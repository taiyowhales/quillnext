 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Paul's travels up and down about Macedonia, Greece, and Asia, and
 his coming at length to Troas, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. A particular account of his spending one Lord's day at Troas, and
 his raising Eutychus to life there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:7-12">ver. 7-12</A>.

 III. His progress, or circuit, for the visiting of the churches he had
 planted, in his way towards Jerusalem, where he designed to be by the
 next feast of pentecost, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.

 IV. The farewell sermon he preached to the presbyters at Ephesus, now
 that he was leaving that country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:17-35">ver. 17-35</A>.

 V. The very sorrowful parting between him and them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:36-38">ver. 36-38</A>.

 And in all these we find Paul very busy to serve Christ, and to do good 
 to the souls of men, not only in the conversion of heathen, but in the 
 edification of Christians.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto <I>him</I> the
 disciples, and embraced <I>them,</I> and departed for to go into
 Macedonia.
 &nbsp; 2 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them
 much exhortation, he came into Greece,
 &nbsp; 3 And <I>there</I> abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait
 for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to
 return through Macedonia.
 &nbsp; 4 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of
 the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe,
 and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
 &nbsp; 5 These going before tarried for us at Troas.
 &nbsp; 6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
 bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode
 seven days.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These travels of Paul which are thus briefly related, if all in them 
 had been recorded that was memorable and worthy to be written in 
 letters of gold, <I>the world would not contain the books that would 
 have been</I> written; and therefore we have only some general hints of 
 occurrences, which therefore ought to be the more precious. Here 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Paul's departure from Ephesus. He had tarried there longer than he 
 had done at any one place since he had been ordained to the apostleship 
 of the Gentiles; and now it was time to think of removing, for he must 
 <I>preach in other cities also;</I> but after this, to the end of the 
 scripture-history of his life (which is all we can depend upon), we 
 never find him breaking up fresh ground again, nor preaching <I>the 
 gospel where Christ had not been named,</I> as hitherto he had done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:20">Rom. xv. 20</A>),

 for in the close of the next chapter we find him made a prisoner, and 
 so continued, and so left, at the end of this book. 

 1. Paul left Ephesus soon after the uproar had ceased, looking upon
 the disturbance he met with there to be an indication of Providence to 
 him not to stay there any longer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 His removal might somewhat appease the rage of his adversaries, and 
 gain better quarter for the Christians there. <I>Currenti cede
 furori--It is good to lie by in a storm.</I> Yet some think that before
 he now left Ephesus he wrote <I>the first epistle to the 
 Corinthians,</I> and that his <I>fighting with beasts at Ephesus,</I> 
 which he mentions in that epistle, was a figurative description of this 
 uproar; but I rather take that literally. 

 2. He did not leave them abruptly and in a fright, but took leave of
 them solemnly: <I>He called unto him the disciples,</I> the principal 
 persons of the congregation, <I>and embraced them, took leave of 
 them</I> (saith the Syriac) <I>with the kiss of love,</I> according to 
 the usage of the primitive church. Loving friends know not how well
 they love one another till they come to part, and then it appears how 
 near they lay to one another's hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His visitation of the Greek churches, which he had planted, and 
 more than once watered, and which appear to have laid very near his 
 heart. 
 
 1. He went first <I>to Macedonia</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 according to his purpose before the uproar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:21"><I>ch.</I> xix. 21</A>);

 there he visited the churches of Philippi and Thessalonica, and <I>gave
 them much exhortation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Paul's visits to his friends were preaching visits, and his preaching 
 was large and copious: <I>He gave them much exhortation;</I> he had a 
 great deal to say to them, and did not stint himself in time; he 
 exhorted them to many duties, in many cases, and (as some read it) 
 <I>with many reasonings.</I> He enforced his exhortation with a great 
 variety of motives and arguments. 

 2. He staid <I>three months in Greece</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>),

 that is, <I>in Achaia,</I> as some think, for thither also he purposed 
 to go, to Corinth, and thereabouts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:21"><I>ch.</I> xix. 21</A>),

 and, no doubt, there also he gave the disciples much exhortation, to
 direct and confirm them, and engage them to cleave to the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The altering of his measures; for we cannot always stand to our 
 purposes. Accidents unforeseen put us upon new counsels, which oblige 
 us to purpose with a proviso. 

 1. <I>Paul was about to sail into Syria, to Antioch,</I> whence he was
 first sent out into the service of the Gentiles, and which therefore in 
 his journeys he generally contrived to take in his way; but he changed 
 his mind, and resolved <I>to return to Macedonia,</I> the same way he 
 came. 

 2. The reason was because the Jews, expecting he would steer that 
 course as usual, had way-laid him, designing to be the death of him; 
 since they could not get him out of the way by stirring up both mobs 
 and magistrates against him, which they had often attempted, they 
 contrived to assassinate him. Some think they <I>laid wait for
 him,</I> to rob him of the money that he was carrying to Jerusalem for 
 the relief of the poor saints there; but, considering how very spiteful 
 the Jews were against him, I suppose they thirsted for his blood more 
 than for his money.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His companions in his travels when he went into Asia; they are here 
 named, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Some of them were ministers, whether they were all so or no is not 
 certain. <I>Sopater of Berea,</I> it is likely, is the same with 
 <I>Sosipater,</I> who is mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:21">Rom. xvi. 21</A>.

 <I>Timothy</I> is reckoned among them, for though Paul, when he
 departed from Ephesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 left Timothy there, and afterwards wrote his first epistle to him
 thither, to direct him as an evangelist how to settle the church there,
 and in what hands to leave it (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:3,3:14,15">1 Tim. i. 3; iii. 14, 15</A>),

 which epistle was intended for direction to Timothy what to do, not 
 only at Ephesus where he now was, but also at other places where he 
 should be in like manner left, or whither he should be sent to reside 
 as an evangelist (and not to him only, but to the other evangelists 
 that attended Paul, and were in like manner employed); yet he soon 
 followed him, and accompanied him, with others here named. Now, one 
 would think, this was no good husbandry, to have all these worthy men 
 accompanying Paul, for there was more need of them where Paul was not 
 than where he was; but so it was ordered, 

 1. That they might assist him in instructing such as by his preaching
 were awakened and startled; wherever Paul came, the waters were 
 stirred, and then there was need of many hands to help the cripples in. 
 It was time to strike when the iron was hot.

 2. That they might be trained up by him, and fitted for future service,
 <I>might fully know his doctrine and manner of life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:10">2 Tim. iii. 10</A>.

 Paul's bodily presence was weak and despicable, and therefore these
 friends of his accompanied him, to put a reputation upon him, to keep 
 him in countenance, and to intimate to strangers, who would be apt to 
 judge by the sight of the eye, that he had a great deal in him truly 
 valuable, which was not discovered upon the outward appearance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His coming to Troas, where he had appointed a general rendezvous of 
 his friends. 
 
 1. They went before, and staid for him at Troas
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 designing to go along with him to Jerusalem, as Trophimus particularly 
 did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:29"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 29</A>.

 We should not think it hard to stay awhile for good company in a
 journey. 

 2. Paul made the best of his way thither; and, it should seem, Luke was
 now in company with him; for he says <I>We sailed from Philippi</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and the first time we find him in his company was here at Troas,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:11"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 11</A>.

 <I>The days of unleavened bread</I> are mentioned only to describe the
 time, not to intimate that Paul kept the passover after the manner of 
 the Jews; for just about this time he had written in his first epistle 
 to the church at Corinth, and taught, that Christs is our Passover, and 
 a Christian life our feast of unleavened bread 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:7,8">1 Cor. v. 7, 8</A>),

 and when the substance was come the shadow was done away. He <I>came to 
 them to Troas,</I> by sea, <I>in five days,</I> and when he was there 
 staid but <I>seven days.</I> There is no remedy, but a great deal of 
 time will unavoidably be lost in travelling to and fro, by those who go 
 about doing good, yet it shall not be put upon the score of lost time. 
 Paul thought it worth while to bestow <I>five days</I> in going to 
 Troas, though it was but for an opportunity of <I>seven days'</I> stay 
 there; but he knew, and so should we, how to redeem even journeying 
 time, and make it turn to some good account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And upon the first <I>day</I> of the week, when the disciples came
 together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart
 on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.
 &nbsp; 8 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they
 were gathered together.
 &nbsp; 9 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
 being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching,
 he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and
 was taken up dead.
 &nbsp; 10 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing <I>him</I>
 said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.
 &nbsp; 11 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread,
 and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he
 departed.
 &nbsp; 12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
 comforted.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of what passed at Troas the last of the seven 
 days that Paul staid there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. There was a solemn religious assembly of the Christians that were 
 there, according to their constant custom, and the custom of all the 
 churches. 
 
 1. <I>The disciples came together,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Though they read, and meditated, and prayed, and sung psalms, apart,
 and thereby kept up their communion with God, yet that was not enough; 
 they must come together to worship God in concert, and so keep up their 
 communion with one another, by mutual countenance and assistance, and 
 testify their spiritual communion with all good Christians. There ought 
 to be stated times for the disciples of Christ to come together; though 
 they cannot all come together in one place, yet as many as can. 

 2. They <I>came together upon the first day of the week,</I> which they 
 called <I>the Lord's day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:10">Rev. i. 10</A>),

 the Christian sabbath, celebrated to the honour of Christ and the Holy 
 Spirit, in remembrance of the resurrection of Christ, and the pouring 
 out of the Spirit, both on the first day of the week. This is here said 
 to be the day when the disciples came together, that is, when it was 
 their practice to come together in all the churches. Note, The first 
 day of the week is to be religiously observed by all the disciples of 
 Christ; and it is a sign between Christ and them, for by this it is 
 known that they are his disciples; and it is to be observed in solemn 
 assemblies, which are, as it were, the courts held in the name of our 
 Lord Jesus, and to his honour, by his ministers, the stewards of his 
 courts, to which all that hold from and under him owe suit and service, 
 and at which they are to make their appearance, as tenants at their 
 Lord's courts, and the first day of the week is appointed to be the 
 court-day.
 
 3. <I>They were gathered together in an upper chamber</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 they had no temple nor synagogue to meet in, no capacious stately
 chapel, but met in a private house, in a garret. As they were few, and 
 did not need, so they were poor, and could not build, a large 
 meeting-place; yet they came together, in that despicable inconvenient 
 place. It will be no excuse for our absenting ourselves from religious 
 assemblies that the place of them is not so decent nor so commodious as 
 we would have it to be. 

 4. They <I>came together to break bread,</I> that is, to celebrate the
 ordinance of the Lord's supper, that one instituted sign of breaking 
 the bread being put for all the rest. <I>The bread which we break is
 the communion of the body of Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:16">1 Cor. x. 16</A>.

 In the breaking of the bread, not only the breaking of Christ's body
 for us, to be a sacrifice for our sins, is commemorated, but the 
 breaking of Christ's body to us, to be food and a feast for our souls, 
 is signified. In the primitive times it was the custom of many churches 
 to receive the Lord's supper every Lord's day, celebrating the memorial 
 of Christ's death in the former, with that of his resurrection in the 
 latter; and both in concert, in a solemn assembly, to testify their 
 joint concurrence in the same faith and worship.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In this assembly Paul gave them a sermon, a long sermon, a farewell 
 sermon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 1. He gave them a sermon: he <I>preached to them.</I> Though they were 
 disciples already, yet it was very necessary they should have the word 
 of God preached to them, in order to their increase in knowledge and 
 grace. Observe, The preaching of the gospel ought to accompany the 
 sacraments. <I>Moses read the book of the covenant in the audience of 
 the people, and then sprinkled the blood of the covenant, which the 
 Lord had made with them concerning all these words,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:7,8">Exod. xxiv. 7, 8</A>.
 
 What does the seal signify without a writing?

 2. It was a farewell sermon, he being <I>ready to depart on the
 morrow.</I> When he was gone, they might have the same gospel preached, 
 but not as he preached it; and therefore they must make the best use of 
 him that they could while they had him. Farewell sermons are usually in 
 a particular manner affecting both to the preacher and to the hearers.

 3. It was a very long sermon: He <I>continued his speech until
 midnight;</I> for he had a great deal to say, and knew not that ever he 
 should have another opportunity of preaching to them. After they had 
 received the Lord's supper, he preached to them the duties they had 
 thereby engaged themselves to, and the comforts they were interested 
 in, and in this he was very large and full and particular. There may be 
 occasion for ministers to preach, not only <I>in season, but out of 
 season.</I> We know some that would have reproached Paul for this as a 
 long-winded preacher, that tired his hearers; but they were willing to 
 hear: he saw them so, and therefore continued his speech. He 
 <I>continued it till midnight;</I> perhaps they met in the evening for 
 privacy, or in conformity to the example of the disciples who came 
 together on the first Christian sabbath in the evening. It is probable 
 he had preached to them in the morning, and yet thus lengthened out his 
 evening sermon even till midnight; we wish we had the heads of this 
 long sermon, but we may suppose it was for substance the same with his 
 epistles. The meeting being continued till midnight, there were candles 
 set up, <I>many lights</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 that the hearers might turn to the scriptures Paul quoted, and see 
 <I>whether these things were so;</I> and that this might prevent the 
 reproach of their enemies, who said they met in the night for works of 
 darkness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. <I>A young man</I> in the congregation, that slept at sermon, was 
 killed by a fall <I>out of the window, but raised to life again;</I> 
 his name signifies <I>one that had good fortune--Eutychus, bene
 fortunatus;</I> and he answered his name. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The infirmity with which he was overtaken. It is probable his 
 parents brought him, though but a boy, to the assembly, out of a desire 
 to have him well instructed in the things of God by such a preacher as 
 Paul. Parents should bring their children to hear sermons as soon as 
 they can hear with understanding 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:2">Neh. viii. 2</A>),

 even <I>the little ones,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:11">Deut. xxix. 11</A>.

 Now this youth was to be blamed, 

 (1.) That he presumptuously <I>sat in the window,</I> unglazed perhaps, 
 and so exposed himself; whereas, if he could have been content to sit 
 on the floor, he had been safe. Boys that love to climb, or otherwise 
 endanger themselves, to the grief of their parents, consider not how 
 much it is also an offence to God. 

 (2.) That he slept, nay, he <I>fell into a deep sleep when Paul was 
 preaching,</I> which was a sign he did not duly attend to the things 
 that Paul spoke of, though they were weighty things. The particular 
 notice taken of his sleeping makes us willing to hope none of the rest 
 slept, though it was sleeping time and after supper; but this youth 
 fell fast asleep, he was <I>carried away with it</I> (so the word is), 
 which intimates that he strove against it, but was overpowered by it, 
 and at last sunk down with sleep.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The calamity with which he was seized herein: <I>He fell down from 
 the third loft, and was taken up dead.</I> Some think that the hand of 
 Satan was in it, by the divine permission, and that he designed it for 
 a disturbance to this assembly and a reproach to Paul and it. Others 
 think that God designed it for a warning to all people to take heed of 
 sleeping when they are hearing the word preached; and certainly we are 
 to make this use of it. We must look upon it as an evil thing, as a bad 
 sign of our low esteem of the word of God, and a great hindrance to our 
 profiting by it. We must be afraid of it, do what we can to prevent our 
 being sleepy, not compose ourselves to sleep, but get our hearts 
 affected with the word we hear to such a degree as may drive sleep far 
 enough. Let us <I>watch and pray, that we enter not into this 
 temptation,</I> and by it into worse. Let the punishment of Eutychus 
 strike an awe upon us, and show us how jealous God is in the matters of 
 his worship; <I>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</I> See how 
 severely God visited an iniquity that seemed little, and but in a 
 youth, and say, <I>Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God?</I> 
 Apply to this story that lamentation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:20,21">Jer. ix. 20, 21</A>),

 <I>Hear the word of the Lord, for death is come up into our windows, to 
 cut off the children from without and the young men from the 
 streets.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The miraculous mercy shown him in his recovery to <I>life again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It gave a present distraction to the assembly, and an interruption to 
 Paul's preaching; but it proved an occasion of that which was a great 
 confirmation to his preaching, and helped to set it home and make it 
 effectual.

 (1.) <I>Paul fell on the dead body, and embraced it,</I> thereby
 expressing a great compassion to, and an affectionate concern for, this 
 young man, so far was he from saying, "He was well enough served for 
 minding so little what I said!" Such tender spirits as Paul had are 
 much affected with sad accidents of this kind, and are far from judging 
 and censuring those that fall under them, as if those on whom <I>the 
 tower of Siloam fell were sinners above all that dwelt at Jerusalem; I 
 tell you, nay.</I> But this was not all; his falling on him and 
 embracing him were in imitation of Elijah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:21">1 Kings xvii. 21</A>),
 
 and Elisha 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:34">2 Kings iv. 34</A>),

 in order to the raising of him to life again; not that this could as a 
 means contribute any thing to it, but as a sign it represented the 
 descent of that divine power upon the dead body, for the putting of 
 life into it again, which at the same time he inwardly, earnestly, and 
 in faith prayed for. 

 (2.) He assured them that he had returned to life, and it would appear 
 presently. Various speculations, we may suppose, this ill accident had 
 occasioned in the congregation, but Paul puts an end to them all: 
 "<I>Trouble not yourselves,</I> be not in any disorder about it, let it 
 not put you into any hurry, <I>for his life is in him;</I> he is not 
 dead, but sleepeth: lay him awhile upon a bed, and he will come to 
 himself, for he is now alive." Thus, when Christ raised Lazarus, he 
 said, <I>Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</I> 

 (3.) He returned to his work immediately after this interruption 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>He came up again</I> to the meeting, they broke bread together in a 
 love-feast, which usually attended the eucharist, in token of their 
 communion with each other, and for the confirmation of friendship among 
 them; and <I>they talked a long while, even till break of day.</I> Paul 
 did not now go on in a continued discourse, as before, but he and his 
 friends fell into a free conversation, the subject of which, no doubt, 
 was good, and to the use of edifying. Christian conference is an 
 excellent means of promoting holiness, comfort, and Christian love.
 They knew not when they should have Paul's company again, and therefore 
 made the best use they could of it when they had it, and reckoned a 
 night's sleep well lost for that purpose. 

 (4.) Before they parted <I>they brought the young man alive</I> into 
 the congregation, every one congratulating him upon his return to life 
 from the dead, and <I>they were not a little comforted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It was matter of great rejoicing among them, not only to the relations 
 of the young man, but to the whole society, as it not only prevented 
 the reproach that would otherwise have been cast upon them, but 
 contributed very much to the credit of the gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there
 intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding
 himself to go afoot.
 &nbsp; 14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came
 to Mitylene.
 &nbsp; 15 And we sailed thence, and came the next <I>day</I> over against
 Chios; and the next <I>day</I> we arrived at Samos, and tarried at
 Trogyllium; and the next <I>day</I> we came to Miletus.
 &nbsp; 16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would
 not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible
 for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul is hastening towards Jerusalem, but strives to do all the good he 
 can by the way, <B><I>os en parodo,</I></B> "as it were by the by." He 
 had called at Troas, and done good there; and now he makes a sort of 
 coasting voyage, the merchants would call it a trading voyage, going 
 from place to place, and no doubt endeavouring to make every place he 
 came to the better for him, as every good man should do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He sent his companions by sea to Assos, but he himself was <I>minded 
 to go afoot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He had decreed or determined within himself that whatever importunity 
 should be used with him to the contrary, urging either his ease or his 
 credit, or the conveniency of a ship that offered itself, or the 
 company of his friends, he would foot it to Assos: and, if the land-way 
 which Paul took was the shorter way, yet it is taken notice of by the 
 ancients as a rough way (Homer, Iliad 6, and Eustathius upon him, say, 
 it was enough to <I>kill one</I> to go <I>on foot</I> to 
 Assos.--<I>Lorin. in locum</I>); yet that way Paul would take,

 1. That he might call on his friends by the way, and do good among
 them, either converting sinners or edifying saints; and in both he was 
 serving his great Master, and carrying on his great work. Or, 

 2. That he might be alone, and might have the greater freedom of
 converse with God and his own heart in solitude. He loved his 
 companions, and delighted in their company, yet he would show hereby 
 that he did not need it, but could enjoy himself alone. Or, 

 3. That he might inure himself to hardship, and not seem to indulge his
 ease. Thus he would by voluntary instances of mortification and 
 self-denial <I>keep under the body, and bring it into subjection,</I> 
 that he might make his sufferings for Christ, when he was called out to 
 them, the more easy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:3">2 Tim. ii. 3</A>.
 
 We should use ourselves to deny ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. At Assos he went on board with his friends. There they <I>took him 
 in;</I> for by this time he had enough of his walk, and was willing to 
 betake himself to the other way of travelling; or perhaps he could not 
 go any further by land, but was obliged to go by water. When Christ 
 sent his disciples away by ship, and tarried behind himself, yet he 
 came to them, and they took him in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:45,51">Mark vi. 45, 51</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He made the best of his way to Jerusalem. His ship passed by 
 <I>Chios</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 touched at <I>Samos</I> (these are places of note among the Greek
 writers, both poets and historians); they tarried awhile at 
 <I>Trogyllium,</I> the sea-port next to Samos; <I>and the next day</I> 
 they came <I>to Miletus,</I> the sea-port that lay next to Ephesus; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 he had determined not to go to Ephesus at this time, because he could 
 not go thither without being urged by his friends whose importunity he 
 could not resist, to make some stay with them there; and, because he 
 was resolved not to stay, he would not put himself into a temptation to 
 stay; <I>for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem 
 on the day of pentecost.</I> He had been at Jerusalem about four or 
 five years ago

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:21,22"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 21, 22</A>),

 and now he was going thither again to pay his continued respects to
 that church, with which he was careful to keep a good correspondence, 
 that he might not be thought alienated from it by his commission to 
 preach among the Gentiles. He aimed to be there by the feast of 
 pentecost because it was a time of concourse, which would give him an 
 opportunity of propagating the gospel among the Jews and proselytes, 
 who came from all parts to worship at the feast: and the feast of 
 pentecost had been particularly made famous among the Christians by the 
 pouring out of the Spirit. Note, Men of business must fit themselves, 
 and it will contribute to the expediting of it, to set time (with 
 submission to Providence) and strive to keep it, contriving to do that 
 first which we judge to be most needful, and not suffering ourselves to 
 be diverted from it. It is a pleasure to us to be with our friends; it 
 diverts us, nothing more; but we must not by it be diverted from our 
 work. When Paul has a call to Jerusalem, he will not loiter away the 
 time in Asia, though he had more and kinder friends there. This is not 
 the world we are to be together in; we hope to be so in the other 
 world.</P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders
 of the church.
 &nbsp; 18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know,
 from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I
 have been with you at all seasons,
 &nbsp; 19 Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many
 tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of
 the Jews:
 &nbsp; 20 <I>And</I> how I kept back nothing that was profitable <I>unto
 you,</I> but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and
 from house to house,
 &nbsp; 21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks,
 repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
 &nbsp; 22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem,
 not knowing the things that shall befal me there:
 &nbsp; 23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying
 that bonds and afflictions abide me.
 &nbsp; 24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life
 dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and
 the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify
 the gospel of the grace of God.
 &nbsp; 25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
 preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
 &nbsp; 26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I <I>am</I> pure
 from the blood of all <I>men.</I>
 &nbsp; 27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel
 of God.
 &nbsp; 28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock,
 over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed
 the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
 &nbsp; 29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous
 wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
 &nbsp; 30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
 things, to draw away disciples after them.
 &nbsp; 31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three
 years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
 &nbsp; 32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of
 his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an
 inheritance among all them which are sanctified.
 &nbsp; 33 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.
 &nbsp; 34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered
 unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
 &nbsp; 35 I have showed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought
 to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus,
 how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It should seem the ship Paul and his companions were embarked in for 
 Jerusalem attended him on purpose, and staid or moved as he pleased; 
 for when he came to Miletus, he went ashore, and tarried thee so long 
 as to send for the elders of Ephesus to come to him thither; for if he 
 had gone up to Ephesus, he could never have got away from them. These 
 elders, or presbyters, some think, were those twelve who received the 
 Holy Ghost by Paul's hands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:6"><I>ch.</I> xix. 6</A>.

 But, besides these, it is probable that Timothy had ordained other
 elders there for the service of that church, and the country about; 
 these Paul sent for, that he might instruct and encourage them to go on 
 in the work to which they had laid their hands. And what instructions 
 he gave to them they would give to the people under their charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is a very pathetic and practical discourse with Paul here takes 
 leave of these elders, and has in it much of the excellent spirit of 
 this good man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He appeals to them concerning both his life and doctrine, all the 
 time he had been in and about Ephesus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>You know after what manner I have been with you,</I> and how I have 
 done the work of an apostle among you." He mentions this as a 
 confirmation of his commission and consequently of the doctrine he had 
 preached among them. They all knew him to be a man of serious,
 gracious, heavenly spirit, that he was no designing self-seeking man, 
 as seducers are; he could not have been carried on with so much 
 evenness and constancy in his services and sufferings, but by the power 
 of divine grace. The temper of his mind, and the tenour both of his 
 preaching and conversation, were such as plainly proved that God was 
 with him of a truth, and that he was actuated and animated by a better 
 spirit than his own.--He likewise makes this reference to his own
 conduct as an instruction to them, in whose hands the work was now 
 left, to follow his example: "<I>You know after what manner I have been 
 with you,</I> how I have conducted myself as a minister; in like manner 
 be you with those that are committed to your charge when I am gone 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:9">Phil. iv. 9</A>),

 <I>what you have seen in me</I> that is good <I>do.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His spirit and conversation were excellent and exemplary; they knew 
 after what manner he had been among them, and how he had had his 
 conversation towards them, in simplicity and godly sincerity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12">2 Cor. i. 12</A>),

 how holily, justly, and unblamably he behaved himself, and how gentle 
 he was towards them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:7,10">1 Thess. ii. 7, 10</A>.

 (1.) He had conducted himself well all along, <I>from the very first 
 day that he came into Asia</I>--at all seasons; the manner of his
 entering in among them was such as nobody could find fault with. He 
 appeared from the first day they knew him to be a man that aimed not 
 only to do well, but to do good, wherever he came. He was a man that 
 was consistent with himself, and all of a piece; take him where you 
 would he was the same at all seasons, he did not turn with the wind nor 
 change with the weather, but was uniform like a die, which, throw it 
 which way you will, lights on a square side. 

 (2.) He had made it his business to serve the Lord, to promote the 
 honour of God and the interest of Christ and his kingdom among them. He 
 never served himself, nor made himself a servant of men, of their lusts 
 and humours, nor was he a time-server; but he made it his business to 
 serve the Lord. In his ministry, in his whole conversation, he proved 
 himself what he wrote himself, Paul <I>a servant of Jesus Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:1">Rom. i. 1</A>.

 (3.) He had done his work <I>with all humility of mind</I>--<B><I>meta
 pases tapeinophrosynes,</I></B> that is, in all works of condescension, 
 modesty, and self-abasement. Though he was one that God had put a great 
 deal of honour upon, and done a great deal of good by, yet he never 
 took state upon him, nor kept people at a distance, but conversed as 
 freely and familiarly with the meanest, for their good, as if he had 
 stood upon a level with them. He was willing to stoop to any service, 
 and to make himself and his labours as cheap as they could desire.
 Note, Those that would in any office serve the Lord acceptably to him, 
 and profitably to others, must do it with all humility of mind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:26,27">Matt. xx. 26, 27</A>.

 (4.) He had always been very tender, affectionate, and compassionate,
 among them; he had <I>served the Lord with many tears.</I> Paul was 
 herein like his Master; often in tears; in his praying, he <I>wept and 
 made supplication,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:5">Hos. xii. 5</A>.

 In his preaching, what he had told them before he told them again,
 <I>even weeping,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:18">Phil. iii. 18</A>.

 In his concern for them, though his acquaintance with them was but of a
 late standing, yet so near did they lie to his heart that he <I>wept 
 with those that wept,</I> and mingled his tears with theirs upon every 
 occasion, which was very endearing.

 (5.) He had struggled with many difficulties among them. He went on in 
 his work in the face of much opposition, <I>many temptations,</I> 
 trials of his patience and courage, such discouragements as perhaps 
 were sometimes <I>temptations</I> to him, as to Jeremiah in a like case 
 to say, <I>I will not speak any more in the name of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:8,9">Jer. xx. 8, 9</A>.

 These befel him <I>by the lying in wait of the Jews,</I> who still were
 plotting some mischief or other against him. Note, Those are the 
 faithful servants of the Lord that continue to serve him in the midst 
 of troubles and perils, that care not what enemies they make, so that 
 they can but approve themselves to their Master, and make him their 
 friend. Paul's tears were owing to his temptations; his afflictions 
 helped to excite his good affections.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His preaching was likewise such as it should be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 He came to Ephesus to preach the gospel of Christ among them, and he 
 had been faithful both to them and to him that appointed him.

 (1.) He was a plain preacher, and one that delivered his message so as 
 to be understood. This is intimated in two words, <I>I have shown you, 
 and have taught you.</I> He did not amuse them with nice speculations, 
 nor lead them into, and then lose them in, the clouds of lofty notions 
 and expressions; but he showed them the plain truths of the gospel, 
 which were of the greatest consequence and importance, and taught them 
 as children are taught. "I have shown you the right way to happiness, 
 and taught you to go in it." 

 (2.) He was a powerful preacher, which is intimated in his 
 <I>testifying</I> to them; he preached as one upon oath, that was 
 himself fully assured of the truth of what he preached and was desirous 
 to convince them of it and to influence and govern them by it. He 
 preached the gospel, not as a hawker proclaims news in the street (it 
 is all one to him whether it be true or false), but as a conscientious 
 witness gives in his evidence at the bar, with the utmost seriousness 
 and concern. Paul preached the gospel as a testimony to them if they 
 received it, but as a testimony against them if they rejected it. 

 (3.) He was a profitable preacher, one that in all his preaching aimed 
 at doing good to those he preached to; he studied that which was 
 <I>profitable unto them,</I> which had a tendency to make them wise and 
 good, wiser and better, to inform their judgments and reform their 
 hearts and lives. He preached <B><I>ta sympheronta,</I></B> such things 
 as <I>brought with them</I> divine light, and heat, and power to their 
 souls. It is not enough not to preach that which is hurtful, which 
 leads into error or hardens in sin, but we must preach that which is 
 profitable. <I>We do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</I> 
 Paul aimed to preach not that which was pleasing, but that which was 
 profitable, and to please only in order to profit. God is said to teach 
 his people to profit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:17">Isa. xlviii. 17</A>.

 Those teach for God that teach people to profit.

 (4.) He was a painstaking preacher, very industrious and indefatigable 
 in his work; he preached <I>publicly, and from house to house.</I> He 
 did not confine himself to a corner when he had opportunity of 
 preaching in the great congregation; nor did he confine himself to the 
 congregation when there was occasion for private and personal 
 instruction. He was neither afraid nor ashamed to preach the gospel 
 publicly, nor did he grudge to bestow his pains privately, among a few, 
 when there was occasion for it. He preached publicly to the flock that 
 came together into the green pastures, and went from house to house to 
 seek those that were weak and had wandered, and did not think that the 
 one would excuse him from the other. Ministers should in their private 
 visits, and as they go from house to house, discourse of those things 
 which they have taught publicly, repeat them, inculcate them, and 
 explain them, if it be needful, asking, <I>Have you understood all 
 these things?</I> And, especially, they should help persons to apply 
 the truth to themselves and their own case. 

 (5.) He was a faithful preacher. He not only preached that which was
 profitable, but he preached every thing that he thought might be 
 profitable, and kept back nothing, though the preaching of it might 
 either cost him more pains or be disobliging to some and expose him to 
 their ill-will. He declined not preaching whatever he thought might be
 profitable, though it was not fashionable, nor to some acceptable. He 
 did not keep back reproofs, when they were necessary and would be 
 profitable, for fear of offending; nor did he keep back the preaching 
 of the cross, though he knew it was to the Jews a stumbling-block and 
 to the Greeks foolishness, as the Roman missionaries in China lately 
 did. 

 (6.) He was a catholic preacher. He <I>testified both to the Jews and 
 also to the Greeks.</I> Though he was born and bred a Jew, and had an 
 entire affection for that nation, and was trained up in their 
 prejudices against the Gentiles, yet he did not therefore confine 
 himself to the Jews and avoid the Gentiles; but preached as readily to 
 them as to the Jews, and conversed as freely with them. And, on the 
 other hand, though he was called to be the apostle of the Gentiles, and 
 the Jews had an implacable enmity against him upon that score, had done 
 him many an ill turn, and here at Ephesus were continually plotting 
 against him, yet he did not therefore abandon them as reprobates, but 
 continued to deal with them for their good. Ministers must preach the
 gospel with impartiality; for they are ministers of Christ for the 
 universal church. 

 (7.) He was a truly Christian evangelical preacher. He did not preach
 philosophical notions, or matters of doubtful disputation, nor did he 
 preach politics, or intermeddle at all with affairs of state or the 
 civil government; but he preached faith and repentance, the two great 
 gospel graces, the nature and necessity of them; these he urged upon 
 all occasions. 

 [1.] <I>Repentance towards God;</I> that those who by sin had gone away 
 from God, and were going further and further from him into a state of 
 endless separation from him, should by true repentance look towards 
 God, turn towards him, move towards him, and hasten to him. He preached 
 repentance as God's great command

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:30"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 30</A>),

 which we must obey--<I>that men should repent, and turn to God, and do
 works meet for repentance</I> (so he explains it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:20"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 20</A>);

 and he preached it as Christ's gift, in order to the <I>remission of
 sins</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:31"><I>ch.</I> v. 31</A>),

 and directed people to look up to him for it. 

 [2.] <I>Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</I> We must be repentance 
 look towards God as our end; and by faith towards Christ as our way to 
 God. Sin must by repentance be abandoned and forsaken, and then Christ 
 must by faith be relied on for the pardon of sin. Our repentance 
 towards God is not sufficient, we must have a true faith in Christ as 
 our Redeemer and Saviour, consenting to him as our Lord and our God. 
 For there is no coming to God, as penitent prodigals to a Father, but 
 in the strength and righteousness of Jesus Christ as Mediator.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Such a preacher as this they all knew Paul had been; and, if they will 
 carry on the same work, they must walk in the same spirit, in the same 
 steps.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He declares his expectation of sufferings and afflictions in his 
 present journey to Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:22-24"><I>v.</I> 22-24</A>.

 Let them not think that he quitted Asia now for fear of persecution; 
 nor, he was so far from running away like a coward from the post of 
 danger that he was now like a hero hastening to the high places of the 
 field, where the battle was likely to be hottest: <I>Now, behold, I go 
 bound in the spirit to Jerusalem,</I> which may be understood either,

 (1.) Of the certain foresight he had of trouble before him. Though he 
 was not yet bound in body, he was bound in spirit; he was in full 
 expectation of trouble, and made it his daily business to prepare for 
 it. He was bound in spirit, as all good Christians are poor in spirit, 
 endeavouring to accommodate themselves to the will of God if they 
 should be reduced to poverty. Or, 

 (2.) Of the strong impulse he was under from the Spirit of God working 
 upon his spirit to go this journey: "<I>I go bound in the spirit,</I> 
 that is, firmly resolved to proceed, and well assured that it is by a 
 divine direction and influence that I am so, and not from any humour or 
 design of my own. I go led by the Spirit, and bound to follow him 
 wherever he leads me."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He does not know particularly the things that shall befal him at 
 Jerusalem. Whence the trouble shall spring, what shall be the occasion 
 of it, what the circumstances and to what degree it shall arise, God 
 had not thought fit to reveal to him. It is good for us to be kept in 
 the dark concerning future events, that we may be always waiting on God 
 and waiting for him. When we go abroad, it should be with this thought, 
 we know not the things that shall befal us, nor what a day, or a night, 
 or an hour, may bring forth; and therefore must refer ourselves to God, 
 let him do with us as seemeth good in his eyes, and study to stand 
 complete in his whole will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Yet he does know in general that thee is a storm before him; for the 
 prophets in every city he passed through told him, by the Holy Ghost, 
 that bonds and afflictions awaited him. Besides the common notice given 
 to all Christians and ministers to expect and prepare for sufferings, 
 Paul had particular intimations of an extraordinary trouble, greater 
 and longer than any he had yet met with, that was now before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He fixes a brave and heroic resolution to go on with his work, 
 notwithstanding. It was a melancholy peal that was rung in his ears in 
 every city, that <I>bonds and afflictions did abide him;</I> it was a 
 hard case for a poor man to labour continually to do good, and to be so 
 ill treated for his pains. Now it is worth while to enquire how he bore 
 it. He was flesh and blood as well as other men; he was so, and yet by 
 the grace of God he was enabled to go on with his work, and to look 
 with a gracious and generous contempt upon all the difficulties and 
 discouragements he met with in it. Let us take it from his own mouth 
 here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 where he speaks not with obstinacy nor ostentation, but with a holy 
 humble resolution: "<I>None of these things move me;</I> all my care is 
 to proceed and to persevere in the way of my duty, and to finish well." 
 Paul is here an example,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Of holy courage and resolution in our work, notwithstanding the 
 difficulties and oppositions we meet with in it; he saw them before 
 him, but he made nothing of them: <I>None of these things move me;</I> 
 <B><I>oudenos logon poioumai</I></B>--<I>I make no account of them.</I>
 He did not lay these things to heart, Christ and heaven lay there. None 
 of these things moved him. 

 [1.] They did not drive him off from his work; he did not tack about, 
 and go back again, when he saw the storm rise, but went on resolutely, 
 preaching there, where he knew how dearly it would cost him. 

 [2.] They did not deprive him of his comfort, nor make him drive on 
 heavily in his work. In the midst of troubles he was as one 
 unconcerned. In his patience he possessed his soul, and, when he was as 
 sorrowful, yet he was always rejoicing, and in all things more than a 
 conqueror. Those that have their conversation in heaven can look down, 
 not only upon the common troubles of this earth but upon the 
 threatening rage and malice of hell itself, and say that none of these 
 things moved them, as knowing that none of these things can hurt 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Of a holy contempt of life, and the continuance and comforts of 
 it: <I>Neither count I my life dear to myself.</I> Life is sweet, and 
 is naturally dear to us. <I>All that a man has will he give for his 
 life;</I> but all that a man has, and life too, will he give who 
 understands himself aright and his own interest, rather than lose the 
 favour of God and hazard eternal life. Paul was of this mind. Though to 
 an eye of nature life is superlatively valuable, yet to an eye of faith 
 it is comparatively despicable; it is not so dear but it can be 
 cheerfully parted with for Christ. This explains 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:26">Luke xiv. 26</A>,

 where we are required to hate our own lives, not in a hasty passion, as
 Job and Jeremiah, but in a holy submission to the will of God, and a 
 resolution to die for Christ rather than to deny him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Of a holy concern to go through with the work of life, which 
 should be much more our care than to secure either the outward comforts 
 of it or the countenance of it. Blessed Paul counts not his life dear 
 in comparison with this, and resolves in the strength of Christ, <I>non 
 propter vitam vivendi perdere causas--that he never will, to save his
 life, lose the ends of living.</I> He is willing to spend his life in 
 labour, to hazard his life in dangerous services, to waste it in 
 toilsome services; nay, to lay down his life in martyrdom, so that he 
 may but answer the great intentions of his birth, of his baptism, and 
 of his ordination to the apostleship. Two things this great and good 
 man is in care about, and if he gain them it is no matter to him what 
 becomes of life:--

 [1.] That he may be found faithful to the trust reposed in him, that he 
 may <I>finish the ministry which he has received of the Lord Jesus,</I> 
 may do the work which he was sent into the world about, or, rather, 
 which he was sent into the church about,--that he may complete the
 service of his generation, may make full proof of his ministry,--that
 he may go through the business of it, and others may reap the advantage 
 of it, to the utmost of what was designed,--that he may, as is said of
 the two witnesses, <I>finish his testimony</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:7">Rev. xi. 7</A>),

 and may not do his work by halves. Observe, <I>First,</I> The 
 apostleship was a ministry both to Christ and to the souls of men; and 
 those that were called to it considered more the ministry of it than 
 the dignity or dominion of it; and, if the apostles did so, much more 
 ought the pastors and teachers to do so, and to be in the church as 
 those who serve. <I>Secondly,</I> This ministry was <I>received from 
 the Lord Jesus.</I> He entrusted them with it, and from him they 
 received their charge; for him they do their work, in his name, in his 
 strength; and to him they must give up their account. It was Christ 
 that put them into the ministry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:12">1 Tim. i. 12</A>);

 it is he that carries them on in their ministry, and from him they have 
 strength to do their service and bear up under the hardships of it. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> The work of this ministry was to <I>testify the gospel 
 of the grace of God,</I> to publish it to the world, to prove it, and 
 to recommend it; and, being the gospel of the grace of God, it has 
 enough in it to recommend itself. It is a proof of God's good-will to 
 us, and a means of his good work in us; it shows him gracious towards 
 us, and tends to make us gracious, and so is the gospel of the grace of 
 God. Paul made it the business of his life to testify this, and desired 
 not to live a day longer than he might be instrumental to spread the 
 knowledge and savour and power of this gospel. 

 [2.] That he may finish well. He cares not when the period of his life 
 comes, nor how, be it ever so soon, ever so sudden, ever so sad, as to 
 outward circumstances, so that he may but <I>finish his course with 
 joy. First,</I> He looks upon his life as <I>a course, a race,</I> so 
 the word is. Our life is <I>a race set before us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:1">Heb. xii. 1</A>.

 This intimates that we have our labours appointed us, for we were not
 sent into the world to be idle; and our limits appointed us, for we 
 were not sent into the world to be here always, but to pass through the 
 world, nay, to run through it, and it is soon run through; I may add, 
 to <I>run the gauntlet</I> through it. <I>Secondly,</I> He counts upon
 the finishing of his course, and speaks of it as sure and near, and 
 that which he had his thoughts continually upon. Dying is the end of 
 our race, when we come off either with honour or shame. <I>Thirdly,</I> 
 He is full of care to finish it well, which implies a holy desire of 
 obtaining and a holy fear of coming short. "Oh! that I may but finish
 my course with joy; and then all will be well, perfectly and eternally 
 well." <I>Fourthly,</I> He thinks nothing too much to do, nor too hard 
 to suffer, so that he may but finish well, finish with joy. We must 
 look upon it as the business of our life to provide for a joyful death, 
 that we may not only die safely, but die comfortably.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Counting upon it that this was the last time they should see him, 
 he appeals to their consciences concerning his integrity, and demands 
 of them a testimony to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He tells them that he was now taking his last leave of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):
 
 <I>I know that you all, among whom I have</I> been conversant 
 <I>preaching the kingdom of God,</I> though you may have letters from 
 me, shall never see my face again. When any of us part with our 
 friends, we may say, and should say, "We know not that ever we shall 
 see one another again: our friends may be removed, or we ourselves 
 may." But Paul here speaks it with assurance, by the Spirit of 
 prophecy, that these Ephesians should <I>see his face no more;</I> and 
 we cannot think that he who spoke so doubtfully of that which he was 
 not sure of (<I>not knowing the things that shall befal me there,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 would speak this with so much confidence, especially when he foresaw 
 what a trouble it would be to his friends here, unless he had had a 
 special warrant from the Spirit to say it, to whom I think those do 
 wrong who suppose that, notwithstanding this, Paul did afterwards come 
 to Ephesus, and see them again. He would never have said thus solemnly, 
 <I>Now, behold, I know it,</I> if he had not known it <I>for 
 certain.</I> Not but that he foresaw that he had a great deal of time 
 and work yet before him, but he foresaw that his work would be cut out 
 for him in other places, and in these parts he had no more to do. Here 
 he had for a great while gone about preaching the kingdom of God, 
 preaching down the kingdom of sin and Satan, and preaching up the 
 authority and dominion of God in Christ, preaching the kingdom of glory 
 as the end and the kingdom of grace as the way. Many a time they had 
 been glad to see his face in the pulpit, and saw it <I>as it had been 
 the face of an angel.</I> If the feet of these messengers of peace were 
 beautiful upon the mountains, what were their faces? But now they shall 
 see his face no more. Note, We ought often to think of it, that those 
 who now are preaching to us the kingdom of God will shortly be removed 
 and we shall see their faces no more: <I>the prophets, do they live for 
 ever?</I> Yet a little while is their light with us; it concerns us 
 therefore to improve it while we have it, that when we shall see their 
 faces no more on earth, yet we may hope to look them in the face with 
 comfort in the great day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He appeals to them concerning the faithful discharge of his ministry 
 among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>Wherefore,</I> seeing my ministry is at an end with you, it 
 concerns both you and me to reflect, and look back;" and, 

 (1.) He challenges them to prove him unfaithful, or to have said or 
 done any thing by which he had made himself accessory to the ruin of 
 any precious soul: <I>I am pure from the blood of all men,</I> the 
 blood of souls. This plainly refers to that of the prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:6">Ezek. xxxiii. 6</A>),
 
 where the blood of him that perishes by the sword of the enemy is said 
 to be required at the hand of the unfaithful watchman that did not give 
 warning: "You cannot say but I have given warning, and therefore no 
 man's blood can be laid at my door." If a minister has approved himself 
 faithful, he may have this rejoicing in himself, <I>I am pure from the 
 blood of all men,</I> and ought to have this testimony from others.
 
 (2.) He therefore leaves the blood of those that perish upon their own 
 heads, because they had fair warning given them, but they would not 
 take it. 

 (3.) He charges these ministers to look to it that they took care and 
 pains, as he had done: "<I>I am pure from the blood of all men,</I> see 
 that you keep yourselves so too. <I>I take you to record this 
 day</I>"--<B><I>en te semeron hemera,</I></B> "I call this day to
 witness to you:" so Streso. As sometimes the heaven and earth are 
 appealed to, so here this day shall be a witness, this parting day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He proves his own fidelity with this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of 
 God.</I> 

 (1.) He had preached to them nothing but the counsel of God, and had 
 not added any inventions of his own; "it was pure gospel, and nothing 
 else, the will of God concerning your salvation." The gospel is the 
 counsel of God; it is admirably contrived by his wisdom, it is 
 unalterably determined by his will, and it is kindly designed by his 
 grace for our glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:7">1 Cor. ii. 7</A>.

 This counsel of God it is the business of ministers to declare as it is 
 revealed, and not otherwise nor any further.

 (2.) He had preached to them the whole counsel of God. As he had
 preached to them the whole counsel of God. As he had preached to them 
 the gospel pure, so he had preached it to them entire; he had gone over 
 a body of divinity among them, that, having the truths of the gospel 
 opened to them methodically from first to last in order, they might the 
 better understand them, by seeing them in their several connections 
 with, and dependences upon, one another. 

 (3.) He had not shunned to do it; had not wilfully nor designedly 
 avoided the declaring of any part of the counsel of God. He had not, to 
 save his own pains, declined preaching upon the most difficult parts of 
 the gospel, nor, to save his own credit, declined preaching upon the 
 most plain and easy parts of it; he had not shunned preaching those 
 doctrines which he knew would be provoking to the watchful enemies of 
 Christianity, or displeasing to the careless professors of it, but 
 faithfully took his work before him, whether they would hear or 
 forbear. And thus it was that he kept himself pure from the blood of 
 all men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He charges them as ministers to be diligent and faithful in their 
 work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He commits the care of the church at Ephesus, that is, the saints, 
 the Christians that were there and thereabouts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:1">Eph. i. 1</A>),

 to them, who, though doubtless they were so numerous that they could 
 not all meet in one place, but worshipped God in several congregations, 
 under the conduct of several ministers, are yet called here <I>one 
 flock,</I> because they not only agreed in one faith, as they did with 
 all Christian churches, but in many instances they kept up communion 
 one with another. To these elders or presbyters the apostle here, upon 
 the actual foresight of his own final leaving them, commits the 
 government of this church, and tells them that not he, but <I>the Holy 
 Ghost, had made them overseers,</I> 
 <B><I>episkopous</I></B>--<I>bishops of the flock.</I> "You that are
 presbyters are bishops of the Holy Ghost's making, that are to take the 
 oversight of this part of the church of God," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:1,2,Tit+1:5,7">1 Pet. v. 1, 2; Tit. i. 5, 7</A>.

 While Paul was present at Ephesus, he presided in all the affairs of
 that church, which made the elders loth to part with him; but now this 
 eagle <I>stirs up the nest, flutters over her young;</I> now that they 
 begin to be fledged they must learn to fly themselves, and to act 
 without him, for the Holy Ghost had made them overseers. They took not 
 this honour to themselves, nor was it conferred upon them by any prince 
 or potentate, but the Holy Ghost in them qualified them for, and 
 enriched them to, this great undertaking, the <I>Holy Ghost fell upon 
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:6"><I>ch.</I> xix. 6</A>.

 The Holy Ghost also directed those that chose, and called, and
 ordained, them to this work in answer to prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He commanded them to mind the work to which they were called. 
 Dignity calls for duty; if the Holy Ghost has made them <I>overseers of 
 the flock,</I> that is, shepherds, they must be true to their trust. 
 
 (1.) They must take heed to themselves in the first place, must have a 
 very jealous eye upon all the motions of their own souls, and upon all 
 they said and did, must walk circumspectly, and know how to behave 
 themselves aright in the house of God, in which they were now advanced 
 to the office of stewards: "You have many eyes upon you, some to take 
 example by you, others to pick quarrels with you, and therefore you 
 ought to <I>take heed to yourselves.</I>" Those are not likely to be 
 skilful or faithful keepers of the vineyards of others that do not keep 
 their own. 

 (2.) "<I>Take heed to the flock,</I> to all the flock, some to one part 
 of it, others to another, according as your call and opportunity are, 
 but see that no part of it be neglected among you." Ministers must not 
 only take heed to their own souls, but must have a constant regard to 
 the souls of those who are under their charge, as shepherds have to 
 their sheep, that they may receive no damage: "<I>Take heed to all the 
 flock,</I> that none of them either of themselves wander from the fold 
 or be seized by the beasts of prey; that none of them be missing, or 
 miscarry, through your neglect." 

 (3.) They must feed the church of God, must do all the parts of the 
 shepherd's office, must lead the sheep of Christ into the green 
 pastures, must lay meat before them, must do what they can to heal 
 those that are distempered and have no appetite to their meat, must 
 feed them with wholesome doctrine, with a tender evangelical 
 discipline, and must see that nothing is wanting that is necessary in 
 order to their being nourished up to eternal life. There is need of 
 pastors, not only to gather the church of God by bringing in of those 
 that are without, but to <I>feed it</I> by building up those that are 
 within. 
 
 (4.) They must watch 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 as shepherds keep watch over their flocks by night, must be awake and 
 watchful, must not give way to spiritual sloth and slumber, but must 
 stir up themselves to their business and closely attend it. <I>Watch 
 thou in all things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:5">2 Tim. iv. 5</A>),

 watch against every thing that will be hurtful to the flock, and watch 
 to every thing that will be advantageous to it; improve every 
 opportunity of doing it a kindness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He gives them several good reasons why they should mind the business 
 of their ministry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Let them consider the interest of their Master, and his concern 
 for the flock that was committed to their charge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 It is <I>the church which he has purchased with his own blood.</I> 

 [1.] "It is his own; you are but his servants to take care of it for 
 him. It is your honour that you are employed for God, who will own you 
 in his service; but then your carelessness and treachery are so much 
 the worse if you neglect your work, for you wrong God and are false to 
 him. From him you received the trust, and to him you must give up your 
 account, and therefore <I>take heed to yourselves.</I> And, if it be 
 the church of God, he expects you should show your love to him by 
 feeding his sheep and lambs." 

 [2.] He has purchased it. The world is God's by right of creation, but 
 the church is his by right of redemption, and therefore it ought to be 
 dear to us, for it was dear to him, because it cost him dear, and we 
 cannot better show it than by feeding his sheep and his lambs. 

 [3.] This church of God is what he has purchased; not as Israel of old, 
 when he <I>gave men for them, and people for their life</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:3">Isa. xliii. 3, 4</A>),

 but <I>with his own blood.</I> This proves that Christ is God, for he 
 is called so here, where yet he is said to purchase the church <I>with 
 his own blood;</I> the blood was his as man, yet so close is the union 
 between the divine and human nature that it is here called the blood of 
 God, for it was the blood of him who is God, and his being so put such 
 dignity and worth into it as made it both a valuable ransom of us from 
 evil, and a valuable purchase for us of all good, nay, a purchase of us 
 to Christ, to be to him a peculiar people: <I>Thine they were, and thou 
 gavest them to me.</I> In consideration of this, therefore, <I>feed the 
 church of God,</I> because it is purchased at so dear a rate. Did 
 Christ lay down his life to purchase it, and shall his ministers be 
 wanting in any care and pains to feed it? Their neglect of its true 
 interest is a contempt of his blood that purchased it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Let them consider the danger that the flock was in of being made a 
 prey to its adversaries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>.

 "If the flock be thus precious upon the account of its relation to God, 
 and its redemption by Christ, then you are concerned to take heed both 
 to yourselves and to it." Here are reasons for both. 

 [1.] <I>Take heed to the flock,</I> for wolves are abroad, that seek to 
 devour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves shall enter in 
 among you. First,</I> Some understand it of persecutors, that will 
 inform against the Christians, and incense the magistrates against 
 them, and will have no compassion on the flock. They thought, because, 
 while Paul was with them, the rage of the Jews was most against him, 
 that, when he had gone out of the country, they would be quiet: "No," 
 says he, "<I>after my departure</I> you will find the persecuting 
 spirit still working, therefore take heed to the flock, confirm them in 
 the faith, comfort and encourage them, that they may not either leave 
 Christ for fear of suffering or lose their peace and comfort in their 
 sufferings." Ministers must take a more ordinary care of the flock in 
 times of persecution. <I>Secondly,</I> It is rather to be understood
 of seducers and false teachers. Probably Paul has an eye to those of 
 the circumcision, who preached up the ceremonial law; these he calls 
 <I>grievous wolves,</I> for though they came in sheep's clothing, nay, 
 in shepherds' clothing, they made mischief in the congregations of 
 Christians, sowed discord among them, drew away many from the pure 
 gospel of Christ, and did all they could to blemish and defame those 
 that adhered to it; not sparing the most valuable members of the flock, 
 stirring up those whom they could influence to bite and devour them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:15">Gal. v. 15</A>);
 
 therefore they are called dogs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:2">Phil. iii. 2</A>),

 as here wolves. While Paul was at Ephesus, they kept away, for they 
 durst not face him; but, when he was gone, then they entered in among 
 them, and sowed their tares where he had sown the good seed.
 "Therefore take heed to the flock, and do all you can to establish them 
 in the truth, and to arm them against the insinuations of the false 
 teachers." 

 [2.] <I>Take heed to yourselves,</I> for some shepherds will apostatise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "<I>Also of your ownselves,</I> among the members, nay, perhaps, among 
 the ministers of your own church, among you that I am now speaking to 
 (though I am willing to hope it does not go so far as that), <I>shall 
 men arise speaking perverse things,</I> things contrary to the right 
 rule of the gospel, and destructive of the great intentions of it. Nay, 
 they will pervert some sayings of the gospel, and wrest them to make 
 them patronize their errors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:16">2 Pet. iii. 16</A>.

 Even those that were well thought of among you, and that you had
 confidence in, will grow proud, and conceited, and opinionative, and 
 will refine upon the gospel, and will pretend with more nice and 
 curious speculations to advance you to a higher form; but it is to 
 <I>draw away disciples after them,</I> to make a party for themselves, 
 that shall admire them, and be led by them, and pin their faith upon 
 their sleeve." Some read it, <I>to draw away disciples after 
 them</I>--those that are already disciples of Christ, draw them from
 him to follow them. "Therefore, take heed to yourselves; when you are 
 told that some of you shall betray the gospel, you are each of you 
 concerned to ask, <I>Is it I?</I> and to look well to yourselves." This 
 was there fulfilled in <I>Phygellus and Hermogenes,</I> who turned away 
 from Paul and the doctrine he had preached

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:15">2 Tim. i. 15</A>),

 and in <I>Hymeneus and Philetus,</I> who <I>concerning the truth erred, 
 and overthrew the faith of some</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:18">2 Tim. ii. 18</A>),

 which explains the expression here. But, though there were some such
 seducers in the church of Ephesus, yet it should seem by Paul's Epistle 
 to that church (wherein we do not find such complaints and 
 reprehensions as we meet with in some other of his epistles) that that 
 church was not so much infested with false teachers, at least not so 
 much infected with their false doctrine, as some other churches were; 
 but its peace and purity were preserved by the blessing of God on the 
 pains and vigilance of these presbyters, to whom the apostle, in the 
 actual foresight and consideration of the rise of heresies and schisms, 
 as well as of his own death, committed the government of this 
 church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Let them consider the great pains that Paul had taken in planting 
 this church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "<I>Remember that for the space of three years</I>" (for so long he had
 been preaching in Ephesus, and the parts adjacent) "<I>I ceased not to 
 warn every one night and day with tears;</I> and be not you negligent 
 in building upon that foundation which I was so diligent to lay." 

 [1.] Paul, like a faithful watchman, had warned them, and, by the 
 warnings he gave men of the danger of their continuing in their Judaism 
 and heathenism, he prevailed with them to embrace Christianity. 

 [2.] He warned every one; besides the public warnings he gave in his 
 preaching, he applied himself to particular persons according as he saw 
 their case called for it, which he had something to say peculiar to. 
 
 [3.] He was constant in giving warning; he <I>warned night and day;</I> 
 his time was filled up with his work. In the night, when he should have 
 been reposing himself, he was dealing with those he could not get to 
 speak with in the day about their souls. 

 [4.] He was indefatigable in it; he <I>ceased not</I> to warn. Though 
 they were ever so obstinate against his warnings, yet he did not cease 
 to warn, not knowing but that at length they might, by the grace of 
 God, be overcome; though they were ever so pliable to his warnings, yet 
 he did not think this would be a sufficient excuse for him to desist, 
 but still he warned those that were righteous as not to turn from their 
 righteousness, as he had warned them when they were wicked to turn from 
 their wickedness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:18-21">Ezek. iii. 18-21</A>.

 [5.] He spoke to them about their souls with a great deal of affection 
 and concern: he <I>warned them with tears.</I> As he had served the 
 Lord, so he had served them, <I>with many tears,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He warned them with tears of compassion, thereby showing how much he
 was himself affected with their misery and danger in a sinful state and 
 way, that he might affect them with it. Thus Paul had begun the good 
 work at Ephesus, thus free had he been of his pains; and why then 
 should they be sparing of their pains in carrying it on?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He recommends them to divine direction and influence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):
 
 "<I>And now, brethren,</I> having given you this solemn charge and 
 caution, <I>I commend you to God.</I> Now that I have said what I have 
 to say, The Lord be with you; I must leave you, but I leave you in good 
 hands." They were in care what would become of them, how they should go 
 on in their work, break through their difficulties, and what provision 
 would be made for them and their families. In answer to all these 
 perplexities, Paul directs them to look up to God with an eye of faith, 
 and beseeches God to look down on them with an eye of favour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See here to whom he commends them. He calls them brethren, not only 
 as Christians, but as ministers, and thereby encourages them to hope in 
 God, as he had done; for they and he were brethren. 

 (1.) He commends them to God, begs of God to provide for them, to take 
 care of them, and to supply all their needs, and encourages them to 
 cast all their care upon him, with an assurance that he cared for them: 
 "Whatever you want, go to God, let your eye be ever towards him, and 
 your dependence upon him, in all your straits and difficulties; and let 
 this be your comfort, that you have a God to go to, a God all 
 sufficient." <I>I commend you to God,</I> that is, to his providence, 
 and to the protection and care of that. It is enough that, from 
 whomsoever we are separated, still we have God nigh unto us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:19">1 Pet. iv. 19</A>.

 (2.) He commends them <I>to the word of his grace,</I> by which some
 understand Christ: he is <I>the word</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1">John i. 1</A>),

 <I>the word of life,</I> because life is treasured up for us in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1">1 John i. 1</A>),

 and in the same sense he is here called <I>the word of God's grace,</I> 
 because <I>from his fulness we receive grace for grace.</I> He commends 
 them to Christ, puts them into his hand, as being his servants, whom he 
 would in a particular manner take care of. Paul commends them not only 
 to God and to his providence, but to Christ and his grace as Christ 
 himself did his disciples when he was leaving them: <I>You believe in 
 God, believe also in me.</I> It comes to much the same thing, if by the 
 word of his grace we understand the gospel of Christ, for it is Christ 
 in the word that is nigh unto us for our support and encouragement, and 
 his word is spirit and life: "You will find much relief by acting faith 
 on the providence of God, but much more by acting faith on the promises 
 of the gospel." He commends them to the word of Christ's grace, which 
 he spoke to his disciples when he sent them forth, the commission he 
 gave them, with assurance that he would be with them <I>always to the 
 end of the world:</I> "Take hold of that word, and God give you the 
 benefit and comfort of it, and you need no more." He commends them to 
 the word of God's grace, not only as the foundation of their hope and 
 the fountain of their joy, but as the rule of their walking: "<I>I 
 commend you to God,</I> as your Master, whom you are to serve, and I 
 have found him a good Master, <I>and to the word of his grace,</I> as 
 cutting you out your work, and by which you are to govern yourselves; 
 observe the precepts of this word, and then live upon the promises of 
 it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See here what he commends them to the word of God's grace for, not 
 so much for a protection from their enemies, or a provision for their 
 families, as for the spiritual blessings which they most needed and 
 ought most to value. They had received the gospel of the grace of God, 
 and were entrusted to preach it. Now he recommends them to that, 

 (1.) For their edification: "<I>It is able</I> (the Spirit of grace
 working with it and by it) <I>to build you up,</I> and you may depend 
 upon this, while you keep close to it, and are deriving daily from it.
 Though you are already furnished with good gifts, yet this is able to 
 build you up; there is that in it with which you need to be better 
 acquainted and more affected." Note, Ministers, in preaching the word 
 of grace, must aim at their own edification as well as at the 
 edification of others. The most advanced Christians, while they are in 
 this world, are capable of growing, and they will find the word of 
 grace to have still more and more in it to contribute to their growth.
 It is still able to build them up. 

 (2.) For their glorification: <I>It is able to give you an inheritance 
 among all those who are sanctified.</I> The word of God's grace gives 
 it, not only as it gives the knowledge of it (for <I>life and 
 immortality are brought to light by the gospel</I>), but as it gives 
 the promise of it, the promise of a God <I>that cannot lie,</I> and 
 which is <I>yea and amen in Christ;</I> and by the word, as the 
 ordinary vehicle, the Spirit of grace is given

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:44"><I>ch.</I> x. 44</A>),

 to be the seal of the promise, and the earnest of the eternal life
 promised; and thus it is the word of God's grace that gives us the 
 inheritance. Note, 

 [1.] Heaven is an inheritance which gives an indefeasible right to all 
 the heirs; it is an inheritance like that of the Israelites in Canaan, 
 which was by promise and yet by lot, but was <I>sure to all the 
 seed.</I> 

 [2.] This inheritance is entailed upon and secured to all those, and 
 those only, that are sanctified; for as those cannot be welcome guests 
 to the holy God, or the holy society above, that are unsanctified, so 
 really heaven would be no heaven to them; but <I>to all that are 
 sanctified,</I> that are born again, and on whom the image of God is 
 renewed, it is as sure as almighty power and eternal truth can make it. 
 Those therefore that would make out a title to that inheritance must 
 make it sure that they are among the sanctified, are joined to them and 
 incorporated with them, and partake of the same image and nature; for 
 we cannot expect to be among the glorified hereafter unless we be among 
 the sanctified here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He recommends himself to them as an example of indifference to this 
 world, and to every thing in it, which, if they would walk in the same 
 spirit and in the same steps, they would find to contribute greatly to 
 their easy and comfortable passage through it. He had recommended them 
 to God, and to the word of his grace, for spiritual blessings, which, 
 without doubt, are the best blessings; but what shall they do for food 
 for their families, an agreeable subsistence for themselves, and 
 portions for their children? "As to these," Paul says, "do as I did;" 
 and how was that? He here tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he never aimed at worldly wealth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 "<I>I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel;</I> nor do 
 you, and then you will be easy." There were many in Ephesus, and many 
 of those that had embraced the Christian faith, who were rich, had a 
 great deal of money, and plate, and rich furniture, and wore very good 
 clothes, and made a very good appearance. Now, 

 (1.) Paul was not ambitious to live like them. We may take it in this 
 sense: "<I>I never coveted to have so much silver and gold at 
 command</I> as I see others have, nor to wear such rich clothes as I 
 see others wear. I neither condemn them nor envy them. I can live 
 comfortably and usefully without living great." The false apostles 
 desired <I>to make a fair show in the flesh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:12">Gal. vi. 12</A>),

 to make a figure in the world; but Paul did not do so. <I>He knew how 
 to want and how to be abased.</I> 

 (2.) He was not greedy to receive from them, silver, or gold, or 
 apparel; so far from being always craving that he was not so much as 
 coveting, nor desired them to allow him so and so for his pains among 
 them, but was <I>content with such things as he had;</I> he never 
 <I>made a gain of them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:17">2 Cor. xii. 17</A>.

 He could not only say with Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:15">Num. xvi. 15</A>),
 
 and with Samuel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:3,5">1 Sam. xii. 3, 5</A>),

 <I>Whose ox have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded?</I> But, "Whose 
 kindness have I coveted, or asked? Or to whom have I been burdensome?" 
 He protests against desiring a gift, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:17">Phil. iv. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he had worked for his living, and taken a great deal of pains 
 to get bread 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>)

 "<I>Yea, you yourselves know,</I> and have been eye-witnesses of it, 
 <I>that these hands of mine have ministered to my necessities, and to 
 those that were with me;</I> you have seen me busy early and late, 
 cutting out tents and making them up;" and, they being commonly made of 
 leather, it was very hard work. Observe, 

 (1.) Paul was sometimes reduced to necessities, and the want of the 
 common supports of life, though he was so great a favourite of Heaven 
 and so great a blessing to this earth. What an unthinking, unkind, and 
 ungrateful world is this, that could let such a man as Paul be poor in 
 it! 

 (2.) He desired no more than to have his necessities supplied; he did 
 not work at his calling to enrich himself, but to maintain himself with 
 food and raiment. 

 (3.) When he was to earn his bread, he did it by a manual occupation. 
 Paul had a head and a tongue that he might have got money by, but they 
 were these hands, saith he, <I>that ministered to my necessities.</I> 
 What a pity was it that those hands by the laying on of which the Holy 
 Ghost had been so often conferred, those hands by which God had wrought 
 special miracles, and both these at Ephesus too

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:6,11"><I>ch.</I> xix. 6, 11</A>),

 should there be obliged to lay themselves to the needle and shears, the
 awl and tacking-end, in tent-making, purely to get bread! Paul puts
 these presbyters (and others in them) in mind of this, that they may
 not think it strange if they be thus neglected, and yet to go on in
 their work, and make the best shift they can to live; the less
 encouragement they have from men, the more they shall have from God.
 
 (4.) He worked not only for himself, but for the support of those also
 that were with him. This was hard indeed. It had better become them to 
 have worked for him (to maintain him as their tutor) than he for them. 
 But so it is; those that are willing to take the labouring oar will 
 find those about them willing they should have it. If Paul will work 
 for the maintenance of his companions, he is welcome to do it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>36 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the parting sermon that Paul preached to the elders of Ephesus, 
 which was very affecting, we have here the parting prayer and tears, 
 which were yet more affecting; we can scarcely read the account here 
 given of them, and meditate upon them with dry eyes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They parted with prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>And, when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them 
 all.</I> And, no doubt, it was a prayer every way suited to the present 
 mournful occasion. He committed them to God in this prayer, prayed that 
 he would not leave them, but continue his presence with them. 

 1. It was a joint prayer. He not only prayed for them, but prayed with
 them, <I>prayed with them all;</I> that they might put up the same 
 petitions for themselves and one another that he put up to God for them 
 all, and that they might learn what to ask of God for themselves when 
 he was gone. Public prayers are so far from being intended to supersede 
 our own secret prayers, and make them needless, that they are designed 
 to quicken and encourage them, and to direct us in them. When we are 
 alone we should pray over the prayers that our ministers have put up 
 with us.

 2. It was a humble reverent prayer. This was expressed by the posture
 they used: <I>He kneeled down, and prayed with them,</I> which is the
 most proper gesture in prayer, and significant both of adoration and of
 petition, especially petition for the forgiveness of sin. Paul used it
 much: <I>I bow my knees,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:14">Eph. iii. 14</A>.

 3. It was a prayer after sermon; and, we may suppose, he prayed over
 what he had preached. He had committed the care of the church at
 Ephesus to those elders, and now he prays that God would enable them 
 faithfully to discharge this great trust reposed in them, and would 
 give them those measures of wisdom and grace which it required; he 
 prayed for the flock, and all that belonged to it, <I>that the great 
 Shepherd of the sheep</I> would take care of them all, and keep them 
 from being a prey to the grievous wolves. Thus he taught these 
 ministers to pray for those they preached to, <I>that they might not 
 labour in vain.</I> 

 4. It was a parting prayer, which might be likely to leave lasting
 impressions, as the farewell sermon did. It is good for friends, when 
 they part, to part with prayer, that by praying together just at 
 parting they may be enabled to pray the more feelingly one for another 
 when they are separated, which is one part of our Christian duty, and 
 an improvement of the communion of saints. The Lord watch between us, 
 and watch over us both, when we are absent one from the other, is a 
 good parting prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:49">Gen. xxxi. 49</A>),

 as also that our next meeting may be either nearer heaven or in heaven. 
 Paul here followed the example of Christ, who, when he took leave of 
 his disciples, after he had preached to them, prayed with them all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1">John xvii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They parted with tears, abundance of tears, and most affectionate 
 embraces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>.

 1. <I>They all wept sorely.</I> We have reason to think the Paul 
 himself began; though he was determined to go, and saw his call clear 
 to other work, yet he was sorry in his heart to leave them, and many a 
 tear it cost him. He that was so often in tears while he was with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:19,31"><I>v.</I> 19, 31</A>),

 no doubt shed many at parting, so watering what he had sown among them. 
 But the notice is taken of their tears: <I>They all wept sorely;</I> 
 there was not a dry eye among them, and it is probable the affectionate 
 expressions Paul used in prayer set them a-weeping. These were tears of 
 love and mutual endearment, like those of Jonathan and David, when they 
 were forced to part, and <I>wept one with another, until</I> (as if
 they wept for strife) <I>David exceeded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:41">1 Sam. xx. 41</A>.

 2. <I>They fell upon Paul's neck, and kissed him,</I> all, one after
 another, each bewailing his own loss: "How can I part with this
 invaluable man, this blessed Paul," says one, "in whom my life is a
 manner bound up?"--"Farewell, my dear friend," says another, "a
 thousand thanks to thee, and ten thousand to God for thee, and for all 
 the pains thou hast taken with me for my good." "And must we part?" 
 says another: "must I lose my spiritual father, nurse, and 
 guide?"--"What will become of us now?" says another, "when we shall no
 more have him to apply to, and receive direction from? What shall I do, 
 if the Lord take away my master from my head? <I>My father, my father, 
 the chariots of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.</I>" Note, Those that 
 are most loving are commonly best beloved. Paul, who was a most 
 affectionate friend himself, had friends that were very affectionate to 
 him. These tears at parting with Paul were a grateful return for all 
 the tears he had shed in preaching to them and praying with them. <I>He 
 that watereth shall be watered also himself.</I> 

 3. That which cut them to the heart thus, and made this place such a
 <I>Bochim, such a place of weepers,</I> was, <I>that word which Paul 
 spoke, that</I> he was certain <I>they should see his face no more.</I> 
 If he had given them directions to follow him, as he did to those that 
 were his usual companions, or any intimation that he would come 
 hereafter and make them a visit, they could have borne this parting 
 pretty well; but when they are told that they shall see his face no 
 more in this world, that it is a final farewell they are now giving and 
 taking, this makes it a great mourning; it makes farewell just like a 
 funeral, and puts them into this passion of weeping. There were other 
 things for which they sorrowed--that they should lose the benefit of his
 public performances, and see him no longer presiding in their 
 assemblies, should have none of his personal counsels and comforts; 
 and, we hope, they sorrowed for their own sin, in not profiting more by 
 his labours while they had him among them, and which had provoked God 
 to order his remove. But that which gave the most sensible accent to 
 their grief was <I>that they should see his face no more.</I> When our 
 friends are separated from us by death, this is the consideration with 
 which we raise up our mourning, that we shall see their faces no more; 
 but we complain of this as those that have no hope, for if our friends 
 died in Christ, and we live to him, they are gone to see God's face, to 
 behold his glory, with the reflection of which their faces shine, and 
 we hope to be with them shortly. Though we shall see their faces no 
 more in this world, we hope to see them again in a better world, and to 
 be there together for ever and with the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They <I>accompanied him unto the ship,</I> partly to show their 
 respect for him (they would bring him on his way as far as they could), 
 and partly that they might have a little more of his company and 
 conversation; if it must be the last interview, they will have as much 
 of him as they can, and see the last of him. And we have reason to 
 think that when they came to the water-side, and he was about to go on 
 board, their tears and embraces were repeated; for loth to part bids 
 oft farewell. But this was a comfort to both sides, and soon turned 
 this tide of passion, that the presence of Christ both went with him 
 and staid with them.</P>
