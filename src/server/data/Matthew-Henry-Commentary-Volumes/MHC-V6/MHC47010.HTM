 There was no place in which the apostle Paul met with more opposition
 from false apostles than at Corinth; he had many enemies there. Let not
 any of the ministers of Christ think it strange if they meet with
 perils, not only from enemies, but from false brethren; for blessed
 Paul himself did so. Though he was so blameless and inoffensive in all
 his carriage, so condescending and useful to all, yet there were those
 who bore him ill-will, who envied him, and did all they could to
 undermine him, and lesson his interest and reputation. Therefore he
 vindicates himself from their imputation, and arms the Corinthians
 against their insinuations. In this chapter the apostle, in a mild and
 humble manner, asserts the power of his preaching, and to punish
 offenders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 He then proceeds to reason the case with the Corinthians, asserting his
 relation to Christ, and his authority as an apostle of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:7-11">ver. 7-11</A>),

 and refuses to justify himself, or to act by such rules as the false
 teachers did, but according to the better rules he had fixed for
 himself,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness
 of Christ, who in presence <I>am</I> base among you, but being absent
 am bold toward you:
 &nbsp; 2  But I beseech <I>you,</I> that I may not be bold when I am present
 with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some,
 which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
 &nbsp; 3  For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the
 flesh:
 &nbsp; 4  (For the weapons of our warfare <I>are</I> not carnal, but mighty
 through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
 &nbsp; 5  Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth
 itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity
 every thought to the obedience of Christ;
 &nbsp; 6  And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when
 your obedience is fulfilled.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The mild and humble manner in which the blessed apostle addresses
 the Corinthians, and how desirous he is that no occasion may be given
 him to use severity. 

 1. He addresses them in a very mild and humble manner: <I>I Paul myself 
 beseech you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 We find, in the introduction to this epistle, he joined Timothy with 
 himself; but now he speaks only for himself, against whom the false 
 apostles had particularly levelled their reproaches; yet in the midst 
 of the greatest provocations he shows humility and mildness, from the 
 consideration of the <I>meekness and gentleness of Christ,</I> and 
 desires this great example may have the same influence on the 
 Corinthians. Note, When we find ourselves tempted or inclined to be 
 rough and severe towards any body, we should think of the meekness and 
 gentleness of Christ, that appeared in him in the days of his flesh, in 
 the design of his undertaking, and in all the acts of his grace towards 
 poor souls. How humbly also does this great apostle speak of himself, 
 as <I>one in presence base among them!</I> So his enemies spoke of him 
 with contempt, and he seems to acknowledge it; while others thought 
 meanly, and spoke scornfully of him, he had low thoughts of himself, 
 and spoke humbly of himself. Note, We should be sensible of our own 
 infirmities, and think humbly of ourselves, even when men reproach us 
 for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is desirous that no occasion may be given to use severity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 <I>He beseeches them</I> to give no occasion for him to be bold, or to 
 exercise his authority against them in general, as he had resolved to 
 do against some who unjustly charged him as <I>walking according to the 
 flesh,</I> that is, regulating his conduct, even in his ministerial 
 actions, according to carnal policy or with worldly views. This was 
 what the apostle had renounced, and this is contrary to the spirit and 
 design of the gospel, and was far from being the aim and design of the 
 apostle.  Hereupon,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He asserts the power of his preaching and his power to punish 
 offenders.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The power of his preaching, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:3,5"><I>v.</I> 3, 5</A>.
 
 Here observe,

 (1.) The work of the ministry is a warfare, not <I>after the flesh</I> 
 indeed, for it is a spiritual warfare, with spiritual enemies and for 
 spiritual purposes.  And though ministers walk in the flesh, or live in 
 the body, and in the common affairs of life act as other men, yet in 
 their work and warfare they must not go by the maxims of the flesh, nor 
 should they design to please the flesh: this must be crucified with its 
 affections and lusts; it must be mortified and kept under. 

 (2.) The doctrines of the gospel and discipline of the church are the 
 weapons of this warfare; and these are not carnal: outward force, 
 therefore, is not the method of the gospel, but strong persuasions, by 
 the power of truth and the meekness of wisdom. A good argument this is 
 against persecution for conscience' sake: conscience is accountable to 
 God only; and people must be persuaded to God and their duty, not 
 driven by force of arms. And so the weapons of our warfare are mighty, 
 or very powerful; the evidence of truth is convincing and cogent. This 
 indeed is through God, or owing to him, because they are his 
 institutions, and accompanied with his blessing, which makes all 
 opposition to fall before his victorious gospel.  We may here observe, 
 
 [1.] What opposition is made against the gospel by the powers of sin 
 and Satan in the hearts of men. Ignorance, prejudices, beloved lusts, 
 are Satan's strong-holds in the souls of some; vain imaginations, 
 carnal reasonings, and high thoughts, or proud conceits, in others, 
 <I>exalt themselves against the knowledge of God,</I> that is, by these 
 ways the devil endeavours to keep men from faith and obedience to the 
 gospel, and secures his possession of the hearts of men, as his own 
 house or property. But then observe, 

 [2.] The conquest which the word of God gains. These strong-holds are 
 pulled down by the gospel as the means, through the grace and power of 
 God accompanying it as the principal efficient cause. Note, The 
 conversion of the soul is the conquest of Satan in that soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The apostle's power to punish offenders (and that in an 
 extraordinary manner) is asserted in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The apostle was a prime-minister in the kingdom of Christ, and chief 
 officer in his army, and <I>had in readiness</I> (that is, he had power 
 and authority at hand) <I>to revenge all disobedience,</I> or to punish 
 offenders in a most exemplary and extraordinary manner. The apostle 
 speaks not of personal revenge, but of punishing disobedience to the 
 gospel, and disorderly walking among church-members, by inflicting 
 church-censures.  Note, Though the apostle showed meekness and 
 gentleness, yet he would not betray his authority; and therefore 
 intimates that when he would commend those whose obedience was 
 fulfilled or manifested others would fall under severe censures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man
 trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think
 this again, that, as he <I>is</I> Christ's, even so <I>are</I> we Christ's.
 &nbsp; 8  For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority,
 which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your
 destruction, I should not be ashamed:
 &nbsp; 9  That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
 &nbsp; 10  For <I>his</I> letters, say they, <I>are</I> weighty and powerful; but
 <I>his</I> bodily presence <I>is</I> weak, and <I>his</I> speech contemptible.
 &nbsp; 11  Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by
 letters when we are absent, such <I>will we be</I> also in deed when
 we are present.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle proceeds to reason the case with the 
 Corinthians, in opposition to those who despised him, judged him, and 
 spoke hardly of him: "<I>Do you,</I>" says he, "<I>look on things after 
 the outward appearance?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Is this a fit measure or rule to make an estimate of things or persons 
 by, and to judge between me and my adversaries?" In outward appearance, 
 Paul was mean and despicable with some; he did not make a figure, as 
 perhaps some of his competitors might do: but this was a false rule to 
 make a judgment by. It should seem that some boasted mighty things of 
 themselves, and made a fair show. But there are often false 
 appearances. A man may seem to be learned who has not learned Christ, 
 and appear virtuous when he has not a principle of grace in his heart. 
 However, the apostle asserts two things of himself:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His relation to Christ: <I>If any man trust to himself that he is 
 Christ's, even so are we Christ's,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It would seem by this that Paul's adversaries boasted of their relation 
 to Christ as his ministers and servants. Now the apostle reasons thus 
 with the Corinthians: "Suppose it to be so, allowing what they say to 
 be true (and let us observe that, in fair arguing, we should allow all 
 that may be reasonably granted, and should not think it impossible but 
 those who differ from us very much may yet belong to Christ, as well as 
 we), allowing them," might the apostle say, "what they boast of, yet 
 they ought also to allow this to us, that <I>we also are Christ's.</I>" 
 Note, 

 1. We must not, by the most charitable allowances we make to others who
 differ from us, cut ourselves off from Christ, nor deny our relation to 
 him. For, 

 2. There is room in Christ for many; and those who differ much from one
 another may yet be one in him. It would help to heal the differences 
 that are among us if we would remember that, how confident soever we 
 may be that we belong to Christ, yet, at the same time, we must allow 
 that those who differ from us may belong to Christ too, and therefore 
 should be treated accordingly. We must not think that we are the 
 people, and that none belong to Christ but ourselves. This we may plead 
 for ourselves, against those who judge us and despise us that, how weak 
 soever we are, yet, as they are Christ's, so are we: we profess the 
 same faith, we walk by the same rule, we build upon the same 
 foundation, and hope for the same inheritance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His authority from Christ as an apostle. This he had mentioned 
 before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and now he tells them that he might speak of it again, and that with 
 some sort of boasting, seeing it was a truth, that the <I>Lord had 
 given it to him,</I> and it was more than his adversaries could justly 
 pretend to. It was certainly what he should not be ashamed of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Concerning this observe, 

 1. The nature of his authority: it was for <I>edification, and not for
 destruction.</I> This indeed is the end of all authority, civil and 
 ecclesiastical, and was the end of that extraordinary authority which 
 the apostles had, and of all church-discipline. 

 2. The caution with which he speaks of his authority, professing that
 his design was not to terrify them with big words, nor by angry 
 letters,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Thus he seems to obviate an objection that might have been formed 
 against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 But the apostle declares he did not intend to frighten those who were 
 obedient, nor did he write any thing in his letters that he was not 
 able to make good by deeds against the disobedient; and he would have 
 his adversaries <I>know this</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 that he would, by the exercise of his apostolical power committed to 
 him, make it appear to have a real efficacy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare
 ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring
 themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among
 themselves, are not wise.
 &nbsp; 13  But we will not boast of things without <I>our</I> measure, but
 according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed
 to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
 &nbsp; 14  For we stretch not ourselves beyond <I>our measure,</I> as though
 we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in
 <I>preaching</I> the gospel of Christ:
 &nbsp; 15  Not boasting of things without <I>our</I> measure, <I>that is,</I> of
 other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is
 increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule
 abundantly,
 &nbsp; 16  To preach the gospel in the <I>regions</I> beyond you, <I>and</I> not
 to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.
 &nbsp; 17  But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
 &nbsp; 18  For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
 Lord commendeth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle refuses to justify himself, or to act by such rules as 
 the false apostles did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He plainly intimates that they took a wrong method to commend 
 themselves, in <I>measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing 
 themselves among themselves,</I> which was <I>not wise.</I> They were 
 pleased, and did pride themselves, in their own attainments, and never 
 considered those who far exceeded them in gifts and graces, in power 
 and authority; and this made them haughty and insolent. Note, If we 
 would compare ourselves with others who excel us, this would be a good 
 method to keep us humble; we should be pleased and thankful for what we 
 have of gifts or graces, but never pride ourselves therein, as if there 
 were none to be compared with us or that did excel us. The apostle 
 would not be of the number of such vain men: let us resolve that we 
 will not make ourselves of that number.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He fixes a better rule for his conduct, namely, <I>not to boast of 
 things without his measure,</I> which was the measure <I>God had 
 distributed</I> to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 His meaning is, either that he would not boast of more gifts or graces, 
 or power and authority, than God had really bestowed on him; or, 
 rather, that he would not act beyond his commission as to persons or 
 things, nor go beyond the line prescribed to him, which he plainly 
 intimates the false apostles did, while they <I>boasted of other men's 
 labors.</I> The apostle's resolution was to keep within his own 
 province, and that compass of ground which God had marked out for him. 
 His commission as an apostle was to preach the gospel every where, 
 especially among the Gentiles, and he was not confined to one place; 
 yet he observed the directions of Providence, and the Holy Spirit, as 
 to the particular places whither he went or where he did abide.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He acted according to this rule: <I>We stretch not ourselves 
 beyond our measure,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 And, particularly, he acted according to this rule in preaching at 
 Corinth, and in the exercise of his apostolical authority there; for he 
 came thither by divine direction, and there he converted many to 
 Christianity; and, therefore, in boasting of them as his charge, he 
 acted not contrary to his rule, he boasted not of <I>other men's 
 labours,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:15"><I>v.</I>  15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He declares his success in observing this rule. His hope was that 
 their faith was increased, and that others beyond them, even in the
 remoter parts of Achaia, would embrace the gospel also; and in all this 
 he exceeded not his commission, nor acted in another man's line.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He seems to check himself in this matter, as if he had spoken too 
 much in his own praise. The unjust accusations and reflections of his 
 enemies had made it needful he should justify himself; and the wrong 
 methods they took gave him good occasion to mention the better rule he 
 had observed: yet he is afraid of boasting, or taking any praise to 
 himself, and therefore he mentions two things which ought to be 
 regarded:--

 1. <I>He that glorieth should glory in the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 If we are able to fix good rules for our conduct, or act by them, or 
 have any good success in so doing, the praise and glory of all are 
 owing unto God. Ministers in particular must be careful not to glory in 
 their performances, but must give God the glory of their work, and the 
 success thereof. 

 2. <I>Not he that commendeth himself is approved, but he whom the Lord
 commendeth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Of all flattery, self-flattery is the worst, and self-applause is 
 seldom any better than self-flattery and self-deceit. At the best, 
 self-commendation is no praise, and it is oftentimes as foolish and 
 vain as it is proud; therefore, instead of praising or commending 
 ourselves, we should strive to approve ourselves to God, and his 
 approbation will be our best commendation.</P>
