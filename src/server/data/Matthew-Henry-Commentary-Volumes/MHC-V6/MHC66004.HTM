 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter the prophetical scene opens; and, as the epistolary 
 part opened with a vision of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:1-20"><I>ch.</I> i.</A>),

 so this part is introduced with a glorious appearance of the great God,
 whose throne is in heaven, compassed about with the heavenly host.
 This discovery was made to John, and in this chapter he,

 I. Records the heavenly sight he saw, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 And then,

 II. The heavenly songs he heard, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:8-11">ver. 8, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  After this I looked, and, behold, a door <I>was</I> opened in
 heaven: and the first voice which I heard <I>was</I> as it were of a
 trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will
 show thee things which must be hereafter.
 &nbsp; 2  And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne
 was set in heaven, and <I>one</I> sat on the throne.
 &nbsp; 3  And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
 stone: and <I>there was</I> a rainbow round about the throne, in sight
 like unto an emerald.
 &nbsp; 4  And round about the throne <I>were</I> four and twenty seats: and
 upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in
 white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.
 &nbsp; 5  And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings
 and voices: and <I>there were</I> seven lamps of fire burning before
 the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
 &nbsp; 6  And before the throne <I>there was</I> a sea of glass like unto
 crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the
 throne, <I>were</I> four beasts full of eyes before and behind.
 &nbsp; 7  And the first beast <I>was</I> like a lion, and the second beast
 like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the
 fourth beast <I>was</I> like a flying eagle.
 &nbsp; 8  And the four beasts had each of them six wings about <I>him;</I>
 and <I>they were</I> full of eyes within--
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of a second vision with which the apostle John 
 was favoured: <I>After this,</I> that is, not only "after I had seen 
 the vision of Christ walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks," 
 but "after I had taken his messages from his mouth, and written and 
 sent them to the several churches, according to his command, after this 
 I had another vision." Those who well improve the discoveries they have 
 had of God already are prepared thereby for more, and may expect them.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preparation made for the apostle's having this vision.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>A door was opened in heaven.</I> Hence we learn, 

 (1.) Whatever is transacted on earth is first designed and settled in 
 heaven; there is the model of all the works of God; all of them are 
 therefore before his eye, and he lets the inhabitants of heaven see as 
 much of them as is fit for them. 

 (2.) We can know nothing of future events but what God is pleased to 
 discover to us; they are within the veil, till God opens the door. But, 
 
 (3.) So far as God reveals his designs to us we may and ought to 
 receive them, and not pretend to be wise above what is revealed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To prepare John for the vision, a trumpet was sounded, and he was 
 called up into heaven, to have a sight there of the things which were 
 to be hereafter. He was called into the third heavens. 

 (1.) There is a way opened into the holiest of all, into which the sons 
 of God may enter by faith and holy affections now, in their spirits 
 when they die, and in their whole persons at the last day. 

 (2.) We must not intrude into the secret of God's presence, but stay
 till we are called up to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. To prepare for this vision, <I>the apostle was in the Spirit.</I> He 
 was in a rapture, as before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:10"><I>ch.</I> i. 10</A>),

 whether in the body or out of the body we cannot tell; perhaps he
 himself could not; however all bodily actions and sensations were for a 
 time suspended, and his spirit was possessed with the spirit of 
 prophecy, and wholly under a divine influence. The more we abstract 
 ourselves from all corporeal things the more fit we are for communion 
 with God; the body is a veil, a cloud, and clog to the mind in its 
 transactions with God. We should as it were forget it when we go in 
 before the Lord in duty, and be willing to drop it, that we may go up 
 to him in heaven. This was the <I>apparatus</I> to the vision. Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The vision itself. It begins with the strange sights that the 
 apostle saw, and they were such as these:--

 1. He saw <I>a throne set in heaven,</I> the seat of honour, and
 authority, and judgment. Heaven is the throne of God; there he resides 
 in glory, and thence he gives laws to the church and to the whole 
 world, and all earthly thrones are under the jurisdiction of this 
 throne that is set in heaven. 

 2. He saw a glorious one upon the throne. This throne was not empty;
 there was one in it who filled it, and that was God, who is here 
 described by those things that are most pleasant and precious in our 
 world: <I>His countenance was like a jasper and a sardine-stone;</I> he 
 is not described by any human features, so as to be represented by an 
 image, but only by his transcendent brightness. This jasper is a
 transparent stone, which yet offers to the eye a variety of the most 
 vivid colours, signifying the glorious perfections of God; the 
 sardine-stone is red, signifying the justice of God, that essential 
 attribute of which he never divests himself in favour of any, but 
 gloriously exerts it in the government of the world, and especially of 
 the church, through our Lord Jesus Christ. This attribute is displayed 
 in pardoning as well as in punishing, in saving as well as in 
 destroying sinners. 

 3. He saw <I>a rainbow about the throne, like unto an emerald,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The rainbow was the seal and token of the covenant of the providence 
 that God made with Noah and his posterity with him, and is a fit emblem 
 of that covenant of promise that God has made with Christ as the head 
 of the church, and all his people in him, which covenant is as the 
 waters of Noah unto God, an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things 
 and sure. This rainbow looked like <I>the emerald;</I> the most
 prevailing colour was a pleasant green, to show the reviving and 
 refreshing nature of the new covenant. 

 4. He saw <I>four-and-twenty seats</I> round about the throne, not
 empty, but filled with <I>four-and-twenty elders,</I> presbyters, 
 representing, very probably, the whole church of God, both in the 
 Old-Testament and in the New-Testament state; not the ministers of the 
 church, but rather the representatives of the people. Their sitting 
 denotes their honour, rest, and satisfaction; their sitting about the 
 throne signifies their relation to God, their nearness to him, the 
 sight and enjoyment they have of him. <I>They are clothed in white 
 raiment,</I> the righteousness of the saints, both imputed and 
 inherent; <I>they had on their heads crowns of gold,</I> signifying the 
 honour and authority given them of God, and the glory they have with 
 him. All these may in a lower sense be applied to the gospel church on 
 earth, in its worshipping assemblies; and, in the higher sense, to the 
 church triumphant in heaven. 

 5. He perceived lightnings and voices proceeding out of the throne;
 that is, the awful declarations that God makes to his church of his 
 sovereign will and pleasure. Thus he gave forth the law on mount Sinai; 
 and the gospel has not less glory and authority than the law, though it 
 be of a more spiritual nature. 

 6. He saw <I>seven lamps of fire burning before the throne,</I> which
 are explained to be <I>the seven Spirits of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 the various gifts, graces, and operations of the Spirit of God in the 
 churches of Christ; these are all dispensed according to the will and 
 pleasure of him who sits upon the throne. 

 7. He saw <I>before the throne a sea of glass, like unto crystal.</I>
 As in the temple there was a great vessel of brass filled with water, 
 in which the priests were to wash when they went to minister before the 
 Lord (and this was called a <I>sea</I>), so in the gospel church the 
 sea or laver for purification is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
 who cleanses from all sin, even from sanctuary-sins. In this all those 
 must be washed that are admitted into the gracious presence of God on 
 earth or his glorious presence in heaven. 

 8. He saw <I>four animals,</I> living creatures, between the throne and
 the circle of elders (as seems most probable), standing between God and 
 the people; these seem to signify the ministers of the gospel, not only 
 because of this their situation nearer to God, and between him and the 
 elders or representatives of the Christian people, and because fewer in 
 number than the people, but as they are here described,

 (1.) By their many eyes, denoting sagacity, vigilance, and 
 circumspection. 

 (2.) By their lion-like courage, their great labour and diligence (in
 which they resemble the ox), their prudence and discretion becoming 
 men, and their sublime affections and speculations, by which they mount 
 up <I>with wings like eagles towards heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and these wings full of eyes within, to show that in all their 
 meditations and ministrations they are to act with knowledge, and 
 especially should be well acquainted with themselves and the state of 
 their own souls, and see their own concern in the great doctrines and 
 duties of religion, watching over their own souls as well as the souls 
 of the people. 

 (3.) By their continual employment, and that is, praising God, and not 
 ceasing to do so night and day. The elders sit and are ministered unto; 
 these stand and minister: they rest not night nor day. This now leads 
 to the other part of the representation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>--8 And they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, 
 holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.
 &nbsp; 9  And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him
 that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,
 &nbsp; 10  The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on
 the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and
 cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
 &nbsp; 11  Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and
 power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure
 they are and were created.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have considered the sights that the apostle saw in heaven: now let 
 us observe the songs that he heard, for there is in heaven not only 
 that to be seen which will highly please a sanctified eye, but there is 
 that to be heard which will greatly delight a sanctified ear. This is 
 true concerning the church of Christ here, which is a heaven upon 
 earth, and it will be eminently so in the church made perfect in the 
 heaven of heavens.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He heard the song of the four living creatures, of the ministers of 
 the church, which refers to the prophet Isaiah's vision, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1-13 "><I>ch.</I> vi</A>.

 And here,

 1. They adore one God, and one only, <I>the Lord God Almighty,</I>
 unchangeable and everlasting. 

 2. They adore three holies in this one God, the Holy Father, the Holy
 Son, and the Holy Spirit; and these are one infinitely holy and eternal 
 Being, who sits upon the throne, <I>and lives for ever and ever.</I> In 
 this glory the prophet saw Christ, and spoke of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He heard the adorations of the <I>four-and-twenty elders,</I> that
 is, of the Christian people represented by them; the ministers led, and 
 the people followed, in the praises of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The object of their worship, the same with that which the ministers 
 adored: <I>Him that sat on the throne,</I> the eternal everliving God. 
 The true church of God has one and the same object of worship. Two 
 different objects of worship, either co-ordinate or sub-ordinate, would
 confound the worship and divide the worshippers. It is unlawful to join 
 in divine worship with those who either mistake or multiply the object. 
 There is but one God, and he alone, as God, is worshipped by the church 
 on earth and in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The acts of adoration. 

 (1.) They <I>fell down before him that sat on the throne;</I> they 
 discovered the most profound humility, reverence, and godly fear. 

 (2.) They <I>cast their crowns before the throne;</I> they gave God the 
 glory of the holiness wherewith he had crowned their souls on earth and 
 the honour and happiness with which he crowns them in heaven. They owe 
 all their graces and all their glories to him, and acknowledge that his 
 crown is infinitely more glorious than theirs, and that it is their 
 glory to be glorifying God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The words of adoration: they said, <I>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to 
 receive glory, and honour, and power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) They do not say, <I>We give thee glory, and honour, and power;</I> 
 for what can any creature pretend to give unto God? But they say,
 <I>thou art worthy to receive glory.</I> 

 (2.) In this they tacitly acknowledge that God is exalted far above all 
 blessing and praise. He was worthy to receive glory, but they were not 
 worthy to praise, nor able to do it according to his infinite 
 excellences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. We have the ground and reason of their adoration, which is 
 threefold:--

 (1.) He is the Creator of all things, the first cause; and none but the
 Creator of all things should be adored; no made thing can be the object 
 of religious worship. 

 (2.) He is the preserver of all things, and his preservation is a 
 continual creation; they are created still by the sustaining power of 
 God. All beings but God are dependent upon the will and power of God, 
 and no dependent being must be set up as an object of religious 
 worship. It is the part of the best dependent beings to be worshippers, 
 not to be worshipped. 

 (3.) He is the final cause of all things: <I>For thy pleasure they are 
 and were created.</I> It was his will and pleasure to create all 
 things; he was not put upon it by the will of another; there is no such 
 thing as a subordinate creator, that acts under and by the will and 
 power of another; and, if there were, he ought not to be worshipped. As 
 God made all things at his pleasure, so he made them for his pleasure, 
 to deal with them as he pleases and to glorify himself by them one way 
 or other. Though he delights not in the death of sinners, but rather 
 that they should turn and live, <I>yet he hath made all things for 
 himself,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:4">Prov. xvi. 4</A>.

 Now if these be true and sufficient grounds for religious worship, as 
 they are proper to God alone, Christ must needs be God, one with the 
 Father and Spirit, and be worshipped as such; for we find the same 
 causality ascribed to him.
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:16,17">Col. i. 16, 17</A>,

 <I>All things were created by him and for him, and he is before all
 things, and by him all things consist.</I></P>
