 It is some rebuke to Barnabas that after he left Paul we hear no more 
 of him, of what he did or suffered for Christ. But Paul, as he was 
 recommended by the brethren to the grace of God, so his services for 
 Christ after this are largely recorded; we are to attend him in this 
 chapter from place to place, wherever he came doing good, either 
 watering or planting, beginning new work or improving what was done. 
 Here is, 

 I. The beginning of his acquaintance with Timothy, and taking him to be
 his assistant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The visit he made to the churches for their establishment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 III. His call to Macedonia (after a restraint he had been under from
 going to some other places), and his coming to Philippi, the chief city
 of Macedonia, with his entertainment there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:6-13">ver. 6-13</A>.

 IV. The conversion of Lydia there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>.

 V. The casing of an evil spirit out of a damsel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>.

 VI. The accusing and abusing of Paul and Silas for it, their 
 imprisonment, and the indignities done them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:19-24">ver. 19-24</A>.

 VII. The miraculous conversion of the jailer to the faith of Christ,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:25-34">ver. 25-34</A>.

 VIII. The honourable discharge of Paul and Silas by the magistrates,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain
 disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman,
 which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father <I>was</I> a Greek:
 &nbsp; 2 Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at
 Lystra and Iconium.
 &nbsp; 3 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and
 circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters:
 for they knew all that his father was a Greek.
 &nbsp; 4 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the
 decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and
 elders which were at Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 5 And so were the churches established in the faith, and
 increased in number daily.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul was a spiritual father, and as such a one we have him here 
 adopting Timothy, and taking care of the education of many others who 
 had been begotten to Christ by his ministry: and in all he appears to
 have been a wise and tender father. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His taking Timothy into his acquaintance and under his tuition. One 
 thing designed in the book of the Acts is to help us to understand 
 Paul's epistles, two of which are directed to Timothy; it was therefore 
 necessary that in the history of Paul we should have some account 
 concerning him. And we are here accordingly told, 

 1. That he was a disciple, one that belonged to Christ, and was
 baptized, probably in his infancy, when his mother became a believer, 
 as Lydia's household was baptized upon her believing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Him, that was a disciple of Christ, Paul took to be his disciple, that 
 he might further train him up in the knowledge and faith of Christ; he 
 took him to be brought up for Christ. 

 2. That his mother was a Jewess originally, <I>but believed in
 Christ;</I> her name was <I>Eunice,</I> his grandmother's name was 
 <I>Lois.</I> Paul speaks of them both with great respect, as women of 
 eminent virtue and piety, and commends them especially for their 
 unfeigned faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:5">2 Tim. i. 5</A>),

 their sincerely embracing and adhering to the doctrine of Christ. 

 3. That his father was a Greek, a Gentile. The marriage of a Jewish
 woman to a Gentile husband (though some would make a difference) was 
 prohibited as much as the marriage of a Jewish man to a Gentile wife, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:3">Deut. vii. 3</A>.

 Thou shalt no more <I>give thy daughter to his son than take his 
 daughter to thy son;</I> yet this seems to have been limited to the 
 nations that lived among them in Canaan, whom they were most in danger 
 of infection from. Now because his father was a Greek he was not 
 circumcised: for the entail of the covenant and the seal of it, as of 
 other entails in that nation, went by the father, not by the mother; so 
 that his father being no Jew he was not obliged to circumcision, nor 
 entitled to it, unless when he grew up he did himself desire it. But, 
 observe, though his mother could not prevail to have him circumcised in 
 his infancy, because his father was of another mind and way, yet she 
 educated him in the fear of God, that though he wanted the sign of the 
 covenant he might not want the thing signified. 

 4. That he had gained a very good character among the Christians: he
 was <I>well reported of by the brethren</I> that were at Lystra and 
 Iconium; he had not only an unblemished reputation, and was free from 
 scandal, but he had a bright reputation, and great encomiums were given 
 of him, as an extraordinary young man, and one from whom great things 
 were expected. Not only those in the place where he was born, but those 
 in the neighbouring cities, admired him, and spoke honourably of him.
 He had a name for good things with good people. 

 5. That Paul would have him <I>to go forth with him,</I> to accompany
 him, to give attendance on him, to receive instruction from him, and to 
 join with him in the work of the gospel--to preach for him when there
 was occasion, and to be left behind in places where he had planted 
 churches. Paul had a great love for him, not only because he was an 
 ingenious young man, and one of great parts, but because he was a 
 serious young man, and one of devout affections: for Paul was always 
 <I>mindful of his tears,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:4">2 Tim. i. 4</A>.

 6. That Paul took him and circumcised him, or ordered it to be done.
 This was strange. Had not Paul opposed those with all his might that 
 were for imposing circumcision upon the Gentile converts? Had he not
 at this time the decrees of the council at Jerusalem with him, which 
 witnessed against it? He had, and yet circumcised Timothy, not, as 
 those teachers designed in imposing circumcision, to oblige him to keep 
 the ceremonial law, but only to render his conversation and ministry 
 passable, and, if it might be, acceptable among the Jews that abounded 
 in those quarters. He knew Timothy was a man likely to do a great deal 
 of good among them, being admirably qualified for the ministry, if they 
 were not invincibly prejudiced against him; and therefore, that they 
 might not shun him as one unclean, because uncircumcised, he took him 
 and <I>circumcised him.</I> Thus <I>to the Jews he became as a Jew, 
 that he might gain the Jews,</I> and <I>all things to all men, that he 
 might gain some.</I> He was against those who made circumcision 
 necessary to salvation, but used it himself when it was conducive to 
 edification; nor was he rigid in opposing it, as they were in imposing 
 it. Thus, though he went not in this instance according to the letter 
 of the decree, he went according to the spirit of it, which was a 
 spirit of tenderness towards the Jews, and willingness to bring them 
 off gradually from their prejudices. Paul made no difficulty of taking 
 Timothy to be his companion, though he was uncircumcised; but the Jews 
 would not hear him if he were, and therefore Paul will humour them 
 herein. It is probable that it was at this time that Paul laid his 
 hands on Timothy, for the conferring of the gift of the Holy Ghost upon 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:6">2 Tim. i. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His confirming the churches which he had planted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>):

 <I>He went through the cities</I> where he had <I>preached the word of 
 the Lord,</I> as he intended

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:36"><I>ch.</I> xv. 36</A>),

 to enquire into their state. And we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they delivered them copies of the decrees of the Jerusalem 
 synod, to be a direction to them in the government of themselves, and 
 that they might have wherewith to answer the judaizing teachers, and to 
 justify themselves in adhering to the <I>liberty with which Christ had 
 made them free.</I> All the churches were concerned in that decree, and 
 therefore it was requisite they should all have it well attested. 
 Though Paul had for a particular reason circumcised Timothy, yet he 
 would not have that drawn into a precedent; and therefore he 
 <I>delivered the decrees</I> to the churches, to be religiously 
 observed; for they must abide by the rule, and not be drawn from it by 
 a particular example.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That this was of very good service to them. 

 (1.) The churches were hereby <I>established in the faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 They were confirmed particularly in their opinion against the imposing 
 of the ceremonial law upon the Gentiles; the great assurance and heat 
 wherewith the judaizing teachers pressed the necessity of circumcision, 
 and the plausible arguments they produced for it, had shocked them, so 
 that they began to waver concerning it. But when they saw the 
 testimony, not only of the apostles and elders, but of the Holy Ghost 
 in them, against it, they were established, and did not longer waver 
 about it. Note, Testimonies to truth, though they may not prevail to 
 convince those that oppose it, may be of very good use to establish 
 those that are in doubt concerning it, and to fix them. Nay, the design 
 of this decree being to set aside the ceremonial law, and the carnal 
 ordinances of that, they were by it established in the Christian faith 
 in general, and were the more firmly assured that it was of God, 
 because it set up a spiritual way of serving God, as more suited to the 
 nature both of God and man; and, besides, that spirit of tenderness and 
 condescension which appeared in these letters plainly showed that the 
 apostles and elders were herein under the guidance of him who is love 
 itself. 

 (2.) They <I>increased in number daily.</I> The imposing of the yoke of 
 the ceremonial law upon their converts was enough to frighten people 
 from them. If they had been disposed to turn Jews, they could have done 
 that long since, before the apostles came among them; but, if they 
 cannot be interested in the Christian privileges without submitting to 
 the Jews' yoke, they will be as they are. But, if they find there is no 
 danger of their being so enslaved, they are ready to embrace 
 Christianity, and join themselves to the church. And thus the church 
 <I>increased in numbers daily;</I> not a day passed but some or other 
 gave up their names to Christ. And it is a joy to those who heartily 
 wish well to the honour of Christ, and the welfare of the church and 
 the souls of men, to see such an increase.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of
 Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word
 in Asia,
 &nbsp; 7 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into
 Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.
 &nbsp; 8 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
 &nbsp; 9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man
 of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia,
 and help us.
 &nbsp; 10 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured
 to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had
 called us for to preach the gospel unto them.
 &nbsp; 11 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course
 to Samothracia, and the next <I>day</I> to Neapolis;
 &nbsp; 12 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that
 part of Macedonia, <I>and</I> a colony: and we were in that city
 abiding certain days.
 &nbsp; 13 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
 where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto
 the women which resorted <I>thither.</I>
 &nbsp; 14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the
 city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard <I>us:</I> whose heart
 the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were
 spoken of Paul.
 &nbsp; 15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought
 <I>us,</I> saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord,
 come into my house, and abide <I>there.</I> And she constrained us.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Paul's travels up and down to do good. 

 1. He and Silas his colleague went throughout Phrygia and the region of 
 Galatia, where, it should seem, the gospel was already planted, but 
 whether by Paul's hand or no is not mentioned; it is likely it was, for 
 in his epistle to the Galatians he speaks of his <I>preaching the 
 gospel to them at the first,</I> and how very acceptable he was among 
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:13-15">Gal. iv. 13-15</A>.

 And it appears by that epistle that the judaizing teachers had then
 done a great deal of mischief to these churches of Galatia, had 
 prejudiced them against Paul and drawn them from the gospel of Christ, 
 for which he there severely reproves them. But probably that was a 
 great while after this.

 2. They were forbidden at this time to preach the gospel in Asia (the
 country properly so called), because it did not need, other hands being 
 at work there; or because the people were not yet prepared to receive 
 it, as they were afterwards

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:10"><I>ch.</I> xix. 10</A>),

 when <I>all those that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord;</I>
 or, as Dr. Lightfoot suggests, because at this time Christ would employ 
 Paul in a piece of new work, which was to preach the gospel to a Roman 
 colony at Philippi, for hitherto the Gentiles to whom he had preached 
 were Greeks. The Romans were more particularly hated by the Jews than 
 other Gentiles; their armies were the <I>abomination of desolation;</I> 
 and therefore there is this among other things extraordinary in his 
 call thither that he is forbidden to preach the gospel in Asia and 
 other places, in order to his preaching it there, which is an 
 intimation that the light of the gospel would in aftertimes be directed 
 more westward than eastward. It was the Holy Ghost that forbade them, 
 either by secret whispers in the minds of both of them, which, when 
 they came to compare notes, they found to be the same, and to come from 
 the same Spirit; or by some prophets who spoke to them from the Spirit. 
 The removals of ministers, and the dispensing of the means of grace by 
 them, are in a particular manner under a divine guidance and direction. 
 We find an Old-Testament minister forbidden to preach at all 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:26">Ezek. iii. 26</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt be dumb.</I> But these New-Testament ministers are only 
 forbidden to preach in one place, while they are directed to another 
 where there is more need. 

 3. They would have gone into Bithynia, but were not permitted: <I>the
 Spirit suffered them not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They came to Mysia, and, as it should seem, preached the gospel there; 
 for though it was a very mean contemptible country, even to a proverb 
 (<I>Mysorum ultimus,</I> in Cicero, is <I>a most despicable man</I>),
 yet the apostles disdained not to visit it, owning themselves debtors 
 both <I>to the wise and to the unwise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:14">Rom. i. 14</A>.

 In Bithynia was the city of Nice, where the first general council was
 held against the Arians; into these countries Peter sent his epistle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1">1 Pet. i. 1</A>);

 and there were flourishing churches here, for, though they had not the
 gospel sent them now, they had it in their turn, not long after.
 Observe, Though their judgment and inclination were to go into 
 Bithynia, yet, having then extraordinary ways of knowing the mind of 
 God, they were overruled by them, contrary to their own mind. We must 
 now follow providence, and submit to the guidance of that pillar of 
 cloud and fire; and, if this <I>suffer us not</I> to do what we assay 
 to do, we ought to acquiesce, and believe it for the best. <I>The 
 Spirit of Jesus</I> suffered them not; so many ancient copies read it.
 The servants of the Lord Jesus ought to be always under the check and 
 conduct of the <I>Spirit of the Lord Jesus,</I> by whom he governs 
 men's minds. 

 4. They <I>passed by Mysia,</I> or passed <I>through it</I> (so some),
 sowing good seed, we may suppose, as they went along; and they came 
 down to Troas, the city of Troy, so much talked of, or the country 
 thereabouts, which took its denomination from it. Here a church was 
 planted; for here we find one in being,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:6"><I>ch.</I> xx. 6, 7</A>,

 and probably planted at this time, and in a little time. It should seem
 that at Troas Luke fell in with Paul, and joined himself to his
 company; for henceforward, for the most part, when he speaks of Paul's
 journeys, he puts himself into the number of his retinue, <I>we</I> 
 went, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Paul's particular call to Macedonia, that is, to Philippi, the 
 chief city, inhabited mostly by Romans, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The vision Paul had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Paul had many visions, sometimes to encourage, sometimes, as here, to 
 direct him in his work. An angel appeared to him, to intimate to him 
 that it was the will of Christ he should go to Macedonia. Let him not 
 be discouraged by the embargo laid upon him once and again, by which 
 his designs were crossed; for, though he shall not go where he has a 
 mind to go, he shall go where God has work for him to do. Now observe,

 (1.) The person Paul saw. There stood by him <I>a man of Macedonia,</I> 
 who by his habit or dialect seemed so to Paul, or who told him he was 
 so. The angel, some think, assumed the shape of such a man; or, as 
 others think, impressed upon Paul's fancy, when between asleep and 
 awake, the image of such a man: he dreamt he saw such a one. Christ 
 would have Paul directed to Macedonia, not as the apostles were at 
 other times, by a messenger from heaven, to send him thither, but by a 
 messenger thence to call him thither, because in this way he would 
 afterwards ordinarily direct the motions of his ministers, by inclining 
 the hearts of those who needed them to invite them. Paul shall be 
 called to Macedonia by a man of Macedonia, and by him speaking in the 
 name of the rest. Some make this man to be the tutelar angel of 
 Macedonia, supposing angels to have charge of particular places as well 
 as persons, and that so much is intimated 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:20">Dan. x. 20</A>,

 where we read of the <I>princes of Persia and Grecia,</I> that seem to
 have been angels. But there is no certainty of this. There was
 presented either to Paul's eyes or to his mind a man of Macedonia. The
 angel must not preach the gospel himself to the Macedonians, but must 
 bring Paul to them. Nor must he by the authority of an angel order him 
 to go, but in the person of a Macedonian court him to come. A man of 
 Macedonia, not a magistrate of the country, much less a priest (Paul 
 was not accustomed to receive invitations from such) but an ordinary 
 inhabitant of that country, a plain man, that carried in his 
 countenance marks of probity and seriousness, that did not come to 
 banter Paul nor trifle with him, but in good earnest and with all 
 earnestness to importune his assistance.

 (2.) The invitation given him. This honest Macedonian <I>prayed him,
 saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us;</I> that is, "Come and 
 preach the gospel to us; let us have the benefit of thy labours." 

 [1.] "<I>Thou hast helped many;</I> we have heard of those in this and 
 the other country to whom thou hast been very useful; and why may we 
 not put in for a share? O come and help us." The benefits others have 
 received from the gospel should quicken our enquiries, our further 
 enquiries, after it. 

 [2.] "It is thy business, and it is thy delight, to help poor souls; 
 thou art a physician for the sick, that art to be ready at the call of 
 every patient; O come and help us." 

 [3.] "We have need of thy help, as much as any people; we in Macedonia 
 are as ignorant and as careless in religion as any people in the world 
 are, are as idolatrous and as vicious as any, and as ingenious and 
 industrious to ruin ourselves as any; and therefore, O come, come with 
 all speed among us. <I>If thou canst do any thing, have compassion on 
 us, and help us.</I>" 

 [4.] "Those few among us that have any sense of divine things, and any 
 concern for their own souls and the souls of others, have done what can 
 be done, by the help of natural light; I have done my part for one. We 
 have carried the matter as far as it will go, to persuade our 
 neighbours to fear and worship God, but we can do little good among 
 them. <I>O come come, thou over, and help us.</I> The gospel thou 
 preachest has arguments and powers beyond those we have yet been 
 furnished with." 

 [5.] "Do not only help us with thy prayers here: this will not do; thou 
 must come over and help us." Note, People have great need of help for 
 their souls, and it is their duty to look out for it and invite those 
 among them that can help them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The interpretation made of the vision 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 They <I>gathered assuredly from this that the Lord had called them to 
 preach the gospel</I> there; and they were ready to go wherever God 
 directed. Note, We may sometimes infer a call of God from a call of
 man. If a man of Macedonia says, <I>Come and help us,</I> Paul thence 
 gathers assuredly that God says, Go an help them. Ministers may go on 
 with great cheerfulness and courage in their work when they perceive 
 Christ calling them, not only to preach the gospel, but to preach it at 
 this time, in this place, to this people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Paul's voyage to Macedonia hereupon: He <I>was not disobedient to 
 the heavenly vision,</I> but followed this divine direction much more 
 cheerfully, and with more satisfaction, than he would have followed any 
 contrivance or inclination of his own.

 1. Thitherward he turned his thoughts. Now that he knows the mind of
 God in the matter he is determined, for this is all he wanted; now he 
 thinks no more of Asia, nor Bithynia, but <I>immediately we endeavoured 
 to go into Macedonia.</I> Paul only had the vision, but he communicated 
 it to his companions, and they all, upon the credit of this, resolved 
 for Macedonia. As Paul will follow Christ, so all his will follow him, 
 or rather follow Christ with him. They are getting things in readiness 
 for this expedition immediately, without delay. Note, God's calls must 
 be complied with immediately. As our obedience must not be disputed, so 
 it must not be deferred; do it to-day, lest thy heart be hardened.
 Observe, They could not immediately go into Macedonia; but they 
 immediately endeavoured to go. If we cannot be so quick as we would be 
 in our performances, yet we may be in our endeavours, and this shall be 
 accepted. 

 2. Thitherward he steered his course. They <I>set sail</I> by the first
 shipping and with the first fair wind <I>from Troas;</I> for they may 
 be sure they have done what they had to do there when God calls them to 
 another place. They <I>came with a straight course,</I> a prosperous 
 voyage, <I>to Samothracia;</I> the <I>next day they came to 
 Neapolis,</I> a city on the confines of Thrace and Macedonia; and at 
 last they landed at <I>Philippi,</I> a city so called from Philip king 
 of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great; it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)
 
 to be, 

 (1.) <I>The chief city of that part of Macedonia;</I> or, as some read 
 it, <I>the first city,</I> the first they came to when they came from 
 Troas. As an army that lands in a country of which they design to make 
 themselves masters begin with the reduction of the first place they 
 come to, so did Paul and his assistants: they began with the first 
 city, because, if the gospel were received there, it would the more 
 easily spread thence all the country over. 

 (2.) It was a colony. The Romans not only had a garrison, but the 
 inhabitants of the city were Romans, the magistrates at least, and the 
 governing part. There were the greatest numbers and variety of people, 
 and therefore the most likelihood of doing good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The cold entertainment which Paul and his companions met with at 
 Philippi. One would have expected that having such a particular call 
 from God thither they would have had a joyful welcome there, as Peter 
 had with Cornelius when the angel sent him thither. Where was the man 
 of Macedonia that begged Paul to come thither with all speed? Why did 
 not he stir up his countrymen, some of them at least, to go and meet 
 him? Why was not Paul introduced with solemnity, and the keys of the 
 city put into his hand? Here is nothing like this; for, 

 1. It is a good while before any notice at all is taken of him: <I>We
 were in that city abiding certain days,</I> probably at a public house 
 and at their own charge, for they had no friend to invite them so much 
 as to a meal's meat, till Lydia welcomed them. They had made all the 
 haste they could thither, but, now that they are there, they are almost 
 tempted to think they might as well have staid where they were. But so 
 it was ordered for their trial whether they could bear the pain of 
 silence and lying by, when this was their lot. Those eminent and useful 
 men are not fit to live in this world that know not how to be slighted 
 and overlooked. Let not ministers think it strange if they be first
 strongly invited to a place, and then looked shyly upon when they come. 
 
 2. When they have an opportunity of preaching it is in an obscure
 place, and to a mean and small auditory,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 There was no synagogue of the Jews there, for aught that appears, to be 
 a door of entrance to them, and they never went to the idol-temples of 
 the Gentiles, to preach to the auditories there; but here, upon 
 enquiry, they found out a little meeting of good women, <I>that were 
 proselytes of the gate,</I> who would be thankful to them if they would 
 give them a sermon. The place of this meeting is out of the city; there 
 it was connived at, but would not be suffered any where within the 
 walls. It was a place <I>where prayer was wont to be made;</I> 
 <B><I>proseuche</I></B>--<I>where an oratory or house of prayer was</I>
 (so some), a chapel, or smaller synagogue. But I rather take it, as we 
 read it, where prayer was appointed or accustomed to be. Those that 
 worshipped the true God, and would not worship idols, met there to pray 
 together, and, according to the description of the most ancient and 
 universal devotion, <I>to call upon the name of the Lord.</I> Each of 
 them prayed apart every day; this was always the practice of those that 
 worshipped God: but, besides this, <I>they came together on the sabbath 
 day.</I> Though they were but a few and discountenanced by the town, 
 though their meeting was at some distance, though, for aught that 
 appears, there were none but women, yet a solemn assembly the 
 worshippers of God must have, if by any means it be possible, on the 
 sabbath day. When we cannot do as we would we must do as we can; if we 
 have not synagogues, we must be thankful for more private places, and 
 resort to them, <I>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves 
 together,</I> according as our opportunities are. This place is said to 
 be <I>by a river side,</I> which perhaps was chosen, as befriending 
 contemplation. Idolaters are said <I>to take their lot among the smooth 
 stones of the stream,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:6">Isa. lvii. 6</A>.

 But these proselytes had in their eye, perhaps, the example of those
 prophets who had their visions, one by the <I>river of Chebar</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:1">Ezek. i. 1</A>),
 
 another by <I>the great river Hiddekel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:4">Dan. x. 4</A>.

 Thither Paul and Silas and Luke went, and <I>sat down,</I> to instruct
 the congregation, that they might the better pray with them. They
 <I>spoke unto the women who resorted thither,</I> encouraged them in 
 practising according to the light they had, and led them on further to 
 the knowledge of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The conversion of <I>Lydia,</I> who probably was the first that was 
 wrought upon there to believe in Christ, though not the last. In this 
 story of <I>the Acts,</I> we have not only the conversion of places 
 recorded, but of many particular persons; for such is the worth of 
 souls that the reducing of one to God is a great matter. Nor have we 
 only the conversions that were effected by miracle, as Paul's, but some 
 that were brought about by the ordinary methods of grace, as Lydia's 
 here. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who this convert was that there is such particular notice taken of. 
 Four things are recorded of her:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Her name, <I>Lydia.</I> It is an honour to her to have her name 
 recorded here in the book of God, so that <I>wherever the scriptures 
 are read there shall this be told concerning her.</I> Note, The names 
 of the saints are precious with God, and should be so with us; we 
 cannot have our names recorded in the Bible, but, if God open our 
 hearts, we shall find them <I>written in the book of life,</I> and this 
 is better 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:3">Phil. iv. 3</A>)
 
 and more to <I>be rejoiced in,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:20">Luke x. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Her calling. She was <I>a seller of purple,</I> either of purple 
 dye or of purple cloth or silk. Observe, 

 [1.] She had a calling, an honest calling, which the historian takes 
 notice of to her praise; she was none of those women that the apostle 
 speaks of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:13">1 Tim. v. 13</A>),
 
 <I>who learn to be idle, and not only idle, &c.</I>

 [2.] It was a mean calling. She was <I>a seller of purple,</I> not a
 wearer of purple, few such are called. The notice here taken of this is 
 an intimation to those who are employed in honest callings, if they be 
 honest in the management of them, not to be ashamed of them. 

 [3.] Though she had a calling to mind, yet she was a worshipper of God, 
 and found time to improve advantages for her soul. The business of our 
 particular callings may be made to consist very well with the business 
 of religion, and therefore it will not excuse us from religious 
 exercises alone, and in our families, or in solemn assemblies, to say, 
 We have shops to look after, and a trade to mind; for have we not also 
 a God to serve and a soul to look after? Religion does not call us from 
 our business in the world, but directs us in it. Every thing in its 
 time and place.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The place she was of--<I>of the city of Thyatira,</I> which was a
 great way from Philippi; there she was born and bred, but either 
 married at Philippi, or brought by her trade to settle there. The 
 providence of God, as it always appoints, so it often removes, <I>the 
 bounds of our habitation,</I> and sometimes makes the change of our 
 outward condition or place of our abode wonderfully subservient to the 
 designs of his grace concerning our salvation. Providence brings Lydia 
 to Philippi, to be under Paul's ministry, and there, where she met with 
 it, she made a good use of it; so should we improve opportunities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Her religion before the Lord opened her heart. 

 [1.] She worshipped God according to the knowledge she had; she was one 
 of the devout women. Sometimes the grace of God wrought upon those who, 
 before their conversion, were very wicked and vile, publicans and 
 harlots; <I>such were some of you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11">1 Cor. vi. 11</A>.

 But sometimes it fastened upon those who were of a good character, who
 had some good in them, as the eunuch, Cornelius, and Lydia. Note, It is 
 not enough to be worshippers of God, but we must be believers in Jesus 
 Christ, for there is no coming to God as a Father, but by him as 
 Mediator. But those who worshipped God according to the light they had 
 stood fair for the discoveries of Christ, and his grace to them; for 
 <I>to him that has shall be given:</I> and to them Christ would be 
 welcome; for those that know what it is to worship God see their need 
 of Christ, and know what use to make of his mediation.

 [2.] She heard the apostles. Here, where prayer was made, when there 
 was an opportunity, <I>the word was preached;</I> for hearing the word 
 of God is a part of religious worship, and how can we expect God should 
 hear our prayers if we will not hearken to his word? Those that 
 worshipped God according to the light they had looked out for further 
 light; we must improve <I>the day of small things,</I> but must not 
 rest in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the work was that was wrought upon her: <I>Whose heart the Lord 
 opened.</I> Observe here, 

 (1.) The author of this work: it was <I>the Lord,</I>--the Lord Christ,
 to whom this judgment is committed,--the Spirit of the Lord, who is the
 sanctifier. Note, Conversion-work is God's work; it is he <I>that
 works in us both to will and to do;</I> not as if we had nothing to do, 
 but of ourselves, without God's grace, we can do nothing; nor as if God 
 were in the least chargeable with the ruin of those that perish, but 
 the salvation of those that are saved must be wholly ascribed to him.

 (2.) The seat of this work; it is in the heart that the change is made, 
 it is to the heart that this blessed turn is given; it was the heart of 
 Lydia that was wrought upon. Conversion-work is heart-work; it is a
 <I>renewing of the heart, the inward man, the spirit of the mind.</I>

 (3.) The nature of the work; she had not only her heart touched, but 
 her heart opened. An unconverted soul is shut up, and fortified against 
 Christ, <I>straitly shut up,</I> as Jericho against Joshua,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+6:1">Josh. vi. 1</A>.

 Christ, in dealing with the soul, knocks at the door that is shut 
 against him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>);

 and, when a sinner is effectually persuaded to embrace Christ, <I>then
 the heart is opened for the King of glory to come in</I>--the
 understanding is open to receive the divine light, the will opened to 
 receive the divine law, and the affections opened to receive the divine 
 love. When the heart is thus opened to Christ, the ear is opened to his 
 word, the lips opened in prayer, the hand opened in charity, and the 
 steps enlarged in all manner of gospel obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What were the effects of this work on the heart. 

 (1.) She took great notice of the word of God. Her heart was so 
 <I>opened that she attended to the things that were spoken by Paul;</I> 
 she not only gave attendance on Paul's preaching, but gave attention to 
 it; <I>she applied to herself</I> (so some read it) <I>the things that 
 were spoken by Paul;</I> and then only the word does us good, and makes 
 an abiding impression upon us, when we apply it to ourselves. Now this 
 was an evidence of the opening of her heart, and was the fruit of it; 
 wherever the heart is opened by the grace of God, it will appear by a 
 diligent attendance on, and attention to, the word of God, both for 
 Christ's sake, whose word it is, and for our own sakes, who are so 
 nearly interested in it.

 (2.) She gave up her name to Jesus Christ, and took upon her the 
 profession of his holy religion; <I>She was baptized,</I> and by this 
 solemn rite was admitted a member of the church of Christ; and with her 
 <I>her household</I> also was baptized, those of them that were infants 
 in her right, for if <I>the root be holy so are the branches,</I> and 
 those that were grown up by her influence and authority. She and her 
 household were baptized by the same rule that Abraham and his household 
 were circumcised, because the seal of the covenant belongs to the 
 covenanters and their seed.

 (3.) She was very kind to the ministers, and very desirous to be 
 further instructed by them in <I>the things pertaining to the kingdom 
 of God: She besought us saying "If you have judged me to be faithful to 
 the Lord,</I> if you take me to be a sincere Christian, manifest your 
 confidence in me by this, <I>come into my house, and abide there.</I>" 
 Thus she desired an opportunity, 

 [1.] To testify her gratitude to those who had been the instruments of 
 divine grace in this blessed change that was wrought upon her. When her 
 heart was open to Christ, her house was open to his ministers for his 
 sake, and they were welcome to the best entertainment she had, which 
 she did not think too good for those of whose spiritual things she had 
 reaped so plentifully. Nay, they are not only welcome to her house, but 
 she is extremely pressing and importunate with them: <I>She constrained 
 us;</I> which intimates that Paul was very backward and unwilling to 
 go, because he was afraid of being burdensome to the families of the 
 young converts, and would study <I>to make the gospel of Christ without 
 charge</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:18,Ac+20:34">1 Cor. ix. 18; Acts xx. 34</A>),

 that those who were without might have no occasion given them to
 reproach the preachers of the gospel as designing, self-seeking men, 
 and that those who were within might have no occasion to complain of 
 the expenses of their religion: but Lydia will have no nay; she will 
 not believe that they take her to be a sincere Christian unless they 
 will oblige her herein; like Abraham inviting the angels

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:3">Gen. xviii. 3</A>),

 <I>If now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away from thy
 servant.</I> 

 [2.] She desired an opportunity of receiving further instruction. If 
 she might but have them for awhile in her family, she might hear them 
 daily

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:34">Prov. viii. 34</A>),

 and not merely on sabbath days at the meeting. In her own house she
 might not only hear them, but ask them questions; and she might have 
 them to pray with her daily, and to bless her household. Those that
 know something of Christ cannot but desire to know more, and seek 
 opportunities of increasing their acquaintance with his gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
 possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her
 masters much gain by soothsaying:
 &nbsp; 17 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men
 are the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way
 of salvation.
 &nbsp; 18 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned
 and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus
 Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.
 &nbsp; 19 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was
 gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew <I>them</I> into the
 marketplace unto the rulers,
 &nbsp; 20 And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men,
 being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
 &nbsp; 21 And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive,
 neither to observe, being Romans.
 &nbsp; 22 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the
 magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast
 <I>them</I> into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:
 &nbsp; 24 Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the
 inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul and his companions, though they were for some time buried in 
 obscurity at Philippi, yet now begin to be taken notice of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>A damsel that had a spirit of divination</I> caused them to be 
 taken notice of, by proclaiming them to be the servants of God.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The account that is given of this damsel: She was <I>pythonissa, 
 possessed with</I> such <I>a spirit of divination</I> as that damsel 
 was by whom the oracles of Apollo at Delphos were delivered; she was 
 actuated by an evil spirit, that dictated ambiguous answers to those 
 who consulted her, which served to gratify their vain desire of knowing 
 things to come, but often deceived them. In those times of ignorance, 
 infidelity, and idolatry, the devil, by the divine permission, thus led 
 men captive at his will; and he could not have gained such adoration 
 from them as he had, if he had not pretended to give oracles to them, 
 for by both his usurpation is maintained as the god of this world. This 
 damsel <I>brought her masters much gain by soothsaying;</I> many came 
 to consult this witch for the discovery of robberies, the finding of 
 things lost, and especially to be told their fortune, and none came but 
 with the rewards of divination in their hands, according to the quality 
 of the person and the importance of the case. Probably there were many 
 that were thus kept for fortune-tellers, but, it should seem, this was 
 more in repute than any of them; for, while others brought some gain, 
 this <I>brought much gain to her masters,</I> being consulted more than 
 any other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The testimony which this damsel gave to Paul and his companions: She 
 <I>met them</I> in the street, as they were going to prayer, to the 
 house of prayer, or rather to the work of prayer there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 They went thither publicly, every body knew whither they were going, 
 and what they were going to do. If what she did was likely to be any 
 distraction to them, or a hindrance in their work, it is observable how 
 subtle Satan is, that great tempter, in taking the opportunity to give 
 us diversion when we are going about any religious exercises, to ruffle 
 us and to put us out of temper when we need to be most composed. When 
 she met with them she followed them, crying, "<I>These men,</I> how 
 contemptible soever they look and are looked upon, are great men, for 
 they <I>are the servants of the most high God,</I> and men that should 
 be very welcome to us, for <I>they show unto us the way of 
 salvation,</I> both the salvation that will be our happiness, and the 
 way to it that will be our holiness."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 (1.) This witness is true; it is a comprehensive encomium on the
 faithful preachers of the gospel, and makes their feet beautiful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:15">Rom. x. 15</A>.

 Though they are <I>men subject to like passions as we are,</I> and
 <I>earthen vessels,</I> yet, 

 [1.] "They are <I>the servants of the most high God;</I> they attend on 
 him, are employed by him, and are devoted to his honour, as servants; 
 they come to us on his errands, the message they bring is from him, and 
 they serve the purposes and interest of his kingdom. The gods we 
 Gentiles worship are inferior beings, therefore not gods, but these men 
 belong to the supreme <I>Numen, to the most high God,</I> who is over 
 all men, over all gods, who made us all, and to whom we are all 
 accountable. They are his servants, and therefore it is our duty to 
 respect them, and harken to them for their Master's sake, and it is at 
 our peril if we affront them." 

 [2.] "They <I>show unto us the way of salvation.</I>" Even the heathen 
 had some notion of the miserable deplorable state of mankind, and their 
 need of salvation, and it was what they made some enquiries after. 
 "Now," saith she, "these men are the men that show us what we have in 
 vain sought for in our superstitious profitless application to our 
 priests and oracles." Note, God has, in the gospel of his Son, plainly 
 shown us the way of salvation, has told us what we must do that we may 
 be delivered from the misery to which by sin we have exposed 
 ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But, 

 (2.) How came this testimony from the mouth of one that had a spirit of 
 divination? Is Satan divided against himself? Will he cry up those 
 whose business it is to pull him down? We may take it either, 

 [1.] As extorted from this spirit of divination for the honour of the 
 gospel by the power of God; as the devil was forced to say of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:24">Mark i. 24</A>):

 <I>I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</I> The truth is
 sometimes magnified by the confession of its adversaries, in which they 
 are witnesses against themselves. Christ would have this testimony of 
 the damsel to rise up in judgment against those at Philippi who 
 slighted and persecuted the apostles; though the gospel needed no such 
 testimony, yet it shall serve to add to their commendation that the 
 damsel whom they looked upon as an oracle in other things proclaimed 
 the apostles God's servants. Or, 

 [2.] As designed by the evil spirit, that subtle serpent, to the 
 dishonour of the gospel; some think she designed hereby to gain credit 
 to herself and her prophecies, and so to increase her master's profit 
 by pretending to be in the interest of the apostles, who, she thought, 
 had a growing reputation, or to curry favour with Paul, that he might 
 not separate her and her familiar. Others think that Satan, who can
 transform himself into an angel of light, and can say anything to serve 
 a turn, designed hereby to disgrace the apostles; as if these divines 
 were of the same fraternity with their diviners, because they were 
 witnessed to by them, and then the people might as well adhere to those 
 they had been used to. Those that were most likely to receive the 
 apostles' doctrine were such as were prejudiced against these spirits 
 of divination, and therefore would, by this testimony, be prejudiced 
 against the gospel; and, as for those who regarded these diviners, the 
 devil thought himself sure of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ caused them to be taken notice of, by giving them power to 
 cast the devil out of this damsel. She continued <I>many days</I> 
 clamouring thus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 and, it should seem, Paul took no notice of her, not knowing but it
 might be ordered of God for the service of his cause, that she should 
 thus witness concerning his ministers; but finding perhaps that it did 
 them a prejudice, rather than any service, he soon silenced her, by 
 casting the devil out of her. 

 1. He was <I>grieved.</I> It troubled him to see the damsel made an
 instrument of Satan to deceive people, and to see the people imposed 
 upon by her divinations. It was a disturbance to him to hear a sacred 
 truth so profaned, and good words come out of such a wicked mouth with 
 such and evil design. Perhaps they were spoken in an ironical bantering 
 way, as ridiculing the apostles' pretensions, and mocking them, as when 
 Christ's persecutors complimented him with <I>Hail, king of the 
 Jews;</I> and then justly might Paul be grieved, as any good man's 
 heart would be, to hear any good truth of God bawled out in the streets 
 in a canting jeering way. 

 2. He <I>commanded the evil spirit to come out of her. He turned</I>
 with a holy indignation, angry both at the flatteries and at the 
 reproaches of <I>the unclean spirit, and said, I command thee in the 
 name of Jesus Christ to come out of her;</I> and by this he will show 
 <I>that these men are the servants of the living God,</I> and are able 
 to prove themselves so, without her testimony: her silence shall 
 demonstrate it more than her speaking could do. Thus Paul shows <I>the 
 way of salvation</I> indeed, that it is by breaking <I>the power of 
 Satan, and chaining him up, that he may not deceive the world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:3">Rev. xx. 3</A>),

 and that this salvation is to be obtained <I>in the name of Jesus
 Christ</I> only, as in his name the devil was now cast out and by no 
 other. It was a great blessing to the country when Christ by a word 
 cast the devil out of those in whom he frightened people and molested 
 them <I>so that no man might pass by that way</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:28">Matt. viii. 28</A>);

 but it was a much greater kindness to the country when Paul now, in
 Christ's name, cast the devil out of one who deceived people and 
 imposed upon their credulity. Power went along with the word of Christ, 
 before which Satan could not stand, but was forced to quit his hold, 
 and in this case it was a strong hold: <I>He came out the same 
 hour.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The masters of the damsel that was dispossessed caused them to be 
 taken notice of, by bringing them before the magistrates for doing it, 
 and laying it to their charge as their crime. The preachers of the 
 gospel would never have had an opportunity of speaking to the 
 magistrates if they had not been brought before them as evil doers. 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That which provoked them was, that, the damsel being restored to 
 herself, <I>her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 See here what evil <I>the love of money is the root of!</I> If the 
 preaching of the gospel ruin the craft of the silversmiths

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:24"><I>ch.</I> xix. 24</A>),

 much more the craft of the soothsayers; and therefore here is a great
 outcry raised, when Satan's power to deceive is broken: the priests 
 hated the gospel because it turned men from the blind service of dumb 
 idols, and so the hope of their gains was gone. The power of Christ, 
 which appeared in dispossessing the woman, and the great kindness done 
 to her in delivering her out of Satan's hand, made no impression upon 
 them when they apprehended that they should hereby lose money.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The course they took with them was to incense the higher powers 
 against them, as men fit to be punished: <I>They caught them</I> as 
 they went along, and, with the utmost fury and violence, <I>dragged 
 them into the marketplace,</I> where public justice was administered. 
 
 (1.) They brought them <I>to the rulers,</I> their justices of peace, 
 to do by them as men taken into the hands of the law, the 
 <I>duumviri.</I> 

 (2.) From them they hurried them <I>to the magistrates,</I> the 
 pr&aelig;tors or governors of the city, <B><I>tois 
 strategois</I></B>--<I>the officers of the army,</I> so the word
 signifies; but it is taken in general for the judges or chief rulers: 
 to them they brought their complaint.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The charge they exhibited against them was that they were the 
 troublers of the land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 They take it for granted that these men are Jews, a nation at this time 
 as much an <I>abomination to the Romans</I> as they had long ago been 
 to the Egyptians. Piteous was the case of the apostles, when it was 
 turned to their reproach that they were Jews, and yet the Jews were 
 their most violent persecutors!

 (1.) The general charge against them is <I>that they troubled the 
 city,</I> sowed discord, and disturbed the public peace, and occasioned 
 riots and tumults, than which nothing could be more false and unjust, 
 as was Ahab's character of Elijah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:17">1 Kings xviii. 17</A>):

 <I>Art thou he that troubleth Israel?</I> If they troubled the city, it
 was but like the angel's troubling the water of Bethesda's pool, in 
 order to healing-shaking, in order to a happy settlement. Thus those 
 that rouse the sluggards are exclaimed against for troubling them.

 (2.) The proof of this charge is their teaching customs not proper to 
 be admitted by a Roman colony, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The Romans were always very jealous of innovations in religion. Right
 or wrong, they would adhere to that, how vain soever, which they had 
 received by tradition from their fathers. No foreign nor upstart deity 
 must be allowed, without the approbation of the senate; the gods of 
 their country must be their gods, true or false. This was one of the 
 laws of the twelve tables. <I>Hath a nation changed their gods?</I> It
 incensed them against the apostles that they taught a religion 
 destructive of polytheism and idolatry, and preached to them to turn 
 from those vanities. This the Romans could not bear: "If this grow upon 
 us, in a little while we shall lose our religion."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The magistrates, by their proceedings against them, caused them to 
 be taken notice of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By countenancing the persecution they raised the mob upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>The multitude rose up together against them,</I> and were ready to
 pull them to pieces. It has been the artifice of Satan to make God's 
 ministers and people odious to the commonalty, by representing them as 
 dangerous men, who aimed at the destruction of the constitution and the 
 changing of the customs, when really there has been no ground for such 
 an imputation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By going on to an execution they further represented them as the 
 vilest malefactors: <I>They rent off their clothes,</I> with rage and 
 fury, not having patience till they were taken off, in order to their 
 being scourged. This the apostle refers to when he speaks of <I>their 
 being treated at Philippi,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:2">1 Thess. ii. 2</A>.

 The magistrates commanded that they should be whipped as vagabonds, by
 the lictors or beadles who attended the pr&aelig;tors, and carried rods 
 with them for that purpose; this was one of those three times that Paul 
 was beaten with rods, according to the Roman usage, which was not under 
 the compassionate limitation of the number of stripes not to exceed 
 forty, which was provided by the Jewish law. It is here said that 
 <I>they laid many stripes upon them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 without counting how many, because they seemed vile unto them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:3">Deut. xxv. 3</A>.

 Now, one would think, this might have satiated their cruelty; if they
 must be whipped, surely they must be discharged. No, they are 
 imprisoned, and it is probable the present purpose was to try them for 
 their lives, and put them to death; else why should there be such care 
 taken to prevent their escape?

 (1.) The judges made their commitment very strict: They <I>charged the 
 jailer to keep them safely,</I> and have a very watchful eye upon them, 
 as if they were dangerous men, that either would venture to break 
 prison themselves or were in confederacy with those that would attempt 
 to rescue them. Thus they endeavoured to render them odious, that they 
 might justify themselves in the base usage they had given them.

 (2.) The jailer made their confinement very severe

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Having received such a charge,</I> though he might have kept them
 safely enough in the outer prison, yet <I>he thrust them into the inner 
 prison.</I> He was sensible that the magistrates had a great 
 indignation against these men, and were inclined to be severe with 
 them, and therefore he thought to ingratiate himself with them, by 
 exerting his power likewise against them to the uttermost. When
 magistrates are cruel, it is no wonder that the officers under them are 
 so too. <I>He put them into the inner prison,</I> the dungeon, into 
 which none were usually put but condemned malefactors, dark at 
 noon-day, damp and cold, dirty, it is likely, and every way offensive, 
 like that into which Jeremiah was let down

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+38:6">Jer. xxxviii. 6</A>);

 and, as if this were not enough, <I>he made their feet fast in the
 stocks.</I> Perhaps, having heard a report of the escape of <I>the 
 preachers of the gospel out of prison, when the doors were fast 
 barred</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:19,12:19"><I>ch.</I> v. 19; xii. 9</A>),

 he thought he would be wiser than other jailers had been, and therefore
 would effectually secure them by fastening them in the stocks; and they
 were not the first of God's messengers that had their feet in the
 stocks; Jeremiah was so treated, and publicly too, in <I>the high-gate
 of Benjamin</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:2">Jer. xx. 2</A>);

 Joseph had his <I>feet hurt with fetters,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:18">Ps. cv. 18</A>.

 Oh what hard usage have God's servants met with, as in the former days,
 so in the latter times! Witness the Book of Martyrs, martyrs in queen 
 Mary's time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
 God: and the prisoners heard them.
 &nbsp; 26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the
 foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the
 doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.
 &nbsp; 27 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
 seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would
 have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.
 &nbsp; 28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no
 harm: for we are all here.
 &nbsp; 29 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came
 trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,
 &nbsp; 30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be
 saved?
 &nbsp; 31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
 shalt be saved, and thy house.
 &nbsp; 32 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all
 that were in his house.
 &nbsp; 33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed
 <I>their</I> stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.
 &nbsp; 34 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat
 before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the designs of the persecutors of Paul and Silas baffled 
 and broken.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The persecutors designed to dishearten and discourage the preachers 
 of the gospel, and to make them sick of the cause and weary of their 
 work; but here we find them both hearty and heartened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were themselves hearty, wonderfully hearty; never were poor 
 prisoners so truly cheerful, nor so far from laying their hard usage to 
 heart. Let us consider what their case was. The pr&aelig;tors among the
 Romans had rods carried before them, and axes bound upon them, the 
 <I>fasces and secures.</I> Now they had felt the smart of the rods, 
 <I>the ploughers had ploughed upon their backs, and made long 
 furrows.</I> The many stripes they had laid upon them were very sore, 
 and one might have expected to hear them complaining of them, of the 
 rawness and soreness of their backs and shoulders. Yet this was not 
 all; they had reason to fear the axes next. Their master was first 
 scourged and then crucified; and they might expect the same. In the 
 mean time they were in the inner prison, their feet in the stocks, 
 which, some think, not only held them, but hurt them; and yet, <I>at 
 midnight,</I> when they should have been trying, if possible, to get a 
 little rest, they <I>prayed and sang praises to God.</I> 

 (1.) They prayed together, prayed to God to support them and comfort 
 them in their afflictions, to visit them, as he did Joseph in the 
 prison, and to be with them,--prayed that their consolations in Christ
 might abound, as their afflictions for him did,--prayed that even their
 bonds and stripes might turn to the furtherance of the gospel,--prayed
 for their persecutors, that God would forgive them and turn their 
 hearts. This was not at an hour of prayer, but at midnight; it was not 
 in a house of prayer, but in a dungeon; yet it was seasonable to pray, 
 and the prayer was acceptable. As in the dark, so out of the depths, we 
 may cry unto God. No place, no time, amiss for prayer, if the heart be 
 lifted up to God. Those that are companions in suffering should join in 
 prayer. <I>Is any afflicted? Let him pray.</I> No trouble, how
 grievous soever, should indispose us for prayer.

 (2.) <I>They sang praises to God.</I> They praised God; for we must 
 <I>in every thing give thanks.</I> We never want matter for praise, if 
 we do not want a heart. And what should put the heart of a child of God 
 out of tune for this duty if a dungeon and a pair of stocks will not do 
 it? They praised God that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for 
 his name, and that they were so wonderfully supported and borne up 
 under their sufferings, and felt divine consolations so sweet, so 
 strong, in their souls. Nay, <I>they not only praised God, but they 
 sang praises to him,</I> in some psalm, or hymn, or spiritual song, 
 either one of David's, or some modern composition, or one of their own, 
 as <I>the Spirit gave them utterance.</I> As our rule is that the 
 afflicted should pray, and therefore, being in affliction, they prayed; 
 so our rule is that the merry should sing psalms

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:13">James v. 13</A>),

 and therefore, being merry in their affliction, <I>merry after a godly
 sort, they sang psalms.</I> This proves that the singing of psalms is a 
 gospel ordinance, and ought to be used by all good Christians; and that 
 it is instituted, not only for the expressing of their joys in a day of 
 triumph, but for the balancing and relieving of their sorrows in a day 
 of trouble. It was at midnight that they sang psalms, according to the 
 example of the sweet psalmist of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:62">Ps. cxix. 62</A>):

 <I>At midnight will I rise to give thanks unto thee.</I>

 (3.) Notice is here taken of the circumstance that <I>the prisoners
 heard them.</I> If the prisoners did not hear them pray, yet <I>they
 heard them sing praises.</I> 

 [1.] It intimates how hearty they were in singing praises to God; they 
 sang so loud that, though they were in the dungeon, they were heard all 
 the prison over; nay, so loud that they woke the prisoners: for we may 
 suppose, being at midnight, they were all asleep. We should sing psalms 
 with all our heart. The saints are called upon to sing aloud upon their 
 beds,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+149:5">Ps. cxlix. 5</A>.

 But gospel grace carries the matter further, and gives us an example of
 those that sang aloud in the prison, in the stocks. 

 [2.] Though they knew the prisoners would hear them, yet they sang 
 aloud, as those that were not ashamed of their Master, nor of his 
 service. Shall those that would sing psalms in their families plead, in 
 excuse for their omission of the duty, that they are afraid their 
 neighbours should hear them, when those that sing profane songs roar 
 them our, and care not who hears them? 

 [3.] The prisoners were made to hear the prison-songs of Paul and 
 Silas, that they might be prepared for the miraculous favour shown to 
 them all for the sake of Paul and Silas, when <I>the prison-doors were 
 thrown open.</I> By this extraordinary comfort with which they were 
 filled it was published that he whom they preached was <I>the 
 consolation of Israel.</I> Let the prisoners that mean to oppose him 
 hear and tremble before him; let those that are faithful to him hear 
 and triumph, and take of the comfort that is spoken to the prisoners of 
 hope, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:12">Zech. ix. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God heartened them wonderfully by his signal appearances for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 (1.) There was immediately a great earthquake; how far it extended we
 are not told, but it was such a violent shock in this place <I>that the 
 very foundations of the prison were shaken.</I> While the prisoners 
 were hearkening to the midnight devotions of Paul and Silas, and 
 perhaps laughing at them and making a jest of them, this earthquake 
 would strike a terror upon them, and convince them that those men were 
 the favourites of Heaven, and such as God owned. We had <I>the house of 
 prayer shaken,</I> in answer to prayer, and as a token of God's 
 acceptance of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:31"><I>ch.</I> iv. 31</A>.

 Here <I>the prison shaken.</I> The Lord was in these earthquakes, to
 show his resentment of the indignities done to his servants, to testify 
 to those whose confidence is in the earth the weakness and instability 
 of that which they confide, and to teach people <I>that, though the 
 earth be moved, yet they need not fear.</I> 

 (2.) The prison-doors were thrown open, and the prisoners' fetters were 
 knocked off: <I>Every man's bands were loosed.</I> Perhaps the 
 prisoners, when they heard Paul and Silas pray and sing psalms, admired 
 them, and spoke honourably of them, and said what the damsel had said 
 of them, Surely, <I>these men are the servants of the living God.</I> 
 To recompense them for, and confirm them in, their good opinion of 
 them, they share in the miracle, and have <I>their bands loosed;</I> as 
 afterwards God gave to Paul all <I>those that were in the ship with 
 him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:24"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 24</A>),

 so now he gave him all those that were in the prison with him. God
 hereby signified to these prisoners, as Grotius observes, that the 
 apostles, in preaching the gospel, were public blessings to mankind, as 
 they <I>proclaimed liberty to the captives, and the opening of the 
 prison-doors to those that were bound,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1">Isa. lxi. 1</A>.

 <I>Et per eos solvi animorum vincula--and as by them the bonds of souls
 were unloosed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The persecutors designed to stop the progress of the gospel, that 
 no more might embrace it; thus they hoped to ruin the meeting by the 
 river side, that no more hearts should be opened there; but here we 
 find converts made in the prison, that house turned into a meeting, the 
 trophies of the gospel's victories erected there, and the jailer, their 
 own servant, become a servant of Christ. It is probable that some of 
 the prisoners, if not all, were converted; surely the miracle wrought 
 on their bodies, in loosing their bands, was wrought on their souls 
 too. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:8-10,Ps+107:14,15">Job xxxvi. 8-10; Ps. cvii. 14, 15</A>.

 But it is only the conversion of the jailer that is recorded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He is afraid he shall lose his life, and Paul makes him easy as to 
 this care, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.

 (1.) He <I>awoke out of his sleep.</I> It is probable that the shock of 
 the earthquake woke him, and the opening of the prison-doors, and the 
 prisoners' expressions of joy and amazement, when in the dark they 
 found their bands loosed, and called to tell one another what they 
 felt: this was enough to awaken the jailer, whose place required that 
 he should not be hard to wake. This waking him out of his sleep 
 signified the awakening of his conscience out of its spiritual slumber. 
 The call of the gospel is, <I>Awake, thou that sleepest</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:14">Eph. v. 14</A>),
 
 like that of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:6">Jonah, i. 6</A>.

 (2.) He saw the prison-doors open, and supposed, as well he might, that
 the prisoners had fled; and then what would become of him? He knew the 
 Roman law in that case, and it was executed not long ago upon the 
 keepers out of whose hands Peter escaped,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:19"><I>ch.</I> xii. 19</A>.

 It was according to that of the prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:39,42">1 Kings xx. 39, 42</A>,

 <I>Keep this man; if he be missing, thy life shall go for his life.</I>
 The Roman lawyers after this, in their readings upon the law, <I>De 
 custodia reorum--The custody of criminals</I> (which appoints that the
 keeper should undergo the same punishment that should have been 
 inflicted on the prisoner if he let him escape), take care to except an 
 escape by miracle. 

 (3.) In his fright <I>he drew his sword,</I> and was going <I>to kill 
 himself,</I> to prevent a more terrible death, and expected one, a 
 pompous ignominious death, which he knew he was liable to for letting 
 his prisoners escape and not looking better to them; and the 
 extraordinarily strict charge which the magistrates gave him concerning 
 Paul and Silas made him conclude they would be very severe upon him if 
 they were gone. The philosophers generally allowed self-murder. Seneca 
 prescribes it as the last remedy which those that are in distress may 
 have recourse to. The Stoics, notwithstanding their pretended conquest 
 of the passions, yielded thus far to them. And the Epicureans, who 
 indulged the pleasures of sense, to avoid its pains chose rather to put 
 an end to it. This jailer thought there was no harm in anticipating his 
 own death; but Christianity proves itself to be of God by this, that it 
 keeps us to the law of our creation--revives, enforces, and establishes
 it, obliges us to be just to our own lives, and teaches us cheerfully 
 to resign them to our graces, but courageously to hold them out against 
 our corruptions.

 (4.) Paul stopped him from his proceeding against himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 He <I>cried with a loud voice,</I> not only to make him hear, but to
 make him heed, <I>saying, Do not practise any evil to thyself; Do 
 thyself no harm.</I> All the cautions of the word of God against sin, 
 and all appearances of it and approaches to it, have this tendency, 
 "<I>Do thyself no harm.</I> Man, woman, do not wrong thyself, nor ruin 
 thyself; hurt not thyself, and then none else can hurt thee; do not 
 sin, for nothing else can hurt thee." Even as to the body, we are 
 cautioned against those sins which do harm to it, and are taught to 
 <I>hate our own flesh, but to nourish and cherish it.</I> The jailer 
 needs not fear being called to an account for the escape of his 
 prisoners, for <I>they are all here.</I> It was strange that some of 
 them did not slip away, when the prison-doors were opened, and they 
 were loosed from their bands; but their amazement held them fast, and, 
 being sensible it was by the prayers of Paul and Silas that they were 
 loosed, they would not stir unless they stirred; and God showed his 
 power in binding their spirits, as much as in loosing their feet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is afraid he shall lose his soul, and Paul makes him easy as to 
 this care too. One concern leads him to another, and a much greater; 
 and, being hindered from hastening himself out of this world, he begins 
 to think, if he had pursued his intention, whither death would have 
 brought him, and what would have become of him on the other side 
 death--a very proper thought for such as have been snatched as a brand
 out of the fire, when there was but a step between them and death. 
 Perhaps the heinousness of the sin he was running into helped to alarm 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Whatever was the cause, he was put into a great consternation. The 
 Spirit of God, that was sen to convince, in order to his being a 
 Comforter, struck a terror upon him, and startled him. Whether he took 
 care to shut the prison-doors again we are not told. Perhaps he forgot 
 this as the woman of Samaria, when Christ had impressed convictions on 
 her conscience, <I>left her water-pot</I> and forgot her errand to the 
 well; for <I>he called for a light</I> with all speed, and <I>sprang 
 in</I> to the inner prison, <I>and came trembling to Paul and 
 Silas.</I> Those that have sin set in order before them, and are made 
 to know their abominations, cannot but tremble at the apprehension of 
 their misery and danger. This jailer, when he was thus made to tremble, 
 could not apply to a more proper person than to Paul, for it had once 
 been his own case; he had been once a persecutor of good men, as this 
 jailer was--had cast them into prison, as he kept them--and when, like
 him, he was made sensible of it, <I>he trembled, and was 
 astonished;</I> and therefore he was able to speak the more feelingly 
 to the jailer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In this consternation, he applied to Paul and Silas for relief. 
 Observe, 

 [1.] How reverent and respectful his address to them is: <I>He called 
 for a light,</I> because they were in the dark, and that they might see 
 what a fright he was in; <I>he fell down before them,</I> as one amazed 
 at the badness of his own condition, and ready to sink under the load 
 of his terror because of it; he fell down before them, as one that had 
 upon his spirit an awe of them, and of the image of God upon them, and 
 of their commission from God. It is probable that he had heard what the 
 damsel said of them, that they were <I>the servants of the living God, 
 who showed to them the way of salvation,</I> and as such he thus 
 expressed his veneration for them. He fell down before them, to beg 
 their pardon, as a penitent, for the indignities he had done them, and 
 to beg their advice, as a supplicant, what he should do. He gave them
 a title of respect, <I>Sirs,</I> <B><I>kyrioi</I></B>--<I>lords,
 masters;</I> just now it was, <I>Rogues</I> and <I>villains,</I> and he 
 was their master; but now, <I>Sirs, lords,</I> and they are his 
 masters. Converting grace changes people's language of and to good 
 people and good ministers; and, to such as are thoroughly convinced of 
 sin, the very feet of those that bring tidings of Christ are beautiful; 
 yea, though they are disgracefully fastened in the stocks. 

 [2.] How serious his enquiry is: <I>What must I do to be saved? 
 First,</I> His salvation is now his great concern, and lies nearest his 
 heart, which before was the furthest thing from his thoughts. Not, What 
 shall I do to be preferred, to be rich and great in the world? but, 
 <I>What shall I do to be saved? Secondly,</I> He does not enquire
 concerning others, what they must do; but concerning himself, "What 
 must I do?" It is his own precious soul that he is in care about: "Let 
 others do as they please; tell me what I must do, what course I must 
 take." <I>Thirdly,</I> He is convinced that something must be done, and 
 done by him too, in order to his salvation: that it is not a thing of 
 course, a thing that will do itself, but a thing about which we must 
 strive, wrestle, and take pains. He asks not, "What may be done for 
 me?" but, "What shall I do, that, being <I>now in fear and 
 trembling,</I> I may <I>work out my salvation?</I>" as Paul speaks in 
 his epistle to the church at Philippi, of which this jailer was, 
 perhaps with respect to his trembling enquiry here, intimating that he 
 must not only ask after salvation (as he had done), but <I>work out his 
 salvation with</I> a holy <I>trembling,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:12">Phil. ii. 12</A>.
 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> He is willing to do any thing: "Tell me what I must
 do, and I am here ready to do it. Sirs, put me into any way, if it be 
 but the right way, and a sure way; though narrow, and thorny, and 
 uphill, yet I will walk in it." Note, Those who are thoroughly 
 convinced of sin, and truly concerned about their salvation, will 
 surrender at discretion to Jesus Christ, will give him a blank to write 
 what he pleases, will be glad to have Christ upon his own terms, Christ 
 upon any terms. <I>Fifthly,</I> He is inquisitive what he should do, is 
 desirous to know what he should do, and asks those that were likely to 
 tell him. <I>If you will enquire, enquire ye,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:12">Isa. xxi. 12</A>.

 Those that set their faces Zionward must ask the way thither, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:5">Jer. l. 5</A>.

 We cannot know it of ourselves, but God has made it known to us by his
 word, has appointed his ministers to assist us in consulting the 
 scriptures, and has promised <I>to give his Holy Spirit to those that 
 ask him,</I> to be their guide in the way of salvation. <I>Sixthly,</I> 
 He <I>brought them out,</I> to put this question to them, that their 
 answer might not be by duress or compulsion, but that they might 
 prescribe to him, though he was their keeper, with the same liberty as 
 they did to others. He brings them out of the dungeon, in hopes they 
 will bring him out of a much worse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They very readily directed him what he must do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 They were always ready to answer such enquiries; though they are cold, 
 and sore, and sleepy, they do not adjourn this cause to a more 
 convenient time and place, do not bid him come to them the next sabbath 
 at their meeting-place by the river side, and they will tell him, but 
 they strike while the iron is hot, take him now when he is in a good 
 mind, lest the conviction should wear off. Now that God begins to work, 
 it is time for them to set in as <I>workers together with God.</I> They 
 do not upbraid him with his rude and ill carriage towards them, and his 
 going beyond his warrant; all this is forgiven and forgotten, and they 
 are as glad to show him the way to heaven as the best friend they have.
 They did not triumph over him, though he trembled; they gave him the 
 same directions they did to others, <I>Believe in the Lord Jesus 
 Christ.</I> One would think they should have said, "Repent of thy 
 abusing us, in the first place." No, that is overlooked and easily 
 passed by, if he will but believe in Christ. This is an example to 
 ministers to encourage penitents, to meet those that are coming to 
 Christ and take them by the hand, not to be hard upon any for 
 unkindness done to them, but to seek Christ's honour more than their 
 own. Here is the sum of the whole gospel, the covenant of grace in a 
 few words: <I>Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be 
 saved, and thy house.</I> Here is, 

 [1.] The happiness promised: "<I>Thou shalt be saved;</I> not only 
 rescued from eternal ruin, but brought to eternal life and blessedness. 
 Though thou art a <I>poor man,</I> an under-jailer or turnkey, mean and 
 of low condition in the world, yet this shall be no bar to thy 
 salvation. Though a great sinner, though a persecutor, yet thy heinous 
 transgressions shall be all forgiven through the merits of Christ; and 
 thy hard embittered heart shall be softened and sweetened by the grace 
 of Christ, and thus thou shalt neither die for thy crime nor die of thy 
 disease." 

 [2.] The condition required: <I>Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.</I> 
 We must admit the record that God hath given in his gospel concerning 
 his Son, and assent to it as faithful, and well <I>worthy of all 
 acceptation.</I> We must approve the method God has taken of 
 reconciling the world to himself by a Mediator; and accept of Christ as 
 he is offered to us, and give up ourselves to be ruled and taught and 
 saved by him. This is the only way and a sure way to salvation. No 
 other way of salvation than by Christ, and no other way of our being 
 saved by Christ than by believing in him; and no danger of coming short 
 if we take this way, for it is the way that God has appointed, and he 
 is faithful that has promised. It is the gospel that is to be preached 
 to every creature, <I>He that believes shall be saved.</I> 

 [3.] The extension of this to his family: <I>Thou shalt be saved, and 
 thy house;</I> that is, "God will be in Christ a God to thee and to thy 
 seed, as he was to Abraham. Believe, and salvation shall <I>come to thy 
 house,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:9">Luke xix. 9</A>.

 Those of thy house that are infants shall be admitted into the visible
 church with thee, and thereby put into a fair way for salvation; those 
 that are grown up shall have the means of salvation brought to them, 
 and, be they ever so many, let them believe in Jesus Christ and they 
 shall be saved; they are all welcome to Christ upon the same 
 terms."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) They proceeded to instruct him and his family in the doctrine of 
 Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 They <I>spoke unto him the word of the Lord.</I> He was, for aught that
 appears, an utter stranger to Christ, and therefore it is requisite he
 should be told who this Jesus is, that he may believe in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:36">John ix. 36</A>.
 
 And, the substance of the matter lying in a little compass, they soon
 told him enough to make his being baptized a reasonable service. 
 Christ's ministers should have the word of the Lord so ready to them, 
 and so richly dwelling in them, as to be able to give instructions 
 offhand to any that desire to hear and receive them, for their 
 direction in the way of salvation. They spoke the word not only to him, 
 but to <I>all that were in his house.</I> Masters of families should 
 take care that all under their charge partake of the means of knowledge 
 and grace, and that the word of the Lord be spoken to them; for the 
 souls of the poorest servants are as precious as those of their 
 masters, and are bought with the same price.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The jailer and his family were immediately baptized, and thereby 
 took upon them the profession of Christianity, submitted to its laws, 
 and were admitted to its privileges, upon their declaring solemnly, as 
 the eunuch did, that they believed that <I>Jesus Christ is the Son of 
 God:</I> He was <I>baptized, he and all his, straightway.</I> Neither 
 he nor any of his family desired time to consider whether they should 
 come into baptismal bonds or no; nor did Paul and Silas desire time to 
 try their sincerity and to consider whether they should baptize them or 
 no. But the Spirit of grace worked such a strong faith in them, all on 
 a sudden, as superseded further debate; and Paul and Silas knew by the 
 Spirit that it was a work of God that was wrought in them: so that 
 there was no occasion for demur. This therefore will not justify such 
 precipitation in ordinary cases.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) The jailer was hereupon very respectful to Paul and Silas, as one 
 that knew not how to make amends for the injury he had done to them, 
 much less for the kindness he had received from them: He <I>took them 
 the same hour of the night,</I> would not let them lie a minute longer 
 in the inner prison; but, 

 [1.] He <I>washed their stripes,</I> to cool them, and abate the smart 
 of them; to clean them from the blood which the stripes had fetched. It 
 is probable that he bathed them with some healing liquor, as the good 
 Samaritan helped the wounded man by <I>pouring in oil and wine.</I> 
 
 [2.] He <I>brought them into his house,</I> bade them welcome to the 
 best room he had, and prepared his best bed for them. Now nothing was 
 thought good enough for them, as before nothing bad enough. 

 [3.] He <I>set meat before them,</I> such as his house would afford, 
 and they were welcome to it, by which he expressed the welcome which 
 his soul gave to the gospel. They had spoken to him the word of the 
 Lord, had broken the bread of life to him and his family; and he, 
 having reaped so plentifully of their spiritual things, thought it was 
 but reasonable that they should reap of his carnal things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:11">1 Cor. ix. 11</A>.
 
 What have we houses and tables for but as we have opportunity to serve
 God and his people with them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) The voice of rejoicing with that of salvation was heard in the 
 jailer's house; never was such a truly merry night kept there before: 
 <I>He rejoiced, believing in God, with all his house.</I> There was 
 none in his house that refused to be baptized, and so made a jar in the 
 harmony; but they were unanimous in embracing the gospel, which added 
 much to the joy. Or it may be read, <I>He, believing in God, rejoiced 
 all the house over;</I> <B><I>panoiki</I></B>--he went to every
 apartment, expressing his joy. Observe, 

 [1.] His believing in Christ is called believing <I>in God,</I> which 
 intimates that Christ is God, and that the design of the gospel is so 
 far from being to draw us from God (saying, <I>Go serve other gods,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:2">Deut. xiii. 2</A>)

 that it has a direct tendency to bring us to God. 

 [2.] His faith produced joy. Those that by faith have given up 
 themselves to God in Christ as theirs have a great deal of reason to 
 rejoice. The eunuch, when he was converted, <I>went on his way 
 rejoicing;</I> and here the jailer rejoiced. The conversion of the 
 nations is spoken of in the Old Testament as their rejoicing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:4,96:11">Ps. lxvii. 4; xcvi. 11</A>.

 For, <I>believing, we rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of
 glory.</I> Believing in Christ is rejoicing in Christ. 

 [3.] He signified his joy to all about him. Out of the abundance of the 
 joy in his heart, his mouth spoke to the glory of God, and their 
 encouragement who believed in God too. Those who have themselves tasted 
 the comforts of religion should do what they can to bring others to the 
 taste of them. One cheerful Christian should make many.</P>

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Orders sent for the discharge of Paul and Silas out of prison 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:35,36"><I>v.</I> 35, 36</A>.

 1. The magistrates that had so basely abused them the day before gave
 the orders; and their doing it so early, <I>as soon as it was day,</I> 
 intimates that either they were sensible the terrific earthquake they 
 felt at midnight was intended to plead the cause of their prisoners, or 
 their consciences had smitten them for what they had done and made them 
 very uneasy. While the persecuted were singing in the stocks, the 
 persecutors were full of tossings to and fro upon their beds, through 
 anguish of mind, complaining more of the lashes of their consciences 
 than the prisoners did of the lashes on their backs, and more in haste 
 to give them a discharge than they were to petition for one. Now God 
 caused his servants to be <I>pitied of those that had carried them 
 captives,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:46">Ps. cvi. 46</A>.

 The magistrates sent <I>sergeants,</I>
 <B><I>rabdouchous</I></B>--<I>those that had the rods,</I> the vergers,
 the tipstaves, the beadles, those that had been employed in beating 
 them, that they might go and ask them forgiveness. The order was,
 <I>Let those men go.</I> It is probable that they designed further 
 mischief to them, but God turned their hearts, and, as he had made their 
 wrath hitherto to praise him, so the remainder thereof he did restrain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:10">Ps. lxxvi. 10</A>.
 
 2. The jailer brought them the news

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>The magistrates have sent to let you go.</I> Some think the jailer
 had betimes transmitted an account to the magistrates of what had
 passed in his house that night, and so had obtained this order for the
 discharge of his prisoners: <I>Now therefore depart.</I> Not that he
 was desirous to part with them as his guests, but as his prisoners;
 they shall still be welcome to his house, but he is glad they are at
 liberty from his stocks. God could by his grace as easily have
 converted the magistrates as the jailer, and have brought them to faith
 and baptism; but God hath <I>chosen the poor of this world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:5">James ii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Paul's insisting upon the breach of privilege which the magistrates 
 had been guilty of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Paul said to the sergeants, "<I>They have beaten us openly, 
 uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison</I> against all 
 law and justice, and <I>now do they thrust us out privily,</I> and 
 think to make us amends with this for the injury done us? <I>Nay, 
 verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us our,</I> and own that 
 they have done us wrong." It is probable that the magistrates had some 
 intimation that they were Romans, and were made sensible that their 
 fury had carried them further than the law would bear them out; and 
 that this was the reason why they gave orders for their discharge. Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Paul did not plead this before he was beaten, though it is probable 
 that it might have prevented it, lest he should seem to be afraid of 
 suffering for the truth which he had preached. Tully, in one of his 
 orations, against Verres, tells of one Ganius, who was ordered by 
 Verres to be beaten in Sicily, that all the while he was under the lash 
 he cried out nothing but <I>Civis Romanus sum--I am a citizen of
 Rome;</I> Paul did not do so; he had nobler things than this to comfort 
 himself with in his affliction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He did plead it afterwards, to put an honour upon his sufferings and 
 upon the cause he suffered for, to let the world know that the 
 preachers of the gospel were not such despicable men as they were 
 commonly looked upon to be, and that they merited better treatment. He 
 did it likewise to mollify the magistrates towards the Christians at 
 Philippi, and to gain better treatment for them, and beget in the 
 people a better opinion of the Christian religion, when they saw that 
 Paul had a fair advantage against their magistrates, might have brought 
 his action against them and had them called to an account for what they 
 had done, and yet did not take the advantage, which was very much to 
 the honour of that worthy name by which he was called. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Paul lets them know how many ways they had run themselves into a 
 premunire, and that he had law enough to know it. 

 [1.] They had <I>beaten</I> those that were Romans; some think that 
 Silas was a Roman citizen as well as Paul; others that this does not 
 necessarily follow. Paul was a citizen, and Silas was his companion.
 Now both the <I>lex Procia</I> and the <I>lex Sempronia</I> did 
 expressly forbid <I>liberum corpus Romani civis, virgis aut aliis 
 verberibus c&aelig;di--the free body of a Roman citizen to be beaten
 with rods or otherwise.</I> Roman historians give instances of cities 
 that had their charters taken from them for indignities done to Roman 
 citizens; we shall afterwards find Paul making use of this plea,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:25,26"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 25, 26</A>.

 To tell them they had beaten those who were the messengers of Christ 
 and the favourites of Heaven would have had no influence upon them; but 
 to tell them they have abused Roman citizens will put them into a 
 fright: so common is it for people to be more afraid of C&aelig;sar's 
 wrath than of Christ's. He that affronts a Roman, a gentleman, a 
 nobleman, though ignorantly, and through mistake, thinks himself 
 concerned to cry <I>Peccavi--I have done wrong,</I> and make his
 submission; but he that persecutes a Christian because he belongs to 
 Christ stands to it, and thinks he may do it securely, though God hath 
 said, <I>He that toucheth them toucheth the apple of my eye,</I> and 
 Christ has warned us of the danger of <I>offending his little ones.</I> 
 
 [2.] They had beaten them <I>uncondemned; indicta causa--without a fair
 hearing,</I> had not calmly examined what was said against them, much 
 less enquired what they had to say for themselves. It is a universal 
 rule of justice, <I>Caus&acirc; cognit&acirc; possunt multi absolvi, 
 incognit&acirc; nemo condemnari potest--Many may be acquitted in
 consequence of having had a hearing, while without a hearing no one can 
 be condemned.</I> Christ's servants would not have been abused as they 
 have been if they and their cause might but have had an impartial 
 trial. 

 [3.] It was an aggravation of this that they had done it openly, which, 
 as it was so much the greater disgrace to the sufferers, so it was the 
 bolder defiance to justice and the law. 

 [4.] They had <I>cast them into prison,</I> without showing any cause 
 of their commitment, and in an arbitrary manner, by a verbal order. 
 
 [5.] They now <I>thrust them out privily;</I> they had not indeed the 
 impudence to stand by what they had done, but yet had not the honesty 
 to own themselves in a fault.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He insists upon it that they should make them an acknowledgment of 
 their error, and give them a public discharge, to make it the more 
 honourable, as they had done them a public disgrace, which made that 
 the more disgraceful: "<I>Let them come themselves, and fetch us 
 out,</I> and give a testimony to our innocency, and that we have done 
 nothing worthy of stripes or of bonds." It was not a point of honour 
 that Paul stood thus stiffly upon, but a point of justice, and not to 
 himself so much as to his cause: "Let them come and stop the clamours 
 of the people, by confessing that we are not the troublers of the 
 city."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The magistrates' submission, and the reversing of the judgment 
 given against Paul and Silas, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:38,39">
 <I>v.</I> 38, 39</A>.

 1. The magistrates were frightened when they were told (though it may 
 be they knew it before) that Paul was a Roman. They feared when they 
 heard it, lest some of his friends should inform the government of what 
 they had done, and they should fare the worse for it. The proceedings 
 of persecutors have often been illegal, even by the law of nations, and 
 often inhuman, against the law of nature, but always sinful, and 
 against God's law. 

 2. They <I>came and besought them</I> not to take advantage of the law
 against them, but to overlook the illegality of what they had done and 
 say no more of it: they <I>brought them out</I> of the prison, owning 
 that they were wrongfully put into it, and desired them that they would 
 peaceably and quietly <I>depart out of the city.</I> Thus Pharaoh and 
 his servants, who had set God and Moses at defiance, came to Moses, and 
 <I>bowed down themselves to him, saying, Get thee out,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:8">Exod. xi. 8</A>.

 God can make the enemies of his people ashamed of their envy and enmity
 to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:11">Isa. xxvi. 11</A>.

 Jerusalem is sometimes made a burdensome stone to those that heave at
 it, which they would gladly get clear of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:3">Zech. xii. 3</A>.

 Yet, if the repentance of these magistrates had been sincere, they
 would not have desired them to depart out of their city (as the 
 Gadarenes desired to be rid of Christ), but would have courted their 
 stay, and begged of them to continue in their city, to show them the 
 way of salvation. But many are convinced that Christianity is not to be 
 persecuted who yet are not convinced that it ought to be embraced, or 
 at least are not persuaded to embrace it. They are compelled to do 
 honour to Christ and his servants, <I>to worship before their feet, and 
 to know that he has loved them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>),

 and yet do not go so far as to have benefit by Christ, or to come in
 for a share in his love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The departure of Paul and Silas from Philippi, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 They went out of the prison when they were legally discharged, and not
 till then, though they were illegally committed, and then, 

 1. They took leave of their friends: they <I>went to the house of
 Lydia,</I> where probably the disciples had met to pray for them, and
 there they <I>saw the brethren,</I> or visited them at their respective
 habitations (which was soon done, they were so few); and they
 <I>comforted them,</I> by telling them (saith an ancient Greek
 commentary) what God had done for them, and how he had owned them in
 the prison. They encouraged them to keep close to Christ, and hold fast
 the profession of their faith, whatever difficulties they might meet
 with, assuring them that all would then end well, everlastingly well.
 Young converts should have a great deal said to them to comfort them,
 for <I>the joy of the Lord will be</I> very much <I>their strength.</I>
 
 2. They quitted the town: <I>They departed.</I> I wonder they should do 
 so; for, now that they had had such an honourable discharge from their 
 imprisonment, surely they might have gone on at least for some time in 
 their work without danger; but I suppose they went away upon that 
 principle of their Master's

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:38">Mark i. 38</A>).

 <I>Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also, for
 therefore came I forth.</I> Paul and Silas had an extraordinary call to 
 Philippi; and yet, when they have come thither, they see little of the 
 fruit of their labours, and are soon driven thence. Yet they did not
 come in vain. Though the beginnings here were <I>small, the latter end 
 greatly increased;</I> now they laid the foundation of a church at 
 Philippi, which became very eminent, had its bishops and deacons, and 
 people that were more generous to Paul than any other church, as 
 appears by his epistle to the Philippians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:1,4:25"><I>ch.</I> i. 1; iv. 25</A>.

 Let not ministers be discouraged, though they see not the fruit of
 their labours presently; the seed sown seems to be lost under the 
 clods, but it shall come up again in a plentiful harvest in due 
 time.</P>
