 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The close of the foregoing chapter left Paul in the high priest's
 court, into which the chief captain (whether to his advantage or no I 
 know not) had removed his cause from the mob; and, if his enemies act 
 there against him with less noise, yet it is with more subtlety. Now 
 here we have, 

 I. Paul's protestation of his own integrity, and of a civil respect to
 the high priest, however he had upon a sudden spoken warmly to him, and 
 justly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. Paul's prudent contrivance to get himself clear of them, by setting
 the Pharisees and Sadducees at variance one with another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 III. The governor's seasonable interposal to rescue him out of their
 hands likewise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:10">ver. 10</A>.

 IV. Christ's more comfortable appearing to him, to animate him against
 those difficulties that lay before him, and to tell him what he must
 expect, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:11">ver. 11</A>.

 V. A bloody conspiracy of some desperate Jews to kill Paul, and their 
 drawing in the chief priests and the elders to be aiders and abettors 
 with them in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 VI. The discovery of this conspiracy to Paul, and by him to the chief
 captain, who perceived so much of their inveterate malice against Paul 
 that he had reason enough to believe the truth of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:16-22">ver. 16-22</A>.

 VII. The chief captain's care of Paul's safety, by which he prevented
 the execution of the design; he sent him away immediately under a 
 strong guard from Jerusalem to C&aelig;sarea, which was now the 
 residence of Felix, the Roman governor, and there he safely arrived,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men <I>and</I>
 brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until
 this day.
 &nbsp; 2 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him
 to smite him on the mouth.
 &nbsp; 3 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, <I>thou</I> whited
 wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest
 me to be smitten contrary to the law?
 &nbsp; 4 And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?
 &nbsp; 5 Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high
 priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler
 of thy people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Perhaps when Paul was brought, as he often was (<I>corpus cum 
 causa--the person and the cause together</I>), before heathen
 magistrates and councils, where he and his cause were slighted, because 
 not at all understood, he thought, if he were brought before the 
 sanhedrim at Jerusalem, he should be able to deal with them to some 
 good purpose, and yet we do not find that he works at all upon them. 
 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Paul's protestation of his own integrity. Whether the chief priest 
 put any question to him, or the chief captain made any representation 
 of his case to the court, we are not told; but Paul appeared here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. With a good courage. He was not at all put out of countenance upon 
 his being brought before such an august assembly, for which in his 
 youth he had conceived such a veneration; nor did he fear their calling 
 him to an account about the letters they gave him to Damascus, to 
 persecute the Christians there, though (for aught we know) this was the 
 first time he had ever seem them since; but <I>he earnestly beheld the 
 council.</I> When Stephen was brought before them, they thought to have 
 faced him down, but could not, such was his holy confidence; they 
 <I>looked stedfastly on him, and his face was as that of an angel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:15"><I>ch.</I> vi. 15</A>.

 Now that Paul was brought before them he thought to have faced them
 down, but could not, such was their wicked impudence. However, now was
 fulfilled in him what God promised to Ezekiel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:8,9"><I>ch.</I> iii. 8, 9</A>):

 <I>I have made thy face strong against their faces; fear them not,
 neither be dismayed at their looks.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. With a good conscience, and that gave him a good courage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He said, "<I>Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience 
 before God unto this day.</I> However I may be reproached, my heart 
 does not reproach me, but witnesses for me." 

 (1.) He had always been a man inclined to religion; he never was a man 
 that lived at large, but always put a difference between moral good and 
 evil; even in his unregenerate state, he was, <I>as touching the 
 righteousness that was in the law, blameless.</I> He was no unthinking 
 man, who never considered what he did, no designing man, who cared not 
 what he did, so he could but compass his own ends. 

 (2.) Even when he persecuted the church of God, he thought he ought to 
 do it, and that he did God service in it. Though his conscience was 
 misinformed, yet he acted according to the dictates of it. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:9"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 9</A>.

 (3.) He seems rather to speak of the time since his conversion, since
 he left the service of the high priest, and fell under their
 displeasure for so doing; he does not say, From my beginning until this
 day; but, "All the time in which you have looked upon me as a deserter,
 an apostate, and an enemy to your church, even <I>to this day,</I> I
 have <I>lived in all good conscience before God;</I> whatever you may
 think of me, I have in every thing approved myself to God, and lived
 honestly," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:18">Heb. xiii. 18</A>.

 He had aimed at nothing but to please God and do his duty, in those
 things for which they were so incensed against him; in all he had done 
 towards the setting up of the kingdom of Christ, and the setting of it 
 up among the Gentiles, he had acted conscientiously. See here the
 character of an honest man. 

 [1.] He sets God before him, and lives as in his sight, and under his 
 eyes, and with an eye to him. <I>Walk before me, and be thou
 upright.</I> 

 [2.] He makes conscience of what he says and does, and, though he may 
 be under some mistakes, yet, according to the best of his knowledge, he 
 abstains from that which is evil and cleaves to that which is good. 
 
 [3.] He is universally conscientious; and those that are not so are not 
 at all truly conscientious; is so in <I>all manner of conversation:</I> 
 "I have lived in all good conscience; have had my whole conversation 
 under the direction and dominion of conscience." 

 [4.] He continues so, and perseveres in it: "I have lived so <I>until 
 this day.</I>" Whatever changes pass over him, he is still the same, 
 strictly conscientious. And those who thus live in all good conscience
 before God may, like Paul here, <I>lift up their face without spot;</I> 
 and, if their hearts condemn them not, may have confidence both towards 
 God and man, as Job had when he <I>still held fast his integrity,</I> 
 and Paul himself, whose rejoicing was this, the testimony of his 
 conscience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The outrage of which Ananias the high priest was guilty: he 
 <I>commanded those that stood by,</I> the beadles that attended the 
 court, <I>to smite him on the mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 to give him a dash on the teeth, either with a hand or with a rod. Our 
 Lord Jesus was thus despitefully used in this court, by one of the 
 servants 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:22">John xviii. 22</A>),

 as was foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:1">Mic. v. 1</A>,

 <I>They shall smite the Judge of Israel upon the cheek.</I> But here 
 was an order of court for the doing of it, and, it is likely, it was 
 done. 

 1. The high priest was highly offended at Paul; some think, because he
 looked so boldly and earnestly at the council, as if he would face them 
 down; others because he did not address himself particularly to him as 
 president, with some title of honour and respect, but spoke freely and 
 familiarly to them all, as men and brethren. His protestation of his 
 integrity was provocation enough to one who was resolved to run him 
 down and make him odious. When he could charge him with no crime, he 
 thought it was crime enough that he asserted his own innocency. 

 2. In his rage he ordered him to be smitten, so to put disgrace upon
 him, and to be smitten on the mouth, as having offended with his lips, 
 and in token of his enjoining him silence. This brutish and barbarous 
 method he had recourse to when he <I>could not answer the wisdom and 
 spirit wherewith he spoke.</I> Thus Zedekiah smote Micaiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:24">1 Kings xxii. 24</A>),
 
 and Pashur smote Jeremiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:2">Jer. xx. 2</A>),

 when they spoke in the name of the Lord. If therefore we see such
 indignities done to good men, nay, if they be done to us for well doing 
 and well saying, we must not think it strange; Christ will give those 
 the <I>kisses of his mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:2">Cant. i. 2</A>)

 who for his sake receive blows on the mouth. And though it may be 
 expected that, as Solomon says, <I>every man should kiss his lips that 
 giveth a right answer</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:26">Prov. xxiv. 26</A>),

 yet we often see the contrary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The denunciation of the wrath of God against the high priest for 
 this <I>wickedness in the place of judgment</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16">Eccl. iii. 16</A>):

 it agrees with what follows there,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>,

 with which Solomon comforted himself (<I>I said in my heart, God shall 
 judge the righteous and the wicked): God shall smite thee, thou whited 
 wall,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Paul did not speak this in any sinful heat or passion, but in a holy 
 zeal against the high priest's abuse of his power, and with something 
 of a prophetic spirit, not at all with a spirit of revenge. 

 1. He gives him his due character: <I>Thou whited wall;</I> that is,
 thou hypocrite--a mud-wall, trash and dirt and rubbish underneath, but
 plastered over, or white-washed. It is the same comparison in effect
 with that of Christ, when he compares the Pharisees to whited
 sepulchres, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:7">Matt. xxiii. 27</A>.

 Those that daubed with untempered mortar failed not to daub themselves
 over with something that made them look not only clean, but gay. 

 2. He reads him his just doom: "<I>God shall smite thee,</I> shall
 bring upon thee his sore judgments, especially spiritual judgments." 
 Grotius thinks this was fulfilled soon after, in his removal from the 
 office of the high priest, either by death or deprivation, for he finds 
 another in that office a little while after this; probably he was 
 smitten by some sudden stroke of divine vengeance. Jeroboam's hand was 
 withered when it was stretched out against a prophet. 

 3. He assigns a good reason for that doom: "For <I>sittest thou</I>
 there as president in the supreme judicature of the church, pretending 
 <I>to judge me after the law,</I> to convict and condemn me by the law, 
 and yet <I>commandest me to be smitten</I> before any crime is proved 
 upon me, which is <I>contrary to the law?</I>" No man must be beaten 
 unless he be <I>worthy to be beaten,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:2">Deut. xxv. 2</A>.

 It is against all law, human and divine, natural and positive, to
 hinder a man from making his defense, and to condemn him unheard. When 
 Paul was beaten by the rabble, he could say, <I>Father, forgive them, 
 they know not what they do;</I> but it is inexcusable in a high priest 
 that is appointed to judge according to the law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The offence which was taken at this bold word of Paul's 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 <I>Those that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</I> It is 
 a probable conjecture that those who blamed Paul for what he said were 
 believing Jews, who were zealous for the law, and consequently for the 
 honour of the high priest, and therefore took it ill that Paul should 
 thus reflect upon him, and checked him for it. See here then, 

 1. What a hard game Paul had to play, when his enemies were abusive to
 him, and his friends were so far from standing by him, and appearing 
 for him, that they were ready to find fault with his management. 

 2. How apt even the disciples of Christ themselves are to overvalue
 outward pomp and power. As because the temple had been God's temple, 
 and a magnificent structure, there were those who followed Christ that 
 could not bear to have any thing said that threatened the destruction 
 of it; so because the high priest had been God's high priest, and was a 
 man that made a figure, though he was an inveterate enemy to 
 Christianity, yet these were disgusted at Paul for giving him his 
 due.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The excuse that Paul made for what he had said, because he found it 
 was a stumbling-block to his weak brethren, and might prejudice them 
 against him in other things. These Jewish Christians, though weak, yet 
 were brethren, so he calls them here, and, in consideration of that, is 
 almost ready to recall his words; for <I>who is offended,</I> saith he, 
 <I>and I burn not?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:29">2 Cor. xi. 29</A>.

 His fixed resolution was rather to abridge himself in the use of his
 Christian liberty than give offence to a weak brother; rather than do 
 this, he will <I>eat no flesh while the world stands,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:13">1 Cor. viii. 13</A>.

 And so here though he had taken the liberty to tell the high priest his
 own, yet, when he found it gave offence, he cried <I>Peccavi--I have
 done wrong.</I> He wished he had not done it; and though he did not beg 
 the high priest's pardon, nor excuse it to him, yet he begs their 
 pardon who took offence at it, because this was not a time to inform 
 them better, nor to say what he could say to justify himself.

 1. He excuses it with this, that he did not consider when he said it to
 whom he spoke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest</I>--<B><I>ouk
 edein.</I></B> "I did not just then think of the dignity of his place, 
 or else I would have spoken more respectfully to him." I see not how we 
 can with any probability think that Paul did not know him to be the 
 high priest, for Paul had been seven days in the temple at the time of 
 the feast, where he could not miss of seeing the high priest; and his 
 telling him that <I>he sat to judge him after the law</I> shows that he 
 knew who he was; but, says he, I did not consider it. Dr. Whitby puts 
 this sense upon it, that the prophetic impulse that was upon him, and 
 inwardly moved him to say what he did, did not permit him to notice 
 that it was the high priest, lest this law might have restrained him 
 from complying with that impulse; but the Jews acknowledged that 
 prophets might use a liberty in speaking of rulers which others might 
 not, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:10,23">Isa. i. 10, 23</A>.

 Or (as he quotes the sense of Grotius and Lightfoot) Paul does not go
 about to excuse what he had said in the least, but rather to justify 
 it; "I own that God's high priest is not to be reviled, but I do not 
 own this Ananias to be high priest. He is a usurper; he came to the 
 office by bribery and corruption, and the Jewish rabbin say that he who 
 does so is neither a judge nor to be honoured as such." Yet, 

 2. He takes care that what he had said should not be drawn into a
 precedent, to the weakening of the obligation of that law in the least: 
 <I>For it is written,</I> and it remains a law in full force, <I>Thou 
 shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</I> It is for the 
 public good that the honour of magistracy should be supported, and not 
 suffer for the miscarriages of those who are entrusted with it, and 
 therefore that decorum be observed in speaking both of and to princes 
 and judges. Even in Job's time it was not thought fit to <I>say to a 
 king, Thou art wicked, or to princes, You are ungodly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:18">Job xxxiv. 18</A>.

 Even when we do well, and suffer for it, we must <I>take it
 patiently,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:20">1 Pet. ii. 20</A>.

 Not as if great men may not hear of their faults, and public grievances
 be complained of by proper persons and in a decent manner, but there 
 must be a particular tenderness for the honour and reputation of those 
 in authority more than of other people, because the law of God requires 
 a particular reverence to be paid to them, as God's vicegerents; and it 
 is of dangerous consequence to have those any way countenanced who 
 <I>despise dominions,</I> and <I>speak evil of dignities,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:8">Jude 8</A>.

 <I>Curse not the king, no not in thy thought,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and
 the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men <I>and</I>
 brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and
 resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
 &nbsp; 7 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the
 Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
 &nbsp; 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither
 angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
 &nbsp; 9 And there arose a great cry: and the scribes <I>that were</I> of
 the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in
 this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us
 not fight against God.
 &nbsp; 10 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain,
 fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them,
 commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from
 among them, and to bring <I>him</I> into the castle.
 &nbsp; 11 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be
 of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in
 Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Many are the troubles of the righteous, but</I> some way or other 
 <I>the Lord delivereth them out of them all.</I> Paul owned he had 
 experienced the truth of this in the persecutions he had undergone 
 among the Gentiles (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:11">2 Tim. iii. 11</A>):

 <I>Out of them all the Lord delivered me.</I> And now he finds that he 
 who has delivered does and will deliver. He that delivered him in the 
 foregoing chapter from the tumult of the people here delivers him from 
 that of the elders.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His own prudence and ingenuity stand him in some stead, and 
 contribute much to his escape. Paul's greatest honour, and that upon 
 which he most valued himself, was that he was a Christian, and an 
 apostle of Christ; and all his other honours he despised and made 
 nothing of, in comparison with this, <I>counting them but dung, that he 
 might win Christ;</I> and yet he had sometimes occasion to make use of 
 his other honours, and they did him service. His being a citizen of 
 Rome saved him in the foregoing chapter from his being scourged by the 
 chief captain as a vagabond, and here his being a Pharisee saved him 
 from being condemned by the sanhedrim, as an apostate from the faith 
 and worship of the God of Israel. It will consist very well with our 
 willingness to suffer for Christ to use all lawful methods, nay, and 
 arts too, both to prevent suffering and to extricate ourselves out of 
 it. The honest policy Paul used here for his own preservation was to 
 divide his judges, and to set them at variance one with another about 
 him; and, by incensing one part of them more against him, to engage the 
 contrary part for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great council was made up of Sadducees and Pharisees, and Paul 
 perceived it. He knew the characters of many of them ever since he 
 lived among them, and saw those among them whom he knew to be 
 Sadducees, and others whom he knew to be Pharisees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>One part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees,</I> and perhaps 
 nearly an equal part. Now these differed very much from one another, 
 and yet they ordinarily agreed well enough to do the business of the 
 council together. 

 (1.) The Pharisees were bigots, zealous for the ceremonies, not only 
 those which God had appointed, but those which were enjoined by the 
 tradition of the elders. They were great sticklers for the authority of 
 the church, and for enforcing obedience to its injunctions, which 
 occasioned many quarrels between them and our Lord Jesus; but at the 
 same time they were very orthodox in the faith of the Jewish church 
 concerning the world of spirits, the resurrection of the dead, and the 
 life of the world to come. 

 (2.) The Sadducees were deists--no friends to the scripture, or divine
 revelation. The books of Moses they admitted as containing a good 
 history and a good law, but had little regard to the other books of the 
 Old Testament; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:23">Matt. xxii. 23</A>.

 The account here given of these Sadducees is,

 [1.] That they <I>deny the resurrection;</I> not only the return of the
 body to life, but a future state of rewards and punishments. They had 
 neither hope of eternal happiness nor dread of eternal misery, nor 
 expectation of any thing on the other side death; and it was upon these 
 principles that they said, <I>It is in vain to serve God,</I> and 
 called the proud happy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:14,15">Mal. iii. 14, 15</A>.

 [2.] That they denied the existence of angels and spirits, and allowed
 of no being but matter. They thought that God himself was corporeal,
 and had parts and members as we have. When they read of angels in the 
 Old Testament, they supposed them to be messengers that God made and 
 sent on his errands as there was occasion, or that they were 
 impressions on the fancies of those they were sent to, and no real 
 existences--that they were this, or that, or any thing rather than what
 they were. And, as for the souls of men, they looked upon them to be 
 nothing else but the temperament of the humours of the body, or the 
 animal spirits, but denied their existence in a state of separation 
 from the body, and any difference between the soul of a man and of a 
 beast. These, no doubt, pretended to be free-thinkers, but really 
 thought as meanly, absurdly, and slavishly, as possible. It is strange 
 how men of such corrupt and wicked principles could come into office, 
 and have a place in the great sanhedrim; but many of them were of 
 quality and estate, and they complied with the public establishment, 
 and so got in and kept in. But they were generally stigmatized as 
 heretics, were ranked with the Epicureans, and were prayed against and 
 excluded from eternal life. The prayer which the modern Jews use 
 against Christians, Witsius thinks, was designed by Gamaliel, who made 
 it, against the Sadducees; and that they meant them in their usual 
 imprecation, <I>Let the name of the wicked rot.</I> But how degenerate 
 was the character and how miserable the state of the Jewish church, 
 when such profane men as these were among their rulers!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In this matter of difference between the Pharisees and Sadducees 
 Paul openly declared himself to be on the Pharisees' side against the 
 Sadducees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 He <I>cried out,</I> so as to be heard by all, "<I>I am a Pharisee,</I> 
 was bred a Pharisee, nay, I was born one, in effect, for I was the 
 <I>son of a Pharisee,</I> my father was one before me, and thus far I 
 am still a Pharisee that I <I>hope for the resurrection of the 
 dead,</I> and I may truly say that, if the matter were rightly 
 understood, it would be found that this is it for which I am now 
 <I>called in question.</I>" When Christ was upon earth the Pharisees 
 set themselves most against him, because he witnessed against their 
 traditions and corrupt glosses upon the law; but, after his ascension, 
 the Sadducees set themselves most against his apostles, because they 
 <I>preached through Jesus the resurrection of the dead,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:1,2"><I>ch.</I> iv. 1, 2</A>.

 And it is said
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:17"><I>ch.</I> v. 17</A>)

 that they were <I>the sect of the Sadducees</I> that were <I>filled
 with indignation</I> at them, because they preached that life and 
 immortality which is <I>brought to light by the gospel.</I> Now here, 
 
 (1.) Paul owns himself a Pharisee, so far as the Pharisees were in the 
 right. Though as Pharisaism was opposed to Christianity he set himself 
 against it, and against all its traditions that were set up in 
 competition with the law of God or in contradiction to the gospel of 
 Christ, yet, as it was opposed to Sadducism, he adhered to it. We must 
 never think the worse of any truth of God, nor be more shy of owning 
 it, for its being held by men otherwise corrupt. If the Pharisees will
 hope for the resurrection of the dead, Paul will go along with them in 
 that hope, and be one of them, whether they will or no. 

 (2.) He might truly say that being persecuted, as a Christian, this was 
 the thing he was called in question for. Perhaps he knew that the 
 Sadducees, though they had not such an interest in the common people as 
 the Pharisees had, yet had underhand incensed the mob against him, 
 under pretence of his having preached to the Gentiles, but really 
 because he had preached the hope of the resurrection. However, being 
 called in question for his being a Christian, he might truly say he was 
 called in question for the hope of the resurrection of the dead, as he 
 afterwards pleaded,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:15,26:6,7"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 15, 
 and <I>ch.</I> xxvi. 6, 7</A>.

 Though Paul preached against the traditions of the elders (as his
 Master had done), and therein opposed the Pharisees, yet he valued 
 himself more upon his preaching the resurrection of the dead, and a 
 future state, in which he concurred with the Pharisees.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. This occasioned a division in the council. It is probable that the 
 high priest sided with the Sadducees (as he had done 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:17"><I>ch.</I> v. 17</A>,

 and made it to appear by his rage at Paul,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 which alarmed the Pharisees so much the more; but so it was, there
 arose a <I>dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 for this word of Paul's made the Sadducees more warm and the Pharisees
 more cool in the prosecution of him; so that <I>the multitude was 
 divided;</I> <B><I>eschisthe</I></B>--<I>there was a schism,</I> a
 quarrel among them, and the edge of their zeal began to turn from Paul 
 against one another; nor could they go on to act against him when they 
 could not agree among themselves, or prosecute him for breaking the 
 unity of the church when there was so little among them of the unity of 
 the spirit. All the cry had been against Paul, but now there arose a
 great cry against one another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 So much did a fierce furious spirit prevail among all orders of the 
 Jews at this time that every thing was done with clamour and noise; and 
 in such a tumultuous manner were the great principles of their religion 
 stickled for, by which they received little service, for <I>the wrath 
 of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</I> Gainsayers may be 
 convinced by fair reasoning, but never by a great cry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The Pharisees hereupon (would one think it?) took Paul's part 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>They strove,</I> <B><I>diemachonto</I></B>--<I>They fought, saying,
 We find no evil in this man.</I> He had conducted himself decently and 
 reverently in the temple, and had attended the service of the church; 
 and, though it was but occasionally, yet it showed that he was not such 
 an enemy to it as he was said to be. He had spoken very handsomely in 
 his own defence, and given a good account of himself, and had now 
 declared himself orthodox in the great principles of religion, as well 
 as regular and conscientious in his conversation; and therefore they 
 cannot see that he has <I>done any thing worthy of death of bonds.</I> 
 Nay, they go further, "<I>If a spirit or an angel hath spoken to 
 him</I> concerning Jesus, and put him upon preaching as he does, though 
 we may not be so far satisfied as to give credit to him, yet we ought 
 to be cautioned not to oppose him, <I>lest we be found fighting against 
 God;</I>" as Gamaliel, who was himself a Pharisee, had argued,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:39"><I>ch.</I> v. 39</A>.

 Now here, 

 (1.) We may observe, to the honour of the gospel, that it was witnessed 
 to even by its adversaries, and confessions, not only of its innocency, 
 but of its excellency, were extorted sometimes by the power of truth 
 even from those that persecuted it. Pilate found no fault in Christ 
 though he put him to death, nor Festus in Paul though he detained him 
 in bonds; and the Pharisees here supposed it possible that Paul might 
 have a commission sent him for heaven by an angel to do what he did; 
 and yet it should seem, as elders, they after this joined with the high 
 priest in prosecuting him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:1"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 1</A>.

 They sinned against the knowledge which they not only had, but
 sometimes owned, as Christ had said of them, <I>They have both seen and 
 hated both me and my Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:24">John xv. 24</A>.
 
 Yet,

 (2.) We will hope that some of them at least did henceforward conceive
 a better opinion of Paul than they had had, and were favourable to him, 
 having had such a satisfactory account both of his conversation in all 
 good conscience and of his faith touching another world; and then it 
 must be observed to their honour that their zeal for the traditions of 
 the elders, which Paul had departed from, was so far swallowed up in a 
 zeal for the great and fundamental doctrines of religion, to which Paul 
 still adhered, that if he will heartily join with them against the 
 Sadducees, and adhere to the hope of the resurrection of the dead, they 
 will not think his shaking off the ceremonial law to be an evil in him, 
 but charitably hope that he walks according to the light God has given 
 him by some angel or spirit, and are so far from persecuting him that 
 they are ready to patronize and protect him. The persecuting Pharisees 
 of the church of Rome are not of this spirit: for let a man be ever so 
 sincere and zealous for all the articles of the Christian faith, yet, 
 if he lay not his neck under the yoke of their church's authority, they 
 find evil enough in him to persecute him unto the death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The chief captain's care and conduct stand him in more stead; for 
 when he has thrown this bone of contention between the Pharisees and 
 Sadducees (which set them together by the ears, and gained a fair 
 testimony from the Pharisees), yet he is never the nearer, but is in 
 danger of being pulled in pieces by them--the Pharisees pulling to have
 him set at liberty, and the Sadducees pulling to have him put to death, 
 or thrown to the people, like Daniel into the den of lions; so that the 
 chief captain is forced to come with his soldiers and rescue him, as he 
 had done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:32,22:24"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 32,
 and <I>ch.</I> xxii. 24</A>.

 1. See here Paul's danger. Between his friends and his enemies he had
 like to have been pulled to pieces, the one hugging him to death, the 
 other crushing him to death, such violences are those liable to that 
 are eminent, and that are become remarkable, as Paul was, who was by 
 some so much beloved and by others so much maligned. 

 2. His deliverance: <I>The chief captain ordered his soldiers to go
 down</I> from the upper wards, and <I>to take them by force from among 
 them,</I> out of that apartment in <I>the temple</I> where he had 
 ordered the council to meet, and <I>to bring him into the castle,</I> 
 or tower of Antonio; for he saw he could make nothing of them towards 
 the understanding of the merits of his cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Divine consolations stood him in most stead of all. The chief 
 captain had rescued him out of the hands of cruel men, but still he had 
 him in custody, and what might be the issue he could not tell. The 
 castle was indeed a protection to him, but withal it was a confinement; 
 and, as it was now his preservation from so great a death, it might be 
 his reservation for a greater. We do not find that any of the apostles 
 or elders at Jerusalem came to him; either they had not courage or they 
 had not admission. Perhaps, in the night following, Paul was full of 
 thoughts and cares what should become of him, and how his present 
 troubles might be turned to answer some good purpose. Then did the Lord 
 Jesus make him a kind visit, and, thought at midnight, yet a very 
 seasonable one 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The Lord stood by him,</I> came to his bed-side, though perhaps it 
 was but a bed of straw, to show him that he was all the day long with 
 him really as sure as he was in the night with him visibly. Note, 
 Whoever is against us, we need not fear if the Lord stand by us; if he 
 undertake our protection, we may set those that seek our ruin at 
 defiance. <I>The Lord is with those that uphold my soul,</I> and then 
 nothing can come amiss. 

 1. Christ bids him have a good heart upon it: <I>"Be of good cheer,
 Paul;</I> be not discouraged; let not what has happened sadden thee, 
 nor let what may yet be before thee frighten thee." Note, It is the 
 will of Christ that his servants who are faithful should be always 
 cheerful. Perhaps Paul, in the reflection, began to be jealous of 
 himself whether he had done well in what he said to the council the day 
 before; but Christ, by his word, satisfies him that God approved of his 
 conduct. Or, perhaps, it troubled him that his friends did not come to 
 him; but Christ's visit did itself speak, though he had not said, <I>Be 
 of good cheer, Paul.</I> 

 2. It is a strange argument which he makes use of to encourage him:
 <I>As thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness 
 also at Rome.</I> One would think this was but cold comfort: "As thou 
 hast undergone a great deal of trouble for me so thou must undergo a 
 great deal more;" and yet this was designed to encourage him; for 
 hereby he is given to understand,

 (1.) That he had been serving Christ as a witness for him in what he 
 had hitherto endured. It was for no fault that he was buffeted, and it 
 was not his former persecuting of the church that was now remembered 
 against him, however he might remember it against himself, but he was 
 still going on with his work. 

 (2.) That he had not yet finished his testimony, nor was, by his 
 imprisonment, laid aside as useless, but was only reserved for further 
 service. Nothing disheartened Paul so much as the thought of being
 taken off from doing service to Christ and good to souls: <I>Fear 
 not,</I> says Christ, <I>I have not done with thee,</I> 

 (3.) Paul seems to have had a particular fancy, and an innocent one, to 
 go to Rome, to preach the gospel there, though it was already preached, 
 and a church planted there; yet, being a citizen of Rome, he longed for 
 a journey thither, and had designed it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:21"><I>ch.</I> xix. 21</A>):

 <I>After I have been at Jerusalem, I must also see Rome.</I> And he had
 written to the Romans some time ago <I>that he longed to see them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:11">Rom. i. 11</A>.

 Now he was ready to conclude that this had broken his measures, and he
 should never see Rome; but even in that Christ tells him he should be 
 gratified, since he desired it for the honour of Christ and to do 
 good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together,
 and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would
 neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
 &nbsp; 13 And they were more than forty which had made this
 conspiracy.
 &nbsp; 14 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We
 have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat
 nothing until we have slain Paul.
 &nbsp; 15 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief
 captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye
 would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or
 ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
 &nbsp; 16 And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait,
 he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
 &nbsp; 17 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto <I>him,</I> and said,
 Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a
 certain thing to tell him.
 &nbsp; 18 So he took him, and brought <I>him</I> to the chief captain, and
 said, Paul the prisoner called me unto <I>him,</I> and prayed me to
 bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto
 thee.
 &nbsp; 19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went <I>with
 him</I> aside privately, and asked <I>him,</I> What is that thou hast to
 tell me?
 &nbsp; 20 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
 wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though
 they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.
 &nbsp; 21 But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for
 him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with
 an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have
 killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from
 thee.
 &nbsp; 22 So the chief captain <I>then</I> let the young man depart, and
 charged <I>him, See thou</I> tell no man that thou hast showed these
 things to me.
 &nbsp; 23 And he called unto <I>him</I> two centurions, saying, Make ready
 two hundred soldiers to go to C&aelig;sarea, and horsemen threescore
 and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the
 night;
 &nbsp; 24 And provide <I>them</I> beasts, that they may set Paul on, and
 bring <I>him</I> safe unto Felix the governor.
 &nbsp; 25 And he wrote a letter after this manner:
 &nbsp; 26 Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix
 <I>sendeth</I> greeting.
 &nbsp; 27 This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed
 of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having
 understood that he was a Roman.
 &nbsp; 28 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused
 him, I brought him forth into their council:
 &nbsp; 29 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law,
 but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of
 bonds.
 &nbsp; 30 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the
 man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his
 accusers also to say before thee what <I>they had</I> against him.
 Farewell.
 &nbsp; 31 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and
 brought <I>him</I> by night to Antipatris.
 &nbsp; 32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and
 returned to the castle:
 &nbsp; 33 Who, when they came to C&aelig;sarea, and delivered the epistle
 to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
 &nbsp; 34 And when the governor had read <I>the letter,</I> he asked of
 what province he was. And when he understood that <I>he was</I> of
 Cilicia;
 &nbsp; 35 I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also
 come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of a plot against the life of Paul; how it was 
 laid, how it was discovered, and how it was defeated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How this plot was laid. They found they could gain nothing by 
 popular tumult, or legal process, and therefore have a recourse to the 
 barbarous method of assassination; they will come upon him suddenly, 
 and stab him, if they can but get him within their reach. So restless 
 is their malice against this good man that, when one design fails, they 
 will turn another stone. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who they were that formed this conspiracy. They were <I>certain 
 Jews</I> that had the utmost degree of indignation against him because 
 he was the apostle of the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 <I>And they were more than forty</I> that were in the design, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 <I>Lord, how are they increased that trouble me!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When the conspiracy was formed: <I>When it was day. Satan had filled 
 their hearts</I> in the night to purpose it, and, as soon as it was 
 day, they got together to prosecute it; answering to the account which 
 the prophet gives of some who <I>work evil upon their beds, and when 
 the morning is light they practise it,</I> and are laid under a woe for 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:1">Mic. ii. 1</A>.

 In the night Christ appeared to Paul to protect him, and, when it was
 day, here were forty men appearing against him to destroy him; they 
 were not up so soon but Christ was up before them <I>God shall help 
 her, and that right early,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:5">Ps. xlvi. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What the conspiracy was. These men <I>banded together</I> in a 
 league, perhaps they called it a <I>holy</I> league; they engaged to 
 stand by one another, and every one, to his power, to be aiding and 
 assisting to murder Paul. It was strange that so many could so soon be 
 got together, and that in Jerusalem too, who were so perfectly lost to 
 all sense of humanity and honour as to engage in so bloody a design. 
 Well might the prophet's complaint be renewed concerning Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:21">Isa. i. 21</A>):

 <I>Righteousness has lodged in it, but now murderers.</I> What a 
 monstrous idea must these men have formed of Paul, before they could be 
 capable of forming such a monstrous design against him; they must be 
 made to believe that he was the worst of men, an enemy to God and 
 religion, and the curse and plague of his generation; when really his 
 character was the reverse of all this! What laws of truth and justice 
 so sacred, so strong which malice and bigotry will not break 
 through!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. How firm they made it, as they thought, that none of them might fly 
 off, upon conscience of the horror of the fact, at second thoughts: 
 <I>They bound themselves under an anathema,</I> imprecating the 
 heaviest curses upon themselves, their souls, bodies, and families, if 
 they did not kill Paul, and so quickly <I>that they would not eat nor 
 drink till they had done it.</I> What a complication of wickedness is 
 here! To design to kill an innocent man, a good man, a useful man, a 
 man that had done them no harm, but was willing to do them all the good 
 he could, was <I>going in the way of Cain,</I> and proved them to be of 
 <I>their father the devil, who was a murderer from the beginning;</I> 
 yet, as if this had been a small matter, 

 (1.) They bound themselves to it. To incline to do evil, and intend to 
 do it, is bad; but to engage to do it is much worse. This is entering 
 into covenant with the devil; it is swearing allegiance to the prince 
 of darkness; it is leaving no room for repentance; nay, it is bidding 
 defiance to it. 

 (2.) They bound one another to it, and did all they could, not only to 
 secure the damnation of their own souls, but of theirs whom they drew 
 into the association. 

 (3.) They showed a great contempt of the providence of God, and a 
 presumption upon it, in that they bound themselves to do such a thing 
 within so short a time as they could continue fasting, without any 
 proviso or reserve for the disposal of an overruling Providence. When 
 we say, <I>To-morrow we will do this or that,</I> be it ever so lawful 
 and good, forasmuch as <I>we know not what shall be on the morrow,</I> 
 we must add, <I>If the Lord will.</I> But with what face could they 
 insert a proviso for the permission of God's providence when they knew 
 that what they were about was directly against the prohibitions of 
 God's work? 

 (4.) They showed a great contempt of their own souls and bodies; of 
 their own souls in imprecating a curse upon them if they did not 
 proceed in this desperate enterprise (what a woeful dilemma did they 
 throw themselves upon! God certainly meets them with his curse if they 
 do go on in it, and they desire he would if they do not!)--and of their
 own bodies too (for wilful sinners are the destroyers of both) in tying 
 themselves out from the necessary supports of life till they had 
 accomplished a thing which they could never lawfully do, and perhaps 
 not possibly do. Such language of hell those speak that wish God to 
 damn them, and the devil to take them, if they do not do so and so.
 <I>As they love cursing, so shall it come unto them.</I> Some think the 
 meaning of this curse was, they would either kill Paul, as an Achan, an 
 accursed thing, a troubler of the camp; or, if they did not do it, they 
 would make themselves accursed before God in his stead. 

 (5.) They showed a most eager desire to compass this matter, and an 
 impatience till was done: not only like David's enemies, <I>that were 
 mad against him,</I> and <I>sworn against him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:8">Ps. cii. 8</A>),

 but like the servants of Job against his enemy: <I>O that we had of
 this flesh! we cannot be satisfied,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:31">Job xxxi. 31</A>.

 Persecutors are said to <I>eat up God's people as they eat bread;</I>
 it is as much a gratification to them as meat to one that is hungry,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:4">Ps. xiv. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. What method they took to bring it about. There is no getting near 
 Paul in the castle. He is there under the particular protection of the 
 government, and is imprisoned, not, as others are, lest he should do 
 harm, but lest he should have harm done him; and therefore the 
 contrivance is that the chief priests and elders must desire the 
 governor of the castle to let Paul come to them to the council-chamber, 
 to be further examined (they have some questions to ask him, or
 something to say to him), and the, in his passage from the castle to 
 the council, they would put an end to all disputes about Paul by 
 killing him; thus the plot was laid, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 Having been all day employed in engaging one another to this 
 wickedness, towards evening they come to the principal members of the 
 great sanhedrim, and, though they might have concealed their mean 
 design and yet might have moved them upon some other pretence to send 
 for Paul, they are so confident of their approbation of this villainy, 
 that they are not ashamed nor afraid to own to them <I>that they have 
 bound themselves under a great curse,</I> without consulting the 
 priests first whether they might lawfully do it, <I>that they will eat 
 nothing</I> the next day <I>till they have killed Paul.</I> They design 
 to breakfast the next morning upon his blood. They doubt not but the 
 chief priests will not only countenance them in the design, but will 
 lend them a helping hand, and be their tools to get them an opportunity 
 of killing Paul; nay, and tell a lie for them too, pretending to <I>the 
 chief captain that they would enquire something more perfectly 
 concerning him,</I> when they meant no such thing. What a mean, what an 
 ill opinion had they of their priests, when they could apply to them on 
 such an errand as this! And yet, vile as the proposal was which was
 made to them (for aught that appears), the priests and elders consented 
 to it, and at the first work, without boggling at it in the least, 
 promised to gratify them. Instead of reproving them, as they ought,
 for their wicked conspiracy, they bolstered them up in it, because it 
 was against Paul whom they hated; and thus they made themselves 
 partakers of the crime as much as if they had been the first in the 
 conspiracy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the plot was discovered. We do not find that the plotters, 
 though they took an oath of fidelity, took an oath of secrecy, either 
 because they thought it did not need it (they would every one keep his 
 own counsel) or because they thought they could accomplish it, though 
 it should take wind and be known; but Providence so ordered it that it 
 was brought to light, and so as effectually to be brought to nought. 
 See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How it was discovered to Paul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 There was a youth that was related to Paul, <I>his sister's son,</I> 
 whose mother probably lived in Jerusalem; and some how or other, we are 
 not told how, <I>he heard of their lying in wait,</I> either overheard 
 them talking of it among themselves, or got intelligence from some that 
 were in the ploy: and <I>he went into the castle,</I> probably, as he 
 used to do, to attend on his uncle, and bring him what he wanted, which 
 gave him a free access to him and <I>he told Paul</I> what he heard. 
 Note, God has many ways of bringing <I>to light the hidden works of 
 darkness;</I> though the contrivers of them <I>dig deep to hide them 
 from the Lord,</I> he can made a <I>bird of the air to carry the 
 voice</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:20">Eccl. x. 20</A>),

 or the conspirators' own tongues to betray them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How it was discovered to the chief captain by the young man that 
 told it to Paul. This part of the story is related very particularly, 
 perhaps because the penman was an eye-witness of the prudent and 
 successful management of this affair, and remembered it with a great 
 deal of pleasure. 

 (1.) Paul had got a good interest in the officers that attended, by his 
 prudent peaceable deportment. He could call one of the centurions to 
 him, though a centurion was one in authority, that had soldiers under 
 him, and used to call, not to be called to, and he was ready to come at 
 his call 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 and he desired that he would introduce this young man to the chief 
 captain, to give in an information of something that concerned the 
 honour of the government.

 (2.) The centurion very readily gratified him,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 He did not send a common soldier with him, but went himself to keep the 
 young man in countenance, to recommend his errand to the chief captain, 
 and to show his respect to Paul: "<I>Paul the prisoner</I> (this was 
 his title now) <I>called me to him, and prayed me to bring this young 
 man to thee;</I> what his business is I know not, but <I>he has 
 something to say to thee.</I>" Note, It is true charity to poor 
 prisoners to act for them as well as to give to them. "<I>I was sick 
 and in prison,</I> and you went on an errand for me," will pass as well 
 in the account as, "<I>I was sick and in prison, and you came unto 
 me,</I> to visit me, or sent me a token." Those that have acquaintance 
 and interest should be ready to use them for the assistance of those 
 that are in distress. This centurion helped to save Paul's life by this 
 piece of civility, which should engage us to be ready to do the like 
 when there is occasion. <I>Open thy mouth for the dumb,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:8">Prov. xxxi. 8</A>.

 Those that cannot give a good gift to God's prisoners may yet speak a 
 good word for them.

 (3.) The chief captain received the information with a great deal of
 condescension and tenderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He <I>took the young man by the hand,</I> as a friend or father, to 
 encourage him, that he might not be put out of countenance, but might 
 be assured of a favourable audience. The notice that is taken of this
 circumstance should encourage great men to take themselves easy of 
 access to the meanest, upon any errand which may give them an 
 opportunity of doing good--<I>to condescend to those of low estate.</I>
 This familiarity to which this Roman tribune or colonel admitted Paul's 
 nephew is here upon record to his honour. Let no man think he
 disparages himself by his humility or charity. He <I>went with him 
 aside privately,</I> that none might hear his business, <I>and asked 
 him, "What is it that thou hast to tell me?</I> Tell me wherein I can 
 be serviceable to Paul." It is probable that the chief captain was the 
 more obliging in this case because he was sensible he had run himself 
 into a premunire in binding Paul, against his privilege as a Roman 
 citizen, which he was willing now to atone for.

 (4.) The young man delivered his errand to the chief captain very 
 readily and handsomely 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>).

 "<I>The Jews</I>" (he does not say who, lest he should invidiously
 reflect upon <I>the chief priests and the elders;</I> and his business 
 was to save his uncle's life, not to accuse his enemies) "<I>have 
 agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to-morrow into 
 the council,</I> presuming that, being so short a distance, thou wilt 
 send him without a guard; <I>but do not thou yield unto them,</I> we 
 have reason to believe thou wilt not when thou knowest the truth; 
 <I>for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty me,</I> who 
 have sworn to be the death of him, <I>and now are they ready looking 
 for a promised from thee,</I> but I have happily got the start of 
 them." 

 (5.) The captain dismissed the young man with a charge of secrecy: 
 <I>See that thou tell no man that thou hast shown these things unto 
 me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The favours of great men are not always to be boasted of; and not fit 
 to be employed in business. If it should be known that the chief 
 captain had this information brought to him, perhaps they would compass 
 and imagine the death of Paul some other way; "therefore keep it 
 private."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How the plot was defeated: The chief captain, finding how 
 implacable and inveterate the malice of the Jews was against Paul, how 
 restless they were in their designs to do him a mischief, and how near 
 he was to become himself accessory to it as a minister, resolves to 
 send him away with all speed out of their reach. He received the 
 intelligence with horror and indignation at the baseness and 
 bloody-mindedness of these Jews; and seemed afraid lest, if he should 
 detain Paul in his castle here, under ever so strong a guard, they 
 would find some way or other to compass their end notwithstanding, 
 either beating the guards or burning the castle; and, whatever came of 
 it, he would, if possible, protect Paul, because he looked upon it that 
 he did not deserve such treatment. What a melancholy observation is it, 
 that the Jewish <I>chief priests,</I> when they knew of this 
 assassination-plot, should countenance it, and assist in it, while a 
 Roman <I>chief captain,</I> purely from a natural sense of justice and 
 humanity, when he knows it, sets himself to baffle it, and puts himself 
 to a great deal of trouble to do it effectually!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He orders a considerable detachment of the Roman forces under his 
 command to get ready <I>to go to C&aelig;sarea</I> with all expedition, and
 to bring Paul thither <I>to Felix the governor,</I> where he might 
 sooner expect to have justice done him than by the great sanhedrim at 
 Jerusalem. I see not but the chief captain might, without any 
 unfaithfulness to the duty of his place, have set Paul at liberty, and 
 given him leave to shift for his own safety, for he was never legally 
 committed to his custody as a criminal, he himself owns <I>that nothing 
 was laid to his charge worthy of bonds</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 and he ought to have had the same tenderness for his liberty that he 
 had for his life; but he feared that this would have incensed the Jews 
 too much against him. Or perhaps, finding Paul to be a very 
 extraordinary man, he was proud to have him his prisoner, and under his 
 protection; and the mighty parade with which he sent him off intimates 
 as much. <I>Two centurions,</I> or captains of the hundreds, are 
 employed in this business, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 They must <I>get ready two hundred soldiers,</I> probably those under 
 their own command, <I>to go to C&aelig;sarea;</I> and with these 
 <I>seventy horse, and two hundred spearmen</I> besides, which some 
 think were the <I>chief captain's</I> guards; whether they were horse 
 or foot is not certain, most probably foot, as pikemen for the 
 protection of the horse. See how justly God brought the Jewish nation 
 under the Roman yoke, when such a party of the Roman army was necessary 
 to restrain them from the most execrable villanies! There needed not 
 all this force, there needed not any of it, to keep Paul from being 
 rescued by his friends; ten times this force would not have kept him 
 from being rescued by an angel, if it had pleased God to work his 
 deliverance that way, as he had sometimes done; but,

 (1.) The chief captain designed hereby to expose the Jews, as a 
 headstrong tumultuous people, that would not be kept within the bounds 
 of duty and decency by the ordinary ministers of justice, but needed to 
 be awed by such a train as this; and, hearing how many were in the 
 conspiracy against Paul, he thought less would not serve to defeat 
 their attempt. 
 
 (2.) God designed hereby to encourage Paul; for, being 
 thus attended, he was not only kept safely in the hands of his friends, 
 but out of the hands of his enemies. Yet Paul did not desire such a 
 guard, any more than Ezra did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:22">Ezra viii. 22</A>),

 and for the same reason, because he trusted in God's all-sufficiency; 
 it was owing, however, to the governor's own care. But he was also made 
 considerable; thus his <I>bonds in Christ</I> were made manifest all 
 the country over 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:13">Phil. i. 13</A>);

 and, son great an honour having been put upon them before by the 
 prediction of them, it was agreeable enough that they should be thus 
 honourably attended, <I>that the brethren in the Lord might wax the 
 more confident by his bonds,</I> when they same him rather guarded as 
 the patriot of his country than guarded against as the pest of his 
 country, and so great a preacher made so great a prisoner. When his 
 enemies hate him, and I doubt his friends neglect him, then does a 
 Roman tribune patronise him, and carefully provide, 

 [1.] For his ease: <I>Let them provide beasts, that they may set Paul 
 on.</I> Had his Jewish persecutors ordered his removal by <I>habeas 
 corpus</I> to C&aelig;sarea, they would have made him run on foot, or 
 dragged him thither in a cart, or on a sledge, or have horsed him 
 behind one of the troopers; but the chief captain treats him like a 
 gentleman, though he was his prisoner, and orders him a good horse to 
 ride upon, not at all afraid that he should ride away. Nay, the order 
 being that they should provide, not a beast, but beasts, to set Paul 
 on, we must either suppose that he was allowed so great a piece of 
 state as to have a led horse, or more, that if he did not like one he 
 might take to another; or (as some expositors conjecture) that he had 
 beasts assigned him for his friends and companions, as many as pleased 
 to go along with him, to divert him in his journey, and to minister to 
 him. 

 [2.] For his security. They have a strict charge given them by their 
 commander in chief <I>to bring him safely to Felix the governor,</I> to 
 whom he is consigned, and who was supreme in all civil affairs among 
 the Jews, as this chief captain was in military affairs. The Roman
 historians speak much of this Felix, as a man of mean extraction, but 
 that raised himself by his shifts to be governor of Judea, in the 
 execution of which office, Tacitus, <I>Hist.</I> 5, says this of him: 
 <I>Per omnem s&aelig;vitiam ac libidinem jus regium servili ingenio 
 exercuit--He used royal power with a servile genius, and in connection
 with all the varieties of cruelty and lust.</I> To the judgement of 
 such a man as this is poor Paul turned over; and yet better so than in 
 the hands of <I>Ananias the high priest!</I> Now, a prisoner, thus upon 
 his deliverance by course of law, ought to be protected as well as a 
 prince.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The chief captain orders, for the greater security of Paul, that he 
 be taken away at <I>the third hour of the night,</I> which some 
 understand of three hours after sun-set, that, it being now after 
 <I>the feast of pentecost</I> (that is, in the midst of summer), they 
 might have the cool of the night to march in. Others understand it of 
 <I>three hours after midnight, in the third watch, about three in the 
 morning,</I> that they might have the day before them, and might get 
 out of Jerusalem before Paul's enemies were stirring, and so might 
 prevent any popular tumult, and leave them to roar when they rose, like 
 a lion disappointed of his prey.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>He writes a letter to Felix the governor</I> of this province, by 
 which he discharges himself from any further care about Paul, and 
 leaves the whole matter with Felix. This letter is here inserted 
 <I>totidem verbis--verbatim,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 It is probable that Luke the historian had a copy of it by him, having
 attended Paul in this remove. Now in this epistle we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The compliments he passes upon <I>the governor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 He is <I>the most excellent governor Felix,</I> this title being given 
 him of course, his excellency, &c. He sends him <I>greeting,</I> wishes 
 him all health and prosperity; may he rejoice, may he ever rejoice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The just and fair account which he gives him of Paul's case: 

 [1.] That he was one that the Jews had a pique against: <I>They had 
 taken him,</I> and would <I>have killed him;</I> and perhaps Felix knew 
 the temper of the Jews so well that he did not think much the worse of 
 him for that,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 [2.] That he had protected him because he was a Roman: "When they were 
 about to kill him, <I>I came with an army,</I> a considerable body of 
 men, <I>and rescued him;</I>" which action for a citizen of Rome would 
 recommend him to the Roman governor. 

 [3.] That he could not understand the merits of his cause, nor what it 
 was that made him so odious to the Jews, and obnoxious to their 
 ill-will. He took the proper method to know: he <I>brought him forth 
 into their council</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 to be examined there, hoping that, either from their complaints or his 
 own confession, he would learn something of the ground of all this 
 clamour, but he found <I>that he was accused of questions of their 
 law</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),
 
 about <I>the hope of the resurrection of the dead,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 This chief captain was a man of sense and honour, and had good 
 principles in him of justice and humanity; and yet see how slightly he 
 speaks of another world, and the great things of that world, as if that 
 were a question, which is of undoubted certainty, and which both sides 
 agreed in, except the Sadducees; and as if that were a question only 
 <I>of their law,</I> which is of the utmost concern to all mankind! Or 
 perhaps he refers rather to the question about their rituals than about 
 their doctrinals, and the quarrel he perceived they had with him was 
 for lessening the credit and obligation of their ceremonial law, which 
 he looked upon as a thing not worth speaking of. The Romans allowed the 
 nations they conquered the exercise of their own religion, and never 
 offered to impose theirs upon them; yet, as conservators of the public 
 peace, they wound not suffer them, under colour of their religion, to 
 abuse their neighbours. 

 [4.] That thus far he understood that there was <I>nothing laid to his 
 charge worthy of death or of bonds,</I> much less proved or made out 
 against him. The Jews had, by their wickedness, made themselves odious 
 to the world, had polluted their own honour and profaned their own 
 crown, had brought disgrace upon their church, their law, and their 
 holy place, and then they cry out against Paul, as having diminished 
 the reputation of them; and was this a crime <I>worthy of death or 
 bonds?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) His referring Paul's case to Felix 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "<I>When it was told me that the Jews laid wait for the man,</I> to 
 kill him, without any legal process against him, <I>I sent straightaway 
 to thee,</I> who art the most proper person to head the cause, and give 
 judgment upon it, and let <I>his accusers</I> go after him, if they 
 please, and <I>say before thee what they have against him,</I> for, 
 being bred a soldier, I will never pretend to be a judge, and so 
 <I>farewell.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Paul was accordingly conducted to C&aelig;sarea; the soldiers got him
 safely out of Jerusalem by night, and left the conspirators to consider 
 whether they should east and drink or no before they had killed Paul; 
 and, if they would not repent of the wickedness of their oath as it was 
 against Paul, they were now at leisure to repent of the rashness of it 
 as it was against themselves; if any of them did starve themselves to 
 death, in consequence of their oath and vexation at their 
 disappointment, they fell unpitied. Paul was conducted to 
 <I>Antipatris,</I> which was seventeen miles from Jerusalem, and about 
 the mid-way to C&aelig;sarea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Thence <I>the two hundred foot-soldiers,</I> and <I>the two hundred 
 spearmen, returned</I> back to Jerusalem, to their quarters in <I>the 
 castle;</I> for, having conducted Paul out of danger, there needed not 
 strong a guard, but <I>the horsemen</I> might serve to bring him to 
 C&aelig;sarea, and would do it with more expedition; this they did, not 
 only to save their own labour, but their master's charge; and it is an 
 example to servants, not only to act obediently according to their 
 masters' orders, but to act prudently, so as may be most for their 
 masters' interest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He was delivered into the hands of Felix, as his prisoner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.
 
 The officers <I>presented the letter,</I> and <I>Paul with it, to 
 Felix,</I> and so discharged themselves of their trust. Paul had never 
 affected acquaintance or society with great men, but with the 
 disciples, wherever he came; yet Providence overrules his sufferings so 
 as by them to give him an opportunity of witnessing to Christ before 
 great men; and so Christ had foretold concerning his disciples, <I>that 
 they should be brought before rulers and kings for his sake, for a 
 testimony against them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:9">Mark xiii. 9</A>.

 <I>The governor</I> enquired <I>of what province</I> of the empire the
 prisoner originally was, and was told <I>that he was a native of 
 Cilicia,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>;
 
 and,

 (1.) He promises him a speedy trial 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 "<I>I will hear thee when thing accusers have come,</I> and will have 
 an ear open to both sides, as becomes a judge." 

 (2.) He ordered him into custody, that he should <I>be kept</I> a 
 prisoner <I>in Herod's judgment-hall,</I> in some apartment belonging 
 to that palace which was denominated from Herod the Great, who built 
 it. There he had opportunity of acquainting himself with great men that 
 attended the governor's court, and, no doubt, he improved what 
 acquaintance he got there to the best purposes.</P>
