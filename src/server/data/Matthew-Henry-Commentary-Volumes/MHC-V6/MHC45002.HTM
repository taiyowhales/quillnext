 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of the first two chapters of this epistle may be gathered
 from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:9"><I>ch.</I> iii. 9</A>,

 "We have before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under
 sin." This we have proved upon the Gentiles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:1-32"><I>ch.</I> i.</A>),

 now in this chapter he proves it upon the Jews, as appears by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:1-17">ver. 17</A>,

 "thou art called a Jew."

 I. He proves in general that Jews and Gentiles stand upon the same
 level before the justice of God, to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:1-11">ver. 11</A>.

 II. He shows more particularly what sins the Jews were guilty of,
 notwithstanding their profession and vain pretensions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:17-29">ver. 17 to the end</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art
 that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest
 thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.
 &nbsp; 2  But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to
 truth against them which commit such things.
 &nbsp; 3  And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do
 such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the
 judgment of God?
 &nbsp; 4  Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance
 and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth
 thee to repentance?
 &nbsp; 5  But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up
 unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the
 righteous judgment of God;
 &nbsp; 6  Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
 &nbsp; 7  To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for
 glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
 &nbsp; 8  But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the
 truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
 &nbsp; 9  Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth
 evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;
 &nbsp; 10  But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh
 good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:
 &nbsp; 11  For there is no respect of persons with God.
 &nbsp; 12  For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish
 without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be
 judged by the law;
 &nbsp; 13  (For not the hearers of the law <I>are</I> just before God, but
 the doers of the law shall be justified.
 &nbsp; 14  For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature
 the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a
 law unto themselves:
 &nbsp; 15  Which show the work of the law written in their hearts,
 their conscience also bearing witness, and <I>their</I> thoughts the
 mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)
 &nbsp; 16  In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus
 Christ according to my gospel.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the former chapter the apostle had represented the state of the 
 Gentile world to be as bad and black as the Jews were ready enough to 
 pronounce it. And now, designing to show that the state of the Jews was 
 very bad too, and their sin in many respects more aggravated, to 
 prepare his way he sets himself in this part of the chapter to show 
 that God would proceed upon equal terms of justice with Jews and 
 Gentiles; and now with such a partial hand as the Jews were apt to 
 think he would use in their favour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He arraigns them for their censoriousness and self-conceit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):
 
 <I>Thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest.</I> As 
 he expresses himself in general terms, the admonition may reach those 
 <I>many masters</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:1">Jam. iii. 1</A>),

 of whatever nation or profession they are, that assume to themselves a 
 power to censure, control, and condemn others. But he intends 
 especially the Jews, and to them particularly he applies this general 
 charge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>Thou who teachest another teachest thou not thyself?</I> The Jews 
 were generally a proud sort of people, that looked with a great deal of
 scorn and contempt upon the poor Gentiles, as not worthy to be set with
 the dogs of their flock; while in the mean time they were themselves as
 bad and immoral--though not idolaters, as the Gentiles, yet
 sacrilegious,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 <I>Therefore thou art inexcusable.</I> If the Gentiles, who had but the 
 light of nature, were inexcusable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:20"><I>ch.</I> i. 20</A>),

 much more the Jews, who had the light of the law, the revealed will of
 God, and so had greater helps than the Gentiles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He asserts the invariable justice of the divine government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 To drive home the conviction, he here shows what a righteous God that 
 is with whom we have to do, and how just in his proceedings. It is 
 usual with the apostle Paul, in his writings, upon mention of some 
 material point, to make large digressions upon it; as here concerning 
 the justice of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 That the <I>judgment of God is according to truth,</I>--according to 
 the eternal rules of justice and equity,--according to the heart, and 
 not according to the outward appearance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:7">1 Sam. xvi. 7</A>),--according

 to the works, and not with respect to persons, is a doctrine which we 
 are all sure of, for he would not be God if he were not just; but it 
 behoves those especially to consider it who condemn others for those 
 things which they themselves are guilty of, and so, while they practise 
 sin and persist in that practice, think to bribe the divine justice by 
 protesting against sin and exclaiming loudly upon others that are 
 guilty, as if preaching against sin would atone for the guilt of it.
 But observe how he puts it to the sinner's conscience 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>Thinkest thou this, O man?</I> O man, a rational creature, a 
 dependent creature, made by God, subject under him, and accountable to 
 him. The case is so plain that we may venture to appeal to the sinner's 
 own thoughts: "Canst thou think that <I>thou shalt escape the judgment 
 of God?</I> Can the heart-searching God be imposed upon by formal 
 pretences, the righteous Judge of all so bribed and put off?" The most 
 plausible politic sinners, who acquit themselves before men with the 
 greatest confidence, cannot <I>escape the judgment of God,</I> cannot 
 avoid being judged and condemned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He draws up a charge against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>)

 consisting of two branches:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Slighting the goodness of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>the riches of his goodness.</I> This is especially applicable to the 
 Jews, who had singular tokens of the divine favour. Means are mercies, 
 and the more light we sin against the more love we sin against. Low and 
 mean thoughts of the divine goodness are at the bottom of a great deal 
 of sin. There is in every wilful sin an interpretative contempt of the 
 goodness of God; it is spurning at his bowels, particularly the 
 goodness of his patience, his forbearance and long-suffering, taking 
 occasion thence to be so much the more bold in sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:11">Eccl. viii. 11</A>.

 <I>Not knowing,</I> that is, not considering, not knowing practically
 and with application, that <I>the goodness of God leadeth thee,</I> the 
 design of it is to lead thee, <I>to repentance.</I> It is not enough 
 for us to know that God's goodness leads to repentance, but we must 
 know that it leads <I>us--thee</I> in particular. See here what method 
 God takes to bring sinners to repentance. He leads them, not drives 
 them like beasts, but leads them like rational creatures, allures them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:14">Hos. ii. 14</A>);
 
 and it is goodness that leads, bands of love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:4">Hos. xi. 4</A>.
 
 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:3">Jer. xxxi. 3</A>.

 The consideration of the goodness of God, his common
 goodness to all (the goodness of his providence, of his patience, and 
 of his offers), should be effectual to bring us all to repentance; and 
 the reason why so many continue in impenitency is because they do not 
 know and consider this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Provoking the wrath of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The rise of this provocation is a <I>hard and impenitent heart;</I> and 
 the ruin of sinners is their walking after such a heart, being led by 
 it. To sin is to walk in the way of the heart; and when that is a hard 
 and impenitent heart (contracted hardness by long custom, besides that 
 which is natural), how desperate must the course needs be! The 
 provocation is expressed by <I>treasuring up wrath.</I> Those that go 
 on in a course of sin are treasuring up unto themselves wrath. A 
 treasure denotes abundance. It is a treasure that will be spending to 
 eternity, and yet never exhausted; and yet sinners are still adding to 
 it as to a treasure. Every wilful sin adds to the score, and will
 inflame the reckoning; it brings a <I>branch to their wrath,</I> as 
 some read that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:17">Ezek. viii. 17</A>),
 
 they <I>put the branch to their nose.</I> A treasure denotes secrecy. 
 The treasury or magazine of wrath is the heart of God himself, in which 
 it lies hid, as treasures in some secret place sealed up; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:34,Job+14:17">Deut. xxxii. 34; Job xiv. 17</A>.

 But withal it denotes reservation to some further occasion; as the
 treasures of the hail are reserved against the day of battle and war,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:22,23">Job xxxviii. 22, 23</A>.

 These treasures will be broken open like the fountains of the great
 deep,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:11">Gen. vii. 11</A>.

 They are treasured up <I>against the day of wrath,</I> when they will
 be dispensed by the wholesale, poured out by full vials. Though the 
 present day be a day of patience and forbearance towards sinners, yet 
 there is a day of wrath coming--wrath, and nothing but wrath. Indeed, 
 every day is to sinners a day of wrath, for God is <I>angry with the 
 wicked every day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:11">Ps. vii. 11</A>),
 
 but there is the <I>great day of wrath</I> coming, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:17">Rev. vi. 17</A>.
 
 And that day of wrath will be <I>the day of the revelation of the 
 righteous judgment of God.</I> The wrath of God is not like our wrath, 
 a heat and passion; no, fury is not in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4">Isa. xxvii. 4</A>):

 but it is a righteous judgment, his will to punish sin, because he 
 hates it as contrary to his nature. This righteous judgment of God is 
 now many times concealed in the prosperity and success of sinners, but 
 shortly it will be manifested before all the world, these seeming 
 disorders set to rights, and the heavens shall declare his 
 righteousness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:6">Ps. l. 6</A>.

 <I>Therefore judge nothing before the time.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He describes the measures by which God proceeds in his judgment. 
 Having mentioned the righteous judgment of God in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>,

 he here illustrates that judgment, and the righteousness of it, and 
 shows what we may expect from God, and by what rule he will judge the 
 world. The equity of distributive justice is the dispensing of frowns 
 and favours with respect to deserts and without respect to persons: 
 such is the righteous judgment of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He will <I>render to every man according to his deeds</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 a truth often mentioned in scripture, to prove that the Judge of all 
 the earth does right.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In dispensing his favours; and this is mentioned twice here, both 
 in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:7,10"><I>v.</I> 7 and <I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 For he delights to show mercy. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The objects of his favour: <I>Those who by patient 
 continuance,</I> &c. By this we may try our interest in the divine 
 favour, and may hence be directed what course to take, that we may 
 obtain it. Those whom the righteous God will reward are, <I>First,</I> 
 Such as fix to themselves the right end, that <I>seek for glory, and 
 honour, and immortality;</I> that is, the glory and honour which are 
 immortal-acceptance with God here and for ever. There is a holy 
 ambition which is at the bottom of all practical religion. This is 
 seeking the kingdom of God, looking in our desires and aims as high as 
 heaven, and resolved to take up with nothing short of it. This seeking 
 implies a loss, sense of that loss, desire to retrieve it, and pursuits 
 and endeavours consonant to those desires. <I>Secondly,</I> Such as, 
 having fixed the right end, adhere to the right way: <I>A patient
 continuance in well-doing.</I> 

 1. There must be well-doing, working good,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It is not enough to know well, and speak well, and profess well, and
 promise well, but we must do well: do that which is good, not only for 
 the matter of it, but for the manner of it. We must do it well. 

 2. A continuance in well-doing. Not for a fit and a start, like the
 morning cloud and the early dew; but we must endure to the end: it is 
 perseverance that wins the crown. 

 3. A patient continuance. This patience respects not only the length of
 the work, but the difficulties of it and the oppositions and hardships 
 we may meet with in it. Those that will do well and continue in it must 
 put on a great deal of patience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The product of his favour. He will render to such eternal life. 
 Heaven is life, eternal life, and it is the reward of those that 
 patiently continue in well-doing; and it is called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 <I>glory, honour, and peace.</I> Those that seek for glory and honour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 shall have them. Those that seek for the vain glory and honour of this 
 world often miss of them, and are disappointed; but those that seek for 
 immortal glory and honour shall have them, and not only <I>glory and 
 honour,</I> but <I>peace.</I> Worldly glory and honour are commonly 
 attended with trouble; but heavenly glory and honour have peace with 
 them, undisturbed everlasting peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In dispensing his frowns 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>).
 
 Observe, 

 [1.] The objects of his frowns. In general those that do evil, more 
 particularly described to be <I>such as are contentious and do not obey 
 the truth.</I> Contentious against God. Every wilful sin is a quarrel
 with God, it is <I>striving with our Maker</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:9">Isa. xlv. 9</A>),

 the most desperate contention. The Spirit of God strives with sinners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:3">Gen. vi. 3</A>),

 and impenitent sinners strive against the Spirit, rebel against the 
 light 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:13">Job xxiv. 13</A>),

 hold fast deceit, strive to retain that sin which the Spirit strives to 
 part them from. <I>Contentious, and do not obey the truth.</I> The 
 truths of religion are not only to be known, but to be obeyed; they are 
 directing, ruling, commanding; truths relating to practice. 
 Disobedience to the truth is interpreted a striving against it. <I>But 
 obey unrighteousness</I>--do what unrighteousness bids them do. Those 
 that refuse to be the servants of truth will soon be the slaves of 
 unrighteousness. 

 [2.] The products or instances of these frowns: <I>Indignation and 
 wrath, tribulation and anguish.</I> These are the wages of sin. 
 <I>Indignation and wrath</I> the causes--<I>tribulation and anguish</I> 
 the necessary and unavoidable effects. And this <I>upon the soul;</I> 
 souls are the vessels of that wrath, the subjects of that tribulation 
 and anguish. Sin qualifies the soul for this wrath. The soul is that
 in or of man which is alone immediately capable of this indignation, 
 and the impressions or effects of anguish therefrom. Hell is eternal 
 tribulation and anguish, the product of wrath and indignation. This 
 comes of contending with God, of setting briers and thorns before a 
 consuming fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4">Isa. xxvii. 4</A>.

 Those that will not bow to his golden sceptre will certainly be broken
 by his iron rod. Thus will God render to every man according to his 
 deeds.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>There is no respect of persons with God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 As to the spiritual state, there is a respect of persons; but not as to 
 outward relation or condition. Jews and Gentiles stand upon the same 
 level before God. This was Peter's remark upon the first taking down of 
 the partition-wall

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:34">Acts x. 34</A>),

 that God is no respecter of persons; and it is explained in the next 
 words, that <I>in every nation he that fears God, and works 
 righteousness, is accepted of him.</I> God does not save men with 
 respect to their external privileges or their barren knowledge and 
 profession of the truth, but according as their state and disposition 
 really are. In dispensing both his frowns and favours it is both to Jew 
 and Gentile. If to <I>the Jews first,</I> who had greater privileges, 
 and made a greater profession, yet <I>also to the Gentiles,</I> whose 
 want of such privileges will neither excuse them from the punishment of 
 their ill-doing nor bar them out from the reward of their well-doing 
 (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:11">Col. iii. 11</A>);
 
 for shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He proves the equity of his proceedings with all, when he shall 
 actually come to Judge them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:12-16"><I>v.</I> 12-16</A>),

 upon this principle, that that which is the rule of man's obedience is
 the rule of God's judgment. Three degrees of light are revealed to the
 children of men:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The light of nature. This the Gentiles have, and by this they shall 
 be judged: <I>As many as have sinned without law shall perish without 
 law;</I> that is, the unbelieving Gentiles, who had no other guide but 
 natural conscience, no other motive but common mercies, and had not the 
 law of Moses nor any supernatural revelation, shall not be reckoned 
 with for the transgression of the law they never had, nor come under 
 the aggravation of the Jews' sin against and judgment by the written 
 law; but they shall be judged by, as they sin against, the law of 
 nature, not only as it is in their hearts, corrupted, defaced, and 
 imprisoned in unrighteousness, but as in the uncorrupt original the 
 Judge keeps by him. Further to clear this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>),

 in a parenthesis, he evinces that the light of nature was to the 
 Gentiles instead of a written law. He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 they had <I>sinned without law,</I> which looks like a contradiction; 
 for where there is no law there is no transgression. But, says he, 
 though they had not the written law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:20">Ps. cxlvii. 20</A>),

 they had that which was equivalent, not to the ceremonial, but to the 
 moral law. They <I>had the work of the law.</I> He does not mean that 
 work which the law commands, as if they could produce a perfect 
 obedience; but that work which the law does. The work of the law is to
 direct us what to do, and to examine us what we have done. Now, 

 (1.) They had that which directed them what to do by the light of 
 nature: by the force and tendency of their natural notions and dictates 
 they apprehended a clear and vast difference between good and evil. 
 They <I>did by nature the things contained in the law.</I> They had a 
 sense of justice and equity, honour and purity, love and charity; the 
 light of nature taught obedience to parents, pity to the miserable, 
 conservation of public peace and order, forbade murder, stealing, 
 lying, perjury, &c. Thus they were a <I>law unto themselves.</I> 

 (2.) They had that which examined them as to what they had done: 
 <I>Their conscience also bearing witness.</I> They had that within them 
 which approved and commended what was well done and which reproached 
 them for what was done amiss. Conscience is a witness, and first or 
 last will bear witness, though for a time it may be bribed or 
 brow-beaten. It is instead of a thousand witnesses, testifying of that 
 which is most secret; and their <I>thoughts accusing or excusing,</I> 
 passing a judgment upon the testimony of conscience by applying the law 
 to the fact. Conscience is that candle of the Lord which was not quite 
 put out, no, not in the Gentile world. The heathen have witnessed to 
 the comfort of a good conscience.</P>

 <P>

 Their <I>thoughts the meanwhile,</I> <B><I>metaxy 
 allelon</I></B>--<I>among themselves,</I> or one with another. The same
 light and law of nature that witnesses against sin in them, and 
 witnessed against it in others, accused or excused one another. 
 <I>Vicissim,</I> so some read it, <I>by turns;</I> according as they 
 observed or broke these natural laws and dictates, their consciences 
 did either acquit or condemn them. All this did evince that they had 
 that which was to them instead of a law, which they might have been 
 governed by, and which will condemn them, because they were not so 
 guided and governed by it. So that the guilty Gentiles are left without 
 excuse. God is justified in condemning them. They cannot plead 
 ignorance, and therefore are likely to perish if they have not 
 something else to plead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The light of the law. This the Jews had, and by this they shall be 
 judged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>As many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.</I> 
 They sinned, not only having the law, but <B><I>en nomo</I></B>--<I>in 
 the law,</I> in the midst of so much law, in the face and light of so 
 pure and clear a law, the directions of which were so very full and 
 particular, and the sanctions of it so very cogent and enforcing. These 
 shall be judged <I>by the law;</I> their punishment shall be, as their 
 sin is, so much the greater for their having the law. <I>The Jew 
 first,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon. Thus Moses did accuse 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:45">John v. 45</A>),

 and they fell under the many stripes of him that knew his master's
 will, and did it not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:47">Luke xii. 47</A>.

 The Jews prided themselves very much in the law; but, to confirm what 
 he had said, the apostle shows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)
 
 that their having, and hearing, and knowing the law, would not justify 
 them, but their doing it. The Jewish doctors bolstered up their 
 followers with an opinion that all that were Jews, how bad soever they 
 lived, should have a place in the world to come. This the apostle here 
 opposes: it was a great privilege that they had the law, but not a 
 saving privilege, unless they lived up to the law they had, which it is 
 certain the Jews did not, and therefore they had need of a 
 righteousness wherein to appear before God. We may apply it to the 
 gospel: it is not hearing, but doing that will save us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:17,Jam+1:22">John xiii. 17; James i. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The light of the gospel: and according to this those that enjoyed 
 the gospel shall be judge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>According to my gospel;</I> not meant of any fifth gospel written by 
 Paul, as some conceit; or of the gospel written by <I>Luke,</I> as 
 Paul's amanuensis (<I>Euseb. Hist.</I> lib 3, cap. 8), but the gospel
 in general, called Paul's because he was a preacher of it. As many as 
 are under that dispensation shall be judged according to that 
 dispensation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:16">Mark xvi. 16</A>.

 Some refer those words, <I>according to my gospel,</I> to what he says
 of the day of judgment: "There will come a day of judgment, according 
 as I have in my preaching often told you; and that will be the day of 
 the final judgment both of Jews and Gentiles." It is good for us to get 
 acquainted with what is revealed concerning that day.

 (1.) There is a day set for a general judgment. The day, the great
 day, his day that is coming, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13">Ps. xxxvii. 13</A>.

 (2.) The judgment of that day will be put into the hands of Jesus 
 Christ. God shall judge by Jesus Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:31">Acts xvii. 31</A>.

 It will be part of the reward of his humiliation. Nothing speaks more
 terror to sinners, or more comfort to saints, than this, that Christ 
 shall be the Judge.

 (3.) The secrets of men shall then be judged. Secret services shall be
 then rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, hidden things shall 
 be brought to light. That will be the great discovering day, when that 
 which is now done in corners shall be proclaimed to all the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and
 makest thy boast of God,
 &nbsp; 18  And knowest <I>his</I> will, and approvest the things that are
 more excellent, being instructed out of the law;
 &nbsp; 19  And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the
 blind, a light of them which are in darkness,
 &nbsp; 20  An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast
 the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
 &nbsp; 21  Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not
 thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou
 steal?
 &nbsp; 22  Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou
 commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit
 sacrilege?
 &nbsp; 23  Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the
 law dishonourest thou God?
 &nbsp; 24  For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through
 you, as it is written.
 &nbsp; 25  For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but
 if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made
 uncircumcision.
 &nbsp; 26  Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of
 the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for
 circumcision?
 &nbsp; 27  And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it
 fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision
 dost transgress the law?
 &nbsp; 28  For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither <I>is
 that</I> circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:
 &nbsp; 29  But he <I>is</I> a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision
 <I>is that</I> of the heart, in the spirit, <I>and</I> not in the letter;
 whose praise <I>is</I> not of men, but of God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the latter part of the chapter the apostle directs his discourse 
 more closely to the Jews, and shows what sins they were guilty of, 
 notwithstanding their profession and vain pretensions. He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 that not the hearers but the doers of the law are justified; and he 
 here applies that great truth to the Jews. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He allows their profession 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:17-20"><I>v.</I> 17-20</A>)

 and specifies their particular pretensions and privileges in which they
 prided themselves, that they might see he did not condemn them out of 
 ignorance of what they had to say for themselves; no, he knew the best 
 of their cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were a peculiar people, separated and distinguished from all 
 others by their having the written law and the special presence of God 
 among them. 

 (1.) <I>Thou art called a Jew;</I> not so much in parentage as 
 profession. It was a very honourable title. Salvation was of the Jews; 
 and this they were very proud of, to be a people by themselves; and yet 
 many that were so called were the vilest of men. It is no new thing for 
 the worst practices to be shrouded under the best names, for many of 
 the synagogue of Satan to say they are Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:9">Rev. ii. 9</A>),

 for a generation of vipers to boast they have <I>Abraham to their 
 father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:7-9">Matt. iii. 7-9</A>.

 (2.) <I>And restest in the law;</I> that is, they took a pride in this,
 that they had the law among them, had it in their books, read it in 
 their synagogues. They were mightily puffed up with this privilege, and 
 thought this enough to bring them to heaven, though they did not live, 
 up to the law. To rest in the law, with a rest of complacency and 
 acquiescence, is good; but to rest in it with a rest of pride, and 
 slothfulness, and carnal security, is the ruin of souls. <I>The temple
 of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:4">Jer. vii. 4</A>.
 
 <I>Bethel their confidence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:13">Jer. xlviii. 13</A>.
 
 <I>Haughty because of the holy mountain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:11">Zeph. iii. 11</A>.

 It is a dangerous thing to rest in external privileges, and not to 
 improve them.

 (3.) <I>And makest thy boast of God.</I> See how the best things may be
 perverted and abused. A believing, humble, thankful glorying in God, is 
 the root and summary of all religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:2,Isa+45:15.1Co+1:31">Ps. xxxiv. 2;
 Isa. xlv. 15; 1 Cor. i. 31</A>.
 
 But a proud vainglorious boasting in God, and in the outward profession
 of his name, is the root and summary of all hypocrisy. Spiritual pride
 is of all kinds of pride the most dangerous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They were a knowing people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>and knowest his will,</I> <B><I>to thelema</I></B>--<I>the will.</I> 
 God's will is the will, the sovereign, absolute, irresistible will. The 
 world will then, and not till then, be set to rights, when God's will 
 is the only will, and all other wills are melted into it. They did not 
 only know the truth of God, but the will of God, that which he would 
 have them to do. It is possible for a hypocrite to have a great deal of 
 knowledge in the will of God.--<I>And approvest the things that are 
 more excellent</I>--<B><I>dokimazeis ta diapheronta.</I></B> Paul prays 
 for it for his friends as a very great attainment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:10">Phil. i. 10</A>.
 
 <B><I>Eis to dokimazein hymas ta diapheronta.</I></B> Understand it,
 
 (1.) Of a good apprehension in <I>the things of God,</I> reading it 
 thus, <I>Thou discernest things that differ,</I> knowest how to 
 distinguish between good and evil, to separate between the precious and 
 the vile 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:19">Jer. xv. 19</A>),

 to make a difference between the unclean and the clean, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:47">Lev. xi. 47</A>.
 
 Good and bad lie sometimes so near together that it is not easy to 
 distinguish them; but the Jews, having the touchstone of the law ready 
 at hand, were, or at least thought they were, able to distinguish, to 
 cleave the hair in doubtful cases. A man may be a good casuist and yet 
 a bad Christian--accurate in the notion, but loose and careless in the 
 application. Or, we may, with <I>De Dieu,</I> understand 
 <I>controversies</I> by the <B><I>ta diapheronta.</I></B> A man may be 
 well skilled in the controversies of religion, and yet a stranger to 
 the power of godliness. 

 (2.) Of a warm affection to the things of God, as we read it, 
 <I>Approvest the things that are excellent.</I> There are excellences 
 in religion which a hypocrite may approve of: there may be a consent of 
 the practical judgment <I>to the law, that it is good,</I> and yet that 
 consent overpowerd by the lusts of the flesh, and of the mind:--</P>

 <P>

 and it is common for sinners to make that approbation an excuse which 
 is really a very great aggravation of a sinful course. They got this 
 acquaintance with, and affection to, that which is good, but being 
 <I>instructed out of the law,</I> <B><I>katechoumenos</I></B>--<I>being
 catechised.</I> The word signifies an early instruction in childhood. 
 It is a great privilege and advantage to be well catechised betimes. It 
 was the custom of the Jews to take a great deal of pains in teaching 
 their children when they were young, and all their lessons were <I>out 
 of the law;</I> it were well if Christians were but as industrious to 
 teach their children <I>out of the gospel.</I> Now this is called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>The form of knowledge, and of the truth in the law,</I> that is, the 
 show and appearance of it. Those whose knowledge rests in an empty 
 notion, and does not make an impression on their hearts, have only the 
 form of it, like a picture well drawn and in good colours, but which 
 wants life. A form of knowledge produces but a form of godliness, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:5">2 Tim. iii. 5</A>.

 A form of knowledge may deceive men, but cannot impose upon the
 piercing eye of the heart-searching God. A form may be the vehicle of 
 the power; but he that takes up with that only is <I>like sounding 
 brass and a tinkling cymbal.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They were a teaching people, or at least thought themselves so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):

 <I>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind.</I> 
 Apply it, 

 (1.) To the Jews in general. They thought themselves guides to the poor 
 blind Gentiles that sat in darkness, were very proud of this, that 
 whoever would have the knowledge of God must be beholden to them for 
 it. All other nations must come to school to them, to learn what is 
 good, and what the Lord requires; for they had the lively oracles. 

 (2.) To their rabbis, and doctors, and leading men among them, who were 
 especially those that judged others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 These prided themselves much in the possession they had got of Moses's 
 chair, and the deference which the vulgar paid to their dictates; and 
 the apostle expresses this in several terms, <I>a guide of the blind, a 
 light of those who are in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a 
 teacher of babes,</I> the better to set forth their proud conceit of 
 themselves, and contempt of others. This was a string they loved to be 
 harping upon, heaping up titles of honour upon themselves. The best 
 work, when it is prided in, is unacceptable to God. It is good to 
 instruct the foolish, and to teach the babes: but considering our own 
 ignorance, and folly, and inability to make these teachings successful 
 without God, there is nothing in it to be proud of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He aggravates their provocations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:21-24"><I>v.</I> 21-24</A>)
 
 from two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they sinned against their knowledge and profession, did that 
 themselves which they taught others to avoid: <I>Thou that teachest 
 another, teachest thou not thyself?</I> Teaching is a piece of that 
 charity which begins at home, though it must not end there. It was the 
 hypocrisy of the Pharisees <I>that they did not do as they taught</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:3">Matt. xxiii. 3</A>),

 but pulled down with their lives what they built up with their 
 preaching; for who will believe those who do not believe themselves? 
 Examples will govern more than rules. The greatest obstructors of the 
 success of the word are those whose bad lives contradict their good 
 doctrine, who in the pulpit preach so well that it is a pity they 
 should ever come out, and out of the pulpit live so ill that it is a 
 pity they should ever come in. He specifies three particular sins that 
 abound among the Jews:--

 (1.) Stealing. This is charged upon some that declared God's statutes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:16,18">Ps. l. 16, 18</A>),

 <I>When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him.</I> The 
 Pharisees are charged with devouring widows' houses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:14">Matt. xxiii. 14</A>),

 and that is the worst of robberies. 
 
 (2.) Adultery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 This is likewise charged upon that sinner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:18">Ps. l. 18</A>),

 <I>Thou hast been partaker with adulterers.</I> Many of the Jewish 
 rabbin are said to have been notorious for this sin.

 (3.) Sacrilege-robbing in holy things, which were then by special laws 
 dedicated and devoted to God; and this is charged upon those that 
 professed to abhor idols. So the Jews did remarkably, after their 
 captivity in Babylon; that furnace separated them for ever from the 
 dross of their idolatry, but they dealt very treacherously in the 
 worship of God. It was in the latter days of the Old-Testament church 
 that they were charged <I>with robbing God in tithes and offerings</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:8,9">Mal. iii. 8, 9</A>),

 converting that to their own use, and to the service of their lusts, 
 which was, in a special manner, set apart for God. And this is almost 
 equivalent to idolatry, though this sacrilege was cloaked with the 
 abhorrence of idols. Those will be severely reckoned with another day 
 who, while they condemn sin in others, do the same, or as bad, or 
 worse, themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they dishonoured God by their sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 While God and his law were an honour to them, which they boasted of and 
 prided themselves in, they were a dishonour to God and his law, by 
 giving occasion to those that were without to reflect upon their 
 religion, as if that did countenance and allow of such things, which, 
 as it is their sin who draw such inferences (for the faults of 
 professors are not to be laid upon professions), so it is their sin who 
 give occasion for those inferences, and will greatly aggravate their 
 miscarriages. This was the condemnation in David's case, <I>that he had 
 given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:14">2 Sam. xii. 14</A>.

 And the apostle here refers to the same charge against their 
 forefathers: <I>As it is written,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He does not mention the place, because he wrote this to those that were 
 instructed in the law (in labouring to convince, it is some advantage 
 to deal with those that have knowledge and are acquainted with the 
 scripture), but he seems to point at 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:5,Eze+36:22,23,2Sa+12:14">Isa. lii. 5;
 Ezek. xxxvi. 22, 23; and 2 Sam. xii. 14</A>.

 It is a lamentation that those who were made <I>to be to God for a name
 and for a praise</I> should be to him a shame and dishonour. The great
 evil of the sins of professors is the dishonour done to God and
 religion by their profession. "<I>Blasphemed through you;</I> that is,
 you give the occasion for it, it is through your folly and
 carelessness. The reproaches you bring upon yourselves reflect upon
 your God, and religion is wounded through your sides." A good caution
 to professors to walk circumspectly. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:1">1 Tim. vi. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He asserts the utter insufficiency of their profession to clear 
 them from the guilt of these provocations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:25-29"><I>v.</I> 25-29</A>):

 <I>Circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law;</I> that is,
 obedient Jews shall not lose the reward of their obedience, but will 
 gain this by their being Jews, that they have a clearer rule of 
 obedience than the Gentiles have. God did not give the law nor appoint 
 circumcision in vain. This must be referred to the state of the Jews 
 before the ceremonial polity was abolished, otherwise circumcision to 
 one that professed faith in Christ was forbidden, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:1">Gal. v. 1</A>.

 But he is here speaking to the Jews, whose Judaism would benefit them,
 if they would but live up to the rules and laws of it; but if not 
 "<I>thy circumcision is made uncircumcision;</I> that is, thy 
 profession will do thee no good; thou wilt be no more justified than 
 the uncircumcised Gentiles, but more condemned for sinning against 
 greater light." The uncircumcised are in scripture branded as 
 <I>unclean</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:1">Isa. lii. 1</A>),
 
 as <I>out of the covenant,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:11,12">Eph. ii. 11, 12</A>)

 and wicked Jews will be dealt with as such. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:25,26">Jer. ix. 25, 26</A>.
 
 Further to illustrate this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He shows that the uncircumcised Gentiles, if they live up to the 
 light they have, stand upon the same level with the Jews; if <I>they 
 keep the righteousness of the law</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),
 
 <I>fulfil the law</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 that is, by submitting sincerely to the conduct of natural light, 
 perform the matter of the law. Some understand it as putting the case 
 of a perfect obedience to the law: "If the Gentiles could perfectly 
 keep the law, they would be justified by it as well as the Jews." But 
 it seems rather to be meant of such an obedience as some of the 
 Gentiles did attain to. The case of Cornelius will clear it. Though he 
 was a Gentile, and uncircumcised, yet, <I>being a devout man, and one 
 that feared God with all his house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:2">Acts x. 2</A>),
 
 he was accepted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Doubtless, there were many such instances: and <I>they were the
 uncircumcision, that kept the righteousness of the law;</I> and of such 
 he says, 

 (1.) That they were accepted with God, as if they had been circumcised. 
 <I>Their uncircumcision was counted for circumcision.</I> Circumcision 
 was indeed <I>to the Jews</I> a commanded duty, but it was not to all 
 the world a necessary condition of justification and salvation. 

 (2.) That their obedience was a great aggravation of the disobedience 
 of the Jews, who had the letter of the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 <I>Judge thee,</I> that is, help to add to thy condemnation, who <I>by 
 the letter and circumcision dost transgress.</I> Observe, To carnal 
 professors the law is but the letter; they read it as a bare writing, 
 but are not ruled by it as a law. They did transgress, not only 
 notwithstanding the letter and circumcision, but by it, that is, they 
 thereby hardened themselves in sin. External privileges, if they do not 
 do us good, do us hurt. The obedience of those that enjoy less means, 
 and make a less profession, will help to condemn those that enjoy 
 greater means, and make a greater profession, but do not live up to 
 it.</P>

 2. He describes the true circumcision, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.

 (1.) It is <I>not that which is outward in the flesh and in the 
 letter.</I> This is not to drive us off from the observance of external 
 institutions (they are good in their place), but from trusting to them 
 and resting in them as sufficient to bring us to heaven, taking up with 
 a name to live, without being alive indeed. <I>He is not a Jew,</I> 
 that is, shall not be accepted of God as the seed of believing Abraham, 
 nor owned as having answered the intention of the law. To be Abraham's 
 children is to do the works of Abraham, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:39,40">John viii. 39, 40</A>.

 (2.) It is <I>that which is inward, of the heart, and in the 
 spirit.</I> It is the heart that God looks at, the circumcising of the
 heart that renders us acceptable to him. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:6">Deut. xxx. 6</A>.

 This is <I>the circumcision that is not made with hands,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:11,12">Col. ii. 11, 12</A>.

 <I>Casting away the body of sin.</I> So it is in the spirit, in our
 spirit as the subject, and wrought by God's Spirit as the author of it.

 (3.) The praise thereof, though it be <I>not of men,</I> who judge 
 according to outward appearance, yet it is <I>of God,</I> that is, God 
 himself will own and accept and crown this sincerity; for <I>he seeth 
 not as man seeth.</I> Fair pretences and a plausible profession may 
 deceive men: but God cannot be so deceived; he sees through shows to 
 realities. This is alike true of Christianity. He is not a Christian 
 that is one outwardly, nor is that baptism which is outward in the 
 flesh; but he is a Christian that is one inwardly, and baptism is that 
 of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not 
 of men but of God.</P>
