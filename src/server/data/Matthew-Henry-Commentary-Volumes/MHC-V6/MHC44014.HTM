 We have, in this chapter, a further account of the progress of the 
 gospel, by the ministry of Paul and Barnabas among the Gentiles; it 
 goes on conquering and to conquer, yet meeting with opposition, as 
 before, among the unbelieving Jews. Here is, 

 I. Their successful preaching of the gospel for some time at Iconium,
 and their being driven thence by the violence of their persecutors, 
 both Jews and Gentiles, and forced into the neighbouring countries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. Their healing a lame man at Lystra, and the profound veneration
 which the people conceived of them thereupon, which they had much ado 
 to keep from running into an extreme, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:8-18">ver. 8-18</A>.

 III. The outrage of the people against Paul, at the instigation of the
 Jews, the effect of which was that they stoned him, as they thought, to
 death; but he was wonderfully restored to life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:19,20">ver. 19, 20</A>.

 IV. The visit which Paul and Barnabas made to the churches which they 
 had planted, to confirm them, and put them into order, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:21-23">ver. 21-23</A>.

 V. They return to Antioch, whence they were sent forth; the good they
 did by the way, and the report they made to the church of Antioch of 
 their expedition, and, if I may so say, of the campaign they had made,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together
 into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great
 multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
 &nbsp; 2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made
 their minds evil affected against the brethren.
 &nbsp; 3 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord,
 which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted
 signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
 &nbsp; 4 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with
 the Jews, and part with the apostles.
 &nbsp; 5 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and
 also of the Jews with their rulers, to use <I>them</I> despitefully,
 and to stone them,
 &nbsp; 6 They were ware of <I>it,</I> and fled unto Lystra and Derbe,
 cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:
 &nbsp; 7 And there they preached the gospel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preaching of the gospel in Iconium, whither the apostles were 
 forced to retire from Antioch. As the blood of the martyrs has been the 
 seed of the church, so the banishment of the confessors has helped to 
 scatter that seed. Observe, 

 1. How they made the first offer of the gospel <I>to the Jews in their
 synagogues;</I> thither they went, not only as to a place of meeting, 
 but as to a place of meeting with them, to whom, wherever they came, 
 they were to apply themselves in the first place. Though the Jews at 
 Antioch had used them barbarously, yet they did not therefore decline 
 preaching the gospel to the Jews at Iconium, who perhaps might be 
 better disposed. Let not those of any denomination be condemned in the 
 gross, nor some suffer for others' faults; but let us do good to those 
 who have done evil to us. Though <I>the blood-thirsty hate the upright, 
 yet the just seek their soul</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:10">Prov. xxix. 10</A>),

 seek the salvation of it. 

 2. How the apostles concurred herein. Notice is taken of this, that
 <I>they went both together into the synagogue,</I> to testify their 
 unanimity and mutual affection, that people might say, <I>See how they 
 love one another,</I> and might think the better of Christianity, and 
 that they might strengthen one another's hands and confirm one 
 another's testimony, and <I>out of the mouth of two witnesses every 
 word might be established.</I> They did not go one one day and another 
 another, nor one go at the beginning and the other some time after; but 
 they went in both together.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The success of their preaching there: <I>They so spoke that a great 
 multitude,</I> some hundreds perhaps, if not thousands, <I>both of the 
 Jews and also of the Greeks,</I> that is the Gentiles, <I>believed.</I> 
 Observe here, 

 1. That the gospel was now preached to Jews and Gentiles together, and
 those of each denomination that believed came together into the church. 
 In the close of the foregoing chapter it was preached first to the 
 Jews, and some of them believed, and then to the Gentiles, and some of 
 them believed; but here they are put together, being put upon the same 
 level. The Jews have not so lost their preference as to be thrown 
 behind, only the Gentiles are brought to stand upon even terms with 
 them; <I>both are reconciled to God in one body</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:16">Ephes. ii. 16</A>),
 
 and both together admitted into the church without distinction.
 
 2. There seems to have been something remarkable in the manner of the 
 apostles' preaching here, which contributed to their success: <I>They 
 so spoke that a great multitude believed</I>--so plainly, so
 convincingly, with such an evidence and <I>demonstration of the 
 Spirit,</I> and <I>with such power;</I> they so spoke, so warmly, so 
 affectionately, and with such a manifest concern for the souls of men, 
 that one might perceive they were not only convinced, but filled, with 
 the things they spoke of, and that what they spoke came from the heart 
 and therefore was likely to reach to the heart; they so spoke, so 
 earnestly and so seriously, so boldly and courageously, that those who 
 heard them could not but say that <I>God was with them of a truth.</I> 
 Yet the success was not to be attributed to the manner of their 
 preaching, but to the Spirit of God, who made use of that means.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The opposition that their preaching met with there, and the 
 trouble that was created them; lest they should be puffed up with the 
 multitude of their converts, there was given them this thorn in the 
 flesh. 

 1. Unbelieving Jews were the first spring of their trouble here, as
 elsewhere

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 they <I>stirred up the Gentiles.</I> The influence which the gospel had 
 upon many of the Gentiles, and their embracing it, as it provoked some 
 of the Jews to a holy jealousy and stirred them up to receive the 
 gospel too 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:14">Rom. xi. 14</A>),

 so it provoked others of them to a wicked jealousy, and exasperated 
 them against the gospel. Thus as good instructions, so good examples, 
 which to some are a savour of life unto life, to others are a savour of 
 death unto death. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:15,16">2 Cor. ii. 15, 16</A>.

 2. Disaffected Gentiles, irritated by the unbelieving Jews, were likely
 to be the instruments of their trouble. The Jews, by false suggestions, 
 which they were continually buzzing in the ears of the Gentiles, made 
 <I>their minds evil affected against the brethren,</I> whom of 
 themselves they were inclined to think favourably of. They not only 
 took occasion in all companies, as it came in their way, but made it 
 their business to go purposely to such as they had any acquaintance 
 with, and said all that their wit or malice could invent to beget in 
 them not only a mean but an ill opinion of Christianity, telling them 
 how destructive it would certainly be to their pagan theology and 
 worship; and, for their parts, they would rather be Gentiles than 
 Christians. Thus they soured and embittered their spirits against both 
 the converters and the converted. <I>The old serpent</I> did, by their
 poisonous tongues, infuse his venom against <I>the seed of the 
 woman</I> into the minds of these Gentiles, and this was a <I>root of 
 bitterness in them, bearing gall and wormwood.</I> It is no wonder if 
 those who are ill affected towards good people wish ill to them, speak 
 ill of them, and contrive ill against them; it is all owing to ill 
 will. <B><I>Ekakosan,</I></B> <I>they molested</I> and vexed the minds
 of the Gentiles (so some of the critics take it); they were continually 
 teasing them with their impertinent solicitations. The tools of 
 persecutors have a dog's life, set on continually.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Their continuance in their work there, notwithstanding this 
 opposition, and God's owning them in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 We have here, 

 1. The apostles working for Christ, faithfully and diligently, 
 according to the trust committed to them. Because the minds of <I>the 
 Gentiles were evil affected against them,</I> one would think that 
 therefore they should have withdrawn, and hastened out of the way, or, 
 if they had preached, should have preached cautiously, for fear of 
 giving further provocation to those who were already enough enraged. 
 No; on the contrary, therefore <I>they abode there a long time, 
 speaking boldly in the Lord.</I> The more they perceived the spite and 
 rancour of the town against the new converts, the more they were 
 animated to go on in their work, and the more needful they saw it to 
 continue among them, <I>to confirm them in the faith, and to comfort 
 them. They spoke boldly,</I> and were not afraid of giving offence to 
 the unbelieving Jews. What God said to the prophet, with reference to 
 the unbelieving Jews in his day, was now made good to the apostles: 
 <I>I have made thy face strong against their faces,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:7-9">Ezek. iii. 7-9</A>.

 But observe what it was that animated them: <I>They spoke boldly in the
 Lord,</I> in his strength, and trusting in him to bear them out; not 
 depending upon any thing in themselves. <I>They were strong in the 
 Lord, and in the power of his might.</I>

 2. Christ working with the apostles, according to his promise, <I>Lo, I 
 am with you always.</I> When they went on in his name and strength, he 
 failed not to give testimony to the word of his grace. Note,

 (1.) The gospel is a word of grace, the assurance of God's good will to
 us and the means of his good work in us. It is the word of Christ's 
 grace, for it is in him alone that we find favour with God.

 (2.) Christ himself has attested this word of grace, who is <I>the 
 Amen, the faithful witness;</I> he has assured us that it is the word 
 of God, and that we may venture our souls upon it. As it was said in 
 general concerning the first preachers of the gospel that they had 
 <I>the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by signs 
 following</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:20">Mark xvi. 20</A>),

 so it is said particularly concerning the apostles here <I>that the 
 Lord confirmed their testimony, in granting signs and wonders to be 
 done by their hands</I>--in the miracles they wrought in the kingdom of
 nature--as well as the wonders done by their word, in the greater
 miracles wrought on men's minds by the power of divine grace. The Lord 
 was with them, while they were with him, and abundance of good was 
 done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The division which this occasioned in the city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The multitude of the city was divided</I> into two parties, and both 
 active and vigorous. Among the rulers and persons of rank, and among 
 the common people, there were some that held with the unbelieving Jews, 
 and others that held with the apostles. Barnabas is here reckoned an 
 apostle, though not one of the twelve, nor called in the extra-ordinary
 manner that Paul was, because set apart by special designation of 
 <I>the Holy Ghost to the service of the Gentiles.</I> It seems, this 
 business of the preaching of the gospel was so universally taken notice 
 of with concern that every person, even of <I>the multitude of the 
 city,</I> was either for it or against it; none stood neuter. "Either 
 for us or for our adversaries, for God or Baal, for Christ or 
 Beelzebub." 

 1. We may here see the meaning of Christ's prediction that he <I>came
 not to send peace upon earth, but rather division,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:51-53">Luke xii. 51-53</A>.
 
 If all would have given in unanimously into his measures, there would
 have been universal concord; and, could men have agreed in this, there 
 would have been no dangerous discord nor disagreement in other things; 
 but, disagreeing here, the breach was wide as the sea. Yet the
 apostles must not be blamed for coming to Iconium, although before they 
 came the city was united, and now it was divided; for it is better that 
 part of the city go to heaven than all to hell. 

 2. We may here take the measures of our expectations; let us not think
 it strange if the preaching of the gospel occasion division, nor be 
 offended at it; it is better to be reproached and persecuted as 
 dividers for swimming against the stream than yield ourselves to be 
 carried down the stream that leads to destruction. Let us hold with the 
 apostles, and not fear those that hold with the Jews.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The attempt made upon the apostles by their enemies. Their evil 
 affection against them broke out at length into violent outrages, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. Who the plotters were: <I>Both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their 
 rulers.</I> The Gentiles and Jews were at enmity with one another, and 
 yet united against Christians, like Herod and Pilate, Sadducees and 
 Pharisees, against Christ; and like <I>Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, of 
 old,</I> against Israel. If the church's enemies can thus unite for its 
 destruction, shall not its friends, laying aside all personal feuds, 
 unite for its preservation? 

 2. What the plot was. Having now got <I>the rulers</I> on their side,
 they doubted not but to carry their point, and their design was <I>to 
 use the apostles despitefully,</I> to expose them to disgrace, and then 
 <I>to stone them,</I> to put them to death; and thus they hoped to sink 
 their cause. They aimed to take away both their reputation and their 
 life, and this was all they had to lose which men could take from them, 
 for they had neither lands nor goods.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The deliverance of the apostles out of the hands of those 
 <I>wicked and unreasonable men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 They got away, upon notice given them of the design against them, or 
 the beginning of the attempt upon them, of which they were soon aware, 
 and they made an honourable retreat (for it was not an inglorious 
 flight) to <I>Lystra and Derbe;</I> and there,

 1. They found safety. Their persecutors in Iconium were for the present 
 satisfied that they were thrust out of their borders, and pursued them 
 no further. God has shelters for his people in a storm; nay, he is, and 
 will be, himself their hiding place.

 2. They found work, and this was what they went for. When the door of
 opportunity was shut against them at Iconium, it was opened at 
 <I>Lystra</I> and <I>Derbe.</I> To these cities they went, and there, 
 and <I>in the region that lieth round about, they preached the 
 gospel.</I> In times of persecution ministers may see cause to quit the 
 spot, when yet they do not quit the work.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
 being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:
 &nbsp; 9 The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and
 perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
 &nbsp; 10 Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he
 leaped and walked.
 &nbsp; 11 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up
 their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come
 down to us in the likeness of men.
 &nbsp; 12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius,
 because he was the chief speaker.
 &nbsp; 13 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city,
 brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done
 sacrifice with the people.
 &nbsp; 14 <I>Which</I> when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard <I>of,</I>
 they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
 &nbsp; 15 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of
 like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn
 from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and
 earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:
 &nbsp; 16 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own
 ways.
 &nbsp; 17 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he
 did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
 filling our hearts with food and gladness.
 &nbsp; 18 And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people,
 that they had not done sacrifice unto them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A miraculous cure wrought by Paul at Lystra upon a cripple that had 
 been lame from his birth, such a one as was miraculously cured by Peter 
 and John, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:2"><I>ch.</I> iii. 2</A>.

 That introduced the gospel among the Jews, this among the Gentiles;
 both that and this were designed to represent the impotency of all the 
 children of men in spiritual things: they are lame from their birth, 
 till the grace of God puts strength into them; for it was when we were 
 yet <I>without strength</I> that <I>Christ died for the ungodly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:6">Rom. v. 6</A>.
 
 Observe here, 
 
 1. The deplorable case of the poor cripple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 He was <I>impotent in his feet, disabled</I> (so the word is) to such a
 degree that it was impossible he should set his foot to the ground, to 
 lay any stress upon it. It was well known that he had been so <I>from 
 his mother's womb,</I> and that he <I>never had walked,</I> nor could 
 <I>stand up.</I> We should take occasion hence to thank God for the use 
 of our limbs; and those who are deprived of it may observe that their 
 case is not singular. 

 2. The expectation that was raised in him of a cure 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 He heard Paul preach, and, it is likely, was much affected with what he 
 heard, believed that the messengers, having their commission thence, 
 had a divine power going along with them, and were therefore able to 
 cure him of his lameness. This Paul was aware of, by the spirit of
 discerning that he had, and perhaps the aspect of his countenance did 
 in part witness for him: <I>Paul perceived that he had faith to be 
 healed;</I> desired it, hoped for it, had such a thing in his thoughts, 
 which it does not appear that the lame man Peter healed had, for he 
 expected no more than an <I>alms.</I> There <I>was not found such great 
 faith in Israel</I> as was among the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:10">Matt. viii. 10</A>.

 3. The cure wrought: <I>Paul, perceiving that he had faith to be
 healed,</I> brought <I>the word and healed him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:20">Ps. cvii. 20</A>.

 Note, God will not disappoint the desires that are of his own kindling,
 nor the hopes of his own raising. Paul spoke to him <I>with a loud
 voice,</I> either because he was at some distance, or to show that the 
 true miracles, wrought by the power of Christ, were far unlike the 
 lying wonders wrought by deceivers, <I>that peeped, and muttered, and 
 whispered,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19">Isa. viii. 19</A>.

 God saith, <I>I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the 
 earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:19">Isa. xlv. 19</A>.

 Paul spoke to him with a loud voice, that the people about might take
 notice, and have their expectations raised of the effect. It does not 
 appear that this cripple was a beggar; it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 <I>that he sat,</I> not that he sat begging. But we may imagine how
 melancholy it was to him to see other people walking about him, and 
 himself disabled; and therefore how welcome Paul's word was to him, 
 "<I>Stand upright on thy feet;</I> help thyself, and God shall help 
 thee; try whether thou hast strength, and thou shalt find that thou 
 hast." Some copies read it, <I>I say unto thee, in the name of the Lord 
 Jesus Christ, Stand upright on thy feet.</I> It is certain that this is 
 implied, and very probably was expressed, by Paul, and <I>power went 
 along with this word;</I> for presently <I>he leaped and walked,</I> 
 leaped up from the place where he sat, and not only <I>stood 
 upright,</I> but to show that he was perfectly cured, and that 
 immediately, he walked to and fro before them all. Herein the scripture 
 was fulfilled, that when <I>the wilderness of the Gentile world is made 
 to blossom as the rose then shall the lame man leap as a hart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:1,6">Isa. xxxv. 1, 6</A>.

 Those that by the grace of God are cured of their spiritual lameness
 must show it by leaping with a holy exultation and walking in a holy 
 conversation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The impression which this cure made upon the people: they were 
 amazed at it, had never seen nor heard the like, and fell into an 
 ecstacy of wonder. Paul and Barnabas were strangers, exiles, refugees, 
 in their country; every thing concurred to make them mean and 
 despicable: yet the working of this one miracle was enough to make them 
 in the eyes of this people truly great and honourable, though the 
 multitude of Christ's miracles could not screen him from the utmost 
 contempt among the Jews. We find here, 
 
 1. The people take them for gods

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>They lifted up their voices</I> with an air of triumph, saying in
 their own language (for it was the common people that said it), <I>in 
 the speech of Lycaonia,</I> which was a dialect of the Greek, <I>The 
 gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</I> They imagined that 
 Paul and Barnabas had dropped down to them out of the clouds, and that 
 they were some divine powers, no less than gods, though in the likeness 
 of men. This notion of the thing agreed well enough with the pagan 
 theology, and the fabulous account they had of the visits which their 
 gods made to this lower world; and proud enough they were to think that 
 they should have a visit made to them. They carried this notion so far 
 here that they pretended to tell which of their gods they were, 
 according to the ideas their poets had given them of the gods 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 <I>They called Barnabas Jupiter;</I> for, if they will have him to be a 
 god, it is as easy to make him the prince of their gods as not. It is
 probable that he was the senior, and the more portly comely man, that 
 had something of majesty in his countenance. And <I>Paul they called
 Mercury,</I> who was the messenger of the gods, that was sent on their 
 errands; for Paul, though he had not the appearance that Barnabas had, 
 was <I>the chief speaker,</I> and had a greater command of language, 
 and perhaps appeared to have something mercurial in his temper and 
 genius. <I>Jupiter</I> used to take <I>Mercury</I> along with him, they 
 said, and, if he make a visit to their city, they will suppose he does 
 so now. 

 2. The priest thereupon prepares <I>to do sacrifice to them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 The temple of Jupiter was, it seems, before the gate of their city, as 
 its protector and guardian; and the priest of that idol and temple, 
 hearing the people cry out thus, took the hint presently, and thought 
 it was time for him to bestir himself to do his duty: many a costly 
 sacrifice he had offered to the image of Jupiter, but if Jupiter be 
 among them <I>himself--in propria persona,</I> it concerns him to do
 him the utmost honours imaginable; and the people are ready to join 
 with him in it. See how easily vain minds are carried away with a
 popular outcry. If the crowd give a shout, Here is Jupiter, the priest 
 of Jupiter takes the first hint, and offers his service immediately. 
 When Christ, the Son of God, came down, and appeared in the likeness of 
 men, and did many, very many miracles, yet they were so far from doing 
 sacrifice to him that they made him a sacrifice to their pride and 
 malice: <I>He was in the world, and the world knew him not; he came to 
 his own, and his own received him not;</I> but Paul and Barnabas, upon 
 the working of one miracle, are immediately deified. The same power of 
 the god of this world which prejudices the carnal mind against truth 
 makes errors and mistakes to find easy admission; and both ways his 
 turn is served. They <I>brought oxen,</I> to be sacrificed <I>to them, 
 and garlands,</I> with which to crown the sacrifices. These garlands 
 were made up of flowers and ribbons; and they gilded the horns of the 
 oxen they sacrificed.</P>

 III. Paul and Barnabas protest against this undue respect paid them, 
 and with much ado prevent it. Many of the heathen emperors called 
 themselves <I>gods,</I> and took a pride in having divine honours paid 
 them: but Christ's ministers, though real benefactors to mankind, while 
 these tyrants only pretended to be so, refused those honours when they 
 were so tendered. Whose successor therefore he is who <I>sits in the 
 temple of God,</I> and shows <I>that he is god</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:4">2 Thess. ii. 4</A>),

 and who is adored as <I>our lord god,</I> the pope, it is easy to say.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The holy indignation which Paul and Barnabas conceived at this: 
 <I>When they heard this, they rent their clothes.</I> We do not find 
 that they rent their clothes when the people vilified them, and spoke 
 of stoning them; they could bear this without disturbance: but when 
 they deified them, and spoke of worshipping them, they could not bear 
 it, but rent their clothes, as being more concerned for God's honour 
 than their own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The pains they took to prevent it. They did not connive at it, nor 
 say, "If people will be deceived, let them be deceived," much less 
 suggest to themselves and one another that it might contribute both to 
 the safety of their persons and the success of their ministry if they 
 suffered the people to continue in this mistake, and so they might make 
 a good hand of an ill thing. No, God's truth needs not the service of 
 man's lie. Christ had put honour enough upon them in making them 
 apostles, they needed not assume either the honour of princes or the 
 honour of gods; they appeared with much more magnificent titles when 
 they were called <I>the ambassadors of Christ,</I> and <I>the stewards 
 of the mysteries of God,</I> than when they were called Jupiter and 
 Mercury. Let us see how they prevented it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>They ran in among the people,</I> as soon as they heard of it, 
 and would not so much as stay awhile to see what the people would do. 
 Their running in, like servants, among the people, showed that they 
 were far from looking upon themselves as gods, or taking state upon 
 them; they did not stand still, expecting honours to be done them, but 
 plainly declined them by thrusting themselves into the crowd. They ran 
 in, as men in earnest, with as much concern as Aaron <I>ran in between 
 the living and the dead,</I> when the plague was begun.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They reasoned with them, <I>crying out,</I> that all might hear, 
 "<I>Sirs, why do you these things?</I>" Why do you go about to make 
 gods of us? It is the most absurd thing you can do; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] "Our nature will not admit it: <I>We also are men of like passions 
 with you</I>" <B><I>homoiopatheis</I></B>: it is the same word that is 
 used concerning Elias, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:18">Jam. v. 18</A>,

 where we render it, <I>subject to like passions as we are.</I> "We are 
 men, and therefore you wrong yourselves if you expect that from us 
 which is to be had in God only; and you wrong God if you give that 
 honour to us, or to any other man, which is to be given to God only. We 
 not only have such bodies as you see, but <I>are of like passions with 
 you,</I> have <I>hearts fashioned like as other men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:15">Ps. xxxiii. 15</A>);

 for, <I>as in water face answers to face, so doth the heart of man to
 man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:19">Prov. xxvii. 19</A>.

 We are naturally subject to the same infirmities of the human nature, 
 and liable to the same calamities of the human life; not only men, but 
 sinful men and suffering men, and therefore will not be deified."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] "Our doctrine is directly against it. Must we be added to the 
 number of your gods whose business it is to abolish the gods you have? 
 <I>We preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities unto the 
 living God.</I> If we should suffer this, we should confirm you in that 
 which it is our business to convert you from:" and so they take this 
 occasion to show them how just and necessary it was that they should 
 <I>turn to God from idols,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:9">1 Thess. i. 9</A>.

 When they preached to the Jews, who hated idolatry, they had nothing to
 do but to preach the grace of God in Christ, and needed not, as the 
 prophets in dealing with their fathers, to preach against idolatry: 
 but, when they had to do with the Gentiles, they must rectify their 
 mistakes in natural religion, and bring them off from the gross 
 corruptions of that. See here what they preached to the Gentiles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> That the gods which they and their fathers worshipped, 
 and all the ceremonies of their worship of them were <I>vanities,</I> 
 idle things, unreasonable, unprofitable, which no rational account 
 could be given of, nor any real advantage gained from. Idols are often 
 called vanities in the Old Testament, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:21,1Ki+10:13.Jer+14:22">Deut. xxxii. 21; 
 1 Kings x. 13; Jer. xiv. 22</A>.

 <I>An idol is nothing in the world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:4">1 Cor. viii. 4</A>):

 it is not at all what it is pretended to be, it is a cheat, it is a
 counterfeit; it deceives those that trust to it and expect relief from 
 it. Therefore <I>turn from these vanities,</I> turn from them with 
 abhorrence and detestation, as Ephraim did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:8">Hos. xiv. 8</A>):

 "<I>What have I to do any more with idols?</I> I will never again be 
 thus imposed upon."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> That the God to whom they would have them <I>turn</I> 
 is <I>the living God.</I> They had hitherto worshipped dead images, 
 that were utterly unable to help them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:9">Isa. lxiv. 9</A>),

 or (as they now attempted) dying men, that would soon be disabled to
 help them; but now they are persuaded to worship a living God, who has 
 life in himself, and life for us, and lives for evermore.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> That this God is the creator of the world, the fountain 
 of all being and power: "He <I>made heaven and earth, and the sea, and 
 all things therein,</I> even those things which you worship as gods, so 
 that he <I>is the God</I> of your gods. You worship gods which you 
 made, the creatures of your own fancy, and the work of your own hands. 
 We call you to worship the true God, and cheat not yourselves with 
 pretenders; worship the Sovereign Lord of all, and disparage not 
 yourselves in bowing down to his creatures and subjects."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> That the world owed it to his patience that he had not 
 destroyed them long ere this for their idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>In times past,</I> for many ages, unto this day, he <I>suffered all 
 nations to walk in their own ways.</I> These idolaters, that were 
 called from the service of other gods, might think, "Have we not served 
 these gods hitherto, and our fathers before us, time out of mind; and 
 why may we not as well go on to serve them still?"--No, your serving
 them was a trial of God's patience, and it was a miracle of mercy that 
 you were not cut off for it. But, though he did not destroy you for it 
 while you were in ignorance, and knew no better

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:30"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 30</A>)

 yet now that he has sent his gospel into the world, and by it has made
 a clear discovery of himself and his will to <I>all nations,</I> and 
 not to the Jews only, if you still continue in your idolatry he will 
 not bear with you as he has done. All the nations that had not the 
 benefit of divine revelation, that is, all but the Jews, <I>he suffered 
 to walk in their own ways,</I> for they had nothing to check them, or 
 control them, but their own consciences, their own thoughts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:15">Rom. ii. 15</A>),

 no scriptures, no prophets; and then they were the more excusable if 
 they mistook their way: but now that God has sent a revelation into the 
 world which is to be published to <I>all nations</I> the case is 
 altered. We may understand it as a judgment upon all nations that
 <I>God suffered them to walk in their own ways, gave them up to their 
 own hearts' lusts;</I> but now the time is come when <I>the veil of the 
 covering spread over all nations should be taken off</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:7">Isa. xxv. 7</A>),
 
 and now you will no longer be excused in these vanities, but must turn 
 from them. Note, 

 1. God's patience with us hitherto should <I>lead us to
 repentance,</I> and not encourage us to presume upon the continuance of 
 it, while we continue to provoke him. 

 2. Our having done ill while we were in ignorance will not bear us out
 in doing ill when we are better taught.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fifthly,</I> That even when they were not under the direction and 
 correction of the word of God, yet they might have known, and should 
 have known, to do better by the works of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Though the Gentiles had not the <I>statutes and judgments</I> that the 
 Jews had to witness for God against all pretenders, no tables of 
 testimony or tabernacle of testimony, yet <I>he left not himself 
 without witness;</I> besides <I>the witness</I> for God within them 
 (the dictates of natural conscience), they had <I>witnesses</I> for God 
 round about them--the bounty of common providence. Their having no
 scriptures did in part excuse them, and therefore God did not destroy 
 them for their idolatry, as he did the Jewish nation. This however did 
 not wholly excuse them, but that notwithstanding this they were highly 
 criminal and deeply guilty before God; for there were other 
 <I>witnesses</I> for God, sufficient to inform them that he and he only 
 is to be worshipped, and that to him they owed all their services from 
 whom they received all their comforts, and therefore that they were 
 guilty of the highest injustice and ingratitude imaginable, in 
 alienating them from him. God, having <I>not left himself without 
 witness,</I> has not left us without a guide, and so has left us 
 without excuse; for whatever is a witness for God is a witness against 
 us, if we give that glory to any other which is due to him only. 

 1. The bounties of common providence witness to us that there is a God,
 for they are all dispensed wisely and with design. The <I>rain and 
 fruitful seasons</I> could not come by chance, nor <I>are there any of 
 the vanities of the heathen that can give rain,</I> neither <I>can the 
 heavens</I> of themselves <I>give showers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:22">Jer. xiv. 22</A>.

 All the powers of nature witness to us a sovereign power in the God of 
 nature, from whom they are derived, and on whom they depend. It is not 
 the heaven that gives us rain, but God that gives us rain from heaven, 
 he is the Father of the rain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:28">Job xxxviii. 28</A>.

 2. The benefits we have by these bounties witness to us that we ought
 to make our acknowledgments not to the creatures who are made 
 serviceable to us, but to the Creator who makes them so. <I>He left not 
 himself without witness, in that he did good.</I> God seems to reckon 
 the instances of his <I>goodness</I> to be more pregnant, cogent proofs 
 of his title to our homage and adoration than the evidences of his 
 <I>greatness;</I> for his goodness is his glory. <I>The earth is full 
 of his goodness; his tender mercies are over all his works;</I> and 
 therefore <I>they praise him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:9,10">Ps. cxlv. 9, 10</A>.

 God does us good, in preserving to us his air to breathe in, his ground
 to go upon, the light of his sun to see by; but, because the most 
 sensible instance of the goodness of Providence to each of us in 
 particular is that of the daily provision made by it of meat and drink 
 for us, the apostle chooses to insist upon that, and shows how God does 
 us good,

 (1.) In preparing it for us, and that by a long train of causes which
 depend upon him as the first cause: <I>The heavens hear the earth; the
 earth hears the corn, and wine, and oil; and they hear Jezreel.</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:21,22">Hos. ii. 21, 22</A>.

 He does us good in giving us rain from heaven--rain for us to drink,
 for if there were no rain there would be no springs of water and we 
 should soon die for thirst--rain for our land to drink, for our meat as
 well as drink we have from the rain; in giving us this, he <I>gives us 
 fruitful seasons. If the heavens be as iron, the earth</I> will soon 
 <I>be as brass,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:19">Lev. xxvi. 19</A>.

 <I>This is the river of God</I> which <I>greatly enriches the 
 earth,</I> and by <I>it God prepares us corn,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:9-13">Ps. lxv. 9-13</A>.

 Of all the common operations of providence, the heathen chose to form
 their notion of the supreme God by that which bespeaks terror, and is 
 proper to strike an awe of him upon us, and this was <I>the 
 thunder;</I> and therefore they called Jupiter <I>the thunderer,</I>
 and represented him with a thunderbolt in his hand; and it appears by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:3">Ps. xxix. 3</A>

 that this ought not to be overlooked; but the apostle here, to engage
 us to worship God, sets before us his beneficence, that we may have 
 good thoughts of him in every thing wherein we have to do with him--may
 love him and delight in him, as one that does good, does good to us, 
 does good to all, in giving <I>rain from heaven and fruitful 
 seasons;</I> and if at any time rain be withheld, or the seasons be 
 unfruitful, we may thank ourselves; it is our sin <I>that turns away 
 these good things from us</I> which were coming to us, and stops the 
 current of God's favours.

 (2.) In giving us the comforts of it. It is he <I>that fills our hearts
 with food and gladness.</I> God <I>is rich in mercy to all</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:12">Rom. x. 12</A>):
 
 <I>he gives us richly all things to enjoy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:17">1 Tim. vi. 17</A>),

 is not only a benefactor, but a bountiful one, not only <I>gives us the 
 things we need,</I> but <I>gives us to enjoy them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:24">Eccl. ii. 24</A>):
 
 <I>He fills our hearts with food,</I> that is, he gives us food to our 
 hearts' content, or according to our hearts' desire; not merely for 
 necessity, but plenty, dainty, and variety. Even those nations that had 
 lost the knowledge of him, and worshipped other gods, yet he <I>filled 
 their houses, filled their mouths, filled their bellies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:18,Ps+17:14">Job xxii. 18; Ps. xvii. 14</A>)

 <I>with good things.</I> The Gentiles that <I>lived without God in the 
 world,</I> yet lived upon God, which Christ urges as a reason why we 
 should <I>do good to those that hate us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:44,45">Matt. v. 44, 45</A>.

 Those heathen had <I>their hearts filled with food;</I> this was their 
 felicity and satisfaction, they desired no more; but <I>these things 
 will not fill the soul</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:19">Ezek. vii. 19</A>),

 nor will those that know how to value their own souls be satisfied with
 them; but the apostles put themselves in as sharers in the divine 
 beneficence. We must all own that God fills our hearts with food and 
 gladness; not only <I>food,</I> that we may live, but <I>gladness,</I> 
 that we may live cheerfully; to him we owe it that we do not <I>all our 
 days eat in sorrow.</I> Note, We must thank God, not only for our food, 
 but for our gladness--that he gives us leave to be cheerful, cause to be
 cheerful, and hearts to be cheerful. And, if <I>our hearts be filled 
 with food and gladness,</I> they ought to be filled with love and 
 thankfulness, and enlarged in duty and obedience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:10,28:47">Deut. viii. 10; xxviii. 47</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The success of this prohibition which the apostles gave 
 to <I>the people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 By <I>these sayings,</I> with much ado, they <I>restrained the people 
 from doing sacrifice to them,</I> so strongly were these idolaters set 
 upon their idolatry. It was not enough for the apostles to refuse to be 
 deified (this would be construed only a pang of modesty), but they 
 resented it, they showed the people the evil of it, and all little 
 enough, for they could <I>scarcely</I> restrain them from it, and some 
 of them were ready to blame the priest, that he did not go on with his 
 business notwithstanding. We may see here what gave rise to the pagan 
 idolatry; it was terminating those regards in the instruments of our 
 comfort which should have passed through them to the Author. Paul and 
 Barnabas had cured a cripple, and therefore the people deified them, 
 instead of glorifying God for giving them such power, which should make 
 us very cautious that we do not give that honour to another, or take it 
 to ourselves, which is due to God only.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of the services and sufferings of Paul 
 and Barnabas.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How Paul was stoned and left for dead, but miraculously came to 
 himself again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 They fell upon Paul rather than Barnabas, because Paul, being the chief 
 speaker, galled and vexed them more than Barnabas did. Now observe 
 here,

 1. How the people were incensed against Paul; not by any injury they 
 pretended he had done them (if they took it for an affront that he 
 would not let them misplace divine honours upon him, when they 
 considered themselves they would easily forgive him that wrong), but 
 <I>there came certain Jews from Antioch,</I> hearing, it is likely, and 
 vexed to hear, what respect was shown to Paul and Barnabas at Lystra; 
 and they incensed the people against them, as factious, seditious, 
 dangerous persons, not fit to be harboured. See how restless the rage
 of the Jews was against the gospel of Christ; they could not bear that 
 it should have footing any where. 

 2. To what degree they were incensed by these barbarous Jews: they were
 irritated to such a degree that the mob rose and <I>stoned Paul,</I> 
 not by a judicial sentence, but in a popular tumult; they threw stones 
 at him, with which they knocked him down, and then <I>drew him out of 
 the city,</I> as one not fit to live in it, or drew him out upon a 
 sledge or in a cart, to bury him, <I>supposing he had been dead.</I> So 
 strong is the bias of the corrupt and carnal heart to that which is 
 evil, even in contrary extremes, that, as it is with great difficulty 
 that men are restrained from evil on one side, so it is with great ease 
 that they are persuaded to evil on the other side. See how fickle and 
 mutable the minds of carnal worldly people are, that do not know and 
 consider things. Those that but the other day would have treated the 
 apostles as more than men now treat them as worse than brutes, as the 
 worst of men, as the worst of male-factors. To-day <I>Hosanna,</I>
 to-morrow <I>Crucify;</I> to-day sacrificed to, to-morrow sacrificed.
 We have an instance of a change the other way,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:1-16"><I>ch.</I> xxviii</A>.

 <I>This man is a murderer,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>;

 no doubt <I>he is a god,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Popular breath turns like the wind. If Paul would have been Mercury, he
 might have been enthroned, nay, he might have been enshrined; but, if 
 he will be a faithful minister of Christ, he shall be stoned, and 
 thrown out of the city. Thus those who easily submit to strong 
 delusions hate to receive the truth in the love of it. 

 3. How he was delivered by the power of God: When he was <I>drawn out
 of the city, the disciples stood round about him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 It seems there were some here at Lystra that became disciples, that 
 found the mean between deifying the apostles and rejecting them; and 
 even these new converts had courage to own Paul when he was thus run 
 down, though they had reason enough to fear that the same that stoned 
 him would stone them for owning him. They stood round about him, as a 
 guard to him against the further outrage of the people--stood about him
 to see whether he were alive or dead; and all of a sudden <I>he rose 
 up.</I> Though he was not dead, yet he was ill crushed and bruised, no 
 doubt, and fainted away; he was in a <I>deliquium,</I> so that it was 
 not without a miracle that he came so soon to himself, and was so well 
 as to be able to go into the city. Note, God's faithful servants,
 though they may be brought within a step of death, and may be looked 
 upon as dead both by friends and enemies, shall not die as long as he 
 has work for them to do. They <I>are cast down, but not destroyed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:9">2 Cor. iv. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they went on with their work, notwithstanding the opposition 
 they met with. All the stones they threw at Paul could not beat him off 
 from his work: They <I>drew him out of the city</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 but, as one that set them at defiance, he <I>came into the city</I> 
 again, to show that he did not fear them; <I>none</I> even <I>of these 
 things move him.</I> However, their being persecuted here is a known 
 indication to them to seek for opportunities of usefulness elsewhere, 
 and therefore for the present they quit Lystra.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They went to break up and sow fresh ground at <I>Derbe.</I> Thither 
 the next day <I>Paul and Barnabas departed,</I> a city not far off; 
 there they preached the gospel, there they <I>taught many,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 And it should seem that Timothy was of that city, and was one of the 
 disciples that now attended Paul, had met him at Antioch and 
 accompanied him in all this circuit; for, with reference to this story, 
 Paul tells him how fully <I>he had known the afflictions he endured at 
 Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:10,11">2 Tim. iii. 10, 11</A>.

 Nothing is recorded that happened at Derbe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They returned, and went over their work again, watering what they 
 had sown; and, having staid as long as they thought fit at Derbe, they 
 came back to Lystra, to Iconium, and Antioch, the cities where they had 
 preached, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Now, as we have had a very instructive account of the methods they took 
 in laying the foundation, and beginning the good work, so here we have 
 the like of their building upon that foundation, and carrying on that 
 good work. Let us see what they did,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They <I>confirmed the souls of the disciples;</I> that is, they 
 inculcated that upon them which was proper to confirm them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Young converts are apt to waver, and a little thing shocks them. Their 
 old acquaintances beg they will not leave them. Those that they look 
 upon to be wiser than themselves set before them the absurdity, 
 indecency, and danger, of a change. They were allured, by the prospect 
 of preferment, to stick to the traditions of their fathers; they are 
 frightened with the danger of swimming against the stream. All this 
 tempts them to think of making a retreat in time; but the apostles come 
 and tell them that <I>this is the true grace of God wherein they 
 stand,</I> and therefore they must stand to it that there is no danger 
 like that of losing their part in Christ, no advantage like that of 
 keeping their hold of him; that, whatever their trials may be, they 
 shall have strength from Christ to pass through them; and, whatever 
 their losses may be, they shall be abundantly recompensed. And this 
 <I>confirms the souls of the disciples;</I> it fortifies their pious 
 resolutions, in the strength of Christ, to adhere to Christ whatever it 
 may cost them. Note, 

 [1.] Those that are converted need to be confirmed; those that are 
 planted need to be rooted. Ministers' work is to establish saints as 
 well as to awaken sinners. <I>Non minor est virtus quam quoerere parta 
 tueri--To retain is sometimes as difficult as to acquire.</I> Those
 that were instructed in the truth must know the certainty of the things 
 in which they have been instructed; and those that are resolved must be 
 fixed in their resolutions. 

 [2.] True confirmation is confirmation of the soul; it is not binding 
 the body by severe penalties on apostates, but binding the soul. The 
 best ministers can do this only by pressing those things which are 
 proper to bind the soul; it is the grace of God, and nothing less, that 
 can effectually <I>confirm the souls of the disciples,</I> and prevent 
 their apostasy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>They exhorted them to continue in the faith;</I> or, as it may 
 be read, <I>they encouraged them.</I> They told them it was both their 
 duty and interest to persevere; to abide in the belief of Christ's 
 being the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world. Note, Those that 
 are in the faith are concerned to <I>continue in the faith,</I> 
 notwithstanding all the temptations they may be under to desert it, 
 from the smiles or frowns of this world. And it is requisite that they 
 should often be exhorted to do so. Those that are continually 
 surrounded with temptations to apostasy have need to be continually 
 attended with pressing exhortations to perseverance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That which they insisted most upon was <I>that we must through 
 much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</I> Not only 
 <I>they</I> must, but <I>we</I> must; it must be counted upon that all 
 who will go to heaven must expect tribulation and persecution in their 
 way thither. But is this the way to <I>confirm the souls of the 
 disciples,</I> and to engage them to <I>continue in the faith?</I> One 
 would think it would rather shock them, and make them weary. No, as the 
 matter is fairly stated and taken entire, it will help to confirm them, 
 and fix them for Christ. It is true they will meet with tribulation, 
 with much tribulation; that is the worst of it: but then, 

 [1.] It is so appointed. They must undergo it, there is no remedy, the 
 matter is already fixed, and cannot be altered. He that has the 
 sovereign disposal of us has determined it to be our lot that all that 
 <I>will live godly in Christ Jesus should suffer persecution;</I> and 
 he that has the sovereign command over us has determined this to be our 
 duty, that all that will be Christ's disciples must <I>take up their 
 cross.</I> When we gave up our names to Jesus Christ it was what we 
 agreed to; when we sat down and counted the cost, if we reckoned 
 aright, it was what we counted upon; so that if <I>tribulation and 
 persecution arise because of the word</I> it is but what we had notice 
 of before, it must be so: <I>he performeth the thing that is appointed 
 for us.</I> The matter is fixed unalterably; and <I>shall the rock 
 be</I> for us <I>removed out of its place?</I> 

 [2.] It is the lot of the leaders in Christ's army, as well as of the 
 soldiers. It is not only <I>you,</I> but <I>we,</I> that (if it be 
 thought a hardship) are subject to it; therefore, as your own
 sufferings must not be a stumbling-block to you, so neither must ours;
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:3">1 Thess. iii. 3</A>.

 <I>Let none be moved by our afflictions, for you yourselves know that
 we are appointed thereunto.</I> As Christ did not put the apostles upon 
 any harder service than what he underwent before them, so neither did 
 the apostles put the ordinary Christians.

 [3.] It is true we must count upon <I>much tribulation,</I> but this is 
 encouraging, that we shall get through it; we shall not be lost and 
 perish in it. It is a Red Sea, but the Lord has opened a way through 
 it, for <I>the redeemed of the Lord to pass over.</I> We must go down 
 to trouble, but we shall come up again. 

 [4.] We shall not only get through it, but get through it <I>into the 
 kingdom of God;</I> and the joy and glory of the end will make abundant 
 amends for all the difficulties and hardships we may meet with in the 
 way. It is true <I>we must go by the cross,</I> but it is as true that 
 if we keep in the way, and do not turn aside nor turn back, we shall 
 <I>go to the crown,</I> and the believing prospect of this will make 
 the tribulation easy and pleasant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) <I>They ordained them elders,</I> or presbyters, <I>in every 
 church.</I> Now at this second visit they settled them in some order, 
 formed them into religious societies under the guidance of a settled 
 ministry, and settled that distinction between those that are taught in 
 the word and those that teach. 

 [1.] Every church had its governors or presidents, whose office it was
 to pray with the members of the church, and to preach to them in their 
 solemn assemblies, to administer all gospel ordinances to them, and to 
 take the oversight of them, <I>to instruct the ignorant, warn the 
 unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, and convince gainsayers.</I> It is 
 requisite that every particular church should have one or more such to 
 preside in it. 

 [2.] Those governors were then elders, that had in their qualification 
 the wisdom and gravity of seniors, and had in their commission the 
 authority and command of seniors: not to make new laws (this is the 
 prerogative of the Prince, the great Lawgiver; the government of the 
 church is an absolute monarchy, and the legislative power entirely in 
 Christ), but to see to the observance and execution of the laws Christ 
 has made; and so far they are to be obeyed and submitted to. 

 [3.] These elders were <I>ordained.</I> The qualifications of such as 
 were proposed or proposed themselves (whether the apostles or the 
 people put them up) were judged of by the apostles, as most fit to 
 judge; and they, having <I>devoted</I> themselves, were solemnly set 
 <I>apart</I> to the work of the ministry, and bound to it.

 [4.] These elders were ordained to them, to the disciples, to their 
 service, for their good. Those that are in the faith have need to be
 built up in it, and have need of the elders' help therein--the
 <I>pastors and teachers,</I> who are <I>to edify the body of 
 Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) <I>By prayer</I> joined with <I>fasting</I> they <I>commended them
 to the Lord,</I> to the Lord Jesus, <I>on whom they believed.</I> Note, 
 
 [1.] Even when persons are brought to believe, and that sincerely, yet 
 ministers' care concerning them is not over; there is need of watching 
 over them still, instructing and admonishing them still; there is still 
 that lacking in their faith which needs to be perfected. 

 [2.] The ministers that take most care of those that believe must after 
 all commend them to the Lord, and put them under the protection and 
 guidance of his grace: <I>Lord, keep them through thine own name.</I> 
 To his custody they must commit themselves, and their ministers must 
 commit them. 

 [3.] It is by prayer that they must be commended to the Lord. Christ, 
 in his prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1-26">John xvii.</A>),

 commended his disciples to his Father: <I>Thine they were, and thou
 gavest them to me. Father, keep them.</I> 

 [4.] It is a great encouragement to us, in commending the disciples to 
 the Lord, that we can say, "It is he in whom they believed; we commit 
 to him those who have committed themselves to him, and who know they 
 have <I>believed in one who is able to keep what they</I> and we have 
 <I>committed to him against</I> that day," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:12">2 Tim. i. 12</A>.

 [5.] It is good to join fasting with prayer, in token of our
 humiliation for sin, and in order to add vigour to our prayers. 

 [6.] When we are parting with our friends, the best farewell is to 
 commend them to the Lord, and to leave them with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They went on preaching the gospel in other places where they had 
 been, but, as it should seem had not made so many converts as that now 
 at their return they could form them into churches; therefore thither 
 they came to pursue and carry on conversion-work. From Antioch they 
 <I>passed through Pisidia,</I> the province in which that Antioch 
 stood; thence they came into the province of <I>Pamphylia,</I> the 
 head-city of which was <I>Perga,</I> where they had been before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:13"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 13</A>),

 and came thither again to <I>preach the word</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 making a second offer, to see if they were now better disposed than 
 they were before to receive the gospel. What success they had there we 
 are not told, but that thence they <I>went down to Attalia,</I> a city 
 of Pamphylia, on the sea-coast. They staid not long at a place, but 
 wherever they came endeavoured to lay a foundation which might 
 afterwards be built upon, and to sow the seeds which would in time 
 produce a great increase. Now Christ's parables were explained, in 
 which he compared the kingdom of heaven to a little leaven, which in 
 time leavened the whole lump--to a grain of mustard-seed, which, though
 very inconsiderable at first, grew to a great tree--and to the seed
 which a man sowed in his ground, and it sprung up he knew not how.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How they at length came back to Antioch in Syria, whence they had 
 been sent forth upon this expedition. From Attalia they came by sea to 
 Antioch, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 
 And we are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Why they came thither: because <I>thence they had been recommended 
 to the grace of God,</I> and such a value did they put upon a solemn 
 recommendation to the grace of God, though they had themselves a great 
 interest in heaven, that they never thought they could show respect 
 enough to those who had so recommended them. The brethren having 
 recommended them to the grace of God, for the work <I>which they 
 fulfilled,</I> now that they had fulfilled it they thought they owed 
 them an account of it, that they might help them by their praises, as 
 they had been helped by their prayers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What account they gave them of their negociation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 They <I>gathered the church together.</I> It is probable that there 
 were more Christians at Antioch than ordinarily met, or could meet, in 
 one place, but on this occasion they called together the <I>leading 
 men</I> of them; as the heads of the tribes are often called the 
 <I>congregation</I> of Israel, so the ministers and principal members 
 of the church at Antioch are called the <I>church.</I> Or perhaps as 
 many of the people as the place would hold came together on this 
 occasion. Or some met at one time, or in one place, and others at 
 another. But when they had called them together, they gave them an 
 account of two things--

 (1.) Of the tokens they had had of the divine presence with them in 
 their labours: <I>They rehearsed all that God had done with them.</I> 
 They did not tell what <I>they</I> had done (this would have savoured 
 of vain-glory), but what God had done with them and by them. Note, The 
 praise of all the little good we do at any time must be ascribed to 
 God; for it is he that not only worketh in us both to will and to do, 
 but then worketh with us to make what we do successful. God's grace
 can do any thing without ministers' preaching; but ministers' 
 preaching, even Paul's, can do nothing without God's grace; and the 
 operations of that grace must be acknowledged in the efficacy of the 
 word. 

 (2.) Of the fruit of their labours among the heathen. They told how 
 <I>God had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles;</I> had not only 
 ordered them to be invited to the gospel feast, but had inclined the 
 hearts of many of them to accept the invitation. Note, 

 [1.] There is no entering into the kingdom of Christ but by the door of 
 faith; we must firmly believe in Christ, or we have no part in him.
 
 [2.] It is God that opens the door of faith, that opens to us the 
 truths we are to believe, opens our hearts to receive them, and makes 
 this a wide door, and an effectual, into the church of Christ. 

 [3.] We have reason to be thankful that God has <I>opened the door of 
 faith to the Gentiles,</I> has both sent them his gospel, which is 
 <I>made known to all nations for the obedience of faith</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:26">Rom. xvi. 26</A>),

 and has also given them hearts to entertain the gospel. Thus the gospel 
 was spread, and it shone more and more, and none was able to shut this 
 door which God had opened; not all the powers of hell and earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How they disposed of themselves for the present: <I>There they abode 
 a long time with the disciples</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 longer than perhaps at first they intended, not because they <I>feared 
 their enemies,</I> but because they <I>loved their friends,</I> and 
 were loth to part from them.</P>
