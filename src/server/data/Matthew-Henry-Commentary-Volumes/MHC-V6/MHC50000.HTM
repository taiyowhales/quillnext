 P<FONT SIZE=-1>HILIPPI</FONT>

 was a chief city of the western part of Macedonia, <B><I>prote tes 
 meridos tes Makedonias polis,</I></B>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:12">Acts xvi. 12</A>.

 It took its name from Philip, the famous king of Macedon, who repaired
 and beautified it, and it was afterwards made a Roman colony. Near this 
 place were the <I>Campi Philippici,</I> remarkable for the famous 
 battles between Julius C&aelig;sar and Pompey the Great, and that 
 between Augustus and Antony on one side and Cassius and Brutus on the 
 other. But it is most remarkable among Christians for this epistle, 
 which was written when Paul was a prisoner at Rome, A.D. 62. Paul seems 
 to have had a very particular kindness for the church at Philippi, 
 which he himself had been instrumental in planting; and, though he had 
 <I>the care of all the churches,</I> he had, upon that account, a 
 particular fatherly tender care of this. To those to whom God has 
 employed us to do any good we should look upon ourselves both as 
 encouraged and engaged to study to do more good. He looked upon them as 
 his children, and, having <I>begotten them by the gospel,</I> he was 
 desirous by the same gospel to nourish and nurse them up.

 I. He was called in an extraordinary manner to preach the gospel at 
 Philippi, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:9">Acts xvi. 9</A>.

 A vision appeared to Paul in the night: <I>There stood a man of 
 Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help 
 us.</I> He saw God going before him, and was encouraged to use all 
 means for carrying on the good work which was begun among them, and 
 building upon the foundation which was laid. 

 II. At Philippi he suffered hard things; he was scourged, and put into
 the stocks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:23,24">Acts xvi. 23, 24</A>);

 yet he had not the less kindness for the place for the hard usage he
 met with there. We must never love our friends the less for the ill 
 treatment which our enemies give us. 

 III. The beginnings of that church were very small; Lydia was
 converted there, and the jailer, and a few more: yet that did not 
 discourage him. If good be not done at first, it may be done
 afterwards, and the last works may be more abundant. We must not be 
 discouraged by small beginnings.

 IV. It seems, by many passages in this epistle, that this church at
 Philippi grew into a flourishing church, and particularly that the 
 brethren were very kind to Paul. He had reaped of their temporal 
 things, and he made a return in spiritual things. He acknowledges the 
 receipt of a present they had sent him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:18">iv. 18</A>),

 and this when no other church communicated with him as concerning
 giving and receiving

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 and he gives them a prophet's, an apostle's reward, in this epistle,
 which is of more value than thousands of gold and silver.</P>
