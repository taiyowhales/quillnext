 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  We then, <I>as</I> workers together <I>with him,</I> beseech <I>you</I> also
 that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
 &nbsp; 2  (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in
 the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now <I>is</I> the
 accepted time; behold, now <I>is</I> the day of salvation.)
 &nbsp; 3  Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not
 blamed:
 &nbsp; 4  But in all <I>things</I> approving ourselves as the ministers of
 God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in
 distresses,
 &nbsp; 5  In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in
 watchings, in fastings;
 &nbsp; 6  By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by
 the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
 &nbsp; 7  By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of
 righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
 &nbsp; 8  By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as
 deceivers, and <I>yet</I> true;
 &nbsp; 9  As unknown, and <I>yet</I> well known; as dying, and, behold, we
 live; as chastened, and not killed;
 &nbsp; 10  As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many
 rich; as having nothing, and <I>yet</I> possessing all things.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have an account of the apostle's general errand and 
 exhortation to all to whom he preached in every place where he came, 
 with the several arguments and methods he used. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The errand or exhortation itself, namely, to comply with the gospel 
 offers of reconciliation--that, being favoured with the gospel, they
 would not receive this <I>grace of God in vain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The gospel is a word of grace sounding in our ears; but it will be in 
 vain for us to hear it, unless we believe it, and comply with the end 
 and design of it. And as it is the duty of the ministers of the gospel 
 to exhort and persuade their hearers to accept of grace and mercy which 
 are offered to them, so they are honoured with this high title of 
 <I>co-workers with</I> God. Note, 

 1. They must work; and must work for God and his glory, for souls and
 their good: and they are workers with God, yet under him, as 
 instruments only; however, if they be faithful, they may hope to find 
 God working with them, and their labour will be effectual.

 2. Observe the language and way of the spirit of the gospel: it is not
 with roughness and severity, but with all mildness and gentleness, to 
 beseech and entreat, to use exhortations and arguments, in order to 
 prevail with sinners and overcome their natural unwillingness to be 
 reconciled to God and to be happy for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The arguments and method which the apostle used. And here he tells 
 them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The present time is the only proper season to accept of the grace 
 that is offered, and improve that grace which is afforded: 
 N<FONT SIZE=-1>OW</FONT> <I>is the accepted time,</I> 
 <FONT SIZE=-1>NOW</FONT> <I>is the day of salvation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The gospel day is a day of salvation, the means of grace the means of 
 salvation, the offers of the gospel the offers of salvation, and the 
 present time the only proper time to accept of these offers: <I>To-day, 
 while it is called to-day.</I> The morrow is none of ours: we know not 
 what will be on the morrow, nor where we shall be; and we should 
 remember that present seasons of grace are short and uncertain, and 
 cannot be recalled when they are past. It is therefore our duty and 
 interest to improve them while we have them, and no less than our 
 salvation depends upon our so doing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What caution they used not to give offence that might hinder the 
 success of their preaching: <I>Giving no offence in any thing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The apostle had great difficulty to behave prudently and inoffensively 
 towards the Jews and Gentiles, for many of both sorts watched for his 
 halting, and sought occasion to blame him and his ministry, or his 
 conversation; therefore he was very cautious not to give offence to 
 those who were so apt to take offence, that he might not offend the 
 Jews by unnecessary zeal against the law, nor the Gentiles by 
 unnecessary compliances with such as were zealous for the law. He was 
 careful, in all his words and actions, not to give offence, or occasion 
 of guilt or grief. Note, When others are too apt to take offence, we 
 should be cautious lest we give offence; and ministers especially 
 should be careful lest they do any thing that may bring blame on their 
 ministry or render that unsuccessful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their constant aim and endeavor in all things to approve themselves 
 faithful, as became the ministers of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 We see how much stress the apostle upon all occasions lays on fidelity 
 in our work, because much of our success depends upon that. His eye
 was single, and his heart upright, in all his ministrations; and his 
 great desire was to be the servant of God, and to approve himself so. 
 Note, Ministers of the gospel should look upon themselves as God's 
 servants or ministers, and act in every thing suitably to that 
 character. So did the apostle,

 (1.) By much patience in afflictions. He was a great sufferer, and met 
 with many afflictions, was often in necessities, and wanted the 
 conveniences, if not the necessaries, of life; in distresses, being 
 straitened on every side, hardly knowing what to do; in stripes often

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:24"><I>ch.</I> xi. 24</A>);

 in imprisonments; in tumults raised by the Jews and Gentiles against
 him; in labours, not only in preaching the gospel, but in travelling 
 from place to place for that end, and working with his hands to supply 
 his necessities; in watchings and in fastings, either voluntary or upon 
 a religious account, or involuntary for the sake of religion: but he 
 exercised much patience in all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.
 
 Note, 

 [1.] It is the lot of faithful ministers often to be reduced to great 
 difficulties, and to stand in need of much patience. 

 [2.] Those who would approve themselves to God must approve themselves 
 faithful in trouble as well as in peace, not only in doing the work of 
 God diligently, but also in bearing the will of God patiently.

 (2.) By acting from good principles. The apostle went by a good 
 principle in all he did, and tells them what his principles were 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>);

 namely, pureness; and there is no piety without purity. A care to keep 
 ourselves unspotted from the world is necessary in order to our 
 acceptance with God. Knowledge was another principle; and zeal without 
 this is but madness. He also acted with <I>long-suffering and 
 kindness,</I> being not easily provoked, but bearing with the hardness 
 of men's hearts, and hard treatment from their hands, to whom he kindly 
 endeavoured to do good. He acted under the influence of the Holy Ghost, 
 from the noble principle of unfeigned love, according to the rule of 
 the word of truth, under the supports and assistances of the power of 
 God, having on the armour of righteousness (a consciousness of 
 universal righteousness and holiness), which is the best defence 
 against the temptations of prosperity on the right hand, and of 
 adversity on the left.

 (3.) By a due temper and behaviour under all the variety of conditions 
 in this world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 We must expect to meet with many alterations of our circumstances and 
 conditions in this world; and it will be a great evidence of our 
 integrity if we preserve a right temper of mind, and duly behave 
 ourselves, under them all. The apostles met with honour and dishonour, 
 good report and evil report: good men in this world must expect to meet 
 with some dishonour and reproaches, to balance their honour and esteem; 
 and we stand in need of the grace of God to arm us against the 
 temptations of honour on the one hand, so as to bear good report 
 without pride, and of dishonour on the other hand, so as to bear 
 reproaches without impatience or recrimination. It should seem that 
 persons differently represented the apostles in their reports; that 
 some represented them as the best, and others as the worst, of men: by 
 some they were counted deceivers, and run down as such; by others as 
 true, preaching the gospel of truth, and men who were true to the trust 
 reposed in them. They were slighted by the men of the world as unknown, 
 men of no figure or account, not worth taking notice of; yet in all the 
 churches of Christ they were well known, and of great account: they 
 were looked upon as dying, being killed all the day long, and their 
 interest was thought to be a dying interest; "and yet behold," says the 
 apostle, "we live, and live comfortably, and bear up cheerfully under 
 all our hardships, and go on conquering and to conquer." They were 
 chastened, and often fell under the lash of the law, yet not killed: 
 and though it was thought that they were sorrowful, a company of mopish 
 and melancholy men, always sighing and mourning, yet they were always 
 rejoicing in God, and had the greatest reason to rejoice always. They 
 were despised as poor, upon the account of their poverty in this world; 
 and yet they made many rich, by preaching the unsearchable riches of 
 Christ. They were thought to have nothing, and silver and gold they had 
 none, houses and lands they had none; yet they possessed all things: 
 they had nothing in this world, but they had a treasure in heaven.
 Their effects lay in another country, in another world. They had 
 nothing in themselves, but possessed all things in Christ. Such a
 paradox is a Christian's life, and through such a variety of conditions 
 and reports lies our way to heaven; and we should be careful in all 
 these things to approve ourselves to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  O <I>ye</I> Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is
 enlarged.
 &nbsp; 12  Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your
 own bowels.
 &nbsp; 13  Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto <I>my</I>
 children,) be ye also enlarged.
 &nbsp; 14  Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for
 what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what
 communion hath light with darkness?
 &nbsp; 15  And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath
 he that believeth with an infidel?
 &nbsp; 16  And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye
 are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell
 in them, and walk in <I>them;</I> and I will be their God, and they
 shall be my people.
 &nbsp; 17  Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate,
 saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean <I>thing;</I> and I will
 receive you,
 &nbsp; 18  And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
 daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle proceeds to address himself more particularly to the 
 Corinthians, and cautions them against mingling with unbelievers. Here 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the caution is introduced with a profession, in a very pathetic 
 manner, of the most tender affection to them, <I>even like that of a 
 father to his children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:11-13"><I>v.</I> 11-13</A>.

 Though the apostle was happy in a great fluency of expressions, yet he 
 seemed to want words to express the warm affections he had for these 
 Corinthians. As if he had said, "O ye Corinthians, to whom I am now 
 writing, I would fain convince you how well I love you: we are desirous 
 to promote the spiritual and eternal welfare of all to whom we preach, 
 yet <I>our mouth is open unto you, and our heart is enlarged unto</I> 
 you, in a special manner." And, because his heart was thus enlarged 
 with love to them, therefore he opened his mouth so freely to them in 
 kind admonitions and exhortations: "<I>You are not,</I>" says he, 
 "<I>straitened in us;</I> we would gladly do you all the service we 
 can, and promote your comfort, as helpers of your faith and your joy; 
 and, if it be otherwise, the fault is in yourselves; it is because you 
 are straitened in yourselves, and fail in suitable returns to us, 
 through some misapprehensions concerning us; and all we desire as a 
 recompense is only that you would be proportionably affected towards 
 us, as children should love their father." Note, It is desirable that 
 there should be a mutual good affection between ministers and their 
 people, and this would greatly tend to their mutual comfort and 
 advantage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The caution or exhortation itself, not to mingle with unbelievers, 
 not to be <I>unequally yoked</I> with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Either,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In stated relations. It is wrong for good people to join in affinity 
 with the wicked and profane; these will draw different ways, and that 
 will be galling and grievous. Those relations that are our choice must 
 be chosen by rule; and it is good for those who are themselves the 
 children of God to join with those who are so likewise; for there is 
 more danger that the bad will damage the good than hope that the good 
 will benefit the bad.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In common conversation. We should not yoke ourselves in friendship 
 and acquaintance with wicked men and unbelievers. Though we cannot 
 wholly avoid seeing, and hearing, and being with such, yet we should 
 never choose them for our bosom-friends.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Much less should we join in religious communion with them; we must 
 not join with them in their idolatrous services, nor concur with them 
 in their false worship, nor any abominations; we must not confound 
 together the table of the Lord and the table of devils, the house of 
 God and the house of Rimmon. The apostle gives several good reasons 
 against this corrupt mixture. 

 (1.) It is a very great absurdity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 It is an unequal yoking of things together that will not agree 
 together; as bad as for the Jews to have ploughed with an ox and an ass 
 or to have sown divers sorts of grain intermixed. What an absurdity is 
 it to think of joining righteousness and unrighteousness, or mingling 
 light and darkness, fire and water, together! Believers are, and should 
 be, righteous; but unbelievers are unrighteous. Believers are made 
 light in the Lord, but unbelievers are in darkness; and what 
 comfortable communion can these have together? Christ and Belial are 
 contrary one to the other; they have opposite interests and designs, so 
 that it is impossible there should be any concord or agreement between 
 them. It is absurd, therefore, to think of enlisting under both; and, 
 if the believer has part with an infidel, he does what in him lies to 
 bring Christ and Belial together.

 (2.) It is a dishonour to the Christian's profession
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 for Christians are by profession, and should be in reality, the 
 <I>temples of the living God</I>--dedicated to, and employed for, the 
 service of God, who has promised to reside in them, <I>to dwell and 
 walk in them,</I> to stand in a special relation to them, and take a 
 special care of them, that he will be their God and they shall be his 
 people. Now there can be no agreement between <I>the temple of God and 
 idols.</I> Idols are rivals with God for his honour, and God is a 
 jealous God, and will not give his glory to another. 

 (3.) There is a great deal of danger in communicating with unbelievers
 and idolators, danger of being defiled and of being rejected; therefore 
 the exhortation is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 <I>to come out from among them,</I> and keep at a due distance, <I>to 
 be separate,</I> as one would avoid the society of those who have the 
 leprosy or the plague, for fear of taking infection, and not <I>to 
 touch the unclean thing,</I> lest we be defiled. Who can touch pitch, 
 and not be defiled by it? We must take care not to defile ourselves by 
 converse with those who defile themselves with sin; so is the will of 
 God, as we ever hope to be received, and not rejected, by him. 

 (4.) It is base ingratitude to God for all the favours he has bestowed 
 upon believers and promised to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 God has promised to be a Father to them, and that they shall be his 
 sons and his daughters; and is there a greater honour or happiness than 
 this? How ungrateful a thing then must it be if those who have this 
 dignity and felicity should degrade and debase themselves by mingling 
 with unbelievers! <I>Do we thus requite the Lord, O foolish and
 unwise?</I></P>
