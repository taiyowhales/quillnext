 The work of a Christian is twofold--doing the will of God and suffering
 his pleasure. This chapter directs us in both. The duties we are here 
 exhorted to employ ourselves in are the mortification of sin, living to 
 God, sobriety, prayer, charity, hospitality, and the best improvement 
 of our talents, which the apostle presses upon Christians from the 
 consideration of the time they have lost in their sins, and the 
 approaching end of all things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 The directions for sufferings are that we should not be surprised at
 them, but rejoice in them, only take care not to suffer as evil-doers.
 He intimates that their trials were near at hand, that their souls were 
 in danger as well as their bodies, and that the best way to preserve 
 their souls is to commit them to God in well-doing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,
 arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath
 suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;
 &nbsp; 2  That he no longer should live the rest of <I>his</I> time in the
 flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
 &nbsp; 3  For the time past of <I>our</I> life may suffice us to have
 wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in
 lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings,
 and abominable idolatries:
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here draws a new inference from the consideration of 
 Christ's sufferings. As he had before made use of it to persuade to 
 patience in suffering, so here to mortification of sin. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the exhortation is expressed. The antecedent or supposition is 
 <I>that Christ had suffered</I> for us in the flesh, or in his human 
 nature. The consequent or inference is, "<I>Arm</I> and fortify 
 <I>yourselves likewise with the same mind,</I> courage, and 
 resolution." The word flesh in the former part of the verse signifies 
 Christ's human nature, but in the latter part it signifies man's 
 corrupt nature. So the sense is, "As Christ suffered in his human 
 nature, do you, according to your baptismal vow and profession, make 
 your corrupt nature suffer, by putting to death the body of sin by 
 self-denial and mortification; for, if you do not thus suffer, you will 
 be conformable to Christ in his death and resurrection, and will cease 
 <I>from sin.</I>" Learn, 

 1. Some of the strongest and best arguments against all sorts of sin
 are taken from the sufferings of Christ. All sympathy and tenderness 
 for Christ as a sufferer are lost of you do not put away sin. He dies 
 to destroy it; and, though he could cheerfully submit to the worst 
 sufferings, yet he could never submit to the least sin. 

 2. The beginning of all true mortification lies in the mind, not in
 penances and hardships upon the body. The mind of man is carnal, full 
 of enmity; the understanding is darkened, being alienated from the life 
 of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:18">Eph. iv. 18</A>.

 Man is not a sincere creature, but partial, blind, and wicked, till he
 be renewed and sanctifies by the regenerating grace of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How it is further explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The apostle explains what he means by being dead to sin, and ceasing 
 from sin, both negatively and positively. Negatively, a Christian ought 
 <I>no longer to live the rest of his time in the flesh,</I> to the 
 sinful lusts and corrupt desires of carnal wicked men; but, positively, 
 he ought to conform himself to the revealed will of the holy God. 
 Learn, 
 
 1. The lusts of men are the springs of all their wickedness,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:13,14">Jam. i. 13, 14</A>.

 Let occasional temptations be what they will, they could not prevail,
 were it not for men's own corruptions. 

 2. All good Christians make the will of God, not their own lusts or
 desires, the rule of their lives and actions. 

 3. True conversion makes a marvellous change in the heart and life of
 every one who partakes of it. It brings a man off from all his old, 
 fashionable, and delightful lusts, and from the common ways and vices 
 of the world, to the will of God. It alters the mind, judgment, 
 affections, way, and conversation of every one who has experienced 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How it is enforced 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the 
 will of the Gentiles,</I> &c. Here the apostle argues from equity. "It 
 is but just, equal, and reasonable, that as you have hitherto all the 
 former part of your life served sin and Satan, so you should now serve 
 the living God." Though those were Jews to whom the apostle wrote, yet 
 the living among the Gentiles they had learned their way. Observe, 

 1. When a man is truly converted, it is very grievous to him to think
 how the time past of his life has been spent; the hazard he has run so 
 many years, the mischief he has done to others, the dishonour done to 
 God, and the loss he has sustained, are very afflicting to him. 

 2. While the will of man is unsanctified and corrupt, he walks
 continually in wicked ways; he makes them his choice and delight, his 
 work and business, and he makes a bad condition daily worse and worse. 
 
 3. One sin, allowed, draws on another. Here are six named, and they
 have a connection and dependence one upon another.

 (1.) <I>Lasciviousness</I> or wantonness, expressed in looks, gesture, 
 or behaviour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:13">Rom. xiii. 13</A>.

 (2.) <I>Lusts,</I> acts of lewdness, such as whoredom and adultery.
 
 (3.) <I>Excess of wine,</I> though short of drunkenness, an immoderate 
 use of it, to the prejudice of health or business, is here condemned. 
 
 (4.) <I>Revellings,</I> or luxurious feastings, too frequent, too full, 
 or too expensive. 

 (5.) <I>Banquetings,</I> by which is meant gluttony or excess in 
 eating.

 (6.) <I>Abominable</I> idolatry; the idol-worship of the Gentiles was 
 attended with lewdness, drunkenness, gluttony, and all sorts of 
 brutality and cruelty; and these Jews living long among them were, some 
 of them at least, debauched and corrupted by such practices.

 4. It is a Christian's duty not only to abstain from what is grossly
 wicked, but also from those things that are generally the occasions of 
 sin, or carry the appearance of evil. <I>Excess of wine</I> and 
 immoderate feasting are forbidden as well as lust and idolatry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with <I>them</I> to
 the same excess of riot, speaking evil of <I>you:</I>
 &nbsp; 5  Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the
 quick and the dead.
 &nbsp; 6  For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that
 are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the
 flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here you have the visible change wrought in those who in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:3">foregoing verse</A>

 were represented as having been in the former part of their life very
 wicked. They no longer run on in the same courses, or with the same 
 companions, as they used to do. Hereupon observe the conduct of their
 wicked acquaintance towards them. 

 1. <I>They think it strange,</I> they are surprised and wonder at it,
 as at something new and unusual, that their old friends should be so 
 much altered, and not run with as much violence as they used to do 
 <I>to the same excess of riot,</I> to the same sottish excesses and 
 luxury which before they had greedily and madly followed. 

 2. <I>They speak evil of them.</I> Their surprise carries them to
 blasphemy. They speak evil of their persons, of their way, their 
 religion, and their God. Learn,

 (1.) Those that are once really converted will not return to their 
 former course of life, though ever so much tempted by the frowns or 
 flatteries of others to do so. Neither persuasion nor reproach will
 prevail with them to be or to do as they were wont to do. 

 (2.) The temper and behaviour of true Christians seem very strange to 
 ungodly men. That they should despise that which every one else is fond 
 of, that they should believe many things which to others seem 
 incredible, that they should delight in what is irksome and tedious, be 
 zealous where they have no visible interest to serve, and depend so 
 much upon hope, is what the ungodly cannot comprehend. 

 (3.) The best actions of religious people cannot escape the censures 
 and slanders of those who are irreligious. Those actions which cost a 
 good man the most pains, hazard, and self-denial, shall be most 
 censured by the uncharitable and ill-natured world; they will speak 
 evil of good people, though they themselves reap the fruits of their 
 charity, piety, and goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. For the comfort of the servants of God, it is here added,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That all wicked people, especially those who speak evil of such as 
 are not as bad as themselves, shall <I>give an account,</I> and be put 
 to give a reason of their behaviour, to him who is ready to judge, who 
 is both able and duly authorized, and who will ere long judge and pass 
 sentence upon all who shall then be found alive, and all such as being 
 dead shall then be raised again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:8,9;2Pe+3:7">Jam. v. 8, 9; 2 Pet. iii. 7</A>.

 Observe, The malignant world shall in a little time give an account to
 the great God of all their evil speeches against his people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14,15">Jude 14, 15</A>.

 They will soon be called to a sad account for all their curses, their
 foolish jests, their slanders and falsehoods, uttered against the 
 faithful people of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That <I>for this cause was the gospel preached also to those that 
 are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but 
 live according to God in the Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Some understand this difficult place thus: <I>For this cause was the 
 gospel preached</I> to all the faithful of old, who are now dead in 
 Christ, that thereby they might be taught and encouraged to bear the 
 unrighteous judgments and persecutions which the rage of men put upon 
 them <I>in the flesh, but might live in the Spirit unto God.</I> Others 
 take the expression, <I>that they might be judged according to men in 
 the flesh,</I> in a spiritual sense, thus: The gospel was preached to 
 them, to judge them, condemn them, and reprove them, for the corruption 
 of their natures, and the viciousness of their lives, while they lived 
 after the manner of the heathen or the mere natural man; and that, 
 having thus mortified their sins, they might live according to God, a 
 new and spiritual life. Take it thus; and thence learn,

 1. The mortifying of our sins and living to God are the expected
 effects of the gospel preached to us. 

 2. God will certainly reckon with all those who have had the gospel
 preached to them, but without these good effects produced by it. God is 
 ready to judge all those who have received the gospel in vain. 

 3. It is no matter how we are judged according to men in the flesh, if
 we do but live according to God in the Spirit.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an awful position or doctrine, and an inference drawn from 
 it. The position is that the <I>end of all things is at hand.</I> The 
 miserable destruction of the Jewish church and nation foretold by our 
 Saviour is now very near; consequently, the time of their persecution 
 and your sufferings is but very short. Your own life and that of your 
 enemies will soon come to their utmost period. Nay, the world itself 
 will not continue very long. The conflagration will put an end to it; 
 and all things must be swallowed up in an endless eternity. The 
 inference from this comprises a series of exhortations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To sobriety and watchfulness: "<I>Be you therefore sober,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Let the frame and temper of your minds be grave, stayed, and solid; and 
 observe strict temperance and sobriety in the use of all worldly
 enjoyments. Do not suffer yourselves to be caught with your former sins 
 and temptations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 <I>An watch unto prayer.</I> Take care that you be continually in a 
 calm sober disposition, fit for prayer; and that you be frequent in 
 prayers, lest this end come upon you unawares,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:34;Mt+26:40,41">Luke xxi. 34; Matt. xxvi. 40, 41</A>.
 
 Learn,

 (1.) The consideration of our approaching end is a powerful argument to
 make us sober in all worldly matters, and earnest in religious affairs. 
 
 (2.) Those who would pray to purpose must <I>watch unto prayer.</I> 
 They must watch over their own spirits, watch all fit opportunities, 
 and do their duty in the best manner they can.

 (3.) The right ordering of the body is of great use to promote the good 
 of the soul. When the appetites and inclinations of the body are 
 restrained and governed by God's word and true reason, and the 
 interests of the body are submitted to the interests and necessities of 
 the soul, then it is not the soul's enemy, but its friend and 
 helper.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To charity: <I>And above all things have fervent charity among 
 yourselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Here is a noble rule in Christianity. Christians ought to love one 
 another, which implies an affection to their persons, a desire of their 
 welfare, and a hearty endeavour to promote it. This mutual affection 
 must not be cold, but fervent, that is, sincere, strong, and lasting. 
 This sort of earnest affection is recommended <I>above all things,</I> 
 which shows the importance of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:14">Col. iii. 14</A>.

 It is greater than faith or hope,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:13">1 Cor. xiii. 13</A>.

 One excellent effect of it is that it will <I>cover a multitude of 
 sins.</I> Learn,

 (1.) There ought to be in all Christians a more fervent charity towards
 one another than towards other men: <I>Have charity among 
 yourselves.</I> He does not say for pagans, for idolaters, or for 
 apostates, but among yourselves. <I>Let brotherly love continue,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:1">Heb. xiii. 1</A>.

 There is a special relation between all sincere Christians, and a 
 particular amiableness and good in them, which require special 
 affection.

 (2.) It is not enough for Christians not to bear malice, nor to have
 common respect for one another, they must intensely and fervently love 
 each other. 

 (3.) It is the property of true charity <I>to cover a multitude of 
 sins.</I> It inclines people to forgive and forget offences against 
 themselves, to cover and conceal the sins of others, rather than 
 aggravate them and spread them abroad. It teaches us to love those who 
 are but weak, and who have been guilty of many evil things before their 
 conversion; and it prepares for mercy at the hand of God, who hath 
 promised to forgive those that forgive others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:14">Matt. vi. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. To hospitality, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The hospitality here required is a free and kind entertainment of 
 strangers and travellers. The proper objects of Christian hospitality 
 are one another. The nearness of their relation, and the necessity of 
 their condition in those times of persecution and distress, obliged 
 Christians to be hospitable one to another. Sometimes Christians were 
 spoiled of all they had, and were driven away to distant countries for 
 safety. In this case they must starve if their fellow-christians would 
 not receive them. Therefore it was a wise and necessary rule which the 
 apostle here laid down. It is elsewhere commanded,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:1,2;Ro+12:13">Heb. xiii. 1, 2; Rom. xii. 13</A>.

 The manner of performing this duty is this: it must be done in an easy,
 kind, handsome manner, <I>without grudging</I> or grumbling at the 
 expense or trouble. Learn, 

 (1.) Christians ought not only to be charitable, but hospitable, one to 
 another. 

 (2.) Whatever a Christian does by way of charity or of hospitality, he 
 ought to do it cheerfully, and without grudging. <I>Freely you have
 received, freely give.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. To the improvement of talents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The rule is that whatever gift, ordinary or extraordinary, 
 whatever power, ability, or capacity of doing good is given to us, we 
 should minister, or do service, with the same <I>one to another,</I> 
 accounting ourselves not masters, but only <I>stewards of the manifold 
 grace,</I> or the various gifts, of God. Learn, 

 [1.] Whatever ability we have of doing good we must own it to be the 
 gift of God and ascribe it to his grace.

 [2.] Whatever gifts we have received, we ought to look upon them as 
 received for the use one of another. We must not assume them to 
 ourselves, nor hide them in a napkin, but do service with them <I>one 
 to another</I> in the best manner we are able.

 [3.] In receiving and using the manifold gifts of God we must look upon 
 ourselves as stewards only, and act accordingly. The talents we are 
 entrusted with are our Lord's goods, and must be employed as he 
 directs. And it is required in a steward that he be found faithful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The apostle exemplifies his direction about gifts in two 
 particulars--speaking and ministering, concerning which he gives these
 rules:--

 [1.] <I>If any man,</I> whether a minister in public or a Christian in
 private conference, <I>speak</I> or teach, he must do it <I>as the 
 oracles of God,</I> which direct us as to the matter of our speech. 
 What Christians in private, or ministers in public, teach and speak 
 must be the pure word and oracles of God. As to the manner of speaking, 
 it must be with the seriousness, reverence, and solemnity, that become 
 those holy and divine oracles. 

 [2.] <I>If any man minister,</I> either as a deacon, distributing the 
 alms of the church and taking care of the poor, or as a private person, 
 by charitable gifts and contributions, <I>let him do it as of the 
 ability which God giveth.</I> He who has received plenty and ability 
 from God ought to minister plentifully, and according to his ability. 
 These rules ought to be followed and practised for this end, <I>that 
 God in all things,</I> in all your gifts, ministrations, and services, 
 may be glorified, <I>that others may see your good works, and glorify 
 your Father who is in heaven</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:16">Matt. v. 16</A>),

 <I>through Jesus Christ,</I> who has procured and given these gifts to 
 men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8">Eph. iv. 8</A>),

 and through whom alone we and our services are accepted of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15">Heb. xiii. 15</A>),

 to whom, Jesus Christ, <I>be praise and dominion for ever and ever.
 Amen.</I> Learn, <I>First,</I> It is the duty of Christians in private, 
 as well as ministers in public, to speak to one another of the things 
 of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:16;Eph+4:29;Ps+145:10-12">Mal. iii. 16;
 Eph. iv. 29; Ps. cxlv. 10-12</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> It highly concerns all preachers of the gospel to keep
 close to the word of God, and to treat that word as becomes the oracles 
 of God. <I>Thirdly,</I> Christians must not only do the duty of their 
 place, but they must do it with vigour, and according to the best of 
 their abilities. The nature of a Christian's work, which is high work 
 and hard work, the goodness and kindness of the Master, and the 
 excellency of the reward, all require that our endeavours should be 
 serious and vigorous, and that whatever we are called to do for the 
 honour of God and the good of others we should do it with all our 
 might. <I>Fourthly,</I> In all the duties and services of life we 
 should aim at the glory of God as our chief end; all other views must 
 be subservient to this, which would sanctify our common actions and 
 affairs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:31">1 Cor. x. 31</A>.

 <I>Fifthly,</I> God is not glorified by any thing we do if we do not
 offer it to him through the mediation and merits of Jesus Christ. 
 <I>God in all things must be glorified through Jesus Christ,</I> who is 
 the only way to the Father. <I>Sixthly,</I> The apostle's adoration of 
 Jesus Christ, and ascribing unlimited and everlasting praise and 
 dominion to him, prove that Jesus Christ is the most high God, over all 
 blessed for evermore. Amen.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial
 which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto
 you:
 &nbsp; 13  But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
 sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be
 glad also with exceeding joy.
 &nbsp; 14  If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy <I>are ye;</I>
 for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their
 part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
 &nbsp; 15  But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or <I>as</I> a thief,
 or <I>as</I> an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.
 &nbsp; 16  Yet if <I>any man suffer</I> as a Christian, let him not be
 ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.
 &nbsp; 17  For the time <I>is come</I> that judgment must begin at the house
 of God: and if <I>it</I> first <I>begin</I> at us, what shall the end <I>be</I>
 of them that obey not the gospel of God?
 &nbsp; 18  And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the
 ungodly and the sinner appear?
 &nbsp; 19  Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God
 commit the keeping of their souls <I>to him</I> in well doing, as unto
 a faithful Creator.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The frequent repetition of counsel and comfort to Christians, 
 considered as sufferers, in every chapter of this epistle, shows that 
 the greatest danger these new converts were in arose from the 
 persecutions to which their embracing Christianity exposed them. The 
 good behaviour of Christians under sufferings is the most difficult 
 part of their duty, but yet necessary both for the honour of Christ and 
 their own comfort; and therefore the apostle, having extorted them in 
 the former part of this chapter to the great duty of mortification, 
 comes here to direct them in the necessary duty of patience under 
 sufferings. An unmortified spirit is very unfit to bear trials.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle's kind manner of address to these poor despised 
 Christians: they were his <I>beloved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His advice to them, relating to their sufferings, which is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they should not think them strange, nor be surprised at them, 
 as if some unexpected event befel them; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Though they be sharp and fiery, yet they are designed only to try, 
 not to ruin them, to try their sincerity, strength, patience, and trust 
 in God. On the contrary, they ought rather to rejoice under their 
 sufferings, because theirs may properly be called Christ's sufferings. 
 They are of the same kind, and for the same cause, that Christ 
 suffered; they make us conformable to him; he suffers in them, and 
 feels in our infirmities; and, if we be partakers of his sufferings, we 
 shall also be make <I>partakers of his glory,</I> and shall meet him 
 with exceeding joy at his great appearing to judge his enemies, and 
 crown his faithful servants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:7">2 Thess. i. 7</A>,

 &c. Learn,

 [1.] True Christians love and own the children of God in their lowest
 and most distressing circumstances. The apostle owns these poor 
 afflicted Christians, and calls them his beloved. True Christians never 
 look more amiable one to another than in their adversities. 

 [2.] There is no reason for Christians to think strange, or to wonder, 
 at the unkindnesses and persecutions of the world, because they are 
 forewarned of them. Christ himself endured them; and forsaking all, 
 denying ourselves, are the terms upon which Christ accepts of us to be 
 his disciples.

 [3.] Christians ought not only to be patient, but to rejoice, in their 
 sharpest sorest sufferings for Christ, because they are tokens of 
 divine favour; they promote the gospel and prepare for glory. Those who 
 rejoice in their sufferings for Christ shall eternally triumph and 
 rejoice with him in glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) From the fiery trial the apostle descends to a lower degree of 
 persecution--that of the tongue by slander and reproach, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He supposes that this sort of suffering would fall to their lot: they 
 would be reviled, evil-spoken of, and slandered for the name or sake of 
 Christ. In such case he asserts, <I>Happy are you,</I> the reason of 
 which is, "Because you have the spirit of God with you, to fortify and 
 comfort you; and the Spirit of God is also the Spirit of glory, that 
 will carry you through all, bring you off gloriously, and prepare and 
 seal you up for eternal glory. This glorious Spirit <I>resteth upon 
 you,</I> resideth with you, dwelleth in you, supporteth you, and is 
 pleased with you; and is not this an unspeakable privilege? By your 
 patience and fortitude in suffering, by your dependence upon the 
 promises of God, and adhering to the word which the Holy Spirit hath 
 revealed, <I>he is on your part glorified;</I> but by the contempt and 
 reproaches cast upon you <I>the Spirit itself</I> is evil-spoken of and 
 blasphemed." Learn, 

 [1.] The best men and the best things usually meet with reproaches in 
 the world. Jesus Christ and his followers, the Spirit of God and the 
 gospel, are all evil-spoken of.

 [2.] The happiness of good people not only consists with, but even 
 flows from their afflictions: <I>Happy are you.</I>

 [3.] That man who hath the Spirit of God resting upon him cannot be 
 miserable, let his afflictions be ever so great: <I>Happy are you; for 
 the Spirit of God,</I> &c.

 [4.] The blasphemies and reproaches which evil men cast upon good
 people are taken by the Spirit of God as cast upon himself: <I>On their 
 part he is evil-spoken of.</I> 

 [5.] When good people are vilified <I>for the name of Christ</I> his 
 Holy Spirit is glorified in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they should take care they did not suffer justly, as 
 evil-doers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 One would think such a caution as this needless to such an excellent 
 set of Christians as these were. But their enemies charged them with 
 these and other foul crimes: therefore the apostle, when he was 
 settling the rules of the Christian religion, thought these cautions 
 necessary, forbidding every one of them to hurt the life or the estate 
 and property of any one, or to do any sort of evil, or, without call 
 and necessity, to play the <I>bishop in another man's charge,</I> or 
 busy himself <I>in other men's matters.</I> To this caution he adds a 
 direction, <I>that if any man suffer</I> for the cause of Christianity, 
 and with a patient Christian spirit, he ought not to account it a 
 shame, but an honour to him; and ought to glorify God who hath thus 
 dignified him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Learn,

 (1.) The best of men need to be warned against the worst of sins. 

 (2.) There is very little comfort in sufferings when we bring them upon 
 ourselves by our own sin and folly. It is not the suffering, but the 
 cause, that makes the martyr. 

 (3.) We have reason to thank God for the honour if he calls us out to 
 suffer for his truth and gospel, for our adherence to any of the 
 doctrines or duties of Christianity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That their trials were now at hand, and they should stand prepared 
 accordingly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He tells them that the time had come when <I>judgment must begin
 at the house of God.</I> The usual method of Providence has been this:
 When God brings great calamities and sore judgments upon whole nations,
 he generally begins with his own people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:12;Jer+25:29;Eze+9:6">Isa. x. 12;
 Jer. xxv. 29; Ezek. ix. 6</A>.

 "Such a time of universal calamity is now at hand, which was foretold
 by our Saviour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:9,10">Matt. xxiv. 9, 10</A>.

 This renders all the foregoing exhortations to patience necessary for
 you. And you have two considerations to support you."

 [1.] "That these judgments will but <I>begin</I> with you that are 
 God's house and family, and will soon be over: your trials and 
 corrections will not last long."

 [2.] "Your troubles will be but light and short, in comparison of what 
 shall befal the wicked world, your own countrymen the Jews, and the 
 infidels and idolatrous people among whom you live: <I>What shall the 
 end be of those who obey not the gospel of God?</I>" Learn, 
 <I>First,</I> The best of God's servants, his own household, have so 
 much amiss in them as renders it fit and necessary that God should 
 sometimes correct and punish them with his judgments: <I>Judgment 
 begins at the house of God. Secondly,</I> Those who are the family of
 God have their worst things in this life. Their worst condition is 
 tolerable, and will soon be over. <I>Thirdly,</I> Such persons or 
 societies of men as <I>disobey the gospel of God</I> are not of his 
 church and household, though possibly they may make the loudest 
 pretensions. The apostle distinguishes the disobedient from the house 
 of God. <I>Fourthly,</I> The sufferings of good people in this life are 
 demonstrations of the unspeakable torments that are coming upon the 
 disobedient and unbelieving: <I>What shall the end be of those that 
 obey not the gospel?</I> Who can express or say how dreadful their end 
 will be?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He intimates the irremediable doom of the wicked: <I>If the 
 righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner 
 appear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 This whole verse is taken from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:31">Prov. xi. 31</A>,

 <I>Behold the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth; how much 
 more the wicked and the sinner?</I> This the LXX. translates exactly as
 the apostle here quotes it. Hence we may learn, 

 [1.] The grievous sufferings of good people in this world are sad 
 presages of much heavier judgments coming upon impenitent sinners. But, 
 if we take the salvation here in the highest sense, then we may learn,

 [2.] It is as much as the best can do to secure the salvation of their 
 souls; there are so many sufferings, temptations, and difficulties to 
 be overcome, so many sins to be mortified, the gate is so strait and 
 the way so narrow, that it is as much as the righteous can do to be 
 saved. Let the absolute necessity of salvation balance the difficulty
 of it. Consider, Your difficulties are greatest at first; God offers
 his grace and help; the contest will not last long; be but faithful to 
 the death, <I>and God will give you the crown of life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:10">Rev. ii. 10</A>.

 [3.] The ungodly and the sinner are unquestionably in a state of 
 damnation. <I>Where shall they appear?</I> How will they stand before
 their Judge? Where can they show their heads? <I>If the righteous
 scarcely be saved,</I> the wicked must certainly perish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That when called to suffer, <I>according to the will of God,</I> 
 they should look chiefly to the safety of their souls, which are put 
 into hazard by affliction, and cannot be kept secure otherwise than by 
 <I>committing them to God,</I> who will undertake the charge, if we 
 commit them to him in well-doing; for he is their Creator, and has out 
 of mere grace made many kind promises to them of eternal salvation, in 
 which he will show himself faithful and true, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 Learn,

 (1.) All the sufferings that befal good people come upon them 
 <I>according to the will of God.</I> 

 (2.) It is the duty of Christians, in all their distresses, to look 
 more to the keeping of their souls than to the preserving of their 
 bodies. The soul is of greatest value, and yet in most danger. If 
 suffering from without raise uneasiness, vexation, and other sinful and 
 tormenting passions within, the soul is then the greatest sufferer. If 
 the soul be not well kept, persecution will drive people to apostasy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:3">Ps. cxxv. 3</A>.

 (3.) The only way to keep the soul well is to commit it to God, in
 well-doing. Commit your souls to God by solemn dedication, prayer, and 
 patient perseverance in well-doing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:7">Rom. ii. 7</A>.

 (4.) Good people, when they are in affliction, have great encouragement
 to commit their souls to God, because he is their Creator, and faithful 
 in all his promises.</P>
