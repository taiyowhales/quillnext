 This chapter contains another representation of those things that had 
 been revealed before concerning the wickedness and ruin of antichrist. 
 This antichrist had been before represented as a beast, and is now 
 described as a great whore. And here, 
 
 I. The apostle is invited to see this vile woman,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. He tells us what an appearance she made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:3-6">ver. 3-6</A>.

 III. The mystery of it is explained to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:7-12">ver. 7-12</A>.
 
 And,

 IV. Her ruin foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:13-18">ver. 13</A>, &c.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven
 vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will
 show unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon
 many waters:
 &nbsp; 2  With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication,
 and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the
 wine of her fornication.
 &nbsp; 3  So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and
 I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of
 blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
 &nbsp; 4  And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and
 decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden
 cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her
 fornication:
 &nbsp; 5  And upon her forehead <I>was</I> a name written, 
 M<FONT SIZE=-1><B>YSTERY</B></FONT>,
 B<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS
 OF THE EARTH</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6  And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and
 with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I
 wondered with great admiration.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have a new vision, not as to the matter of it, for that is 
 contemporary with what came under the three last vials; but as to the 
 manner of description, &c. Observe, 

 1. The invitation given to the apostle to take a view of what was here
 to be represented: <I>Come hither, and I will show thee the judgment of 
 the great whore,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This is a name of great infamy. A whore [in this passage] is one that 
 is married, and has been false to her husband's bed, has forsaken the 
 guide of her youth, and broken the covenant of God. She had been a 
 prostitute to the kings of the earth, whom she had intoxicated <I>with 
 the wine of her fornication.</I> 

 2. The appearance she made: it was gay and gaudy, like such sort of
 creatures: <I>She was arrayed in purple, and scarlet colour, and decked 
 with gold, and precious stones, and pearls,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Here were all the allurements of worldly honour and riches, pomp and 
 pride, suited to sensual and worldly minds. 

 3. Her principal seat and residence--<I>upon the beast that had seven
 heads and ten horns;</I> that is to say, Rome, the city on seven hills, 
 infamous for idolatry, tyranny, and blasphemy.

 4. Her name, which <I>was written on her forehead.</I> It was the
 custom of impudent harlots to hang out signs, with their names, that 
 all might know what they were. Now in this observe,

 (1.) She is named from her place of residence--<I>Babylon the 
 great.</I> But, that we might not take it for the old Babylon literally 
 so called, we are told there is a mystery in the name; it is some other 
 great city resembling the old Babylon. 

 (2.) She is named from her infamous way and practice; not only a 
 harlot, but a mother of harlots, breeding up harlots, and nursing and 
 training them up to idolatry, and all sorts of lewdness and 
 wickedness--the parent and nurse of all false religion and filthy 
 conversation. 

 5. Her diet: she satiated herself with <I>the blood of the saints and
 martyrs of Jesus.</I> She drank their blood with such greediness that 
 she intoxicated herself with it; it was so pleasant to her that she 
 could not tell when she had had enough of it: she was satiated, but 
 never satisfied.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I
 will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that
 carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.
 &nbsp; 8  The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend
 out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that
 dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in
 the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they
 behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
 &nbsp; 9  And here <I>is</I> the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are
 seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.
 &nbsp; 10  And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is,
 <I>and</I> the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must
 continue a short space.
 &nbsp; 11  And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth,
 and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.
 &nbsp; 12  And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which
 have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one
 hour with the beast.
 &nbsp; 13  These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength
 unto the beast.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have the mystery of this vision explained. The apostle wonders 
 at the sight of this woman: the angel undertakes to open this vision to 
 him, it being the key of the former visions; and he tells the apostle 
 what was meant by the beast on which the woman sat; but it is so 
 explained as still to need further explanation. 

 1. This beast <I>was, and is not, and yet is;</I> that is, it
 <I>was</I> a seat of idolatry and persecution; <I>and is not,</I> that 
 is, not in the ancient form, which was pagan; <I>and yet it is,</I> it 
 is truly the seat of idolatry and tyranny, though of another sort and 
 form. <I>It ascends out of the bottomless pit</I> (idolatry and cruelty 
 are the issue and product of hell), and it shall return thither and go 
 into perdition. 

 2. <I>This beast has seven heads,</I> which have a double
 signification.

 (1.) <I>Seven mountains</I>--the seven hills on which Rome stands; and 
 
 (2.) <I>Seven kings</I>--seven sorts of government. Rome was governed 
 by kings, consuls, tribunes, decemviri, dictators, emperors who were 
 pagan, and emperors who were Christian. Five of these were extinct when 
 this prophecy was written; one was then in being, that is, the pagan 
 emperor; and the other, that is, the Christian emperor, was yet to 
 come, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 This beast, the papacy, makes an eighth governor, and sets up idolatry 
 again. 

 3. This beast had ten horns; which are said to be <I>ten kings which 
 have as yet received no kingdoms; as yet,</I> that is, as some, shall 
 not rise up till the Roman empire be broken in pieces; or, as others, 
 shall not rise up till near the end of antichrist's reign, and so shall 
 reign but as it were <I>one hour with her,</I> but shall for that time 
 be very unanimous and very zealous in that interest, and entirely 
 devoted to it, divesting themselves of their prerogatives and revenues 
 (things so dear to princes), out of an unaccountable fondness for the 
 papacy.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall
 overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and
 they that are with him <I>are</I> called, and chosen, and faithful.
 &nbsp; 15  And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where
 the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and
 tongues.
 &nbsp; 16  And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these
 shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and
 shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
 &nbsp; 17  For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to
 agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of
 God shall be fulfilled.
 &nbsp; 18  And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which
 reigneth over the kings of the earth.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have some account of the downfall of Babylon, to be more fully 
 described in the following chapter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a war begun between the beast and his followers, and the 
 Lamb and his followers. The beast and his army, to an eye of sense, 
 appear much stronger than the Lamb and his army: one would think an 
 army with a lamb at the head of them could not stand before <I>the 
 great red dragon.</I> But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a victory gained by the Lamb: <I>The Lamb shall 
 overcome.</I> Christ must reign till all enemies <I>be put under his 
 feet;</I> he will be sure to meet with many enemies, and much 
 opposition, but he will also be sure to gain the victory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the ground or reason of the victory assigned; and this is 
 taken, 

 1. From the character of the Lamb: <I>He is King of kings and Lord of
 lords.</I> He has, both by nature and by office, supreme dominion and 
 power over all things; all the powers of earth and hell are subject to 
 his check and control. 

 2. From the character of his followers: <I>They are called, and chosen,
 and faithful.</I> They are called out by commission to this warfare; 
 they are chosen and fitted for it, and they will be faithful in it. 
 Such an army, under such a commander, will at length carry all the 
 world before them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The victory is justly aggrandized. 

 1. By the vast multitude who paid obedience and subjection to the beast
 and to the whore. She sat upon (that is, presided over) many waters; 
 and these waters were so many multitudes of people, and nations, of all 
 languages; yea, she reigned not only over kingdoms, but over the kings, 
 and they were her tributaries and vassals,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:15,18"><I>v.</I> 15, 18</A>.

 2. By the powerful influence which God hereby showed he had over the 
 minds of great men. Their hearts were in his hand, and he turned them 
 as he pleased; for,

 (1.) It was of God, and to fulfil his will, that these kings <I>agreed 
 to give their kingdom unto the beast;</I> they were judicially blinded 
 and hardened to do so. And, 

 (2.) It was of God that afterwards their hearts were turned against the
 whore, to hate her, and to <I>make her desolate and naked, and to eat 
 her flesh, and burn her with fire;</I> they shall at length see their 
 folly, and how they have been bewitched and enslaved by the papacy, 
 and, out of a just resentment, shall not only fall off from Rome, but 
 shall be made the instruments of God's providence in her 
 destruction.</P>
