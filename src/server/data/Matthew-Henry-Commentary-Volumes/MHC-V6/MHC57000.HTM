 epistle to Philemon is placed the last of those with the name of Paul 
 to them, perhaps because the shortest, and of an argument peculiar and 
 different from all the others; yet such as the Spirit of God, who 
 indited it, saw would, in its kind, be very instructive and useful in 
 the churches. The occasion of it was this:--Philemon, one of note and 
 probably a minister in the church of Colosse, a city of Phrygia, had a 
 servant named <I>Onesimus,</I> who, having purloined his goods, ran 
 away from him, and in his rambles came to Rome, where Paul was then a 
 prisoner for the gospel, and, providentially coming under his preaching 
 there, was, by the blessing of God, converted by him, after which he 
 ministered awhile to the apostle in bonds, and might have been further 
 useful to him, but, understanding him to be another man's servant, Paul 
 would not, without his consent, detain him, but sends him back with 
 this letter-commendatory, wherein he earnestly sues for his pardon and 
 kind reception.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Before we enter on the exposition, such general things as follow may be 
 taken notice of from the epistle and what relates to it; namely, 

 I. The goodness and mercy of God to a poor wandering sinner, bringing 
 him by his gracious providence under the means, and making them 
 effectual to his conversion. Thus came he to be <I>sought of him that 
 asked not for him, and to be found of him that sought him not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1">Isa. lxv. 1</A>.

 II. The great and endeared affection between a true convert and him
 whom God used to be the instrument of his conversion. Paul regards this 
 poor fugitive now as his son in the faith, and terms him his <I>own 
 bowels;</I> and Onesimus readily serves Paul in prison, and would 
 gladly have continued to do so, would duty have permitted; but, being 
 another's servant, he must return and submit himself to his master, and 
 be at his disposal. 

 III. The tender and good spirit of this blessed apostle Paul. With what
 earnestness does he concern himself for the poor slave! Being now, 
 through his preaching, reconciled to God, he labours for reconciliation 
 between him and his master. How pathetic a letter does he here write in 
 his behalf! Scarcely any argument is forgotten that could possible be 
 used in the case; and all are pressed with such force that, had it been 
 the greatest favour to himself that he was asking, he could not have 
 used more.

 IV. The remarkable providence of God in preserving such a short writing 
 as this, that might be thought of little concern to the church, being 
 not only a letter to a particular person (as those to Timothy, and 
 Titus, and Gaius, and the elect lady, likewise were), but of a private 
 personal matter, namely, the receiving of a poor fugitive servant into 
 the favour and family of his injured master. What in this is there that 
 concerns the common salvation? And yet over this has there been a 
 special divine care, it being given (as the other scriptures were) by 
 <I>inspiration of God,</I> and in some sort, as they are, <I>profitable 
 for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in 
 righteousness.</I> God would have extant a proof and instance of his 
 rich and free grace for the encouragement and comfort of the meanest 
 and vilest of sinners, looking to him for mercy and forgiveness; and 
 for instruction to ministers and others not to despise any, much less 
 to judge them as to their final state, as if they were utter 
 cast-aways, but rather to attempt their conversion, hoping they may be 
 saved; likewise how to behave towards them. Joy must be on earth, as 
 well as there is in heaven, over one sinner who repenteth. Such must 
 now be loved, and helped, and confirmed in good, and furthered in it; 
 and, in their outward concerns, their comfort and welfare must be 
 consulted and promoted as much as possible. And, on their part, they 
 must be humble and grateful, acknowledging God and his instruments in 
 what good they have received, ready to all suitable returns, making 
 what reparation they can in case of injuries, and living a life of 
 thankfulness and obedience. To such purposes may this epistle have been 
 written and preserved. And perhaps, 

 V. There may be something further in all this; at least, by way of 
 allusion, it is applicable to the mediation and intercession of Christ 
 for poor sinners. We, like Onesimus, were revolters from God's service, 
 and had injured him in his rights. Jesus Christ finds us, and by his 
 grace works a change in us, and then intercedes for us with the Father, 
 that we may be received into his favour and family again, and past 
 offences may be forgiven; and we are sure that the <I>Father heareth 
 him always.</I> There is no reason to doubt but Paul prevailed with 
 Philemon to forgive and receive Onesimus: and more reason have we to be 
 confident that the intercession of Christ with the Father is prevalent 
 for the acceptance of all whose case he takes in hand and recommends to 
 him. From these general observations we come to the epistle itself.</P>
