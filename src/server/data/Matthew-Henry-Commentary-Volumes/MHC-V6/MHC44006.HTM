 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was
 multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the
 Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily
 ministration.
 &nbsp; 2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples <I>unto
 them,</I> and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word
 of God, and serve tables.
 &nbsp; 3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of
 honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may
 appoint over this business.
 &nbsp; 4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the
 ministry of the word.
 &nbsp; 5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose
 Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip,
 and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas
 a proselyte of Antioch:
 &nbsp; 6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed,
 they laid <I>their</I> hands on them.
 &nbsp; 7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the
 disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of
 the priests were obedient to the faith.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having seen the church's struggles with her enemies, and triumphed with 
 her in her victories, we now come to take a view of the administration 
 of her affairs at home; and here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An unhappy disagreement among some of the church-members, which 
 might have been of ill consequence, but was prudently accommodated and 
 taken up in time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>When the number of the disciples</I> (for so Christians were at
 first called, learners of Christ) <I>was multiplied</I> to many 
 thousands in Jerusalem, <I>there arose a murmuring.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It does our hearts good to find <I>that the number of the disciples 
 is multiplied,</I> as, no doubt, it vexed <I>the priests and 
 Sadducees</I> to the heart to see it. The opposition that the preaching 
 of the gospel met with, instead of checking its progress, contributed 
 to the success of it; and this infant Christian church, like the infant 
 Jewish church in Egypt, <I>the more it was afflicted, the more it 
 multiplied.</I> The preachers were beaten, threatened, and abused, and 
 yet the people received their doctrine, invited, no doubt, thereto by 
 their wonderful patience and cheerfulness under their trials, which 
 convinced men that they were borne up and carried on by a better spirit 
 than their own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Yet it casts a damp upon us to find that the multiplying of the 
 disciples proves an occasion of discord. Hitherto <I>they were all with 
 one accord.</I> This had been often taken notice of to their honour; 
 but now that they were multiplied, they began to murmur; as in the old 
 world, <I>when men began to multiply, they corrupted themselves. Thou 
 hast multiplied the nation, and not increased their joy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:3">Isa. ix. 3</A>.
 
 When Abraham and Lot increased their families, <I>there was a strife
 between their herdsmen;</I> so it was here: <I>There arose a 
 murmuring,</I> not an open falling out, but a secret heart-burning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The complainants were <I>the Grecians,</I> or Hellenists, 
 <I>against the Hebrews</I>--the Jews that were scattered in Greece, and
 other parts, who ordinarily spoke the Greek tongue, and read the Old 
 Testament in the Greek version, and not the original Hebrew, many of 
 whom being at Jerusalem at the feast embraced the faith of Christ, and 
 were added to the church, and so continued there. These complained 
 against the Hebrews, the native Jews, that used the original Hebrew of 
 the Old Testament. Some of each of these became Christians, and, it 
 seems, their joint-embracing of the faith of Christ did not prevail, as 
 it ought to have done, to extinguish the little jealousies they had one 
 of another before their conversion, but they retained somewhat of that 
 old leaven; not understanding, or not remembering, <I>that in Christ 
 Jesus there is neither Greek nor Jew,</I> no distinction of Hebrew and 
 Hellenist, but all are alike welcome to Christ, and should be, for his 
 sake, dear to one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The complaint of these Grecians was <I>that their widows were 
 neglected in the daily administration,</I> that is in the distribution 
 of the public charity, and the Hebrew widows had more care taken of 
 them. Observe, The first contention in the Christian church was about a 
 money-matter; but it is a pity <I>that the little things of this 
 world</I> should be makebates among those that profess to be taken up 
 with <I>the great things of another world.</I> A great deal of money 
 was gathered for the relief of the poor, but, as often happens in such 
 cases, it was impossible to please every body in the laying of it out. 
 <I>The apostles, at whose feet it was laid,</I> did their best to 
 dispose of it so as to answer the intentions of the donors, and no 
 doubt designed to do it with the utmost impartiality, and were far from 
 respecting the Hebrews more than the Grecians; and yet here they are 
 complained to, and tacitly complained of, <I>that the Grecian widows 
 were neglected;</I> though they were as real objects of charity, yet 
 they had not so much allowed them, or not to so many, or not so duly 
 paid them, as the Hebrews. Now, 

 [1.] Perhaps this complaint was groundless and unjust, and there was no 
 cause for it; but those who, upon any account, lie under disadvantages 
 (as the Grecian Jews did, in comparison with those that were Hebrews of 
 the Hebrews) are apt to be jealous that they are slighted when really 
 they are not so; and it is the common fault of poor people that, 
 instead of being thankful for what is given them, they are querulous 
 and clamorous, and apt to find fault that more is not given them, or 
 that more is given to others than to them; and there are envy and 
 covetousness, those roots of bitterness, to be found among the poor as 
 well as among the rich, notwithstanding the humbling providences they 
 are under, and should accommodate themselves to. But, 

 [2.] We will suppose there might be some occasion for their complaint. 
 <I>First,</I> Some suggest that though their other poor were well 
 provided for, yet their widows were neglected, because the managers 
 governed themselves by an ancient rule which the Hebrews observed, 
 <I>that a widow was to be maintained by her husband's children.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:4">1 Tim. v. 4</A>.

 But, <I>Secondly,</I> I take it that the widows are here put for all
 the poor, because many of those that were in the church-book, and 
 received alms, were widows, who were well provided for by the industry 
 of their husbands while they lived, but were reduced to straits when 
 they were gone. As those that have the administration of public justice 
 ought in a particular manner to protect widows from injury

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:17,Lu+18:3">Isa. i. 17; Luke xviii. 3</A>);

 so those that have the administration of public charity ought in a
 particular manner to provide for widows what is necessary. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:3">1 Tim. v. 3</A>.

 And observe, The widows here, and the other poor, had a daily
 ministration; perhaps they wanted forecast, and could not save for 
 hereafter, and therefore the managers of the fund, in kindness to them, 
 gave them day by day their daily bread; they lived from hand to mouth.
 Now, it seems, the Grecian widows were, comparatively, neglected.
 Perhaps those that disposed of the money considered that there was more 
 brought into the fund by the rich Hebrews than by the rich Grecians, 
 who had not estates to sell, as the Hebrews had, and therefore the poor 
 Grecians should have less out of the fund; this, though there was some 
 tolerant reason for it, they thought hard and unfair. Note, In the 
 best-ordered church in the world there will be something amiss, some 
 mal--administration or other, some grievances, or at least some
 complaints; those are the best that have the least and the fewest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The happy accommodating of this matter, and the expedient pitched 
 upon for the taking away of the cause of this murmuring. The apostles 
 had hitherto the directing of the matter. Applications were made to 
 them, and appeals in cases of grievances. They were obliged to employ
 persons under them, who did not take all the care they might have 
 taken, nor were so well fortified as they should have been against 
 temptations to partiality; and therefore some persons must be chosen to 
 manage this matter who have more leisure to attend to it than the 
 apostles had, and were better qualified for the trust than those whom 
 the apostles employed were. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How the method was proposed by the apostles: They <I>called the 
 multitude of the disciples unto them,</I> the heads of the 
 congregations of Christians in Jerusalem, the principal leading men. 
 The twelve themselves would not determine any thing without them, for 
 <I>in multitude of counsellors there is safety;</I> and in an affair of 
 this nature those might be best able to advise who were more conversant 
 in the affairs of this life than the apostles were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The apostles urge that they could by no means admit so great a 
 diversion, as this would be, from their great work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>It is not reasonable that we should leave the word of God and serve
 tables.</I> The receiving and paying of money was serving tables, too 
 like <I>the tables of the money-changers in the temple.</I> This was 
 foreign to the business which the apostles were called to. They were 
 <I>to preach the word of God;</I> and though they had not such occasion 
 to study for what they preached as we have (it being <I>given in that 
 same hour what they should speak</I>), yet they thought that was work 
 enough for a whole man, and to employ all their thoughts, and cares, 
 and time, though one man of them was more than ten of us, <I>than ten 
 thousand.</I> If they serve tables, they must, in some measure, 
 <I>leave the word of God;</I> they could not attend their preaching 
 work so closely as they ought. <I>Pectora nostra duas non admittentia 
 curas--These minds of ours admit not of two distinct anxious
 employments.</I> Though this serving of tables was for pious uses, and 
 serving the charity of rich Christians and the necessity of poor 
 Christians, and in both serving Christ, yet the apostles would not take 
 so much time from their preaching as this would require. They will no 
 more be drawn from their preaching by the money laid at their feet than 
 they will be driven from it by the stripes laid on their backs. While 
 the number of the disciples was small, the apostles might manage this 
 matter without making it any considerable interruption to their main 
 business; but, now that their number was increased, they could not do 
 it. <I>It is not reason,</I> <B><I>ouk areston estin</I></B>--<I>it is
 not fit,</I> or commendable, that we should neglect the business of 
 feeding souls with the bread of life, to attend the business of 
 relieving the bodies of the poor. Note, Preaching the gospel is the 
 best work, and the most proper and needful that a minister can be 
 employed in, and that which he must give himself wholly to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:15">1 Tim. iv. 15</A>),

 which that he may do, he must not entangle himself in the affairs of 
 this life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:4">2 Tim. ii. 4</A>),

 no, not in the outward business of the house of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+11:16">Neh. xi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They therefore desire <I>that seven men</I> might be chosen, well 
 qualified for the purpose, whose business it should be <I>to serve 
 tables,</I> <B><I>diakonein trapezais</I></B>--<I>to be deacons to the
 tables,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The business must be minded, must be better minded than it had been, 
 and than the apostles could mind it; and therefore proper persons must 
 be occasionally employed in the word, and prayer, were not so entirely 
 devoted to it as the apostles were; and these must take care of the 
 church's stock--must review, and pay, and keep accounts--must <I>buy
 those things which they had need of against the feast</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:29">John xiii. 29</A>),

 and attend to all those things which are necessary <I>in ordine ad
 spiritualia--in order to spiritual exercises,</I> that every thing
 might be done decently and in order, and no person nor thing neglected.
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The persons must be duly qualified. The people are to choose, and 
 the apostles to ordain; but the people have no authority to choose, nor 
 the apostles to ordain, men utterly unfit for the office: <I>Look out 
 seven men;</I> so many they thought might suffice for the present, more 
 might be added afterwards if there were occasion. These must be, 
 <I>First, Of honest report,</I> men free from scandal, that were looked 
 upon by their neighbours as men of integrity, and faithful men, well 
 attested, as men that might be trusted, not under a blemish for any 
 vice, but, on the contrary, well spoken of for every thing that is 
 virtuous and praiseworthy; <B><I>martyroumenous</I></B>--<I>men that can
 produce good testimonials</I> concerning their conversation. Note, 
 Those that are employed in any office in the church ought to be men of 
 honest report, of a blameless, nay, of an admirable character, which is 
 requisite not only to the credit of their office, but to the due 
 discharge of it. <I>Secondly,</I> They must be <I>full of the Holy
 Ghost,</I> must be filled with those gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost 
 which were necessary to the right management of this trust. They must 
 not only be honest men, but they must be men of ability and men of 
 courage; such as were to be made judges in Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:21">Exod. xviii. 21</A>),

 <I>able men, fearing God; men of truth, and hating covetousness;</I>
 and hereby appearing to be <I>full of the Holy Ghost. Thirdly,</I> They 
 must be <I>full of wisdom.</I> It was not enough that they were honest, 
 good men, but they must be discreet, judicious men, that could not be 
 imposed upon, and would order things for the best, and with 
 consideration: <I>full of the Holy Ghost, and wisdom,</I> that is, of 
 the Holy Ghost as a Spirit of wisdom. We find the word of wisdom given 
 by the Spirit, as distinct form the word of knowledge by the same 
 Spirit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:8">1 Cor. xii. 8</A>.

 Those must be full of wisdom who are entrusted with public money, that
 it may be disposed of, not only with fidelity, but with frugality.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The people must nominate the persons: "<I>Look you out among 
 yourselves seven men;</I> consider among yourselves who are the fittest 
 for such a trust, and whom you can with the most satisfaction confide 
 in." They might be presumed to know better, or at least were fitter to 
 enquire, what character men had, than the apostles; and therefore they 
 are entrusted with the choice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] They apostles will ordain them to the service, will give them 
 their charge, that they may know what they have to do and make 
 conscience of doing it, and give them their authority, that the persons 
 concerned may know whom they are to apply to, and submit to, in affairs 
 of that nature: <I>Men, whom we may appoint.</I> In many editions of 
 our English Bibles there has been an error of the press here; for they 
 have read it, <I>whom ye may appoint,</I> as if the power were in the 
 people; whereas it was certainly in the apostles: <I>whom we may 
 appoint over this business,</I> to take care of it, and to see that 
 there be neither waste nor want.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The apostles engage to addict themselves wholly to their work as 
 ministers, and the more closely if they can but get fairly quit of this 
 troublesome office 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>We will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of
 the word.</I> See here, 

 [1.] What are the two great gospel ordinances--<I>the word, and
 prayer;</I> by these two communion between God and his people is kept 
 up and maintained; by the word he speaks to them, and by prayer they 
 speak to him; and these have a mutual reference to each other. By these 
 two the kingdom of Christ must be advanced, and additions made to it; 
 we must <I>prophesy upon the dry bones,</I> and <I>then pray for a 
 spirit of life</I> from God <I>to enter into them.</I> By the word and 
 prayer other ordinances are sanctified to us, and sacraments have their 
 efficacy. 

 [2.] What is the great business of gospel ministers--to give themselves
 continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word; they must still 
 be either fitting and furnishing themselves for those services, or 
 employing themselves in them; either publicly or privately; in the 
 stated times, or out of them. They must be God's mouth to the people in 
 the ministry of the word, and the people's mouth to God in prayer. In 
 order to the conviction and conversion of sinners, and the edification 
 and consolation of saints, we must not only offer up our prayers for 
 them, but we must minister the word to them, seconding our prayers with 
 our endeavours, in the use of appointed means. Nor must we only 
 minister the word to them, but we must pray for them, that it may be 
 effectual; for God's grace can do all without our preaching, but our 
 preaching can do nothing without God's grace. The apostles were endued 
 with extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost, tongues and miracles; and 
 yet that to which they gave themselves continually was preaching and 
 praying, by which they might edify the church: and those ministers, 
 without doubt, are the successors of the apostles (not in the plenitude 
 of the apostolical power--those are daring usurpers who pretend to
 this, but in the best and most excellent of the apostolical works) who 
 give themselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word; 
 and such Christ will always be with, <I>even to the end of the 
 world.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How this proposal was agreed to, and presently put in execution, by 
 the disciples. It was not imposed upon them by an absolute power, 
 though they might have been bold in Christ to do this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:8">Philem. 8</A>),

 but proposed, as that which was highly convenient, and <I>then the 
 saying pleased the whole multitude,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It pleased them to see the apostles so willing to have themselves 
 discharged from intermeddling in secular affairs, and to transmit them 
 to others; it pleased them to hear that they would give themselves to 
 the word and prayer; and therefore they neither disputed the matter nor 
 deferred the execution of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They pitched upon the persons. It is not probable that they all 
 cast their eye upon the same men. Everyone had his friend, whom he 
 thought well of. But the majority of votes fell upon the persons here 
 named; and the rest both of the candidates and the electors acquiesced, 
 and made no disturbance, as the members of societies in such cases 
 ought to do. An apostle, who was an extraordinary officer, was chosen 
 by lot, which is more immediately the act of God; but the overseers of 
 the poor were chosen by the suffrage of the people, in which yet a 
 regard is to be had to the providence of God, who has all men's hearts 
 and tongues in his hand. We have a list of the persons chosen. Some 
 think they were such as were before of the seventy disciples; but this 
 is not likely, for they were ordained by Christ himself, long since, 
 <I>to preach the gospel;</I> and there was not more reason that they 
 should leave the word of God to serve tables than that the apostles 
 should. It is therefore more probable that they were of those that were 
 converted since the pouring out of the Spirit; for it was promised to 
 all that would be baptized that they should <I>receive the gift of the 
 Holy Ghost;</I> and the gift, according to that promise, is that 
 fulness of the Holy Ghost which was required in those that were to be 
 chosen to this service. We may further conjecture, concerning these 
 seven, 

 [1.] That they were such as had sold their estates, and brought the 
 money into the common stock; for <I>c&aelig;teris paribus--other things
 being equal,</I> those were fittest to be entrusted with the 
 distribution of it who had been most generous in the contribution to 
 it. 

 [2.] That these seven were all of the Grecian or Hellenist Jews, for 
 they have all Greek names, and this would be most likely <I>to silence 
 the murmurings of the Grecians</I> (which occasioned this institution), 
 to have the trust lodged in those that were foreigners, like 
 themselves, who would be sure not to neglect them. <I>Nicolas,</I> it 
 is plain, was one of them, for he was <I>a proselyte of Antioch;</I> 
 and some think the manner of expression intimates that they were all
 proselytes of Jerusalem, as he was of Antioch. The first named is 
 <I>Stephen,</I> the glory of these <I>septemviri, a man full of faith 
 and of the Holy Ghost;</I> he had a strong faith in the doctrine of 
 Christ, and was full of it above most; <I>full of fidelity, full of 
 courage</I> (so some), for he was <I>full of the Holy Ghost,</I> of his 
 gifts and graces. He was an extraordinary man, and excelled in every 
 thing that was good; his name signifies <I>a crown. Phillip</I> is put 
 next, because he, having <I>used this office of a deacon well, thereby 
 obtained a good degree,</I> and was afterwards ordained to the office 
 of an evangelist, a companion and assistant to the apostles, for so he 
 is expressly called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:8"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 8</A>.

 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:11">Eph. iv. 11</A>.

 And his preaching and baptizing (which we read of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:12"><I>ch.</I> viii. 12</A>)

 were certainly not as a deacon (for it is plain that that office was
 <I>serving tables,</I> in opposition <I>to the ministry of the 
 word</I>), but as an evangelist; and, when he was preferred to that 
 office, we have reason to think he quitted this office, as incompatible 
 with that. As for <I>Stephen,</I> nothing we find done by him proves 
 him to be a preacher of the gospel; for he only disputes in the 
 schools, and pleads for his life at the bar,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:9,7:2"><I>v.</I> 9, and <I>ch.</I> vii. 2</A>.

 The last named is <I>Nicolas,</I> who, some say, afterwards degenerated
 (as the Judas among these seven) and was the founder of <I>the sect of 
 the Nicolaitans</I> which we read of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:6,15">Rev. ii. 6, 15</A>),

 and which Christ there says, once and again, was a thing he hated. But
 some of the ancients clear him from this charge, and tell us that, 
 though that vile impure sect denominated themselves from him, yet it 
 was unjustly, and because he only insisted much upon it <I>that those 
 that had wives should be as though they had none,</I> thence they 
 wickedly inferred <I>that those that had wives should have them in 
 common,</I> which therefore Tertullian, when he speaks of the community 
 of goods, particularly excepts: <I>Omnia indiscreta apud nos, 
 pr&aelig;ter uxores--All things are common among us, except our
 wives.</I>--Apol. cap, 39.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The apostles appointed them to this work of serving tables for the 
 present, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The people presented them to the apostles, who approved their choice, 
 and ordained them. 

 [1.] They prayed with them, and for them, that God would give them more 
 and more of the Holy Ghost and of wisdom--that he would qualify them
 for the service to which they were called, and own them in it, and make 
 them thereby a blessing to the church, and particularly to the poor of 
 the flock. All that are employed in the service of the church ought to 
 be committed to the conduct of the divine grace by the prayers of the 
 church. 

 [2.] <I>They laid their hands on them,</I> that is, <I>they blessed 
 them in the name of the Lord,</I> for laying on hands was used in 
 blessing; so <I>Jacob blessed both the sons of Joseph;</I> and, without 
 controversy, <I>the less is blessed of the greater</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:7">Heb. vii. 7</A>);

 the deacons are blessed by the apostles, and the overseers of the poor
 by the pastors of the congregation. Having by prayer implored a 
 blessing upon them, they did by the laying on of hands assure them that 
 the blessing was conferred in answer to the prayer; and this was giving 
 them authority to execute that office, and laying an obligation upon 
 the people to be observant of them therein.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The advancement of the church hereupon. When things were thus put 
 into good order in the church (grievances were redressed and 
 discontents silenced) then religion got ground, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 1. <I>The word of God increased.</I> Now that the apostles resolved to 
 stick more closely than ever to their preaching, it spread the gospel 
 further, and brought it home with the more power. Ministers 
 disentangling themselves from secular employments, and addicting 
 themselves entirely and vigorously to their work, will contribute very 
 much, as a means, to the success of the gospel. The word of God is said 
 to increase as the seed sown increases when it comes up again thirty, 
 sixty, a hundred fold. 

 2. Christians became numerous: <I>The number of the disciples
 multiplied in Jerusalem greatly.</I> When Christ was upon earth, his 
 ministry had least success in Jerusalem; yet now that city affords most 
 converts. God has his remnant even in the worst of places.

 3. <I>A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
 Then</I> is the word and grace of God greatly magnified when those are 
 wrought upon by it that were least likely, as the priests here, who 
 either had opposed it, or at least were linked in with those that had. 
 The priests, whose preferments arose from the law of Moses, were yet 
 willing to let them go for the gospel of Christ; and, it should seem, 
 they came <I>in a body;</I> many of them agreed together, for the 
 keeping up of one another's credit, and the strengthening of one 
 another's hands, to join at once in giving up their names to Christ: 
 <B><I>polis ochlos</I></B>--<I>a great crowd of priests</I> were, by
 the grace of God helped over their prejudices, and <I>were obedient to 
 the faith,</I> so their conversion is described.

 (1.) They embraced the doctrine of the gospel; their understandings 
 were captivated to the power of the truths of Christ, and every 
 opposing objecting thought brought into obedience to him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:4,5">2 Cor. x. 4, 5</A>.

 The gospel is said to be <I>made known for the obedience of
 faith,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:26">Rom. xvi. 26</A>.

 Faith is an act of obedience, for this is God's commandment, <I>that we
 believe,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:23">1 John iii. 23</A>.

 (2.) They evinced the sincerity of their believing the gospel of
 Christ by a cheerful compliance with all the rules and precepts of the 
 gospel. The design of the gospel is to refine and reform our hearts and 
 lives; faith gives law to us, and we must be obedient to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and
 miracles among the people.
 &nbsp; 9 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called
 <I>the synagogue</I> of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and
 Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with
 Stephen.
 &nbsp; 10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit
 by which he spake.
 &nbsp; 11 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
 blasphemous words against Moses, and <I>against</I> God.
 &nbsp; 12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the
 scribes, and came upon <I>him,</I> and caught him, and brought <I>him</I>
 to the council,
 &nbsp; 13 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not
 to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
 &nbsp; 14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall
 destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses
 delivered us.
 &nbsp; 15 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him,
 saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Stephen, no doubt was diligent and faithful in the discharge of his 
 office as distributor of the church's charity, and laid out himself to 
 put that affair in a good method, which he did to universal 
 satisfaction; and though it appears here that he was a man of uncommon 
 gifts, and fitted for a higher station, yet, being called to that 
 office, he did not think it below him to do the duty of it. And, being 
 faithful in a little, he was entrusted with more; and, though we do not 
 find him propagating the gospel by preaching and baptizing, yet we find 
 him here called out to very honourable services, and owned in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He proved the truth of the gospel, by working miracles in Christ's 
 name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 1. He was <I>full of faith and power,</I> that is, of a strong faith, 
 by which he was enabled to do great things. Those that are full of 
 faith are full of power, because by faith the power of God is engaged 
 for us. His faith did so fill him that it left no room for unbelief and 
 made room for the influences of divine grace, so that, as the prophet 
 speaks, he was <I>full of power by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:8">Mic. iii. 8</A>.

 By faith we are emptied of self, and so are filled with Christ, who is
 the <I>wisdom of God and the power of God.</I> 

 2. Being so <I>he did great wonders and miracles among the people,</I>
 openly, and in the sight of all; for Christ's miracles feared not the 
 strictest scrutiny. It is not strange that Stephen, though he was not
 a preacher by office, did these great wonders, for we find that these 
 were distinct gifts of the Spirit, and divided severally, for <I>to one 
 was given the working of miracles, and to another prophecy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:10,11">1 Cor. xii. 10, 11</A>.

 And <I>these signs followed</I> not only those that preached, but those
 that believed.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:17">Mark xvi. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He pleaded the cause of Christianity against those that opposed it, 
 and argued against it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>);

 he served the interests of religion as a disputant, in the high places 
 of the field, while others were serving them as vinedressers and 
 husbandmen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We are here told who were his opponents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 They were Jews, but Hellenist Jews, Jews of the dispersion, who seem to 
 have been more zealous for their religion than the native Jews; it was 
 with difficulty that they retained the practice and profession of it in 
 the country where they lived, where they were as speckled birds, and 
 not without great expense and toil that they kept up their attendance 
 at Jerusalem, and this made them more active sticklers for Judaism than 
 those were whose profession of their religion was cheap and easy. They 
 were <I>of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the 
 Libertines;</I> the Romans called those <I>Liberti,</I> or 
 <I>Libertini,</I> who either, being foreigners, were naturalized, or, 
 being slaves by birth, were manumitted, or made freemen. Some think 
 that these Libertines were such of the Jews as had obtained the Roman 
 freedom, as Paul had

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:27,28"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 27, 28</A>);

 and it is probable that he was the most forward man of this synagogue
 of the Libertines in disputing with Stephen, and engaged others in the 
 dispute, for we find him busy in the stoning of Stephen, and consenting 
 to his death. There were others that belonged to the synagogue of the 
 Cyrenians and Alexandrians, of which synagogue the Jewish writers 
 speak; and others that belonged to their synagogue who were of Cilicia 
 and Asia; and if Paul, as a freeman of Rome, did not belong to the 
 synagogue of the Libertines, he belonged to this, as a native of 
 Tarsus, a city of Cilicia: it is probable that he might be a member of 
 both. The Jews that were born in other countries, and had concerns in 
 them, had frequent occasion, not only to resort to, but to reside in, 
 Jerusalem. Each nation had its synagogue, as in London there are 
 French, and Dutch, and Danish churches: and those synagogues were the 
 schools to which the Jews of those nations sent their youth to be 
 educated in the Jewish learning. Now those that were tutors and 
 professors in these synagogues, seeing the gospel grow, and the rulers 
 conniving at the growth of it, and fearing what would be the 
 consequence of it to the Jewish religion, which they were jealous for, 
 being confident of the goodness of their cause, and their own 
 sufficiency to manage it, would undertake to run down Christianity by 
 force of argument. It was a fair and rational way of dealing with it, 
 and what religion is always ready to admit. <I>Produce your cause, 
 saith the Lord, bring forth your strong reasons,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:21">Isa. xli. 21</A>.

 But why did they dispute with Stephen? And why not with the apostles 
 themselves?

 (1.) Some think because they despised the apostles as <I>unlearned and
 ignorant men,</I> whom they thought it below them to engage with; but 
 Stephen was bred a scholar, and they thought it their honour to meddle 
 with their match. 

 (2.) Others think it was because they stood in awe of the apostles, and 
 could not be so free and familiar with them as they could be with 
 Stephen, who was in an inferior office. 

 (3.) Perhaps, they having given a public challenge, Stephen was chosen 
 and appointed by the disciples to be their champion; for it was not 
 meet that the apostles should leave the preaching of the word of God to 
 engage in controversy. Stephen, who was only a deacon in the church,
 and a very sharp young man, of bright parts, and better qualified to 
 deal with wrangling disputants than the apostles themselves, was 
 appointed to this service. Some historians say that Stephen had been
 bred up at the feet of Gamaliel, and that Saul and the rest of them set 
 upon him as a deserter, and with a particular fury made him their mark. 
 
 (4.) It is probable that they disputed with Stephen because he was 
 zealous to argue with them and convince them, and this was the service 
 to which God had called him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We are here told how he carried the point in this dispute 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 <I>They were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he 
 spoke.</I> They could neither support their own arguments nor answer 
 his. He proved by such irresistible arguments that Jesus is the Christ, 
 and delivered himself with so much clearness and fulness that they had 
 nothing to object against what he said; though they were not convinced, 
 yet they were confounded. It is not said, They were not able to resist 
 him, but, They were not able to resist the <I>wisdom and the Spirit by 
 which he spoke,</I> that Spirit of wisdom which spoke by him. Now was 
 fulfilled that promise, <I>I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all 
 your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:15">Luke xxi. 15</A>.

 They thought they had only disputed with Stephen, and could make their
 part good with him; but they were disputing with the Spirit of God in 
 him, for whom they were an unequal match.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. At length, he sealed it with his blood; so we shall find he did in 
 the next chapter; here we have some steps taken by his enemies towards 
 it. When they could not answer his arguments as a disputant, they 
 prosecuted him as a criminal, and suborned witnesses against him, to 
 swear blasphemy upon him. "On such terms (saith Mr. Baxter here) do we 
 dispute with malignant men. And it is next to a miracle of providence 
 that no greater number of religious persons have been murdered in the 
 world, by the way of perjury and pretence of law, when so many 
 thousands hate them who make no conscience of false oaths." They 
 suborned men, that is, instructed them what to say, and then hired them 
 to swear it. They were the more enraged against him because he had 
 proved them to be in the wrong, and shown them the right way; for which 
 they ought to have given him their best thanks. <I>Was he therefore 
 become their enemy, because he told them the truth,</I> and proved it 
 to be so? Now let us observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How with all possible art and industry they incensed both the 
 government and the mob against him, that, if they could not prevail by 
 the one, they might by the other 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>They stirred up the people</I> against him, that, if the sanhedrim 
 should still think fit (according to Gamaliel's advice) to let him 
 alone, yet they might run him down by a popular rage and tumult; they 
 also found means to stir up the elders and scribes against him, that, 
 if the people should countenance and protect him, they might prevail by 
 authority. Thus they doubted not but to gain their point, when then had 
 two strings to their bow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How they got him to the bar: <I>They came upon him,</I> when he 
 little thought of it, <I>and caught him and brought him to the 
 council.</I> They came upon him in a body, and flew upon him as a lion 
 upon his prey; so the word signifies. By their rude and violent 
 treatment of him, they would represent him, both to the people, and to 
 the government, as a dangerous man, that would either flee from justice 
 if he were not watched, or fight with it if he were not put under a 
 force. Having caught him, they brought him triumphantly into the 
 council, and, as it should seem, so hastily that he had none of his 
 friends with him. They had found, when they brought many together, that 
 they emboldened one another, and strengthened one another's hands; and 
 therefore they will try how to deal with them singly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How they were prepared with evidence ready to produce against him. 
 They were resolved that they would not be run a-ground, as they were 
 when they brought our Saviour upon his trial, and then had to seek for 
 witnesses. These were got ready beforehand, and were instructed to make 
 oath that they had <I>heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses 
 and against God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 --against this <I>holy place and the law</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 for they heard him say what Jesus would do to their place and their 
 customs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is probable that he had said something to that purport; and yet 
 those who swore it against him are called <I>false witnesses,</I> 
 because, though there was something of truth in their testimony, yet 
 they put a wrong and malicious construction upon what he had said, and 
 perverted it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What was the general charge exhibited against him--that he <I>spoke
 blasphemous words;</I> and, to aggravate the matter, "He <I>ceases not 
 to speak blasphemous words;</I> it is his common talk, his discourse in 
 all companies; wheresoever he comes, he makes it his business to instil 
 his notions into all he converses with." It intimates likewise 
 something of contumacy and contempt of admonition. "He has been warned 
 against it, and yet ceases not to talk at this rate." Blasphemy is 
 justly reckoned a heinous crime (to speak contemptibly and 
 reproachfully of God our Maker), and therefore Stephen's persecutors 
 would be thought to have a deep concern upon them for the honour of 
 God's name, and to do this in a jealousy for that. As it was with the 
 confessors and martyrs of the Old Testament, so it was with those of 
 the New--their brethren that hated them, and cast them out, said, <I>Let
 the Lord be glorified;</I> and pretended they did him service in it. He 
 is said to have spoken blasphemous words <I>against Moses and against 
 God.</I> Thus far they were right, that those who blaspheme Moses (if 
 they meant the writings of Moses, which were given by inspiration of 
 God) blaspheme God himself. Those that speak reproachfully of the 
 scriptures, and ridicule them, reflect upon God himself, and do despite 
 to him. His great intention is to <I>magnify the law and make it 
 honourable;</I> those therefore that vilify the law, and make it 
 contemptible, blaspheme his name; for he has <I>magnified his word 
 above all his name.</I> But did Stephen blaspheme Moses? By no means, 
 he was far from it. Christ, and the preachers of his gospel, never said 
 any thing that looked like blaspheming Moses; they always quoted his 
 writings with respect, appealed to them, and said no other things than 
 what Moses said should come; very unjustly therefore is Stephen 
 indicted for blaspheming Moses. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Let us see how this charge is supported and made out; why, truly, 
 when the thing was to be proved, all they can charge him with is that 
 <I>he hath spoken blasphemous words against this holy place and the 
 law;</I> and this must be deemed and taken as blasphemy against Moses 
 and against God himself. Thus does the charge dwindle when it comes to 
 the evidence. 

 [1.] He is charged with blaspheming <I>this holy place.</I> Some 
 understand this of the city of Jerusalem, which was the holy city, and 
 which they had a mighty jealousy for. But it is rather meant of the 
 temple, that holy house. Christ was condemned as a blasphemer for words 
 which were thought to reflect upon the temple, which they seemed 
 concerned for the honour of, even when they by their wickedness had 
 profaned it. 

 [2.] He is charged with blaspheming <I>the law,</I> of which they 
 <I>made their boast,</I> and in which they put their trust, when 
 through <I>breaking the law they dishonoured God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:23">Rom. ii. 23</A>.

 Well, but how can they make this out? Why, here the charge dwindles 
 again; for all they can accuse him of is that <I>they had</I> 
 themselves <I>heard him say</I> (but how it came in, or what 
 explication he gave to if, they think not themselves bound to give 
 account) that this <I>Jesus of Nazareth,</I> who was so much talked of, 
 <I>shall destroy this place, and change the customs which Moses 
 delivered to us.</I> He could not be charged with having said any thing 
 to the disparagement either of the temple or of the law. The priests 
 had themselves profaned the temple, by making it not only a house of 
 merchandise, but a den of thieves; yet they would be thought zealous 
 for the honour of it, against one that had never said any thing amiss 
 of it, but had attended it more as a house of prayer, according to the 
 true intention of it, than they had. Nor had he ever reproached the law 
 as they had. But, <I>First,</I> He had said, <I>Jesus of Nazareth shall 
 destroy this place,</I> destroy the temple, destroy Jerusalem. It is 
 probable that he might say so; and what blasphemy was it against the 
 holy place to say that it should not be perpetual any more than Shiloh 
 was, and that the just and holy God would not continue the privileges 
 of his sanctuary to those that abused them? Had not the prophets given 
 the same warning to their fathers of the destruction of that holy place 
 by the Chaldeans? Nay, when the temple was first built, had not God 
 himself given the same warning: <I>This house, which is high, shall be 
 an astonishment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+7:21">2 Chron. vii. 21</A>.

 And is he a blasphemer, then, who tells them that Jesus of Nazareth, if
 they continue their opposition to him, will bring a just destruction 
 upon their place and nation, and they may thank themselves? Those 
 wickedly abuse their profession of religion who, under colour of that, 
 call the reproofs given them for their disagreeable conversations 
 blasphemous reflections upon their religion. <I>Secondly,</I> He had 
 said, <I>This Jesus shall change the customs which Moses delivered to 
 us.</I> And it was expected that in the days of the Messiah they should 
 be changed, and that the shadows should be done away when the substance 
 was come; yet this was no essential change of the law, but the 
 perfecting of it. <I>Christ came, not to destroy,</I> but to fulfil, 
 the law; and, if he changed some customs that Moses delivered, it was 
 to introduce and establish those that were much better; and if the 
 Jewish church had not obstinately refused to come into this new 
 establishment, and adhered to the ceremonial law, for aught I know 
 <I>their place</I> had not been destroyed; so that for putting them 
 into a certain way to prevent their destruction, and for giving them 
 certain notice of their destruction if they did not take that way, he 
 is accused as a blasphemer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We are here told how God owned him when he was brought before the 
 council, and made it to appear that he stood by him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>All that sat in the council,</I> the priests, scribes, and elders, 
 <I>looking stedfastly on him,</I> being a stranger, and one they had 
 not yet had before them, <I>saw his face as it had been the face of an 
 angel.</I> It is usual for judges to observe the countenance of the 
 prisoner, which sometimes is an indication either of guilt or 
 innocence. Now Stephen appeared at the bar with the countenance <I>as 
 of an angel.</I> 

 1. Perhaps it intimates no more than that he had an extraordinarily
 pleasant, cheerful countenance, and there was not in it the least sign 
 either of fear for himself or anger at his persecutors. He looked as
 if he had never been better pleased in his life than he was now when he 
 was called out to bear his testimony to the gospel of Christ, thus 
 publicly, and stood fair for the crown of martyrdom. Such an 
 undisturbed serenity, such an undaunted courage, and such an 
 unaccountable mixture of mildness and majesty, there was in his 
 countenance, that every one said he looked like an angel; enough surely 
 to convince the Sadducees that there are angels, when they saw before 
 their eyes an incarnate angel. 

 2. It should rather seem that there was a miraculous splendour and
 brightness upon his countenance, like that of our Saviour when he was 
 transfigured--or, at least, that of Moses when he came down from the
 mount--God designing thereby to put honour upon his faithful witness
 and confusion upon his persecutors and judges, whose sin would be 
 highly aggravated, and would be indeed a rebellion against the light, 
 if, notwithstanding this, they proceeded against him. Whether he 
 himself knew that the skin of his face shone or no we are not told; but 
 <I>all that sat in the council saw it,</I> and probably took notice of 
 it to one another, and an arrant shame it was that when they saw, and 
 could not but see by it that he was owned of God, they did not call him 
 from standing at the bar to sit in the chief seat upon the bench. 
 Wisdom and holiness make a man's face to shine, and yet these will not 
 secure men from the greatest indignities; and no wonder, when the 
 shining of Stephen's face could not be his protection; though it had 
 been easy to prove that if he had been guilty of putting any dishonour 
 upon Moses God would not thus have put Moses's honour upon him.</P>
