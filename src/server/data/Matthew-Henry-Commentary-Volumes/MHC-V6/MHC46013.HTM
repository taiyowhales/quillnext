 In this chapter the apostle goes on to show more particularly what that 
 more excellent way was of which he had just before been speaking. He 
 recommends it, 

 I. By showing the necessity and importance of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. By giving a description of its properties and fruits, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 III. By showing how much it excels the best of gifts and other graces,
 by its continuance, when they shall be no longer in being, or of any 
 use,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and
 have not charity, I am become <I>as</I> sounding brass, or a tinkling
 cymbal.
 &nbsp; 2  And though I have <I>the gift of</I> prophecy, and understand all
 mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so
 that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
 nothing.
 &nbsp; 3  And though I bestow all my goods to feed <I>the poor,</I> and
 though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it
 profiteth me nothing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle shows what more excellent way he meant, or had in 
 view, in the close of the former chapter, namely, <I>charity,</I> or, 
 as it is commonly elsewhere rendered, <I>love</I>--<B><I>agape</I></B>:
 not what is meant by charity in our common use of the word, which most 
 men understand of alms-giving, but love in its fullest and most
 extensive meaning, true love to God and man, a benevolent disposition 
 of mind towards our fellow-christians, growing out of sincere and 
 fervent devotion to God. This living principle of all duty and 
 obedience is the more excellent way of which the apostle speaks, 
 preferable to all gifts. Nay, without this the most glorious gifts are 
 nothing, of no account to us, of no esteem in the sight of God. He 
 specifies, 

 1. The gift of tongues: <I>Though I speak with the tongues of men and
 of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a 
 tinkling cymbal,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Could a man speak all the languages on earth, and that with the
 greatest propriety, elegance, and fluency, could he talk like an angel, 
 and yet be without charity, it would be all empty noise, mere 
 unharmonious and useless sound, that would neither profit nor delight. 
 It is not talking freely, nor finely, nor learnedly, of the things of 
 God, that will save ourselves, or profit others, if we are destitute of 
 holy love. It is the charitable heart, not the voluble tongue, that is 
 acceptable with God. The apostle specifies first this gift because 
 hereupon the Corinthians seemed chiefly to value themselves and despise 
 their brethren. 

 2. Prophecy, and the understanding of mysteries, and all knowledge.
 This without charity is as nothing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Had a man ever so clear an understanding of the prophecies and types 
 under the old dispensation, ever so accurate a knowledge of the 
 doctrines of Christianity, nay, and this by inspiration, from the 
 infallible dictates and illumination of the Spirit of God, without 
 charity he would be nothing; all this would stand him in no stead. 
 Note, A clear and deep head is of no signification, without a 
 benevolent and charitable heart. It is not great knowledge that God 
 sets a value upon, but true and hearty devotion and love. 

 3. Miraculous faith, the faith of miracles, or the faith by which
 persons were enabled to work miracles: <I>Had I all faith</I> (the 
 utmost degree of this kind of faith), <I>that I could remove 
 mountains</I> (or say to them, "Go hence into the midst of the sea," 
 and have my command obeyed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+11:23">Mark xi. 23</A>),

 <I>and had no charity, I am nothing.</I> The most wonder-working faith,
 to which nothing is in a manner impossible, is itself nothing without
 charity. Moving mountains is a great achievement in the account of men;
 but one dram of charity is, in God's account, of much greater worth
 than all the faith of this sort in the world. Those may do many
 wondrous works in Christ's name whom yet he will disown, and bid depart
 from him, as workers of iniquity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:22,23">Matt. vii. 22, 23</A>.

 Saving faith is ever in conjunction with charity, but the faith of
 miracles may be without it.

 4. The outward acts of charity: <I>Bestowing his goods to feed the
 poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Should all a man has be laid out in this manner, if he had no charity, 
 it would profit him nothing. There may be an open and lavish hand, 
 where there is no liberal and charitable heart. The external act of 
 giving alms may proceed from a very ill principle. Vain-glorious
 ostentation, or a proud conceit of merit, may put a man to large 
 expense this way who has no true love to God nor men. Our doing good to 
 others will do none to us, if it be not well done, namely, from a 
 principle of devotion and charity, love to God, and good-will to men. 
 Note, If we leave charity out of religion, the most costly services 
 will be of no avail to us. If we give away all we have, while we 
 withhold the heart from God, it will not profit. 

 5. Even sufferings, and even those of the most grievous kind: <I>If we
 give our bodies to be burnt, without charity, it profiteth nothing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:3">v. 3</A>.

 Should we sacrifice our lives for the faith of the gospel, and be burnt 
 to death in maintenance of its truth, this will stand us in no stead 
 without charity, unless we be animated to these sufferings by a 
 principle of true devotion to God, and sincere love to his church and 
 people, and good-will to mankind. The outward carriage may be 
 plausible, when the invisible principle is very bad. Some men have 
 thrown themselves into the fire to procure a name and reputation among 
 men. It is possible that the very same principle may have worked up 
 some to resolution enough to die for their religion who never heartily 
 believed and embraced it. But vindicating religion at the cost of our 
 lives will profit nothing if we feel not the power of it; and true 
 charity is the very heart and spirit of religion. If we feel none of 
 its sacred heat in our hearts, it will profit nothing, though we be 
 burnt to ashes for the truth. Note, The most grievous sufferings, the 
 most costly sacrifices, will not recommend us to God, if we do not love 
 the brethren; should we give our own bodies to be burnt, it would not 
 profit us. How strange a way of recommending themselves to God are 
 those got into who hope to do it by burning others, by murdering, and 
 massacring, and tormenting their fellow-christians, or by any injurious 
 usage of them! <I>My soul, enter not thou into their secrets.</I> If I 
 cannot hope to recommend myself to God by giving my own body to be 
 burnt while I have no charity, I will never hope to do it by burning or 
 maltreating others, in open defiance to all charity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Charity suffereth long, <I>and</I> is kind; charity envieth not;
 charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
 &nbsp; 5  Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not
 easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
 &nbsp; 6  Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
 &nbsp; 7  Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle gives us in these verses some of the properties and effects 
 of charity, both to describe and commend it, that we may know whether 
 we have this grace and that if we have not we may fall in love with 
 what is so exceedingly amiable, and not rest till we have obtained it. 
 It is an excellent grace, and has a world of good properties belonging 
 to it. As,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>It is long suffering</I>--<B><I>makrothymei.</I></B> It can
 endure evil, injury, and provocation, without being filled with 
 resentment, indignation, or revenge. It makes the mind firm, gives it 
 power over the angry passions, and furnishes it with a persevering 
 patience, that shall rather wait and wish for the reformation of a 
 brother than fly out in resentment of his conduct. It will put up with 
 many slights and neglects from the person it loves, and wait long to 
 see the kindly effects of such patience on him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>It is kind</I>--<B><I>chresteuetai.</I></B> It is benign,
 bountiful; it is courteous and obliging. <I>The law of kindness is in 
 her lips;</I> her heart is large, and her hand open. She is ready to 
 show favours and to do good. She seeks to be useful; and not only 
 seizes on opportunities of doing good, but searches for them. This is 
 her general character. She is patient under injuries, and apt and 
 inclined to do all the good offices in her power. And under these two 
 generals all the particulars of the character may be reduced.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Charity suppresses envy: <I>It envieth not;</I> it is not grieved 
 at the good of others; neither at their gifts nor at their good 
 qualities, their honours not their estates. If we love our neighbour we 
 shall be so far from envying his welfare, or being displeased with it, 
 that we shall share in it and rejoice at it. His bliss and 
 sanctification will be an addition to ours, instead of impairing or 
 lessening it. This is the proper effect of kindness and benevolence: 
 envy is the effect of ill-will. The prosperity of those to whom we
 wish well can never grieve us; and the mind which is bent on doing good 
 to all can never with ill to any.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Charity subdues pride and vain-glory; <I>It vaunteth not itself, is 
 not puffed up,</I> is not bloated with self-conceit, does not swell 
 upon its acquisitions, nor arrogate to itself that honour, or power, or 
 respect, which does not belong to it. It is not insolent, apt to
 despise others, or trample on them, or treat them with contempt and 
 scorn. Those who are animated with a principle of true brotherly love 
 will in honour prefer one another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:10">Rom. xii. 10</A>.

 They will <I>do nothing out</I> of a spirit of contention or
 <I>vain-glory, but in lowliness of mind will esteem others better than 
 themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:3">Phil. ii. 3</A>.

 True love will give us an esteem of our brethren, and raise our value
 for them; and this will limit our esteem of ourselves, and prevent the 
 tumours of self-conceit and arrogance. These ill qualities can never
 grow out of tender affection for the brethren, nor a diffusive 
 benevolence. The word rendered in our translation <I>vaunteth 
 itself</I> bears other significations; nor is the proper meaning, as I 
 can find, settled; but in every sense and meaning true charity stands 
 in opposition to it. The Syriac renders it, <I>non tumultuatur--does 
 not raise tumults</I> and disturbances. Charity calms the angry
 passions, instead of raising them. Others render it, <I>Non 
 perper&agrave;m et pervers&egrave; agit--It does not act insidiously 
 with any,</I> seek to ensnare them, nor tease them with needless 
 importunities and addresses. It is not froward, nor stubborn and 
 untractable, nor apt to be cross and contradictory. Some understand it 
 of dissembling and flattery, when a fair face is put on, and fine words 
 are said, without any regard to truth, or intention of good. Charity
 abhors such falsehood and flattery. Nothing is commonly more 
 pernicious, nor more apt to cross the purposes of true love and good 
 will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Charity is careful not to pass the bounds of decency; <B><I>ouk
 aschemonei</I></B>--<I>it behaveth not unseemly;</I> it does nothing
 indecorous, nothing that in the common account of men is base or vile. 
 It does nothing out of place or time; but behaves towards all men as 
 becomes their rank and ours, with reverence and respect to superiors, 
 with kindness and condescension to inferiors, with courtesy and 
 good-will towards all men. It is not for breaking order, confounding 
 ranks bringing all men on a level; but for keeping up the distinction 
 God has made between men, and acting decently in its own station, and 
 minding its own business, without taking upon it to mend, or censure, 
 or despise, the conduct of others. Charity will do nothing that 
 misbecomes it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Charity is an utter enemy to selfishness: <I>Seeketh not its 
 own,</I> does not inordinately desire nor seek its own praise, or 
 honour, or profit, or pleasure. Indeed self-love, in some degree, is 
 natural to all men, enters into their very constitution. And a 
 reasonable love of self is by our Saviour made the measure of our love 
 to others, that charity which is here described, <I>Thou shalt love thy 
 neighbour as thyself.</I> The apostle does not mean that charity 
 destroys all regard to self; he does not mean that the charitable man 
 should never challenge what is his own, but utterly neglect himself and 
 all his interests. Charity must then root up that principle which is 
 wrought into our nature. But charity never seeks its own to the hurt of 
 others, or with the neglect of others. It often neglects its own for 
 the sake of others; prefers their welfare, and satisfaction, and 
 advantage, to its own; and it ever prefers the weal of the public, of 
 the community, whether civil or ecclesiastical, to its private 
 advantage. It would not advance, nor aggrandize, nor enrich, nor 
 gratify itself, at the cost and damage of the public.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. It tempers and restrains the passions. <B><I>Ou 
 paroxynetai</I></B>--<I>is not exasperated.</I> It corrects a sharpness
 of temper, sweetens and softens the mind, so that it does not suddenly 
 conceive, nor long continue, a vehement passion. Where the fire of love 
 is kept in, the flames of wrath will not easily kindle, nor long keep 
 burning. Charity will never be angry without a cause, and will 
 endeavour to confine the passions within proper limits, that they may 
 not exceed the measure that is just, either in degree or duration.
 Anger cannot rest in the bosom where love reigns. It is hard to be 
 angry with those we love, but very easy to drop our resentments and be 
 reconciled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. Charity <I>thinks no evil.</I> It cherishes no malice, nor gives 
 way to revenge: so some understand it. It is not soon, nor long, angry; 
 it is never mischievous, nor inclined to revenge; it does not suspect 
 evil of others, <B><I>ou logizetai to kakon</I></B>--<I>it does not
 reason out</I> evil, charge guilt upon them by inference and 
 <I>innuendo,</I> when nothing of this sort appears open. True love is 
 not apt to be jealous and suspicious; it will hide faults that appear,
 and draw a veil over them, instead of hunting and raking out those that 
 lie covered and concealed: it will never indulge suspicion without 
 proofs, but will rather incline to darken and disbelieve evidence 
 against the person it affects. It will hardly give into an ill opinion 
 of another, and it will do it with regret and reluctance when the 
 evidence cannot be resisted; hence it will never be forward to suspect 
 ill, and reason itself into a bad opinion upon mere appearances, nor 
 give way to suspicion without any. It will not make the worst 
 construction of things, but put the best face that it can on 
 circumstances that have no good appearance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. The matter of its joy and pleasure is here suggested: 

 1. Negatively: <I>It rejoiceth not in iniquity.</I> It takes no
 pleasure in doing injury or hurt to any. It thinks not evil of any, 
 without very clear proof. It wishes ill to none, much less will it hurt 
 or wrong any, and least of all make this matter of its delight, rejoice 
 in doing harm and mischief. Nor will it rejoice at the faults and 
 failings of others, and triumph over them, either out of pride or 
 ill-will, because it will set off its own excellences or gratify its 
 spite. The sins of others are rather the grief of a charitable spirit 
 than its sport or delight; they will touch it to the quick, and stir 
 all its compassion, but give it no entertainment. It is the very height 
 of malice to take pleasure in the misery of a fellow-creature. And is 
 not falling into sin the greatest calamity that can befal one? How 
 inconsistent is it with Christian charity, to rejoice at such fall! 

 2. Affirmatively: <I>It rejoiceth in the truth,</I> is glad of the
 success of the gospel, commonly called <I>the truth,</I> by way of 
 emphasis, in the New Testament; and rejoices to see men moulded into an 
 evangelical temper by it, and made good. It takes no pleasure in their 
 sins, but is highly delighted to see them do well, to approve 
 themselves men of probity and integrity. It gives it much satisfaction 
 to see truth and justice prevail among men, innocency cleared, and 
 mutual faith and trust established, and to see piety and true religion 
 flourish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 X. <I>It beareth all things, it endureth all things,</I> <B><I>panta
 stegei, panta hypomenei.</I></B> Some read the first, <I>covers all 
 things.</I> So the original also signifies. <I>Charity will cover a 
 multitude of sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:8">1 Pet. iv. 8</A>.

 It will draw a veil over them, as far as it can consistently with duty.
 It is not for blazing nor publishing the faults of a brother, till duty 
 manifestly demands it. Necessity only can extort this from the 
 charitable mind. Though such a man be free to tell his brother his 
 faults in private, he is very unwilling to expose him by making them 
 public. Thus we do by our own faults, and thus charity would teach us 
 to do by the faults of others; not publish them to their shame and 
 reproach, but cover them from public notice as long as we can, and be 
 faithful to God and to others. Or, it <I>beareth all things,</I>--will 
 pass by and put up with injuries, without indulging anger or cherishing 
 revenge, will be patient upon provocation, and long patient, 
 <B><I>panta hypomenei</I></B>--holds firm, though it be much shocked, 
 and borne hard upon; sustains all manner of injury and ill usage, and 
 bears up under it, such as curses, contumacies, slanders, prison, 
 exile, bonds, torments, and death itself, for the sake of the 
 injurious, and of others; and perseveres in this firmness. Note, What a 
 fortitude and firmness fervent love will give the mind! What cannot a 
 lover endure for the beloved and for his sake! How many slights and 
 injuries will he put up with! How many hazards will he run and how many 
 difficulties encounter!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 XI. Charity believes and hopes well of others: <I>Believeth all things; 
 hopeth all things.</I> Indeed charity does by no means destroy 
 prudence, and, out of mere simplicity and silliness, believe every 
 word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+14:15">Prov. xiv. 15</A>.

 Wisdom may dwell with love, and charity be cautious. But it is apt to
 believe well of all, to entertain a good opinion of them when there is 
 no appearance to the contrary; nay, to believe well when there may be 
 some dark appearances, if the evidence of ill be not clear. All charity 
 is full of candour, apt to make the best of every thing, and put on it 
 the best face and appearance? it will judge well, and believe well, as 
 far as it can with any reason, and will rather stretch its faith beyond 
 appearances for the support of a kind opinion; but it will go into a 
 bad one with the upmost reluctance, and fence against it as much as it 
 fairly and honestly can. And when, in spite of inclination, it cannot 
 believe well of others, it will yet hope well, and continue to hope as 
 long as there is any ground for it. It will not presently conclude a 
 case desperate, but wishes the amendment of the worst of men, and is 
 very apt to hope for what it wishes. How well-natured and amiable a 
 thing is Christian charity? How lovely a mind is that which is 
 tinctured throughout with such benevolence, and has it diffused over 
 its whole frame! Happy the man who has this heavenly fire glowing in 
 his heart, flowing out of his mouth, and diffusing its warmth over all 
 with whom he has to do! How lovely a thing would Christianity appear to 
 the world, if those who profess it were more actuated and animated by 
 this divine principle, and paid a due regard to a command on which its 
 blessed author laid a chief stress! <I>A new commandment give I to you, 
 that you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one 
 another,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:34">John xiii. 34</A>.

 <I>By this shall all men know that you are my disciples,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.
 
 Blessed Jesus! how few of thy professed disciples are to be
 distinguished and marked out by this characteristic!</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle goes on to commend charity, and show how much it is 
 preferable to the gifts on which the Corinthians were so apt to pride 
 themselves, to the utter neglect, and almost extinction, of charity. 
 This he makes out,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. From its longer continuance and duration: <I>Charity never 
 faileth.</I> It is a permanent and perpetual grace, lasting as 
 eternity; whereas the extraordinary gifts on which the Corinthians 
 valued themselves were of short continuance. They were only to edify 
 the church on earth, and that but for a time, not during its whole 
 continuance in this world; but in heaven would be all superseded, which 
 yet is the very seat and element of love. <I>Prophecy must fail,</I> 
 that is, either the prediction of things to come (which is its most 
 common sense) or the interpretation of scripture by immediate 
 inspiration. <I>Tongues will cease,</I> that is, the miraculous power 
 of speaking languages without learning them. There will be but one 
 language in heaven. There is no confusion of tongues in the region of 
 perfect tranquility. And <I>knowledge will vanish away.</I> Not that, 
 in the perfect state above, holy and happy souls shall be unknowing, 
 ignorant: it is a very poor happiness that can consist with utter 
 ignorance. The apostle is plainly speaking of miraculous gifts, and 
 therefore of knowledge to be had out of the common way (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:6"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 6</A>),

 a knowledge of mysteries supernaturally communicated. Such knowledge 
 was to vanish away. Some indeed understand it of common knowledge 
 acquired by instruction, taught and learnt. This way of knowing is to 
 vanish away, though the knowledge itself, once acquired, will not be 
 lost. But it is plain that the apostle is here setting the grace of 
 charity in opposition to supernatural gifts. And it is more valuable, 
 because more durable; <I>it</I> shall last, when <I>they</I> shall be 
 no more; <I>it</I> shall enter into heaven, where <I>they</I> will have 
 no place, because they will be of no use, though, in a sense, even our 
 common knowledge may be said to cease in heaven, by reason of the 
 improvement that will then be made in it. The light of a candle is 
 perfectly obscured by the sun shining in its strength.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He hints that these gifts are adapted only to a state of 
 imperfection: <I>We know in part, and we prophesy in part,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Our best knowledge and our greatest abilities are at present like our 
 condition, narrow and temporary. Even the knowledge they had by 
 inspiration was but in part. How little a portion of God, and the 
 unseen world, was heard even by apostles and inspired men! How much 
 short do others come of them! But these gifts were fitted to the 
 present imperfect state of the church, valuable in themselves, but not 
 to be compared with charity, because they were to vanish with the 
 imperfections of the church, nay, and long before, whereas charity was 
 to last for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He takes occasion hence to show how much better it will be with 
 the church hereafter than it can be here. A state of perfection is in 
 view 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>When that which is perfect shall come, then that which is in part 
 shall be done away.</I> When the end is once attained, the means will 
 of course be abolished. There will be no need of tongues, and prophecy, 
 and inspired knowledge, in a future life, because then the church will 
 be in a state of perfection, complete both in knowledge and holiness. 
 God will be known then clearly, and in a manner by intuition, and as 
 perfectly as the capacity of glorified minds will allow; not by such 
 transient glimpses, and little portions, as here. The difference
 between these two states is here pointed at in two particulars: 

 1. The present state is a state of childhood, the future that of
 manhood: <I>When I was a child, I spoke as a child</I> (that is, as 
 some think, spoke with tongues), <I>I understood as a child;</I> 
 <B><I>ephronoun</I></B>--<I>sapiebam</I> (that is, "I prophesied, I was 
 taught the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, in such an extraordinary 
 way as manifested I was not out of my childish state"), <I>I 
 thought,</I> or reasoned, <B><I>elogizomen,</I></B> <I>as a child; but, 
 when I became a man, I put away childish things.</I> Such is the 
 difference between earth and heaven. What narrow views, what confused 
 and indistinct notions of things, have children, in comparison of grown 
 men! And how naturally do men, when reason is ripened and matured, 
 despise and relinquish their infant thoughts, put them away, reject 
 them, esteem as nothing! Thus shall we think of our most valued gifts 
 and acquisitions in this world, when we come to heaven. We shall 
 despise our childish folly, in priding ourselves in such things when we 
 are grown up to men in Christ. 

 2. Things are all dark and confused now, in comparison of what they
 will be hereafter: <I>Now we see through a glass darkly</I> (<B><I>en 
 ainigmati,</I></B> <I>in a riddle</I>), <I>then face to face; now we 
 know in part, but then we shall know as we are known.</I> Now we can 
 only discern things at a great distance, as through a telescope, and 
 that involved in clouds and obscurity; but hereafter the things to be 
 known will be near and obvious, open to our eyes; and our knowledge 
 will be free from all obscurity and error. God is to be seen <I>face to 
 face;</I> and we <I>are to know him as we are known by him;</I> not 
 indeed as perfectly, but in some sense in the same manner. We are known 
 to him by mere inspection; he turns his eye towards us, and sees and 
 searches us throughout. We shall then fix our eye on him, <I>and see 
 him as he is,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:2">1 John iii. 2</A>.

 We shall know how we are known, enter into all the mysteries of divine
 love and grace. O glorious change! To pass from darkness to light, from
 clouds to the clear sunshine of our Saviour's face, and in God's own
 light to see light! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:9">Ps. xxxvi. 9</A>.

 Note, It is the light of heaven only that will remove all clouds and
 darkness from the face of God. It is at best but twilight while we are 
 in this world; there it will be perfect and eternal day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. To sum up the excellences of charity, he prefers it not only to 
 gifts, but to other graces, to faith and hope 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>And now abide faith, hope, and charity; but the greatest of these is 
 charity.</I> True grace is much more excellent than any spiritual gifts 
 whatever. And faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces,
 of which charity is the chief, being the end to which the other two are 
 but means. This is the divine nature, the soul's felicity, or its 
 complacential rest in God, and holy delight in all his saints. And it 
 is everlasting work, when faith and hope shall be no more. Faith fixes 
 on the divine revelation, and assents to that: hope fastens on future 
 felicity, and waits for that: and in heaven faith well be swallowed up 
 in vision, and hope in fruition. There is no room to believe and hope, 
 when we see and enjoy. But love fastens on the divine perfections 
 themselves, and the divine image on the creatures, and our mutual 
 relation both to God and them. These will all shine forth in the most 
 glorious splendours in another world, and there will love be made 
 perfect; there we shall perfectly love God, because he will appear 
 amiable for ever, and our hearts will kindle at the sight, and glow 
 with perpetual devotion. And there shall we perfectly love one another, 
 when all the saints meet there, when none but saints are there, and 
 saints made perfect. O blessed state! How much surpassing the best 
 below! O amiable and excellent grace of charity! How much does it 
 exceed the most valuable gift, when it outshines every grace, and is 
 the everlasting consummation of them! When faith and hope are at an 
 end, true charity will burn for ever with the brightest flame. Note, 
 Those border most upon the heavenly state and perfection whose hearts 
 are fullest of this divine principle, and burn with the most fervent 
 charity. It is the surest offspring of God, and bears his fairest 
 impression. For God is love,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:8,16">1 John iv. 8, 16</A>.

 And where God is to be seen as he is, and face to face, there charity
 is in its greatest height--there, and there only, will it be 
 perfected.</P>
