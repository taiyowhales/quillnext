 In this chapter our apostle treats of church-officers. He specifies, 

 I. The qualifications of a person to be admitted to the office of a
 bishop, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. The qualifications of deacons 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>),

 and of their wives

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:11">ver. 11</A>),

 again of the deacons,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>.

 III. The reasons of his writing to Timothy, whereupon he speaks of the
 church and the foundation-truth professed therein,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  This <I>is</I> a true saying, If a man desire the office of a
 bishop, he desireth a good work.
 &nbsp; 2  A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
 vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to
 teach;
 &nbsp; 3  Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
 but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
 &nbsp; 4  One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in
 subjection with all gravity;
 &nbsp; 5  (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall
 he take care of the church of God?)
 &nbsp; 6  Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into
 the condemnation of the devil.
 &nbsp; 7  Moreover he must have a good report of them which are
 without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The two epistles to Timothy, and that to Titus, contain a 
 scripture-plan of church-government, or a direction to ministers.
 Timothy, we suppose, was an evangelist who was left at Ephesus, to take 
 care of those whom the Holy Ghost had made bishops there, that is, the 
 presbyters, as appears by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28">Acts xx. 28</A>,

 where the care of the church was committed to the presbyters, and they
 were called bishops. It seems they were very loth to part with Paul, 
 especially because he told them they should <I>see his face no more</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:38">Acts xx. 38</A>);

 for their church was but newly planted, they were afraid of undertaking 
 the care of it, and therefore Paul left Timothy with them to set them 
 in order. And here we have the character of a gospel minister, whose 
 office it is, as a bishop, to preside in a particular congregation of 
 Christians: <I>If a man desires the office of a bishop, he desires a 
 good work,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The ministry is a work. However the office of a bishop may be now 
 thought a good preferment, then it was thought a good work. 

 1. The office of a scripture-bishop is an office of divine appointment, 
 and not of human invention. The ministry is not a creature of the 
 state, and it is a pity that the minister should be at any time the 
 tool of the state. The office of the ministry was in the church before 
 the magistrate countenanced Christianity, for this office is one of the 
 great gifts Christ has bestowed on the church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8-11">Eph. iv. 8-11</A>.

 2. This office of a Christian bishop is a work, which requires
 diligence and application: the apostle represents it under the notion
 and character of a work; not of great honour and advantage, for
 ministers should always look more to their work than to the honour and
 advantage of their office. 

 3. It is a good work, a work of the greatest importance, and designed
 for the greatest good: the ministry is conversant about no lower 
 concerns than the life and happiness of immortal souls; it is a good 
 work, because designed to illustrate the divine perfections in bringing 
 many sons to glory; the ministry is appointed to open men's eyes, and 
 to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto 
 God, &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:18">Acts xxvi. 18</A>.

 4. There ought to be an earnest desire of the office in those who would
 be put into it; if a man desire, he should earnestly desire it for the 
 prospect he has of bringing greater glory to God, and of doing the 
 greatest good to the souls of men by this means. This is the question 
 proposed to those who offer themselves to the ministry of the church of 
 England: "Do you think you are moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon you 
 this office?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In order to the discharge of this office, the doing of this work, 
 the workman must be qualified. 

 1. A minister must be blameless, he must not lie under any scandal; he
 must give as little occasion for blame as can be, because this would be 
 a prejudice to his ministry and would reflect reproach upon his office. 
 
 2. He must be the husband of one wife; not having given a bill of
 divorce to one, and then taken another, or not having many wives at 
 once, as at that time was too common both among Jews and Gentiles, 
 especially among the Gentiles.

 3. He must be vigilant and watchful against Satan, that subtle enemy;
 he must watch over himself, and the souls of those who are committed to 
 his charge, of whom having taken the <I>oversight,</I> he must improve 
 all opportunities of doing them good. A minister ought to be vigilant, 
 because our adversary the devil goes about like a roaring lion, seeking 
 whom he may devour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:8">1 Pet. v. 8</A>.

 4. He must be sober, temperate, moderate in all his actions, and in the
 use of all creature-comforts. Sobriety and watchfulness are often in 
 scripture put together, because they mutually befriend one another: 
 <I>Be sober, be vigilant.</I> 

 5. He must be of good behaviour, composed and solid, and not light, 
 vain, and frothy. 

 6. He must be given to hospitality, open-handed to strangers, and ready
 to entertain them according to his ability, as one who does not set his 
 heart upon the wealth of the world and who is a true lover of his 
 brethren. 

 7. Apt to teach. Therefore this is a preaching bishop whom Paul
 describes, one who is both able and willing to communicate to others 
 the knowledge which God has given him, one who is fit to teach and 
 ready to take all opportunities of giving instructions, who is himself 
 <I>well instructed in the things of the kingdom of heaven,</I> and is 
 communicative of what he knows to others.

 8. No drunkard: <I>Not given to wine.</I> The priests were not to drink
 wine when they went in to minister

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:8,9">Lev. x. 8, 9</A>),

 lest they should drink and pervert the law.

 9. No striker; one who is not quarrelsome, nor apt to use violence to
 any, but does every thing with mildness, love, and gentleness. The
 servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle towards all, &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:24">2 Tim. ii. 24</A>.

 10. One who is not greedy of filthy lucre, who does not make his 
 ministry to truckle to any secular design or interest, who uses no 
 mean, base, sordid ways of getting money, who is dead to the wealth of 
 this world, lives above it, and makes it appear he is so. 

 11. He must be patient, and not a brawler, of a mild disposition.
 Christ, the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls, is so. Not apt to be 
 angry or quarrelsome; as not a striker with his hands, so not a brawler 
 with his tongue; for how shall men teach others to govern their tongues 
 who do not make conscience of keeping them under good government 
 themselves?

 12. Not covetous. Covetousness is bad in any, but it is worst in a
 minister, whose calling leads him to converse so much with another 
 world.

 13. He must be one who keeps his family in good order: <I>That rules
 well his own house,</I> that he may set a good example to other masters 
 of families to do so too, and that he may thereby give a proof of his 
 ability to take care of the church of God: <I>For, if a man know not 
 how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of 
 God.</I> Observe, The families of ministers ought to be examples of 
 good to all others families. Ministers must have their children in 
 subjection; then it is the duty of ministers' children to submit to the 
 instructions that are given them.--<I>With all gravity.</I> The best 
 way to keep inferiors in subjection, is to be grave with them. Not 
 having his children in subjection with all austerity, but with all 
 gravity.

 14. He must not be a novice, not one newly brought to the Christian
 religion, or not one who is but meanly instructed in it, who knows no 
 more of religion than the surface of it, for such a one is apt to be 
 lifted up with pride: the more ignorant men are the more proud they 
 are: <I>Lest, being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation 
 of the devil.</I> The devils fell through pride, which is a good reason 
 why we should take heed of pride, because it is a sin that turned 
 angels into devils. 

 15. He must be of good reputation among his neighbours, and under no
 reproach from former conversation; for the devil will make use of that 
 to ensnare others, and work in them an aversion to the doctrine of 
 Christ preached by those who have not had a good report.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Upon the whole, having briefly gone through the qualifications of 
 a gospel-bishop, we may infer, 

 1. What great reason we have to cry out, as Paul does, <I>Who is
 sufficient for these things?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:16">2 Cor. ii. 16</A>.
 
 <I>Hic labor, hoc opus--This is a work indeed.</I> What piety, what
 prudence, what zeal, what courage, what faithfulness, what watchfulness 
 over ourselves, our lusts, appetites, and passions, and over those 
 under our charge; I say, what holy watchfulness is necessary in this
 work! 

 2. Have not the best qualified and the most faithful and conscientious
 ministers just reason to complain against themselves, that so much is 
 requisite by way of qualification, and so much work is necessary to be 
 done? And, alas! how far short do the best come of what they should be 
 and what they should do!

 3. Yet let those bless God, and be thankful, whom the Lord has enabled,
 and counted faithful, putting them into the ministry: if God is pleased 
 to make any in some degree able and faithful, let him have the praise 
 and glory of it. 

 4. For the encouragement of all faithful ministers, we have Christ's
 gracious word of promise, <I>Lo, I am with you always, even unto the 
 end of the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20">Matt. xxviii. 20</A>.

 And, if he be with us, he will fit us for our work in some measure, 
 will carry us through the difficulties of it with comfort, graciously 
 pardon our imperfections, and reward our faithfulness with a crown of 
 glory that fadeth not away,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:4">1 Pet. v. 4</A>.</P>

 &nbsp; 9  Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
 &nbsp; 10  And let these also first be proved; then let them use the
 office of a deacon, being <I>found</I> blameless.
 &nbsp; 11  Even so <I>must their</I> wives <I>be</I> grave, not slanderers,
 sober, faithful in all things.
 &nbsp; 12  Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their
 children and their own houses well.
 &nbsp; 13  For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase
 to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith
 which is in Christ Jesus.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the character of deacons: these had the care of the 
 temporal concerns of the church, that is, the maintenance of the 
 ministers and provision for the poor: they served tables, while the 
 ministers or bishops gave themselves only to the ministry of the word 
 and prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:2,4">Acts vi. 2, 4</A>.

 Of the institution of this office, with that which gave occasion to it, 
 you have an account in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:1-7">Acts vi. 1-7</A>.

 Now it was requisite that deacons should have a good character, because
 they were assistants to the ministers, appeared and acted publicly, and 
 had a great trust reposed in them. They must be <I>grave.</I> Gravity 
 becomes all Christians, but especially those who are in the office in 
 the church. <I>Not doubled-tongued;</I> that will say one thing to one 
 and another thing to another, according as their interests leads them: 
 a double tongue comes from a double heart; flatterers and slanderers 
 are double-tongued. <I>Not given to much wine;</I> for this is a great 
 disparagement to any man, especially to a Christian, and one in office, 
 unfits men for business, opens the door to many temptations. <I>Not 
 greedy of filthy lucre;</I> this would especially be bad in the 
 deacons, who were entrusted with the church's money, and, if they were 
 covetous and greedy of filthy lucre, would be tempted to embezzle it, 
 and convert that to their own use which was intended for the public 
 service. <I>Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, The mystery of faith is best held in a pure conscience. The 
 practical love of truth is the most powerful preservative from error 
 and delusion. If we keep a pure conscience (take heed of every thing 
 that debauches conscience, and draws us away from God), this will 
 preserve in our souls the mystery of faith. <I>Let these also first be 
 proved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It is not fit that the public trusts should be lodged in the hands of 
 any, till they have been first proved, and found fit for the business 
 they are to be entrusted with; the soundness of their judgments, their 
 zeal for Christ, and the blamelessness of their conversation, must be 
 proved. Their wives likewise must have a good character

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 they must be of a grave behaviour, not slanderers, tale-bearers, 
 carrying stories to make mischief and sow discord; they must be 
 <I>sober and faithful in all things,</I> not given to any excess, but 
 trusty in all that is committed to them. All who are related to 
 ministers must double their care to walk as becomes the gospel of 
 Christ, lest, if they in any thing walk disorderly, the ministry be 
 blamed. As he said before of the bishops or ministers, so here of the 
 deacons, they must be <I>the husband of one wife,</I> such as had not 
 put away their wives, upon dislike, and married others; they must 
 <I>rule their children and their own houses well;</I> the families of 
 deacons should be examples to other families. And the reason why the 
 deacons must be thus qualified is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 because, though the office of a deacon be of an inferior degree, yet it 
 is a step towards the higher degree; and those who had served tables 
 well the church might see cause afterwards to discharge from that 
 service, and prefer to serve in preaching the word and in prayer. Or it 
 may be meant of the good reputation that a man would gain by his 
 fidelity in this office: <I>they will purchase to themselves great 
 boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.</I> Observe, 

 1. In the primitive church there were but two orders of ministers or
 officers, <I>bishops and deacons,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:1">Phil. i. 1</A>.

 After-ages have invented the rest. The office of the bishop,
 presbyter, pastor, or minister, was confined to prayer and to the 
 ministry of the word; and the office of the deacon was confined to, or 
 at least principally conversant about, serving tables. Clemens Romanus, 
 in his epistle to the Christian (<I>cap.</I> 42, 44), speaks very fully 
 and plainly to this effect, that the apostles, foreknowing, by our Lord 
 Jesus Christ, that there would arise in the Christian church a 
 controversy about the name <I>episcopacy,</I> appointed the 
 forementioned orders, bishops and deacons.

 2. The scripture-deacon's main employment was to serve tables, and not
 to preach or baptize. It is true, indeed, that Philip did preach and 
 baptize in Samaria 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:4-25">Acts viii.</A>),

 but you read that he was an evangelist 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:8">Acts xxi. 8</A>),

 and he might preach and baptize, and perform any other part of the 
 ministerial office, under that character; but still the design of the 
 deacon's office was to mind the temporal concerns of the church, such 
 as the salaries of the ministers and providing for the poor.

 3. Several qualifications were very necessary, even for these inferior
 officers: <I>The deacons must be grave,</I> &c.

 4. Some trial should be made of persons' qualifications before they are
 admitted into office in the church, or have any trust committed to 
 them: <I>Let these also first be proved.</I> 

 5. Integrity and uprightness in an inferior office are the way to be
 preferred to a higher station in the church: <I>They purchase to 
 themselves a good degree.</I> 

 6. This will also give a man great boldness in the faith, whereas a
 want of integrity and uprightness will make a man timorous, and ready 
 to tremble at his own shadow. <I>The wicked fleeth when no man 
 pursueth, but the righteous are bold as a lion,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee
 shortly:
 &nbsp; 15  But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
 to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the
 living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
 &nbsp; 16  And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness:
 God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
 angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world,
 received up into glory.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He concludes the chapter with a particular direction to Timothy. He 
 hoped shortly to come to him, to give him further directions and 
 assistance in his work, and to see that Christianity was well planted, 
 and took root well, at Ephesus; he therefore wrote the more briefly to 
 him. But he wrote <I>lest he should tarry long, that</I> Timothy 
 <I>might know how to behave himself in the house of God,</I> how to 
 conduct himself as became an evangelist, and the apostle's substitute.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Those who are employed in the house of God must see to it that they 
 behave themselves well, lest they bring reproach upon the house of God, 
 and that worthy name by which they are called. Ministers ought to 
 behave themselves well, and to look not only to their praying and 
 preaching, but to their behaviour: their office binds them to their 
 good behaviour, for any behaviour will not do in this case. Timothy 
 must know how to behave himself, not only in the particular church
 where he was now appointed to reside for some time, but being an
 evangelist, and the apostle's substitute, he must learn how to behave
 himself in other churches, where he should in like manner be appointed
 to reside for some time; and therefore it is not the church of Ephesus,
 but the catholic church, which is here called <I>the house of God,
 which is the church of the living God.</I> Observe here, 

 1. God is the living God; he is the fountain of life, he is life in
 himself, and he gives life, breath, and all things to his creatures; in 
 him we live, and move, and have our being,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:25,28">Acts xvii. 25, 28</A>.

 2. The church is the house of God, he dwells there; the Lord has chosen
 Zion, to dwell there. "This is my rest, here will I dwell, for I have 
 chosen it;" there may we see God's power and glory,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:2">Ps. lxiii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is the great support of the church that it is the church of the 
 living <I>God,</I> the true God in opposition to false gods, dumb and 
 dead idols.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As the church of God, it is <I>the pillar and ground of truth;</I> 
 that is, either, 

 (1.) The church itself is the pillar and ground of truth. Not that the 
 authority of the scriptures depends upon that of the church, as the 
 papists pretend, for truth is the pillar and ground of the church; but 
 the church holds forth the scripture and the doctrine of Christ, as the 
 pillar to which a proclamation is affixed holds forth the proclamation. 
 <I>Even to the principalities and powers in heavenly places is made 
 known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:10">Eph. iii. 10</A>.

 (2.) Others understand it of Timothy. He, not he himself only, but he
 as an evangelist, he and other faithful ministers, are the pillars and
 ground of truth; it is their business to maintain, hold up, and
 publish, the truths of Christ in the church. It is said of the apostles
 that <I>they seemed to be pillars,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:9">Gal. ii. 9</A>.

 [1.] Let us be diligent and impartial in our own enquiries after truth;
 let us buy the truth at any rate, and not think much of any pains to
 discover it. 

 [2.] Let us be careful to keep and preserve it. "<I>Buy the truth, and 
 sell it not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:23">Prov. xxiii. 23</A>),

 do not part with it on any consideration."

 [3.] Let us take care to publish it, and to transmit it safe and 
 uncorrupted unto posterity. 

 [4.] When the church ceases to be the pillar and ground of truth, we 
 may and ought to forsake her; for our regard to truth should be greater 
 than our regard to the church; we are no longer obliged to continue in 
 the church than she continues to be the pillar and ground of truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But what is the truth which the churches and ministers are the 
 pillars and grounds of? He tells us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 that <I>without controversy great is the mystery of godliness.</I> The 
 learned Camero joins this with what goes before, and then it runs thus: 
 "The pillar and ground of the truth, and <I>without controversy great 
 is the mystery of godliness.</I>" He supposes this mystery to be the 
 pillar, &c. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christianity is a mystery, a mystery that could not have been 
 found out by reason or the light of nature, and which cannot be 
 comprehended by reason, because it is above reason, though not contrary 
 thereto. It is a mystery, not of philosophy or speculation; but of 
 godliness, designed to promote godliness; and herein it exceeds all the 
 mysteries of the Gentiles. It is also a revealed mystery, not shut up 
 and sealed; and it does not cease to be a mystery because now in part 
 revealed. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What is the mystery of godliness? It is Christ; and here are six 
 things concerning Christ, which make up the mystery of godliness. 

 [1.] That he is God manifest in the flesh: <I>God was manifest in the 
 flesh.</I> This proves that he is God, the eternal Word, that was made 
 flesh and was manifest in the flesh. When God was to be manifested to 
 man he was pleased to manifest himself in the incarnation of his own 
 Son: <I>The Word was made flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14">John i. 14</A>.

 [2.] He is <I>justified in the Spirit.</I> Whereas he was reproached as
 a sinner, and put to death as a malefactor, he was raised again by the 
 Spirit, and so was justified from all the calumnies with which he was 
 loaded. <I>He was made sin for us, and was delivered for our 
 offences;</I> but, being raised again, he was justified in the Spirit; 
 that is, it was made to appear that his sacrifice was accepted, and so 
 he rose again for our justification, as he was delivered for our 
 offences,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:25">Rom. iv. 25</A>.

 He was put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:18">1 Pet. iii. 18</A>.

 [3.] He was <I>seen of angels.</I> They worshipped him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:6">Heb. i. 6</A>);

 they attended his incarnation, his temptation, his agony, his death, 
 his resurrection, his ascension; this is much to his honour, and shows 
 what a mighty interest he had in the upper world, that angels 
 ministered to him, for he is the Lord of angels. 

 [4.] He is <I>preached unto the Gentiles.</I> This is a great part of 
 the mystery of godliness, that Christ was offered to the Gentiles a 
 Redeemer and Saviour; that whereas, before, salvation was of the Jews, 
 the partition-wall was now taken down, and the Gentiles were taken in. 
 <I>I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:47">Acts xiii. 47</A>.

 [5.] That he was <I>believed on in the world,</I> so that he was not
 preached in vain. Many of the Gentiles welcomed the gospel which the 
 Jews rejected. Who would have thought that the world, which lay in
 wickedness, would believe in the Son of God, would take him to be their 
 Saviour who was himself crucified at Jerusalem? But, notwithstanding 
 all the prejudices they laboured under, he was believed on, &c.

 [6.] He was <I>received up into glory,</I> in his ascension. This
 indeed was before he was believed on in the world; but it is put last, 
 because it was the crown of his exaltation, and because it is not only 
 his ascension that is meant, but his sitting at the right hand of God, 
 where he ever lives, making intercession, and has all power, both in 
 heaven and earth, and because, in the apostasy of which he treats in 
 the following chapter, his remaining in heaven would be denied by those 
 who pretend to bring him down on their altars in the consecrated 
 wafers. Observe, <I>First,</I> He who was manifest in flesh was God, 
 really and truly God, God by nature, and not only so by office, for 
 this makes it to be a mystery. <I>Secondly,</I> God was manifest in
 flesh, real flesh. <I>Forasmuch as the children are partakers of flesh 
 and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14">Heb. ii. 14</A>.

 And, what is more amazing, he was manifest in the flesh after all flesh
 had corrupted his way, though he himself was holy from the womb.
 <I>Thirdly,</I> Godliness is a mystery in all its parts and branches, 
 from the beginning to the end, from Christ's incarnation to his 
 ascension. <I>Fourthly,</I> It being a great mystery, we should rather
 humbly adore it, and piously believe it, than curiously pry into it, or 
 be too positive in our explications of it and determinations about it, 
 further than the holy scriptures have revealed it to us.</P>
