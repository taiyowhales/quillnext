 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called <I>to be</I> an apostle,
 separated unto the gospel of God,

 scriptures,)

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this paragraph we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The person who writes the epistle described 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ;</I> this is his title of honour, 
 which he glories in, not as the Jewish teachers, <I>Rabbi, Rabbi;</I> 
 but a servant, a more immediate attendant, a steward in the house. 
 <I>Called to be an apostle.</I> Some think he alludes to his old name 
 Saul, which signifies <I>one called for,</I> or <I>enquired after:</I> 
 Christ sought him to make an apostle of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:15">Acts ix. 15</A>.

 He here builds his authority upon his call; he did not run without
 sending, as the false apostles did; <B><I>kletos
 apostolos</I></B>--<I>called an apostle,</I> as if this were the name
 he would be called by, though he acknowledged himself not meet to be
 called so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:9">1 Cor. xv. 9</A>.

 <I>Separated to the gospel of God.</I> The Pharisees had their name
 from separation, because they <I>separated themselves to the study of 
 the law,</I> and might be called <B><I>aphorismenoi eis ton 
 nomon;</I></B> such a one Paul had formerly been; but now he had 
 changed his studies, was <B><I>aphorismenos eis to Euangelion,</I></B> 
 a gospel Pharisee, separated by the counsel of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:15">Gal. i. 15</A>),

 <I>separated from his mother's womb,</I> by an immediate direction of 
 the Spirit, and a regular ordination according to that direction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:2,3">Acts xiii. 2, 3</A>),

 by a dedication of himself to this work. He was an entire devotee to 
 the gospel of God, the gospel which has God for its author, the origin 
 and extraction of it divine and heavenly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Having mentioned the gospel of God, he digresses, to give us an 
 encomium of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The antiquity of it. It was <I>promised before</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 it was no novel upstart doctrine, but of ancient standing in the 
 promises and prophecies of the old Testament, which did all unanimously 
 point at the gospel, the morning-beams that ushered in the sun of 
 righteousness; this not by word of mouth only, but in the 
 scriptures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The subject-matter of it: it is concerning Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 The prophets and apostles all bear witness to him; he is the true 
 treasure hid in the field of the scriptures. Observe, When Paul 
 mentions Christ, how he heaps up his names and titles, <I>his Son Jesus 
 Christ our Lord,</I> as one that took a pleasure in speaking of him; 
 and, having mentioned him, he cannot go on in his discourse without 
 some expression of love and honour, as here, where in one person he 
 shows us his two distinct natures.

 (1.) His human nature: <I>Made of the seed of David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that is, born of the virgin Mary, who was of the house of David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:27">Luke i. 27</A>),
 
 as was Joseph his supposed father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:4">Luke ii. 4</A>.

 David is here mentioned, because of the special promises made to him 
 concerning the Messiah, especially his kingly office; 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:12,Ps+132:11,Lu+1:32,33">2 Sam. vii. 12;
 Ps. cxxxii. 11, compared with Luke i. 32, 33</A>.

 (2.) His divine nature: <I>Declared to be the Son of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 the Son of God by eternal generation, or, as it is here explained, 
 <I>according to the Spirit of holiness. According to the flesh,</I>
 that is, his human nature, <I>he was of the seed of David;</I> but, 
 <I>according to the Spirit of holiness,</I> that is, the divine nature 
 (as he is said to be <I>quickened by the Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:18,2Co+13:4">1 Pet. iii. 18,
 compared with 2 Cor. xiii. 4</A>),

 he is the Son of God. The great proof or demonstration of this is
 <I>his resurrection from the dead,</I> which proved it effectually and
 undeniably. The sign of the prophet Jonas, Christ's resurrection, was
 intended for the last conviction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:39,40">Matt. xii. 39, 40</A>.

 Those that would not be convinced by that would be convinced by 
 nothing. So that we have here a summary of the gospel doctrine 
 concerning Christ's two natures in one person.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The fruit of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 <I>By whom,</I> that is, by Christ manifested and made known in the 
 gospel, <I>we (Paul</I> and the rest of the ministers) <I>have received 
 grace and apostleship,</I> that is, the favour to be made apostles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:8">Eph. iii. 8</A>.

 The apostles were made a spectacle to the world, led a life of toil,
 and trouble, and hazard, <I>were killed all the day long,</I> and yet 
 Paul reckons the apostleship a favour: we may justly reckon it a great 
 favour to be employed in any work or service for God, whatever 
 difficulties or dangers we may meet with in it. This apostleship was 
 received <I>for obedience to the faith,</I> that is, to bring people to 
 that obedience; as Christ, so his ministers, received that they might 
 give. Paul's was for this obedience <I>among all nations,</I> for he 
 was the <I>apostle of the Gentiles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:13"><I>ch.</I> xi. 13</A>.

 Observe the description here given of the Christian profession: it is
 <I>obedience to the faith.</I> It does not consist in a notional 
 knowledge or a naked assent, much less does it consist in perverse 
 disputings, but in obedience. This obedience to the faith answers the 
 <I>law of faith,</I> mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:27"><I>ch.</I> iii. 27</A>.

 The act of faith is the obedience of the understanding to God
 revealing, and the product of that is the obedience of the will to God 
 commanding. To anticipate the ill use which might be made of the 
 doctrine of justification by faith without the works of the law, which 
 he was to explain in the following epistle, he here speaks of 
 Christianity as an obedience. Christ has a yoke. "<I>Among whom are 
 you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 You Romans in this stand upon the same level with other Gentile nations 
 of less fame and wealth; you are all one in Christ." The gospel 
 salvation is a common salvation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:3">Jude 3</A>.

 No respect of persons with God. <I>The called of Jesus Christ;</I> all
 those, and those only, are brought to an obedience of the faith that 
 are effectually called of Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The persons to whom it is written 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>To all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints;</I> 
 that is, to all the professing Christians that were in Rome, whether 
 Jews or Gentiles originally, whether high or low, bond or free, learned 
 or unlearned. Rich and poor meet together in Christ Jesus. Here is, 

 1. The privilege of Christians: They are <I>beloved of God,</I> they
 are members of that body which is beloved, which is God's 
 <I>Hephzibah,</I> in which his delight is. We speak of God's love by 
 his bounty and beneficence, and so he hath a common love to all mankind 
 and a peculiar love for true believers; and between these there is a 
 love he hath for all the body of visible Christians. 

 2. The duty of Christians; and that is to be holy, for hereunto are 
 they called, <I>called to be saints,</I> called to salvation through 
 sanctification. Saints, and only saints, are beloved of God with a
 special and peculiar love. <B><I>Kletois hagiois</I></B>--<I>called
 saints,</I> saints in profession; it were well if all that are called 
 saints were saints indeed. Those that are called saints should labour 
 to answer to the name; otherwise, though it is an honour and a 
 privilege, yet it will be of little avail at the great day to have been 
 called saints, if we be not really so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The apostolical benediction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Grace to you and peace.</I> This is one of the tokens in every 
 epistle; and it hath not only the affection of a good wish, but the 
 authority of a blessing. The priests under the law were to bless the 
 people, and so are gospel ministers, in the name of the Lord. In this 
 usual benediction observe, 

 1. The favours desired: <I>Grace and peace.</I> The Old-Testament
 salutation was, <I>Peace be to you;</I> but now grace is 
 prefixed--<I>grace,</I> that is, the favour of God towards us or the 
 work of God in us; both are previously requisite to true peace. All 
 gospel blessings are included in these two: <I>grace and peace. 
 Peace,</I> that is all good; peace with God, peace in your own 
 consciences, peace with all that are about you; all these founded in 
 grace.

 2. The fountain of those favours, <I>from God our Father, and the Lord 
 Jesus Christ.</I> All good comes,

 (1.) From God as a Father; he hath put himself into that relation to
 engage and encourage our desires and expectations; we are taught, when 
 we come for grace and peace, to call him our Father. 

 (2.) <I>From the Lord Jesus Christ,</I> as Mediator, and the great 
 feoffee in trust for the conveying and securing of these benefits. We 
 have them from his fulness, peace from the fulness of his merit, grace 
 from the fulness of his Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that
 your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.
 &nbsp; 9  For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the
 gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you
 always in my prayers;
 &nbsp; 10  Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a
 prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.
 &nbsp; 11  For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some
 spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;
 &nbsp; 12  That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the
 mutual faith both of you and me.
 &nbsp; 13  Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes
 I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might
 have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
 &nbsp; 14  I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both
 to the wise, and to the unwise.
 &nbsp; 15  So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to
 you that are at Rome also.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His thanksgivings for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>First, I thank my God.</I> It is good to begin every thing with 
 blessing God, to make that <I>the alpha and omega</I> of every song, 
 <I>in every thing to give thanks.</I>--<I>My God.</I> He speaks this 
 with delight and triumph. In all our thanksgivings, it is good for us 
 to eye God as our God; this makes every mercy sweet, when we can say of 
 God, "He is mine in covenant."--<I>Through Jesus Christ.</I> All our 
 duties and performances are pleasing to God only through Jesus Christ, 
 praises as well as prayers.--<I>For you all.</I> We must express our 
 love to our friends, not only by praying for them, but by praising God 
 for them. God must have the glory of all the comfort we have in our
 friends; for every creature is that to us, and no more, which God makes 
 it to be. Many of these Romans Paul had no personal acquaintance with,
 and yet he could heartily rejoice in their gifts and graces. When some 
 of the Roman Christians met him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:15">Acts xxviii. 15</A>),

 he thanked God for them, and took courage; but here his true catholic 
 love extends itself further, and he <I>thanks God for them all;</I> not 
 only for those among them that were his helpers in Christ, and that 
 bestowed much labour upon him (of whom he speaks

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:3,6"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 3, 6</A>),

 but for them all.--<I>That your faith is spoken of.</I> Paul travelled
 up and down from place to place, and, wherever he came, he heard great 
 commendations of the Christians at Rome, which he mentions, not to make 
 them proud, but to quicken them to answer the general character people 
 gave of them, and the general expectation people had from them. The 
 greater reputation a man hath for religion, the more careful he should 
 be to preserve it, because <I>a little folly spoils him that is in 
 reputation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:1">Eccl. x. 1</A>.--<I>Throughout

 the whole world,</I> that is, the Roman empire, into which the Roman
 Christians, upon Claudius's edict to banish all the Jews from Rome, 
 were scattered abroad, but had now returned, and, it seems, left a very 
 good report behind them, wherever they had been, in all the churches. 
 There was this good effect of their sufferings: if they had not been 
 persecuted, they had not been famous. This was indeed a good name, a 
 name for good things with God and good people. As the elders of old, so 
 these Romans, <I>obtained a good report through faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:2">Heb. xi. 2</A>.
 
 It is a desirable thing to be famous for faith. The faith of the Roman
 Christians came to be thus talked of, not only because it was excelling 
 in itself, but because it was eminent and observable in its 
 circumstances. Rome was a city upon a hill, every one took notice of 
 what was done there. Thus those who have many eyes upon them have need 
 to walk circumspectly, for what they do, good or bad, will be spoken 
 of. The church of Rome was then a flourishing church; but since that 
 time how is the gold become dim! How is the most fine gold changed! 
 Rome is not what it was. She was then espoused a <I>chaste virgin to 
 Christ,</I> and excelled in beauty; but she has since <I>degenerated, 
 dealt treacherously, and embraced the bosom of a stranger;</I> so that 
 (as that good old book, <I>the Practice of Piety,</I> makes appear in 
 no less than twenty-six instances) even <I>the epistle to the 
 Romans</I> is now an epistle <I>against</I> the Romans; little reason 
 has she therefore to boast of her former credit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His prayer for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Though a famous flourishing church, yet they had need to be prayed for; 
 they <I>had not yet attained.</I> Paul mentions this as an instance of 
 his love to them. One of the greatest kindnesses we can do our friends, 
 and sometimes the only kindness that is in the power of our hands, is, 
 by prayer to recommend them to the loving-kindness of God. From Paul's 
 example here we may learn, 

 1. Constancy in prayer: <I>Always without ceasing.</I> He did himself
 observe the same rules he gave to others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:18,1Th+5:17">Eph. vi. 18; 1 Thess. v. 17</A>.

 Not that Paul did nothing else but pray, but he kept up stated times
 for the solemn performance of that duty, and those very frequent, and
 observed without fail. 

 2. Charity in prayer: <I>I make mention of you.</I> Though he had not
 particular acquaintance with them, nor interest in them, yet he prayed 
 for them; not only for all saints in general, but he made express 
 mention of them. It is not unfit sometimes to be express in our prayers 
 for particular churches and places; not to inform God, but to affect 
 ourselves. We are likely to have the most comfort in those friends that 
 we pray most for. Concerning this he makes a solemn appeal to the
 searcher of hearts: <I>For God is my witness.</I> It was in a weighty 
 matter, and in a thing known only to God and his own heart, that he 
 used this asseveration. It is very comfortable to be able to call God 
 to witness to our sincerity and constancy in the discharge of a duty. 
 God is particularly a witness to our secret prayers, the matter of 
 them, the manner of the performance; then our Father sees in secret, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:6">Matt. vi. 6</A>.

 <I>God, whom I serve with my spirit.</I> Those that serve God with
 their spirits may, with a humble confidence, appeal to him; hypocrites 
 who rest in bodily exercise cannot. His particular prayer, among many 
 other petitions he put up for them, was that he might have an 
 opportunity of paying them a visit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Making request, if by any means,</I> &c. Whatever comfort we desire 
 to find in any creature, we must have recourse to God for it by prayer; 
 for <I>our times are in his hand,</I> and all our ways at his disposal. 
 The expressions here used intimate that he was very desirous of such an 
 opportunity: <I>if by any means;</I> that he had long and often been 
 disappointed: <I>now at length;</I> and yet that he submitted it to the 
 divine Providence: <I>a prosperous journey by the will of God.</I> As 
 in our purposes, so in our desires, we must still remember to insert 
 this, <I>if the Lord will,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:15">James iv. 15</A>.

 Our journeys are prosperous or otherwise according to the will of God,
 comfortable or not as he pleases.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His great desire to see them, with the reasons of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:11-15"><I>v.</I> 11-15</A>.

 He had heard so much of them that he had a great desire to be better
 acquainted with them. Fruitful Christians are as much the joy as barren 
 professors are the grief of faithful ministers. Accordingly, he 
 <I>often purposed to come, but was let hitherto</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 for man purposeth, but God disposeth. He was hindered by other business 
 that took him off, by his care of other churches, whose affairs were 
 pressing; and Paul was for doing that first, not which was most 
 pleasant (then he would have gone to Rome), but which was most 
 needful--a good example to ministers, who must not consult their own 
 inclinations so much as the necessity of their people's souls. Paul 
 desired to visit these Romans,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they might be edified 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>That I may impart unto you.</I> He received, that he might 
 communicate. Never were full breasts so desirous to be drawn out to the 
 sucking infant as Paul's head and heart were to be imparting spiritual 
 gifts, that is, preaching to them. A good sermon is a good gift, so 
 much the better for being a spiritual gift.--<I>To the end you may be 
 established.</I> Having commended their flourishing he here expresses 
 his desire of their establishment, that as they grew upward in the 
 branches they might grow downward in the root. The best saints, while 
 they are in such a shaking world as this, have need to be more and more 
 established; and spiritual gifts are of special use for our 
 establishment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he might be comforted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 What he heard of their flourishing in grace was so much a joy to him 
 that it must needs be much more so to behold it. Paul could take 
 comfort in the fruit of the labours of other ministers.--<I>By the 
 mutual faith both of you and me,</I> that is, our mutual faithfulness 
 and fidelity. It is very comfortable when there is a mutual confidence 
 between minister and people, they confiding in him as a faithful 
 minister, and he in them as a faithful people. Or, the mutual work of 
 faith, which is love; they rejoiced in the expressions of one another's 
 love, or communicating their faith one to another. It is very 
 refreshing to Christians to compare notes about their spiritual 
 concerns; thus are they sharpened, <I>as iron sharpens iron.--That I 
 might have some fruit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Their edification would be his advantage, it would be fruit abounding 
 to a good account. Paul minded his work, as one that believed the more 
 good he did the greater would his reward be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he might discharge his trust as the apostle of the Gentiles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I am a debtor.</I> 

 (1.) His receivings made him a debtor; for they were talents he was 
 entrusted with to trade for his Master's honour. We should think of 
 this when we covet great things, that all our receivings put us in 
 debt; we are but stewards of our Lord's goods.

 (2.) His office made him a debtor. He was a debtor as he was an 
 apostle; he was called and sent to work, and had engaged to mind it.
 Paul had improved his talent, and laboured in his work, and done as 
 much good as ever any man did, and yet, in reflection upon it, he still 
 writes himself debtor; for, <I>when we have done all, we are but 
 unprofitable servants.--Debtor to the Greeks, and to the 
 barbarians,</I> that is, as the following words explain it, <I>to the 
 wise and to the unwise.</I> The Greeks fancied themselves to have the 
 monopoly of wisdom, and looked upon all the rest of the world as 
 barbarians, comparatively so; not cultivated with learning and arts as 
 they were. Now Paul was a debtor to both, looked upon himself as
 obliged to do all the good he could both to the one and to the other.
 Accordingly, we find him paying his debt, both in his preaching and in 
 his writing, doing good <I>both to Greeks and barbarians,</I> and 
 suiting his discourse to the capacity of each. You may observe a 
 difference between his sermon at Lystra among the plain Lycaonians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:15">Acts xiv. 15</A>,

 &c.) and his sermon at Athens among the polite philosophers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:22">Acts xvii. 22</A>,

 &c. He delivered both as debtor to each, giving to each their portion.
 Though a plain preacher, yet, as debtor to the wise, he speaks wisdom 
 among those that are perfect, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:6">1 Cor. ii. 6</A>.

 For these reasons he was ready, if he had an opportunity, <I>to preach
 the gospel at Rome,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Though a public place, though a perilous place, where Christianity met 
 with a great deal of opposition, yet Paul was ready to run the risk at 
 Rome, if called to it: <I>I am ready</I>--<B><I>prothymon.</I></B> It 
 denotes a great readiness of mind, and that he was very forward to it.
 What he did was not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind. It is an 
 excellent thing to be ready to meet every opportunity of doing or 
 getting good.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul here enters upon a large discourse of justification, in the latter 
 part of this chapter laying down his thesis, and, in order to the proof 
 of it, describing the deplorable condition of the Gentile world. His 
 transition is very handsome, and like an orator: he was ready to preach 
 the gospel at Rome, though a place where the gospel was run down by 
 those that called themselves the wits; <I>for,</I> saith he, <I>I am 
 not ashamed of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 There is a great deal in the gospel which such a man as Paul might be 
 tempted to be ashamed of, especially that he whose gospel it is was a 
 man hanged upon a tree, that the doctrine of it was plain, had little 
 in it to set it off among scholars, the professors of it were mean and 
 despised, and every where spoken against; yet Paul was not ashamed to 
 own it. I reckon him a Christian indeed that is neither ashamed of the 
 gospel nor a shame to it. The reason of this bold profession, taken 
 from the nature and excellency of the gospel, introduces his 
 dissertation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The proposition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 The excellency of the gospel lies in this, that it reveals to us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The salvation of believers as the end: <I>It is the power of God 
 unto salvation.</I> Paul is not ashamed of the gospel, how mean and 
 contemptible soever it may appear to a carnal eye; for <I>the power of 
 God works by it the salvation of all that believe;</I> it shows us 
 <I>the way of salvation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:17">Acts xvi. 17</A>),

 and is the great charter by which salvation is conveyed and made over 
 to us. But, 

 (1.) <I>It is through the power of God;</I> without that power the 
 gospel is but a dead letter; the revelation of the gospel is the 
 revelation of <I>the arm of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1">Isa. liii. 1</A>),

 as power went along with the word of Christ to heal diseases. 

 (2.) It is to those, and those only, that believe. Believing interests 
 us in the gospel salvation; to others it is hidden. The medicine 
 prepared will not cure the patient if it be not taken.--<I>To the Jew 
 first. The lost sheep of the house of Israel</I> had the first offer 
 made them, both by Christ and his apostles. <I>You first</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:26">Acts iii. 26</A>),

 but upon their refusal the apostles turned to the Gentiles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:46">Acts xiii. 46</A>.

 Jews and Gentiles now stand upon the same level, both equally miserable
 without a Saviour, and both equally welcome to the Saviour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:11">Col. iii. 11</A>.
 
 Such doctrine as this was surprising to the Jews, who had hitherto been
 the peculiar people, and had looked with scorn upon the Gentile world;
 but the long-expected Messiah proves <I>a light to enlighten the 
 Gentiles,</I> as well as <I>the glory of his people Israel.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The justification of believers as the way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>For therein,</I> that is, in this gospel, which Paul so much 
 triumphs in, <I>is the righteousness of God revealed.</I> Our misery 
 and ruin being the product and consequent of our iniquity, that which 
 will show us the way of salvation must needs show us the way of 
 justification, and this the gospel does. The gospel makes known a 
 righteousness. While God is a just and holy God, and we are guilty 
 sinners, it is necessary we should have a righteousness wherein to 
 appear before him; and, blessed be God, there is such a righteousness 
 brought in by Messiah the prince 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24">Dan. ix. 24</A>)

 and <I>revealed in the gospel;</I> a <I>righteousness,</I> that is, a 
 gracious method of reconciliation and acceptance, notwithstanding the 
 guilt of our sins. This evangelical righteousness,

 (1.) Is called the <I>righteousness of God;</I> it is of God's 
 appointing, of God's approving and accepting. It is so called to cut
 off all pretensions to a righteousness resulting from the merit of our 
 own works. It is the righteousness of Christ, who is God, resulting 
 from a satisfaction of infinite value. 

 (2.) It is said to be <I>from faith to faith,</I> from the faithfulness 
 of God revealing to the faith of man receiving (so some); from the 
 faith of dependence upon God, and dealing with him immediately, as Adam 
 before the fall, to the faith of dependence upon a Mediator, and so 
 dealing with God (so others); from the first faith, by which we are put 
 into a justified state, to after faith, by which we live, and are 
 continued in that state: and the faith that justifies us is no less 
 than our taking Christ for our Saviour, and becoming true Christians, 
 according to the tenour of the baptismal covenant; from faith 
 engrafting us into Christ, to faith deriving virtue from him as our 
 root: both implied in the next words, <I>The just shall live by faith. 
 Just by faith,</I> there is faith justifying us; <I>live by faith,</I> 
 there is faith maintaining us; and so <I>there is a righteousness from 
 faith to faith.</I> Faith is all in all, both in the beginning and 
 progress of a Christian life. It is not from faith to works, as if
 faith put us into a justified state, and then works preserved and 
 maintained us in it, but it is all along from faith to faith, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>,

 <I>from glory to glory;</I> it is increasing, continuing, persevering
 faith, faith pressing forward, and getting ground of unbelief. To show 
 that this is no novel upstart doctrine, he quotes for it that famous 
 scripture in the Old Testament, so often mentioned in the New

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:4">Hab. ii. 4</A>):

 <I>The just shall live by faith.</I> Being justified by faith he shall
 live by it both the life of grace and of glory. The prophet there had
 placed himself upon the watch-tower, expecting some extraordinary
 discoveries

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and the discovery was of the certainty of the appearance of the 
 promised Messiah in the fulness of time, not withstanding seeming 
 delays. This is there called <I>the vision,</I> by way of eminence, as 
 elsewhere <I>the promise;</I> and while that time is coming, as well as 
 when it has come, <I>the just shall live by faith.</I> Thus is the 
 evangelical righteousness from faith to faith--from Old-Testament faith 
 in a Christ to come to New-Testament faith in a Christ already 
 come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The proof of this proposition, that both Jews and Gentiles stand in 
 need of a righteousness wherein to appear before God, and that neither 
 the one nor the other have nay of their own to plead. Justification 
 must be either by faith or works. It cannot be by works, which he 
 proves at large by describing the works both of Jews and Gentiles; and 
 therefore he concludes it must be by faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:20,38"><I>ch.</I> iii. 20, 28</A>.

 The apostle, like a skilful surgeon, before he applies the plaster,
 searches the wound--endeavours first to convince of guilt and wrath, 
 and then to show the way of salvation. This makes the gospel the more 
 welcome. We must first see the righteousness of God condemning, and 
 then the righteousness of God justifying will appear <I>worthy of all 
 acceptation.</I> In general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>the wrath of God is revealed.</I> The light of nature and the light 
 of the law reveal the wrath of God from sin to sin. It is well for us 
 that the gospel reveals the justifying righteousness of God from faith 
 to faith. The antithesis is observable. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sinfulness of man described; he reduceth it to two heads, 
 <I>ungodliness and unrighteousness;</I> ungodliness against the laws of 
 the first table, unrighteousness against those of the second.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The cause of that sinfulness, and that is, <I>holding the truth in 
 unrighteousness.</I> Some <I>communes notit&aelig;,</I> some ideas they had
 of the being of God, and of the difference of good and evil; but they 
 held them in unrighteousness, that is, they knew and professed them in 
 a consistency with their wicked courses. They held the truth as a 
 captive or prisoner, that it should not influence them, as otherwise it 
 would. An unrighteous wicked heart is the dungeon in which many a good 
 truth is detained and buried. <I>Holding fast the form of sound words 
 in faith and love</I> is the root of all religion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:13">2 Tim. i. 13</A>),

 but holding it fast in unrighteousness is the root of all sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The displeasure of God against it: <I>The wrath of God is revealed 
 from heaven;</I> not only in the written word, <I>which is given by 
 inspiration of God</I> (the Gentiles had not that), but in the 
 providences of God, his judgments executed upon sinners, which do not 
 spring out of the dust, or fall out by chance, nor are they to be 
 ascribed to second causes, but they are a revelation from heaven. Or 
 <I>wrath from heaven is revealed;</I> it is not the wrath of a man like 
 ourselves, <I>but wrath from heaven,</I> therefore the more terrible 
 and the more unavoidable.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them;
 for God hath showed <I>it</I> unto them.
 &nbsp; 20  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the
 world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
 made, <I>even</I> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are
 without excuse:
 &nbsp; 21  Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <I>him</I> not
 as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their
 imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
 &nbsp; 22  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,
 &nbsp; 23  And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image
 made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed
 beasts, and creeping things.
 &nbsp; 24  Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the
 lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between
 themselves:
 &nbsp; 25  Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
 served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for
 ever. Amen.
 &nbsp; 26  For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for
 even their women did change the natural use into that which is
 against nature:
 &nbsp; 27  And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the
 woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men
 working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that
 recompence of their error which was meet.
 &nbsp; 28  And even as they did not like to retain God in <I>their</I>
 knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those
 things which are not convenient;
 &nbsp; 29  Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
 wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder,
 debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
 &nbsp; 30  Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters,
 inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
 &nbsp; 31  Without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural
 affection, implacable, unmerciful:
 &nbsp; 32  Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such
 things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have
 pleasure in them that do them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this last part of the chapter the apostle applies what he had said 
 particularly to the Gentile world, in which we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The means and helps they had to come to the knowledge of God. Though 
 they had not such a knowledge of his law as Jacob and Israel had 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:20">Ps. cxlvii. 20</A>),
 
 yet among them <I>he left not himself without witness</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:17">Acts xiv. 17</A>):
 
 <I>For that which may be known,</I> &c.,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What discoveries they had: <I>That which may be known of God is 
 manifest,</I> <B><I>en autois</I></B>--<I>among them;</I> that is, there
 were some even among them that had the knowledge of God, were convinced 
 of the existence of one supreme <I>Numen.</I> The philosophy of 
 Pythagoras, Plato, and the Stoics, discovered a great deal of the 
 knowledge of God, as appears by abundance of testimonies. <I>That which 
 may be known,</I> which implies that there is a great deal which may 
 not be known. The being of God may be apprehended, but cannot be 
 comprehended. We cannot by searching find him out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:7-9">Job xi. 7-9</A>.

 Finite understandings cannot perfectly know an infinite being; but,
 blessed be God, there is that which may be known, enough to lead us to 
 our chief end, the glorifying and enjoying of him; and these things 
 revealed belong to us and to our children, while secret things are not 
 to be pried into, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:29">Deut. xxix. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Whence they had these discoveries: <I>God hath shown it to them.</I> 
 Those common natural notions which they had of God were imprinted upon 
 their hearts by the God of nature himself, who is the <I>Father of 
 lights.</I> This sense of a Deity, and a regard to that Deity, are so 
 connate with the human nature that some think we are to distinguish men 
 from brutes by these rather than by reason.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. By what way and means these discoveries and notices which they had 
 were confirmed and improved, namely, by the work of creation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);
 
 <I>For the invisible things of God,</I> &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Observe what they knew: <I>The invisible things of him, even his 
 eternal power and Godhead.</I> Though God be not the object of sense, 
 yet he hath discovered and made known himself by those things that are 
 sensible. The power and Godhead of God are invisible things, and yet 
 are clearly seen in their products. He works in secret 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8,9,Ps+139:15,Ec+11:15">Job xxiii. 8, 9; Ps. cxxxix. 15;
 Eccl. xi. 5</A>),

 but manifests what he has wrought, and therein makes known his power 
 and Godhead, and others of his attributes which natural light 
 apprehends in the idea of a God. They could not come by natural light 
 to the knowledge of the three persons in the Godhead (though some fancy 
 they have found footsteps of this in Plato's writings), but they did 
 come to the knowledge of the Godhead, at least so much knowledge as was 
 sufficient to have kept them from idolatry. This was that truth which
 they held in unrighteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How they knew it: <I>By the things that are made,</I> which could 
 not make themselves, nor fall into such an exact order and harmony by 
 any casual hits; and therefore must have been produced by some first 
 cause or intelligent agent, which first cause could be no other than an 
 eternal powerful God. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1,Isa+40:26,Ac+17:24">Ps. xix. 1;
 Isa. xl. 26; Acts xvii. 24</A>.

 The workman is known by his work. The variety, multitude, order,
 beauty, harmony, different nature, and excellent contrivance, of the 
 things that are made, the direction of them to certain ends, and the 
 concurrence of all the parts to the good and beauty of the whole, do 
 abundantly prove a Creator and his eternal power and Godhead. Thus did 
 the light shine in the darkness. And <I>this from the creation of the 
 world.</I> Understand it either,

 [1.] As the topic from which the knowledge of them is drawn. To evince 
 this truth, we have recourse to the great work of creation. And some 
 think this <B><I>ktisis kosmou,</I></B> <I>this creature of the 
 world</I> (as it may be read), is to be understood of man, the 
 <B><I>ktisis kat exochen</I></B>--<I>the most remarkable creature</I> 
 of the lower world, called <B><I>ktisis,</I></B> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:15">Mark xvi. 15</A>.

 The frame and structure of human bodies, and especially the most
 excellent powers, faculties, and capacities of human souls, do 
 abundantly prove that there is a Creator, and that he is God. Or,

 [2.] As the date of the discovery. It as old as the creation of the 
 world. In this sense <B><I>apo ktiseos</I></B> is most frequently used
 in scripture. These notices concerning God are not any modern 
 discoveries, hit upon of late, but ancient truths, which were from the 
 beginning. The way of the acknowledgement of God is a good old way; it
 was from the beginning. Truth got the start of error.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their gross idolatry, notwithstanding these discoveries that God 
 made to them of himself; described here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:21-23,25"><I>v.</I> 21-23, 25</A>.

 We shall the less wonder at the inefficacy of these natural discoveries
 to prevent the idolatry of the Gentiles if we remember how prone even 
 the Jews, who had scripture light to guide them, were to idolatry; so 
 miserably are the degenerate sons of men plunged in the mire of sense.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The inward cause of their idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 They are therefore without excuse, in that they did know God, and from 
 what they knew might easily infer that it was their duty to worship 
 him, and him only. Though some have greater light and means of
 knowledge than others, yet all have enough to leave them inexcusable. 
 But the mischief of it was that,

 (1.) They <I>glorified him not as God.</I> Their affections towards 
 him, and their awe and adoration of him, did not keep pace with their 
 knowledge. To glorify him as God is to glorify him only; for there can 
 be but one infinite: but they did not so glorify him, for they set up a 
 multitude of other deities. To glorify him as God is to worship him 
 with spiritual worship; but they made images of him. Not to glorify God 
 as God is in effect not to glorify him at all; to respect him as a 
 creature is not to glorify him, but to dishonour him. 

 (2.) <I>Neither were they thankful;</I> not thankful for the favours in 
 general they received from God (insensibleness of God's mercies is at 
 the bottom of our sinful departures from him); not thankful in 
 particular for the discoveries God was pleased to make of himself to 
 them. Those that do not improve the means of knowledge and grace are 
 justly reckoned unthankful for them. 

 (3.) <I>But they became vain in their imaginations,</I> <B><I>en tois 
 dialogismois</I></B>--<I>in their reasonings,</I> in their practical 
 inferences. They had a great deal of knowledge of general truths 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 but no prudence to apply them to particular cases. Or, in their notions 
 of God, and the creation of the world, and the origination of mankind, 
 and the chief good; in these things, when they quitted the plain truth, 
 they soon disputed themselves into a thousand vain and foolish fancies. 
 The several opinions and hypotheses of the various sects of 
 philosophers concerning these things were so many vain imaginations. 
 When truth is forsaken, errors multiply <I>in 
 infinitum</I>--<I>infinitely.</I> 

 (4.) <I>And their foolish heart was darkened.</I> The foolishness and 
 practical wickedness of the heart cloud and darken the intellectual 
 powers and faculties. Nothing tends more to the blinding and perverting 
 of the understanding than the corruption and depravedness of the will 
 and affections. 

 (5.) <I>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 This looks black upon the philosophers, the pretenders to wisdom and 
 professors of it. Those that had the most luxuriant fancy, in framing 
 to themselves the idea of a God, fell into the most gross and absurd 
 conceits: and it was the just punishment of their pride and 
 self-conceitedness. It has been observed that the most refined nations, 
 that made the greatest show of wisdom, were the arrantest fools in 
 religion. The barbarians adored the sun and moon, which of all others 
 was the most specious idolatry; while the learned Egyptians worshipped 
 an ox and an onion. The Grecians, who excelled them in wisdom, adored 
 diseases and human passions. The Romans, the wisest of all, worshipped 
 the furies. And at this day the poor Americans worship the thunder; 
 while the ingenious Chinese adore the devil. Thus the <I>world by 
 wisdom knew not God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:21">1 Cor. i. 21</A>.

 As a profession of wisdom is an aggravation of folly, so a proud
 conceit of wisdom is the cause of a great deal of folly. Hence we read 
 of few philosophers who were converted to Christianity; and Paul's 
 preaching was no where so laughed at and ridiculed as among the learned 
 Athenians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:18-32">Acts xvii. 18-32</A>.

 <B><I>Phaskontes einai</I></B>--<I>conceiting themselves</I> to be wise.
 The plain truth of the being of God would not content them; they 
 thought themselves above that, and so fell into the greatest 
 errors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The outward acts of their idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:23-25"><I>v.</I> 23-25</A>.

 (1.) Making images of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 by which, as much as in them lay, they <I>changed the glory of the
 incorruptible God.</I> Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:20,Jer+2:11">Ps. cvi. 20; Jer. ii. 11</A>.

 They ascribed a deity to the most contemptible creatures, and by them 
 represented God. It was the greatest honour God did to man that he
 made man in the image of God; but it is the greatest dishonour man has 
 done to God that he has made God in the image of man. This was what
 God so strictly warned the Jews against,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:15">Deut. iv. 15</A>,

 &c. This the apostle shows the folly of in his sermon at Athens,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:29">Acts xvii. 29</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:18,44:10">Isa. xl. 18, &c.; xliv. 10</A>,

 &c. This is called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)
 
 <I>changing the truth of God into a lie.</I> As it did dishonour his
 glory, so it did misrepresent his being. Idols are called lies, for 
 they belie God, as if he had a body, whereas he is a Spirit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:14,Ho+7:1">Jer. xxiii. 14; Hos. vii. 1</A>.
 
 <I>Teachers of lies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:18">Hab. ii. 18</A>.

 (2.) Giving divine honour to the creature: <I>Worshipped and served the
 creature,</I> <B><I>para ton ktisavta</I></B>--<I>besides the 
 Creator.</I> They did own a supreme <I>Numen</I> in their profession, 
 but they did in effect disown him by the worship they paid to the 
 creature; for God will be all or none. Or, <I>above</I> the Creator, 
 paying more devout respect to their inferior deities, stars, heroes, 
 demons, thinking the supreme God inaccessible, or above their worship.
 The sin itself was their worshipping the creature at all; but this is 
 mentioned as an aggravation of the sin, that they worshipped the 
 creature more than the Creator. This was the general wickedness of the 
 Gentile world, and became twisted in with their laws and government; in 
 compliance with which even the wise men among them, who knew and owned 
 a supreme God and were convinced of the nonsense and absurdity of their 
 polytheism and idolatry, yet did as the rest of their neighbours did.
 <I>Seneca,</I> in his book <I>De Superstitione,</I> as it is quoted by 
 <I>Aug. de Civit. Dei,</I> lib. 6, cap. 10 (for the book itself is 
 lost), after he had largely shown the great folly and impiety of the 
 vulgar religion, in divers instances of it, yet concludes, <I>Qu&aelig; 
 omnia sapiens servabit tanquam legibus jussa, non tanquam diis 
 grata--All which a wise man will observe as established by law, not 
 imagining them grateful to the gods.</I> And afterwards, <I>Omnem istam 
 ignobilem deorum turbam, quam longo &aelig;vo longa superstitio 
 congessit, sic adorabimus, ut meminerimus cultum ejus magis ad morem 
 quam ad rem pertinere--All this ignoble rout of gods, which ancient 
 superstition has amassed together by long prescription, we will so 
 adore as to remember that the worship of them is rather a compliance 
 with custom than material in itself.</I> Upon which Augustine observes, 
 <I>Coleb at quod reprehendebat, agebat quod arguebat, quod culpabat 
 adorabat--He worshipped that which he censured, he did that which he 
 had proved wrong, and he adored what he found fault with.</I> I mention 
 this thus largely because methinks it doth fully explain that of the 
 apostle here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Who hold the truth in unrighteousness.</I> It is observable that 
 upon the mention of the dishonour done to God by the idolatry of the 
 Gentiles the apostle, in the midst of his discourse, expresses himself 
 in an awful adoration of God: <I>Who is blessed for ever. Amen.</I>
 When we see or hear of any contempt cast upon God or his name, we 
 should thence take occasion to think and speak highly and honourably of 
 him. In this, as in other things, the worse others are, the better we 
 should be. <I>Blessed for ever,</I> notwithstanding these dishonours 
 done to his name: though there are those that do not glorify him, yet 
 he is glorified, and will be glorified to eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The judgments of God upon them for this idolatry; not many 
 temporal judgments (the idolatrous nations were the conquering ruling 
 nations of the world), but spiritual judgments, giving them up to the 
 most brutish and unnatural lusts. <B><I>Paredoken autous</I></B>--<I>He
 gave them up;</I> it is thrice repeated here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:24,26,28"><I>v.</I> 24, 26, 28</A>.

 Spiritual judgments are of all judgments the sorest, and to be most 
 dreaded. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By whom they were given up. God gave them up, in a way of righteous 
 judgment, as the just punishment of their idolatry--taking off the
 bridle of restraining grace--leaving them to themselves--letting them
 alone; for his grace is his own, he is debtor to no man, he may give or 
 withhold his grace at pleasure. Whether this giving up be a positive 
 act of God or only privative we leave to the schools to dispute: but 
 this we are sure of that it is no new thing for God to give men up to 
 their own hearts' lusts, to send them strong delusions, to let Satan 
 loose upon them, nay, to lay stumbling-blocks before them. And yet God 
 is not the author of sin, but herein infinitely just and holy; for, 
 though the greatest wickedness follow upon this giving up, the fault of 
 that is to be laid upon the sinner's wicked heart. If the patient be 
 obstinate, and will not submit to the methods prescribed, but wilfully 
 takes and does that which is prejudicial to him, the physician is not 
 to be blamed if he give him up as in a desperate condition; and all the 
 fatal symptoms that follow are not to be imputed to the physician, but 
 to the disease itself and to the folly and wilfulness of the 
 patient.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To what they were given up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>To uncleanness and vile affections,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:24,26,27"><I>v.</I> 24, 26, 27</A>.

 Those that would not entertain the more pure and refined notices of 
 natural light, which tend to preserve the honour of God, justly 
 forfeited those more gross and palpable sentiments which preserve the 
 honour of human nature. <I>Man being in honour,</I> and refusing to 
 understand the God that made him, thus becomes worse than the <I>beasts 
 that perish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:20">Ps. xlix. 20</A>.

 Thus one, by the divine permission, becomes the punishment of another;
 but it is (as it said here) <I>through the lusts of their own 
 hearts</I>--there all the fault is to be laid. Those who dishonoured 
 God were given up to dishonour themselves. A man cannot be delivered up 
 to a greater slavery than to be given up to his own lusts. Such are 
 given over, like the Egyptians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:4">Isa. xix. 4</A>),

 into the hand of a cruel lord. The particular instances of their 
 uncleanness and vile affections are their unnatural lusts, for which 
 many of the heathen, even of those among them who passed for wisemen, 
 as Solon and Zeno, were infamous, against the plainest and most obvious 
 dictates of natural light. The crying iniquity of Sodom and Gomorrah, 
 for which God rained hell from heaven upon them, became not only 
 commonly practised, but avowed, in the pagan nations. Perhaps the 
 apostle especially refers to the abominations that were committed in 
 the worship of their idol-gods, in which the worst of uncleannesses 
 were prescribed for the honour of their gods; dunghill service for 
 dunghill gods: the unclean spirits delight in such ministrations. In 
 the church of Rome, where the pagan idolatries are revived, images 
 worshipped, and saints only substituted in the room of demons, we hear 
 of these same abominations going barefaced, licensed by the pope 
 (<I>Fox's Acts and Monuments,</I> vol. 1, p. 808), and not only
 commonly perpetrated, but justified and pleaded for by some of their 
 cardinals: the same spiritual plagues for the same spiritual 
 wickednesses. See what wickedness there is in the nature of man. How 
 abominable and filthy is man! <I>Lord, what is man?</I> says David; 
 what a vile creature is he when left to himself! How much are we
 beholden to the restraining grace of God for the preserving any thing 
 of the honour and decency of the human nature! For, were it not for
 this, man, who was made but little lower than the angels, would make 
 himself a great deal lower than the devils. This is said to be that 
 <I>recompence of their error which was meet.</I> The Judge of all the 
 earth does right, and observes a meetness between the sin and the 
 punishment of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To a reprobate mind in these abominations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They <I>did not like to retain God in their knowledge.</I> The 
 blindness of their understandings was caused by the wilful aversion of 
 their wills and affections. They did not retain God in their knowledge, 
 because they did not like it. They would neither know nor do any thing 
 but just what pleased themselves. It is just the temper of carnal 
 hearts; the pleasing of themselves is their highest end. There are many 
 that have God in their knowledge, they cannot help it, the light shines 
 so fully in their faces; but they do not retain him there. They <I>say 
 to the Almighty, Depart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:14">Job xxi. 14</A>),

 and they therefore do not retain God in their knowledge because it 
 thwarts and contradicts their lusts; they do not like it. In their 
 knowledge--<B><I>en epignosei.</I></B> There is a difference between 
 <B><I>gnosis</I></B> and <B><I>epignosis,</I></B> the <I>knowledge</I> 
 and the <I>acknowledgement</I> of God; the pagans knew God, but did 
 not, would not, acknowledge him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Answerable to this wilfulness of theirs, in gainsaying the truth, 
 God gave them over to a wilfulness in the grossest sins, here called a 
 <I>reprobate mind</I>--<B><I>eis adokimon noun,</I></B> a mind void of
 all sense and judgment to discern things that differ, so that they 
 could not distinguish their right hand from their left in spiritual 
 things. See whither a course of sin leads, and into what a gulf it 
 plunges the sinner at last; hither fleshly lusts have a direct
 tendency. <I>Eyes full of adultery cannot cease from sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:14">2 Pet. ii. 14</A>.

 This reprobate mind was a blind scared conscience, past feeling,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:19">Eph. iv. 19</A>.

 When the judgment is once reconciled to sin, the man is in the suburbs
 of hell. At first Pharaoh hardened his heart, but afterwards God 
 hardened Pharaoh's heart. Thus wilful hardness is justly punished with 
 judicial hardness.--<I>To do those things which are not convenient.</I> 
 This phrase may seem to bespeak a diminutive evil, but here it is 
 expressive of the grossest enormities; things that are not agreeable to 
 men, but contradict the very light and law of nature. And here he 
 subjoins a black list of those unbecoming things which the Gentiles 
 were guilty of, being delivered up to a reprobate mind. No wickedness 
 so heinous, so contrary to the light of nature, to the law of nations, 
 and to all the interests of mankind, but a reprobate mind will comply 
 with it. By the histories of those times, especially the accounts we 
 have of the then prevailing dispositions and practices of the Romans 
 when the ancient virtue of that commonwealth was so degenerated, it 
 appears that these sins here mentioned were then and there reigning 
 national sins. No fewer than twenty-three several sorts of sins and 
 sinners are here specified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:29-31"><I>v.</I> 29-31</A>.

 Here the devil's seat is; his name is legion, for they are many. It was
 time to have the gospel preached among them, for the world had need of 
 reformation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Sins against the first table: <I>Haters of God.</I> Here 
 is the devil in his own colours, sin appearing sin. Could it be 
 imagined that rational creatures should hate the chief good, and 
 depending creatures abhor the fountain of their being? And yet so it 
 is. Every sin has in it a hatred of God; but some sinners are more open 
 and avowed enemies to him than others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:8">Zech. xi. 8</A>.

 <I>Proud men and boasters</I> cope with God himself, and put those
 crowns upon their own heads which must be cast before his throne.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Sins against the second table. These are especially 
 mentioned, because in these things they had a clearer light. In general 
 here is a charge of unrighteousness. This is put first, for every sin 
 is unrighteousness; it is withholding that which is due, perverting 
 that which is right; it is especially put for second-table sins, doing 
 as we would not be done by. Against the fifth commandment: 
 <I>Disobedient to parents,</I> and <I>without natural 
 affection</I>--<B><I>astorgous,</I></B> that is parents unkind and cruel
 to their children. Thus, when duty fails on one side, it commonly fails 
 on the other. Disobedient children are justly punished with unnatural 
 parents; and, on the contrary, unnatural parents with disobedient 
 children. Against the sixth commandment: <I>Wickedness</I> (doing 
 mischief for mischief's sake), <I>maliciousness, envy, murder, 
 debate</I> (<B><I>eridos</I></B>--<I>contention</I>), <I>malignity,
 despiteful, implacable, unmerciful;</I> all expressions of that hatred 
 of our brother which is heart-murder. Against the seventh commandment: 
 <I>Fornication;</I> he mentions no more, having spoken before of other 
 uncleannesses. Against the eighth commandment: <I>Unrighteousness, 
 covetousness.</I> Against the ninth commandment: <I>Deceit, whisperers, 
 back-biters, covenant-breakers,</I> lying and slandering. Here are two
 generals not before mentioned--<I>inventors of evil things, and without
 understanding;</I> wise to do evil, and yet having no knowledge to do 
 good. The more deliberate and politic sinners are in inventing evil 
 things, the greater is their sin: so quick of invention in sin, and yet 
 without understanding (stark fools) in the thoughts of God. Here is 
 enough to humble us all, in the sense of our original corruption; for 
 every heart by nature has in it the seed and spawn of all these sins. 
 In the close he mentions the aggravations of the sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 1. They <I>knew the judgment of God;</I> that is,

 (1.) They knew the law. The judgment of God is that which his justice
 requires, which, because he is just, he judgeth meet to be done. 

 (2.) They knew the penalty; so it is explained here: They knew <I>that 
 those who commit such things were worthy of death,</I> eternal death; 
 their own consciences could not but suggest this to them, and yet they 
 ventured upon it. It is a great aggravation of sin when it is committed 
 against knowledge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:17">James iv. 17</A>),

 especially against the knowledge of the judgment of God. It is daring 
 presumption to run upon the sword's point. It argues the heart much 
 hardened, and very resolutely set upon sin. 

 2. They <I>not only do the same, but have pleasure in those that do
 them.</I> The violence of some present temptation may hurry a man into 
 the commission of such sins himself in which the vitiated appetite may 
 take a pleasure; but to be pleased with other people's sins is to love 
 sin for sin's sake: it is joining in a confederacy for the devil's 
 kingdom and interest. <B><I>Syneudokousi</I></B>: they do not only
 commit sin, but they defend and justify it, and encourage others to do 
 the like. Our own sins are much aggravated by our concurrence with, and 
 complacency in, the sins of others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now lay all this together, and then say whether the Gentile world, 
 lying under so much guilt and corruption, could be justified before God
 by any works of their own.</P>
