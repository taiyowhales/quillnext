 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the duty of servants. The apostle had spoken before of 
 church-relations, here of our family-relations. Servants are here said
 to be <I>under the yoke,</I> which denotes both subjection and labour; 
 they are yoked to work, not to be idle. If Christianity finds servants 
 under the yoke, it continues them under it; for the gospel does not 
 cancel the obligations any lie under either by the law of nature or by 
 mutual consent. They must respect their masters, <I>count them worthy 
 of all honour</I> (because they are their masters), of all the respect, 
 observance, compliance, and obedience, that are justly expected from 
 servants to their masters. Not that they were to think that of them 
 which they were not; but as their masters they must count them worthy 
 of all that honour which was fit for them to receive, <I>that the name 
 of God be not blasphemed.</I> If servants that embraced the Christian 
 religion should grow insolent and disobedient to their masters, the 
 doctrine of Christ would be reflected on for their sakes, as if it had 
 made men worse livers than they had been before they received the 
 gospel. Observe, If the professors of religion misbehave themselves, 
 <I>the name of God and his doctrine</I> are in danger of being 
 blasphemed by those who seek occasion <I>to speak evil of that worthy 
 name by which we are called.</I> And this is a good reason why we 
 should all conduct ourselves well, that we may prevent the occasion 
 which many seek, and will be very apt to lay hold of, to speak ill of 
 religion for our sakes. Or suppose the master were a Christian, and a 
 believer, and the servant a believer too, would not this excuse him, 
 because <I>in Christ there is neither bond nor free?</I> No, by no 
 means, for Jesus Christ did not come to dissolve the bond of civil 
 relation, but to strengthen it: <I>Those that have believing masters, 
 let them not despise them because they are brethren;</I> for this 
 brotherhood relates only to spiritual privileges, not to any outward 
 dignity or advantage (those misunderstood and abuse their religion who 
 make it a pretence for denying the duties that they owe to their 
 relations); nay, <I>rather do them service, because they are faithful 
 and beloved.</I> They must think themselves the more obliged to serve 
 them because the faith and love that bespeak men Christians oblige them 
 to do good; and that is all wherein their service consists. Observe, It 
 is a great encouragement to us in doing our duty to our relations if we 
 have reason to think they are faithful and beloved, <I>and partakers of 
 the benefit,</I> that is, of the benefit of Christianity. Again, 
 Believing masters and servants are brethren, and partakers of the 
 benefit; for in Christ Jesus there is neither bond nor free, for you 
 are all one in Christ Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:28">Gal. iii. 28</A>.

 Timothy is appointed to <I>teach and exhort these things.</I> Ministers
 must preach not only the general duties of all, but the duties of 
 particular relations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Paul here warns Timothy to withdraw from those who corrupted the 
 doctrine of Christ, and made it the subject off strife, debate, and 
 controversy: <I>If any man teach otherwise</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>),

 do not preach practically, do not teach and exhort that which is for 
 the promoting of serious godliness--if he will not consent to wholesome 
 words, words that have a direct tendency to heal the soul--if he will 
 <I>not consent</I> to these, even the <I>words of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ.</I> Observe, We are not required to consent to any words as 
 wholesome words except the words of our Lord Jesus Christ; but to those 
 we must give our unfeigned assent and consent, and <I>to the doctrine 
 which is according to godliness.</I> Observe, The doctrine of our Lord 
 Jesus is a doctrine according to godliness; it has a direct tendency to 
 make people godly. But he that does not consent to the words of Christ
 <I>is proud</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 and contentious, ignorant, and does a great deal of mischief to the 
 church, knowing nothing. Observe, Commonly those are most proud who 
 know least; for with all their knowledge they do not know 
 themselves.--<I>But doting about questions.</I> Those who fall off from 
 the plain practical doctrines of Christianity fall in with 
 controversies, which eat out the life and power of religion; they dote 
 about questions <I>and strifes of words,</I> which do a great deal of 
 mischief in the church, are the occasion of <I>envy, strife, railings, 
 evil surmisings.</I> When men are not content with the words of the 
 Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine which is according to godliness, 
 but will frame notions of their own and impose them, and that too in 
 their own words, which man's wisdom teaches, and not in the words which 
 the Holy Ghost teaches 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:13">1 Cor. ii. 13</A>),

 they sow the seeds of all mischief in the church. Hence come 
 <I>perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 disputes that are all subtlety, and no solidity. Observe, Men of
 corrupt minds are <I>destitute of the truth.</I> The reason why men's 
 minds are corrupt is because they do not stick to <I>the truth as it is 
 in Jesus: supposing that gain is godliness,</I> making religion truckle 
 to their secular interest. From such as these Timothy is warned to 
 withdraw himself. We observe, 

 1. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ are wholesome words, they are the
 fittest to prevent or heal the church's wounds, as well as to heal a 
 wounded conscience; for Christ has the tongue of the learned, to speak 
 a word in season to him that is weary, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:4">Isa. l. 4</A>.

 The words of Christ are the best to prevent ruptures in the church; for
 none who profess faith in him will dispute the aptness or authority of 
 his words who is their Lord and teacher, and it has never gone well 
 with the church since the words of men have claimed a regard equal to 
 his words, and in some cases a much greater.

 2. Whoever teaches otherwise, and does not consent to these wholesome
 words, he is proud, knowing nothing; for pride and ignorance commonly 
 go together.

 3. Paul sets a brand only on those who consent not to the words of our
 Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine which is according to godliness;
 they are proud, knowing nothing: other words more wholesome he knew
 not. 

 4. We learn the sad effects of doting about questions and strifes of
 words; of such doting about questions comes envy, strife, evil
 surmisings, and perverse disputings; when men leave the wholesome words
 of our Lord Jesus Christ, they will never agree in other words, either
 of their own or other men's invention, but will perpetually wrangle and
 quarrel about them; and this will produce envy, when they see the words
 of others preferred to those they have adopted for their own; and this
 will be attended with jealousies and suspicions of one another, called
 here <I>evil surmisings;</I> then they will proceed to perverse
 disputings.

 5. Such persons as are given to perverse disputings appear to be men of
 corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth; especially such as act in 
 this manner for the sake of gain, which is all their godliness, 
 supposing gain to be godliness, contrary to the apostle's judgment, who 
 reckoned godliness great gain. 

 6. Good ministers and Christians will withdraw themselves from such.
 "Come out from among them, my people, and be ye separate," says the 
 Lord: <I>from such withdraw thyself.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  But godliness with contentment is great gain.
 &nbsp; 7  For we brought nothing into <I>this</I> world, <I>and it is</I> certain
 we can carry nothing out.
 &nbsp; 8  And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
 &nbsp; 9  But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare,
 and <I>into</I> many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in
 destruction and perdition.
 &nbsp; 10  For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while
 some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced
 themselves through with many sorrows.
 &nbsp; 11  But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
 righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
 &nbsp; 12  Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,
 whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good
 profession before many witnesses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From the mention of the abuse which some put upon religion, making it 
 to serve their secular advantages, the apostle,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Takes occasion to show the excellency of contentment and the evil of 
 covetousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The excellency of contentment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.

 Some account Christianity an advantageous profession for this world. In 
 the sense they mean this is false; yet it is undoubtedly true that, 
 though Christianity is the worst trade, it is the best calling in the 
 world. Those that make a trade of it, merely to serve their turn for 
 this world, will be disappointed, and find it a sorry trade; but those 
 that mind it as their calling, and make a business of it, will find it 
 a gainful calling, for it has the promise of the life that now is, as 
 well as of that which is to come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The truth he lays down is that <I>godliness with contentment is 
 great gain.</I> Some read it, <I>godliness with a competency;</I> that 
 is, if a man have but a little in this world, yet, if he have but 
 enough to carry him through it, he needs desire no more, his godliness 
 with that will be his great gain. <I>For a little which a righteous man 
 has is better than the riches of many wicked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:16">Ps. xxxvii. 16</A>.

 We read it, <I>godliness with contentment;</I> godliness is itself
 great gain, it is profitable to all things; and, wherever there is true 
 godliness, there will be contentment; but those have arrived at the 
 highest pitch of contentment with their godliness are certainly the 
 easiest happiest people in this world. <I>Godliness with 
 contentment,</I> that is, Christian contentment (content must come from 
 principles of godliness) is great gain; it is all the wealth in the 
 world. He that is godly is sure to be happy in another world; and if 
 withal he do by contentment accommodate himself to his condition in 
 this world he has enough. Here we have,

 [1.] A Christian's gain; it is godliness with contentment, this is the 
 true way to gain, yea, it is gain itself.

 [2.] A Christian's gain is great: it is not like the little gain of 
 worldlings, who are so fond of a little worldly advantage.

 [3.] Godliness is ever accompanied with contentment in a great or less 
 degree; all truly godly people have learned with Paul, in whatever 
 state they are, to be therewith content, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:11">Phil. iv. 11</A>.

 They are content with what God allots for them, well knowing that this
 is best for them. Let us all then endeavour after godliness with
 contentment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The reason he gives for it is, <I>For we brought nothing with us 
 into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 This is a reason why we should be content with a little. 

 [1.] Because we can challenge nothing as a debt that is due to us, for 
 we came naked into the world. Whatever we have had since, we are 
 obliged to the providence of God for it; but he that gave may take what 
 and when he pleases. We had our beings, our bodies, our lives (which 
 are more than meat, and which are more than raiment), when we came into 
 the world, though we came naked, and brought nothing with us; may we 
 not then be content while our beings and lives are continued to us, 
 though we have not every thing we would have? We brought nothing with 
 us into this world, and yet God provided for us, care was taken of us, 
 we have been fed all our lives long unto this day; and therefore, when 
 we are reduced to the greatest straits, we cannot be poorer than when 
 we came into this world, and yet then we were provided for; therefore 
 let us trust in God for the remaining part of our pilgrimage.

 [2.] We shall carry nothing with us out of this world. A shroud, a 
 coffin, and a grave, are all that the richest man in the world can have 
 from his thousands. Therefore why should we covet much? Why should we 
 not be content with a little, because, how much soever we have, we must 
 leave it behind us?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:15,16">Eccl. v. 15, 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Hence he infers, <I>having food and raiment, let us be therewith 
 content,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Food and a <I>covering,</I> including habitation as well as raiment. 
 Observe, If God give us the necessary supports of life, we ought to be 
 content therewith, though we have not the ornaments and delights of it. 
 If nature should be content with a little, grace should be content with 
 less; though we have not dainty food, though we have not costly 
 raiment, if we have but food and raiment convenient for us we ought to 
 be content. This was Agur's prayer: <I>Give me neither poverty nor 
 riches; feed me with food convenient for me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:8">Prov. xxx. 8</A>.

 Here we see, 

 [1.] The folly of placing our happiness in these things, when we did 
 not bring any thing into this world with us, and we can carry nothing 
 out. What will worldlings do when death shall strip them of their 
 happiness and portion, and they must take an everlasting farewell of 
 all these things, on which they have so much doted? They may say with 
 poor Micah, <I>You have taken away my gods; and what have I more?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:24">Jud. xviii. 24</A>.

 [2.] The necessaries of life are the hounds of a true Christian's
 desire, and with these he will endeavour to be content; his desires are 
 not insatiable; no, a little, a few comforts of this life, will serve 
 him, and these may hope to enjoy: <I>Having food and raiment.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The evil of covetousness. <I>Those that will be rich</I> (that set 
 their hearts upon the wealth of this world, and are resolved right or 
 wrong, they will have it), <I>fall into temptation and a snare,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It is not said, those that are rich, but those that will be rich, that 
 is, that place their happiness in worldly wealth, that covet it 
 inordinately, and are eager and violent in the pursuit of it. Those 
 that are such <I>fall into temptation and a snare,</I> unavoidably; 
 for, when the devil sees which way their lusts carry them, he will soon 
 bait his hook accordingly. He knew how fond Achan would be of a wedge 
 of gold, and therefore laid that before him. They fall into <I>many 
 foolish and hurtful lusts.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The apostle supposes that, 

 [1.] Some will be rich; that is, they are resolved upon it, nothing 
 short of a great abundance will satisfy.

 [2.] Such will not be safe nor innocent, for they will be in danger of
 ruining themselves for ever; they fall into temptation, and a snare, 
 &c. 

 [3.] Worldly lusts are foolish and hurtful, for they drown men in
 destruction and perdition. 

 [4.] It is good for us to consider the mischievousness of worldly
 fleshly lusts. They are foolish, and therefore we should be ashamed of 
 them, hurtful, and therefore we should be afraid of them, especially 
 considering to what degree they are hurtful, for they <I>drown men in 
 destruction and perdition.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The apostle affirms that <I>the love of money is the root of all 
 evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 What sins will not men be drawn to by the love of money? Particularly 
 this was at the bottom of the apostasy of many from the faith of 
 Christ; while they coveted money, they <I>erred from the faith,</I> 
 they quitted their Christianity, and <I>pierced themselves through with 
 many sorrows.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] What is the root of all evil; the love of money: people may have 
 money, and yet not love it; but, if they love it inordinately, it will 
 push them on to all evil.

 [2.] Covetous persons will quit the faith, if that be the way to get 
 money: <I>Which while some coveted after, they have erred from the 
 faith. Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:10">2 Tim. iv. 10</A>.

 For the world was dearer to him than Christianity. Observe, Those that 
 err from the faith pierce themselves with many sorrows; those that 
 depart from God do but treasure up sorrows for themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Hence he takes occasion to caution Timothy, and to counsel him to 
 keep in the way of God and his duty, and particularly to fulfil the 
 trust reposed in him as a minister. He addresses himself to him as <I>a 
 man of God.</I> Ministers are men of God, and ought to conduct 
 themselves accordingly in every thing; they are men employed for God, 
 devoted to his honour more immediately. The prophets under the Old 
 Testament were called men of God. 

 1. He charges Timothy to take heed of the love of money, which had been
 so pernicious to many: <I>Flee these things.</I> It ill becomes any 
 men, but especially men of God, to set their hearts upon the things of 
 this world; men of God should be taken up with the things of God. 

 2. To arm him against the love of the world, he directs him to follow
 that which is good. <I>Follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, 
 love, patience, meekness:</I> righteousness in his conversation towards 
 men, godliness towards God, faith and love as living principles, to 
 support him and carry him on in the practice both of righteousness and 
 godliness. Those that follow after righteousness and godliness, from a 
 principle of faith and love, have need to put on patience and 
 meekness--patience to bear both the rebukes of Providence and the 
 reproaches of men, and meekness wherewith to instruct gainsayers and 
 pass by the affronts and injuries that are done us. Observe, It is not 
 enough that men of God flee these things, but they must follow after 
 what is directly contrary thereto. Further, What excellent persons men 
 of God are who follow after righteousness! They are the excellent of
 the earth, and, being acceptable to God, they should be approved of 
 men. 

 3. He exhorts him to do the part of a soldier: <I>Fight the good fight
 of faith.</I> Note, Those who will get to heaven must fight their way 
 thither. There must be a conflict with corruption and temptations, and 
 the opposition of the powers of darkness. Observe, It is a good fight, 
 it is a good cause, and it will have a good issue. It is the fight of 
 faith; we do not war after the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare 
 are not carnal,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:3,4">2 Cor. x. 3, 4</A>.

 He exhorts him to <I>lay hold on eternal life.</I> Observe,

 (1.) Eternal life is the crown proposed to us, for our encouragement to
 war, and to fight the good fight of faith, the good warfare. 

 (2.) This we must lay hold on, as those that are afraid of coming short 
 of it and losing it. Lay hold, and take heed of losing your hold.
 <I>Hold fast that which thou hast, that no man take thy crown,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:11">Rev. iii. 11</A>.

 (3.) We are called to the fight, and to lay hold on eternal life.

 (4.) The profession Timothy and all faithful ministers make before many
 witnesses is a good profession; for they profess and engage to fight 
 the good fight of faith, and to lay hold on eternal life; their calling 
 and their own profession oblige them to this.</P>

 <I>be</I> with thee. Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here charges Timothy <I>to keep this commandment</I> (that 
 is, the whole work of his ministry, all the trust reposed in him, all 
 the service expected from him) <I>without spot, unrebukable;</I> he 
 must conduct himself so in his ministry that he might not lay himself 
 open to any blame nor incur any blemish. What are the motives to move 
 him to this?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gives him a solemn charge: <I>I give thee charge in the sight of 
 God that thou do this.</I> He charges him as he will answer it at the 
 great day to that God whose eyes are upon us all, who sees what we are 
 and what we do:--<I>God, who quickens all things,</I> who has life in
 himself and is the fountain of life. This should quicken us to the 
 service of God that we serve a God who quickens all things. He charges 
 him before Christ Jesus, to whom in a peculiar manner he stood related 
 as a minister of his gospel: <I>Who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a 
 good confession.</I> Observe, Christ died not only as a sacrifice, but 
 as a martyr; and he witnessed a good confession when he was arraigned 
 before Pilate, saying 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:36,37">John xviii. 36, 37</A>),

 <I>My kingdom is not of this world: I am come to bear witness unto the 
 truth.</I> That good confession of his before Pilate, <I>My kingdom is 
 not of this world,</I> should be effectual to draw off all his 
 followers, both ministers and people, from the love of this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He reminds him of the confession that he himself had made: <I>Thou 
 hast professed a good profession before many witnesses</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 namely, when he was ordained by the laying on of the hands of the 
 presbytery. The obligation of that was still upon him, and he must live 
 up to that, and be quickened by that, to do the work of his 
 ministry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He reminds him of Christ's second coming: "<I>Keep this 
 commandment-until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;</I> keep it 
 as long as thou live, till Christ come at death to give thee a 
 discharge. Keep it with an eye to his second coming, when we must all 
 give an account of the talents we have been entrusted with," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:2">Luke xvi. 2</A>.
 
 Observe, The Lord Jesus Christ will appear, and it will be a glorious
 appearing, not like his first appearing in the days of his humiliation. 
 Ministers should have an eye to this appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ 
 in all their ministrations, and, till his appearing, they are to keep 
 this commandment without spot, unrebukable. Mentioning the appearing of 
 Christ, as one that loved it, Paul loves to speak of it, and loves to 
 speak of him who shall then appear. The appearing of Christ is certain 
 (<I>he shall show it</I>), but it is not for us to know the time and 
 season of it, which the Father has kept in his own power: let this 
 suffice us, that in time he will show it, in the time that he thinks 
 fit for it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning Christ and God the Father the apostle here speaks great 
 things. 

 (1.) That God is the only Potentate; the powers of earthly princes are
 all derived from him, and depend upon him. The powers that exist are 
 ordained of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:1">Rom. xiii. 1</A>.

 He is the only Potentate that is absolute and sovereign, and perfectly 
 independent. 

 (2.) He is the blessed and the only Potentate, infinitely happy, and 
 nothing can in the least impair his happiness. 

 (3.) He is King of kings, and Lord of lords. All the kings of the earth 
 derive their power from him; he gave them their crowns, they hold them 
 under him, and he has a sovereign dominion over them. This is Christ's 
 title 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:16">Rev. xix. 16</A>),

 <I>upon his vesture and his thigh;</I> for he has a name higher than 
 the kings of the earth. 

 (4.) He only has immortality. He only is immortal in himself, and has 
 immortality as he is the fountain of it, for the immortality of angels 
 and spirits derived from him. 

 (5.) He dwells in inaccessible light, <I>light which no man can 
 approach unto:</I> no man can get to heaven but those whom he is 
 pleased to bring thither, and admit into his kingdom. 

 (6.) He is invisible: <I>Whom no man hath seen, nor can see.</I> It is 
 impossible that mortal eyes should bear the brightness of the divine 
 glory. No man can see God and live.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Having mentioned these glorious attributes, he concludes with a 
 doxology: <I>To him be honour and power everlasting. Amen.</I> God 
 having all power and honour to himself, it is our duty to ascribe all 
 power and honour to him. 

 (1.) What an evil is sin, when committed against such a God, the 
 blessed and only Potentate! The evil of it rises in proportion to the 
 dignity of him against whom it is committed.

 (2.) Great is his condescension, to take notice of such mean and vile 
 creatures as we are. What are we then, that the blessed God, the King 
 of kings and Lord of lords, should seek after us? 

 (3.) Blessed are those who are admitted to dwell with this great and 
 blessed Potentate. <I>Happy are thy men</I> (says the queen of Sheba
 to king Solomon), <I>happy are these thy servants, who stand 
 continually before thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:8">1 Kings x. 8</A>.

 Much more happy are those who are allowed to stand before the King of
 kings. 

 (4.) Let us love, adore, and praise, the great God; for <I>who shall 
 not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? For thou only art 
 holy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+15:4">Rev. xv. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The apostle adds, by way of postscript, a lesson for rich people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:17-19"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Timothy must charge those that are rich to beware of the 
 temptations, and improve the opportunities, of their prosperous estate. 
 
 (1.) He must caution them to take heed of pride. This is a sin that 
 easily besets rich people, upon whom the world smiles. Charge them 
 <I>that they be not high-minded,</I> or think of themselves above what 
 is meet, or be puffed up with their wealth. 

 (2.) He must caution them against vain confidence in their wealth. 
 Charge them that they <I>trust not in uncertain riches.</I> Nothing is 
 more uncertain than the wealth of this world; many have had much of it 
 one day and been stripped of all the next. Riches make themselves 
 wings, and fly away as an eagle, &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:5">Prov. xxiii. 5</A>.

 (3.) He must charge them to <I>trust in God, the living God,</I> to 
 make him their hope, <I>who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.</I> 
 Those who are rich must see God giving them their riches, and giving 
 them to enjoy them richly; for many have riches, but enjoy them poorly, 
 not having a heart to use them. 

 (4.) He must charge them to do good with what they have (for what is
 the best estate worth, any more than as it gives a man an opportunity 
 of doing so much the more good?): <I>That they be rich in good 
 works.</I> Those are truly rich who are rich in good works. That they 
 be <I>ready to distribute, willing to communicate:</I> not only to do 
 it, but to do it willingly, for <I>God loves a cheerful giver.</I> 

 (5.) He must charge them to think of another world, and prepare for 
 that which is to come by works of charity: <I>Laying up in store a good 
 foundation against the time to come,</I> that they may take hold on 
 eternal life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Hence we may observe, 

 (1.) Ministers must not be afraid of the rich; be they ever so rich, 
 they must speak to them, and charge them. 

 (2.) They must caution them against pride, and vain confidence in their 
 riches: <I>That they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain 
 riches.</I> Stir them up to works of piety and charity: <I>That they do 
 good,</I> &c.

 (3.) This is the way for the rich to lay up in store for themselves for
 the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life; in the way of
 well-doing we are to seek for glory, honour, and immortality, <I>and
 eternal life will be the end of all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:7">Rom. ii. 7</A>.

 (4.) Here is a lesson for ministers in the charge given to Timothy:
 <I>Keep that which is committed to thy trust.</I> Every minister is a 
 trustee, and it is a treasure committed to his trust, which he has to 
 keep. The truths of God, the ordinances of God, keep these, <I>avoiding 
 profane and vain babblings;</I> not affecting human eloquence, which 
 the apostle calls vain babbling, or human learning, which often opposes 
 the truths of God, but keep close to the written word, for that is 
 committed to our trust. Some who have been very proud of their 
 learning, their <I>science, which is falsely so called,</I> have by 
 that been debauched in their principles and been drawn away from the 
 faith of Christ, which is a good reason why we should keep to the plain 
 word of the gospel, and resolve to live and die by that. Observe, 

 [1.] Ministers cannot be too earnestly exhorted to keep what is 
 committed to their trust, because it is a great trust lodged with them: 
 <I>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust!</I> as if he 
 had said, "I cannot conclude without charging thee again; whatever thou 
 doest, be sure to keep this trust, for it is too great a trust to be 
 betrayed."

 [2.] Ministers are to avoid babblings, if they would keep what is 
 committed to them, because they are vain and profane.

 [3.] That science that opposes the truth of the gospel is falsely so
 called; it is not true science, for if it were it would approve of the 
 gospel and consent to it.

 [4.] Those who are so fond of such science are in great danger of
 erring concerning the faith; those who are for advancing reason above 
 faith are in danger of leaving faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Our apostle concludes with a solemn prayer and benediction: <I>Grace 
 be with thee. Amen.</I> Observe, this is a short, yet comprehensive 
 prayer for our friends, for grace comprehends in it all that is good, 
 and grace is an earnest, yea, a beginning, of glory; for, wherever God
 gives grace, he will give glory, and will not withhold any good thing 
 from him who walketh uprightly. Grace be with you all. Amen.</P>
