 The doctrine of the priestly office of Christ is so excellent in 
 itself, and so essential a part of the Christian faith, that the 
 apostle loves to dwell upon it. Nothing made the Jews so fond of the 
 Levitical dispensation as the high esteem they had of their priesthood, 
 and it was doubtless a sacred and most excellent institution; it was a 
 very severe threatening denounced against the Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:4">Hos. iii. 4</A>),

 that the children of Israel should abide many days without a prince or 
 priest, and without a sacrifice, and with an ephod, and without 
 teraphim. Now the apostle assures them that by receiving the Lord Jesus 
 they would have a much better high priest, a priesthood of a higher 
 order, and consequently a better dispensation or covenant, a better law 
 and testament; this he shows in this chapter, where,

 I. We have a more particular account of Melchisedec,

 II. The superiority of his priesthood to that of Aaron,

 excellency of his person, office, and covenant,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high
 God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings,
 and blessed him;
 &nbsp; 2  To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
 interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of
 Salem, which is, King of peace;
 &nbsp; 3  Without father, without mother, without descent, having
 neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto
 the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
 &nbsp; 4  Now consider how great this man <I>was,</I> unto whom even the
 patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
 &nbsp; 5  And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the
 office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of
 the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren,
 though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
 &nbsp; 6  But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes
 of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
 &nbsp; 7  And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the
 better.
 &nbsp; 8  And here men that die receive tithes; but there he <I>receiveth
 them,</I> of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
 &nbsp; 9  And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, paid
 tithes in Abraham.
 &nbsp; 10  For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec
 met him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The foregoing chapter ended with a repetition of what had been cited 
 once and again before out of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:4">Ps. cx. 4</A>,

 <I>Jesus, a high priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.</I>
 Now this chapter is as a sermon upon that text; here the apostle sets 
 before them some of the strong meat he had spoken of before, hoping 
 they would by greater diligence be better prepared to digest it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The great question that first offers itself is, Who was this 
 Melchisedec? All the account we have of him in the Old Testament is in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:18">Gen. xiv. 18</A>,

 &c., and in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:4">Ps. cx. 4</A>.

 Indeed we are much in the dark about him; God has thought fit to leave
 us so, that this Melchisedec might be a more lively type of him whose 
 generation none can declare. If men will not be satisfied with what is 
 revealed, they must rove about in the dark in endless conjectures, some 
 fancying him to have been an angel, others the Holy Ghost; but,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The opinions concerning him that are best worthy our consideration 
 are these three:--

 (1.) Therabbin, and most of the Jewish writers, think he was Shem the
 son of Noah who was king and priest to their ancestors, after the 
 manner of the other patriarchs; but it is not probable that he should 
 thus change his name. Besides, we have no account of his settling in 
 the land of Canaan. 

 (2.) Many Christian writers have thought him to be Jesus Christ 
 himself, appearing by a special dispensation and privilege to Abraham 
 in the flesh, and who was known to Abraham by the name 
 <I>Melchisedec,</I> which agrees very well to Christ, and to what is 
 said,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:56">John viii. 56</A>,

 <I>Abraham saw</I> his <I>day and rejoiced.</I> Much may be said for
 this opinion, and what is said in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>

 does not seem to agree with any mere man; but then it seems strange to 
 make Christ a type of himself.

 (3.) The most general opinion is that he was a Canaanite king, who 
 reigned in Salem, and kept up religion and the worship of the true God; 
 that he was raised to be a type of Christ, and was honoured by Abraham 
 as such.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But we shall leave these conjectures, and labour to understand, as 
 far as we can, what is here said of him by the apostle, and how Christ 
 is represented thereby, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:1-3"><I>v.</I> 1-3</A>.

 (1.) Melchisedec was a king, and so is the Lord Jesus--a king of God's
 anointing; the government is laid upon his shoulders, and he rules over 
 all for the good of his people. 

 (2.) That he was <I>king of righteousness:</I> his name signifies
 <I>the righteous king.</I> Jesus Christ is a rightful and a righteous 
 king--rightful in his title, righteous in his government. He is the 
 Lord our righteousness; he has fulfilled all righteousness, and brought 
 in an everlasting righteousness, and he loves righteousness and 
 righteous persons, and hates iniquity. 

 (3.) He was king of Salem, that is, king of peace; first king of
 righteousness, and after that king of peace. So is our Lord Jesus; he 
 by his righteousness made peace, the fruit of righteousness is peace. 
 Christ speaks peace, creates peace, is our peace-maker.

 (4.) He was <I>priest of the most high God,</I> qualified and anointed
 in an extraordinary manner to be his priest among the Gentiles. So is 
 the Lord Jesus; he is the priest of the most high God, and the Gentiles 
 must come to God by him; it is only through his priesthood that we can 
 obtain reconciliation and remission of sin. 

 (5.) He was <I>without father, without mother, without descent, having 
 neither beginning of days nor end of life,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This must not be understood according to the letter; but the scripture 
 has chosen to set him forth as an extraordinary person, without giving 
 us his genealogy, that he might be a fitter type of Christ, who as man 
 was without father, as God without mother; whose priesthood is without 
 descent, did not descend to him from another, nor from him to another, 
 but is personal and perpetual.

 (6.) That he <I>met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, 
 and blessed him.</I> The incident is recorded

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:18">Gen. xiv. 18</A>,

 &c. He brought forth bread and wine to refresh Abraham and his servants
 when they were weary; he gave as a king, and blessed as a priest. Thus 
 our Lord Jesus meets his people in their spiritual conflicts, refreshes 
 them, renews their strength, and blesses them.

 (7.) That <I>Abraham gave him a tenth part of all</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that is, as the apostle explains it, of all <I>the spoils;</I> and this 
 Abraham did as an expression of his gratitude for what Melchisedec had 
 done for him, or as a testimony of his homage and subjection to him as 
 a king, or as an offering vowed and dedicated to God, to be presented 
 by his priest. And thus are we obliged to make all possible returns of 
 love and gratitude to the Lord Jesus for all the rich and royal favours 
 we receive from him, to pay our homage and subjection to him as our 
 King, and to put all our offerings into his hands, to be presented by 
 him to the Father in the incense of his own sacrifice. 

 (8.) That this Melchisedec was <I>made like unto the Son of God, and 
 abideth a priest continually.</I> He bore the image of God in his piety 
 and authority, and stands upon record as an immortal high priest; the 
 ancient type of him who is the eternal and only-begotten of the Father, 
 who abideth a priest for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us now consider (as the apostle advises) how great this 
 Melchisedec was, and how far his priesthood was above that of the order 
 of Aaron 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>,

 &c.): <I>Now consider how great this man was,</I> &c. The greatness of
 this man and his priesthood appears, 

 1. From Abraham's paying the tenth of the spoils unto him; and it is
 well observed that Levi paid tithes to Melchisedec in Abraham, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Now Levi received the office of the priesthood from God, and was to 
 take tithes of the people, yet even Levi paid tithes to Melchisedec, as 
 to a greater and higher priest than himself; therefore that high priest 
 who should afterwards appear, of whom Melchisedec was a type, must be 
 much superior to any of the Levitical priests, who paid tithes, in 
 Abraham, to Melchisedec. And now by this argument of persons doing 
 things that are matters of right or injury in the loins of their 
 predecessors we have an illustration how we may be said to have sinned 
 in Adam, and fallen with him in his first transgression. We were in 
 Adam's loins when he sinned, and the guilt and depravity contracted by 
 the human nature when it was in our first parents are equitably imputed 
 and derived to the same nature as it is in all other persons naturally 
 descended from them. They justly adhere to the nature, and it must be 
 by an act of grace if ever they be taken away. 

 2. From Melchisedec's blessing of Abraham, <I>who had the promises;
 and, without contradiction, the less is blessed of the greater,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 Here observe,

 (1.) Abraham's great dignity and felicity--that he had the promises. He 
 was one in covenant with God, to whom God had given exceedingly great 
 and precious promises. That man is rich and happy indeed who has an 
 estate in bills and bonds under God's own hand and seal. These
 promises are both of the life that now is and of that which is to come; 
 this honour have all those who receive the Lord Jesus, in whom all the 
 promises are yea and amen. 

 (2.) Melchisedec's greater honour--in that it was his place and
 privilege to bless Abraham; and it is an uncontested maxim <I>that the 
 less is blessed of the greater,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He who gives the blessing is greater than he who receives it; and 
 therefore Christ, the antitype of Melchisedec, the meriter and Mediator 
 of all blessings to the children of men, must be greater than all the 
 priests of the order of Aaron.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood,
 (for under it the people received the law,) what further need
 <I>was there</I> that another priest should rise after the order of
 Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
 &nbsp; 12  For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity
 a change also of the law.
 &nbsp; 13  For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another
 tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
 &nbsp; 14  For <I>it is</I> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of
 which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
 &nbsp; 15  And it is yet far more evident: for that after the
 similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
 &nbsp; 16  Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but
 after the power of an endless life.
 &nbsp; 17  For he testifieth, Thou <I>art</I> a priest for ever after the
 order of Melchisedec.
 &nbsp; 18  For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
 before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
 &nbsp; 19  For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a
 better hope <I>did;</I> by the which we draw nigh unto God.
 &nbsp; 20  And inasmuch as not without an oath <I>he was made priest:</I>
 &nbsp; 21  (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with
 an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not
 repent, Thou <I>art</I> a priest for ever after the order of
 Melchisedec:)
 &nbsp; 22  By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
 &nbsp; 23  And they truly were many priests, because they were not
 suffered to continue by reason of death:
 &nbsp; 24  But this <I>man,</I> because he continueth ever, hath an
 unchangeable priesthood.
 &nbsp; 25  Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that
 come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession
 for them.
 &nbsp; 26  For such a high priest became us, <I>who is</I> holy, harmless,
 undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the
 heavens;
 &nbsp; 27  Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
 sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for
 this he did once, when he offered up himself.
 &nbsp; 28  For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity;
 but the word of the oath, which was since the law, <I>maketh</I> the
 Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe the necessity there was of raising up another priest, after the 
 order of Melchisedec and not after the order of Aaron, by whom that 
 perfection should come which could not come by the Levitical 
 priesthood, which therefore must be changed, and the whole economy with 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>,

 &c. Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is asserted that perfection could not come by the Levitical 
 priesthood and the law. They could not put those who came to them into 
 the perfect enjoyment of the good things they pointed out to them; they 
 could only show them the way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That therefore another priest must be raised up, after the order of 
 Melchisedec, by whom, and his law of faith, perfection might come to 
 all who obey him; and, blessed be God, that we may have perfect 
 holiness and perfect happiness by Christ in the covenant of grace, 
 according to the gospel, for we are complete in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is asserted that the priesthood being changed there must of 
 necessity be a change of the law; there being so near a relation 
 between the priesthood and the law, the dispensation could not be the 
 same under another priesthood; a new priesthood must be under a new 
 regulation, managed in another way, and by rules proper to its nature 
 and order.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. It is not only asserted, but proved, that the priesthood and law 
 are changed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 The priesthood and law by which perfection could not come are 
 abolished, and a priest has arisen, and a dispensation is now set up, 
 by which true believers may be made perfect. Now that there is such a 
 change is obvious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There is a change in the tribe of which the priesthood comes. 
 Before, it was the tribe of Levi; but our great high priest sprang out 
 of Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning the priesthood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This change of the family shows a real change of the law of the 
 priesthood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There is a change in the form and order of making the priests. 
 Before, in the Levitical priesthood, they were made after the law of a 
 carnal commandment; but our great high priest was made after the power 
 of an endless life. The former law appointed that the office should 
 descend, upon the death of the father, to his eldest son, according to 
 the order of carnal or natural generation; for none of the high priests 
 under the law were without father or mother, or without descent: they 
 had not life and immortality in themselves. They had both beginning of 
 days and end of life; and so the carnal commandment, or law of 
 primogeniture, directed their succession, as it did in matters of civil 
 right and inheritance. But the law by which Christ was constituted a 
 priest, after the order of Melchisedec, was the power of an endless 
 life. The life and immortality which he had in himself were his right 
 and title to the priesthood, not his descent from former priests. This 
 makes a great difference in the priesthood, and in the economy too, and 
 gives the preference infinitely to Christ and the gospel. The very law 
 which constituted the Levitical priesthood supposed the priests to be 
 weak, frail, dying, creatures, not able to preserve their own natural 
 lives, but who must be content and glad to survive in their posterity 
 after the flesh; much less could they, by any power or authority they 
 had, convey spiritual life and blessedness to those who came to them. 
 But the high priest of our profession holds his office by that innate 
 power of endless life which he has in himself, not only to preserve 
 himself alive, but to communicate spiritual and eternal life to all 
 those who duly rely upon his sacrifice and intercession. Some thing 
 <I>the law of the carnal commandment</I> refers to the external rites 
 of consecration, and the carnal offerings that were made; but <I>the 
 power of an endless life</I> to the spiritual living sacrifices proper 
 to the gospel, and the spiritual and eternal privileges purchased by 
 Christ, who was consecrated by the eternal Spirit of life that he 
 received without measure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. There is a change in the efficacy of the priesthood. The former was 
 weak and unprofitable, made nothing perfect; the latter brought in a 
 better hope, by which we draw near to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 The Levitical priesthood brought nothing to perfection: it could not 
 justify men's persons from guilt; it could not sanctify them from 
 inward pollution; it could not cleanse the consciences of the 
 worshippers from dead works; all it could do was to lead them to the 
 antitype. But the priesthood of Christ carries in it, and brings along 
 with it, a better hope; it shows us the true foundation of all the hope 
 we have towards God for pardon and salvation; it more clearly discovers 
 the great objects of our hope; and so it tends to work in us a more 
 strong and lively hope of acceptance with God. By this hope we are 
 encouraged to draw nigh unto God, to enter into a covenant-union with 
 him, to live a life of converse and communion with him. We may now draw 
 near with a true heart, and with the full assurance of faith, having 
 our minds sprinkled from an evil conscience. The former priesthood 
 rather kept men at a distance, and under a spirit of bondage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. There is a change in God's way of acting in this priesthood. He has 
 taken an oath to Christ, which he never did to any of the order of 
 Aaron. God never gave them any such assurance of their continuance, 
 never engaged himself by oath or promise that theirs should be an 
 everlasting priesthood, and therefore gave them no reason to expect the 
 perpetuity of it, but rather to look upon it as a temporary law. But 
 Christ was made a priest with the oath of God: <I>The Lord hath sworn, 
 and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of 
 Melchisedec,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Here God has upon oath declared the immutability, excellency, efficacy, 
 and eternity, of the priesthood of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. There is a change in that covenant of which the priesthood was a 
 security and the priest a surety; that is, a change in the dispensation 
 of that covenant. The gospel dispensation is more full, free, 
 perspicuous, spiritual, and efficacious, than that of the law. Christ 
 is in this gospel covenant a surety for us to God and for God to us, to 
 see that the articles be performed on both parts He, as surety, has 
 united the divine and human nature together in his own person, and 
 therein given assurance of reconciliation; and he has, as surety, 
 united God and man together in the bond of the everlasting covenant. He 
 pleads with men to keep their covenant with god, and he pleads with God 
 that he will fulfil his promises to men, which he is always ready to do 
 in a way suitable to his majesty and glory, that is, through a 
 Mediator.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. There is a remarkable change in the number of the priests under 
 these different orders. In that of Aaron there was a multitude of 
 priests, of high priests, not at once, but successively; but in this of 
 Christ there is but one and the same. The reason is plain, The 
 Levitical priests were many, because <I>they were not suffered to 
 continue by reason of death.</I> Their office, how high and honourable 
 soever, could not secure them from dying; and, as one died, another 
 must succeed, and after a while must give place to a third, till the 
 number had become very great. But this our high priest continues for 
 ever, and his priesthood is <B><I>aparabaton</I></B>--<I>an unchangeable
 one,</I> that does not pass from one to another, as the former did; it 
 is always in the same hand. There can be no vacancy in this priesthood, 
 no hour nor moment in which the people are without a priest to 
 negotiate their spiritual concerns in heaven. Such a vacancy might be 
 very dangerous and prejudicial to them; but this is their safety and 
 happiness, that this ever-living high priest is able to save to the 
 utmost--in all times, in all cases, in every juncture--all who come to
 God by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 So that here is a manifest alteration much for the better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. There is a remarkable difference in the moral qualifications of the 
 priests. Those who were of the order of Aaron were not only mortal men, 
 but sinful men, who had their sinful as well as natural infirmities; 
 they needed to offer up sacrifices first for their own sins and then 
 for the people. But our high priest, who was consecrated by the word of 
 the oath, needed only to offer up once for the people, never at all for 
 himself; for he has not only an immutable consecration to his office, 
 but an immutable sanctity in his person. He is <I>such a high priest as 
 became us, holy, harmless, and undefiled,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 (1.) Our case, as sinners, needed a high priest to make satisfaction 
 and intercession for us. 

 (2.) No priest could be suitable or sufficient for our reconciliation 
 to God but one who was perfectly righteous in his own person; he must 
 be righteous in himself, or he could not be a propitiation for our sin, 
 or our advocate with the Father. 

 (3.) The Lord Jesus was exactly such a high priest as we wanted, for he 
 has a personal holiness, absolutely perfect. Observe the description we 
 have of the personal holiness of Christ expressed in various terms, all 
 of which some learned divines consider as relating to his perfect 
 purity.

 [1.] He is holy, perfectly free from all the habits or principles of 
 sin, not having the least disposition to it in his nature; no sin 
 dwells in him, though it does in the best of Christians, not the least 
 sinful inclination

 [2.] He is harmless, perfectly free from all actual transgression, has 
 done no violence, nor is there any deceit in his mouth, never did the 
 least wrong to God or man.

 [3.] He is undefiled, he was never accessory to other men's sins. It
 is a difficult thing to keep ourselves pure, so as not to partake in 
 the guilt of other men's sins, by contributing in some way towards 
 them, or not doing what we ought to prevent them. Christ was
 undefiled; though he took upon him the guilt of our sins, yet he never 
 involved himself in the fact and fault of them.

 [4.] He is separate from sinners, not only in his present state (having 
 entered as our high priest into the holiest of all, into which nothing 
 defiled can enter), but in his personal purity: he has no such union 
 with sinners, either natural or federal, as can devolve upon him 
 original sin. This comes upon us by virtue of our natural and federal 
 union with the first Adam, we descending from him in the ordinary way. 
 But Christ was, by his ineffable conception in the virgin, separate 
 from sinners; though he took a true human nature, yet the miraculous 
 way in which it was conceived set him upon a separate footing from all 
 the rest of mankind.

 [5.] He is made higher than the heavens. Most expositors understand 
 this concerning his state of exaltation in heaven, at the right hand of 
 God, to perfect the design of his priesthood. But Dr. Goodwin thinks 
 this may be very justly referred to the personal holiness of Christ, 
 which is greater and more perfect than the holiness of the hosts of 
 heaven, that is, the holy angels themselves, who, though they are free 
 from sin, yet are not in themselves free from all possibility of 
 sinning. And therefore we read, <I>God putteth no trust in his holy 
 ones, and he chargeth his angels with folly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:18">Job iv. 18</A>),

 that is, with weakness and peccability. They may be angels one hour and 
 devils another, as many of them were; and that the holy angels shall 
 not now fall does not proceed from an indefectibility of nature, but 
 from the election of God; they are elect angels. It is very probable
 that this explanation of the words, <I>made higher than the 
 heavens,</I> may be thought too much strained, and that it ought to be 
 understood of the dignity of Christ's state, and not the perfect 
 holiness of his person; and the rather because it is said he was 
 <I>made</I> higher <B><I>genomenos</I></B>; but it is well known that
 this word is used in a neutral sense, as where it is said,
 <B><I>genesthe ho Theos alethes</I></B>--<I>Let God be true.</I> The
 other characters in the verse plainly belong to the personal perfection
 of Christ in holiness, as opposed to the sinful infirmities of the
 Levitical priests; and it seems congruous to think this must do so too,
 if it may be fairly taken in such a sense; and it appears yet more
 probable, since the validity and prevalency of Christ's priesthood in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>

 are placed in the impartiality and disinterestedness of it. He needed 
 not to offer up for himself: it was a disinterested mediation; he 
 mediated for that mercy for others which he did not need for himself; 
 had he needed it himself, he had been a party, and could not have been 
 a Mediator--a criminal, and could not have been an advocate for 
 sinners. Now, to render his mediation the more impartial and 
 disinterested, it seems requisite not only that he had no present need 
 of that favour for himself which he mediated for in behalf of others, 
 but that he never could stand in need of it. Though he needed it not 
 to-day, yet if he knew he might be in such circumstances as to need it 
 to-morrow, or at any future time, he must have been thought to have had 
 some eye upon his own interest, and therefore could not act with 
 impartial regard and pure zeal for the honour of God on one hand, and 
 tender pure compassion for poor sinners on the other. I pretend not 
 here to follow the notes of our late excellent expositor, into whose 
 labours we have entered, but have taken the liberty to vindicate this 
 notion of the learned Dr. Goodwin from the exceptions that I know have 
 been made to it; and I have the rather done it because, if it will hold 
 good, it gives us further evidence how necessary it was that the 
 Mediator should be God, since no mere creature is of himself possessed 
 of that impeccability which will set him above all possible need of 
 favour and mercy for himself.</P>
