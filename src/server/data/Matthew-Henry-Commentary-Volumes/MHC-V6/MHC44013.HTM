 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have not yet met with any things concerning the spreading of the 
 gospel to the Gentiles which bears any proportion to the largeness of 
 that commission, "Go, and disciple all nations." The door was opened in 
 the baptizing of Cornelius and his friends; but since then we had the 
 gospel preached to the Jews only, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:19"><I>ch.</I> xi. 19</A>.

 It should seem as if the light which began to shine upon the Gentile
 world had withdrawn itself. But here in this chapter that work, that
 great good work, is revived in the midst of the years; and though the 
 Jews shall still have the first offer of the gospel made to them, yet, 
 upon their refusal, the Gentiles shall have their share of the offer of 
 it. Here is, 

 I. The solemn ordination of Barnabas and Saul, by divine direction, to 
 the ministry, to the great work of spreading the gospel among the 
 nations about (and it is probable that other apostles or apostolical
 men dispersed themselves by order from Christ, upon the same errand,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>).

 II. Their preaching the gospel in Cyprus, and the opposition they met
 with there from Elymas the sorcerer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:4-13">ver. 4-13</A>.

 III. The heads of a sermon which Paul preached to the Jews at Antioch 
 in Pisidia, in their synagogue, which is given us as a specimen of what 
 they usually preached to the Jews, and the method they took with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:14-41">ver. 14-41</A>.

 IV. The preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles at their request, and
 upon the Jews' refusal of it, wherein the apostles justified themselves
 against the displeasure which the Jews conceived at it, and God owned
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:42-49">ver. 42-49</A>.

 V. The trouble which the infidel Jews gave to the apostles, which 
 obliged them to remove to another place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:50-52">ver. 50-52</A>),

 so that the design of this chapter is to show how cautiously, how
 gradually, and with what good reason the apostles carried the gospel 
 into the Gentile world, and admitted the Gentiles into the church, 
 which was so great an offence to the Jews, and which Paul is so 
 industrious to justify in his epistles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain
 prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called
 Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought
 up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
 &nbsp; 2 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost
 said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have
 called them.
 &nbsp; 3 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid <I>their</I> hands
 on them, they sent <I>them</I> away.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a divine warrant and commission to Barnabas and Saul to go 
 and preach the gospel among the Gentiles, and their ordination to that 
 service by the imposition of hands, with fasting and prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is an account of the present state of the church at Antioch, 
 which was planted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:20"><I>ch.</I> xi. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How well furnished it was with good ministers; there were there 
 <I>certain prophets and teachers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 men that were eminent for gifts, graces, and usefulness. Christ, when 
 he <I>ascended on high,</I> gave <I>some prophets and some teachers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:11">Eph. iv. 11</A>);

 these were both. Agabus seems to have been a prophet and not a teacher, 
 and many were teachers who were not prophets; but those here mentioned 
 were at times divinely inspired, and had instructions immediately from 
 heaven upon special occasions, which gave them the title of prophets; 
 and withal they were stated teachers of the church in their religious 
 assemblies, expounded the scriptures, and opened the doctrine of Christ 
 with suitable applications. These were the prophets, and scribes, or 
 teachers, which Christ promised to send 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:34">Matt. xxiii. 34</A>),

 such as were every way qualified for the service of the Christian 
 church. Antioch was a great city, and the Christians there were many, 
 so that they could not all meet in one place; it was therefore 
 requisite they should have many teachers, to preside in their 
 respective assemblies, and to deliver God's mind to them. Barnabas is 
 first named, probably because he was the eldest, and Saul last, 
 probably because he was the youngest; but afterwards the last became 
 first, and Saul more eminent in the church. Three others are
 mentioned. 

 (1.) <I>Simeon,</I> or Simon, who for distinction-sake was called 
 <I>Niger, Simon the Black,</I> from the color of his hair; like him 
 that with us was surnamed the Black Prince.

 (2.) <I>Lucius</I> of Cyrene, who some think (and Dr. Lightfoot
 inclines to it) was the same with this Luke that wrote the Acts, 
 originally a Cyrenian, and educated in the Cyrenian college or 
 synagogue at Jerusalem, and there first receiving the gospel.

 (3.) <I>Manaen,</I> a person of some quality, as it should seem, for he 
 was <I>brought up with Herod the tetrarch,</I> either nursed of the 
 same milk, or bred at the same school, or pupil to the same tutor, or 
 rather one that was his constant colleague and companion--that in every
 part of his education was his comrade and intimate, which gave him a 
 fair prospect of preferment at court, and yet for Christ's sake he 
 quitted all the hopes of it; like Moses, who, <I>when he had come to 
 years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.</I> Had he 
 joined in with Herod, with whom he was brought up, he might have had 
 Blastus's place, and have been his chamberlain; but it is better to be 
 fellow-sufferer with a saint than fellow-persecutor with a
 tetrarch.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How well employed they were 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>They ministered to the Lord, and fasted.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) Diligent faithful teachers do truly minister unto the Lord. Those
 that instruct Christians serve Christ; they really do him honour, and 
 carry on the interest of his kingdom. Those that minister to the
 church in praying and preaching (both which are included here), 
 <I>minister unto the Lord,</I> for they are the church's servants for 
 Christ's sake; to him they must have an eye in their ministrations, and 
 from him they shall have their recompence.

 (2.) Ministering to the Lord, in one way or other, ought to be the 
 stated business of churches and their teachers; to this work time ought 
 to be set apart, nay, it is set apart, and in this work we ought to
 spend some part of every day. What have we to do as Christians and
 ministers but to <I>serve the Lord Christ?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:24,Ro+14:18">Col. iii. 24; Rom. xiv. 18</A>.

 (3.) Religious <I>fasting</I> is of use in our ministering to the Lord,
 both as a sign of our humiliation and a means of our mortification.
 Though it was not so much practised by the disciples of Christ, 
 <I>while the bridegroom was with them,</I> as it was by the disciples 
 of John and of the Pharisees; yet, after the bridegroom was taken away, 
 they abounded in it, as those that had well learned to deny themselves 
 and to endure hardness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The orders given by the Holy Ghost for the setting apart of 
 Barnabas and Saul, while they were engaged in public exercises, the 
 ministers of the several congregations in the city joining in one 
 solemn fast or day of prayer: The <I>Holy Ghost said,</I> either by a 
 voice from heaven, or by a strong impulse on the minds of those of them 
 that were prophets, <I>Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work 
 whereunto I have called them.</I> He does not specify the work, but 
 refers to a former call of which they themselves knew the meaning, 
 whether others did or no: as for Saul, he was particularly told that he 
 must <I>bear Christ's name to the Gentiles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:15"><I>ch.</I> ix. 15</A>),

 that <I>he must be sent to the Gentiles</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:21"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 21</A>);

 the matter was settled between them at Jerusalem before this, that as
 Peter, James, and John laid out themselves among those of the
 circumcision, so Paul and Barnabas should <I>go to the heathen,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:7-9">Gal. ii. 7-9</A>.

 Barnabas, it is likely, knew himself designed for this service as well
 as Paul. Yet they would not thrust themselves into this harvest, though
 it appeared plenteous, till they received their orders from the Lord of
 the harvest: <I>Thrust in thy sickle for the harvest is ripe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:15">Rev. xiv. 15</A>.

 The orders were, <I>Separate me Barnabas and Saul.</I> Observe here,

 1. Christ by his Spirit has the nomination of his ministers; for it is
 by the Spirit of Christ that they are qualified in some measure for his 
 services, inclined to it, and taken off from other cares inconsistent 
 with it. There are some whom the Holy Ghost has separated for the
 service of Christ, has distinguished from others as men that are 
 offered and that willingly offer themselves to the temple service; and 
 concerning them directions are given to those who are competent judges 
 of the sufficiency of the abilities and the sincerity of the 
 inclination: <I>Separate</I> them. 

 2. Christ's ministers are separated to him and to the Holy Ghost:
 <I>Separate them to me;</I> they are to be employed in Christ's work 
 and under the Spirit's guidance, to the glory of God the Father. 

 3. All that are separated to Christ as his ministers are separated to 
 work; Christ keeps no servants to be idle. <I>If any man desires the
 office of a bishop, he desires a good work;</I> that is what he is 
 separated to, <I>to labour in the word and doctrine.</I> They are 
 separated to take pains, not to take state. 

 4. The work of Christ's ministers, to which they are to be separated,
 is work that is already settled, and that which all Christ's ministers 
 hitherto have been called to, and which they themselves have first 
 been, by an external call, directed to and have chosen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Their ordination, pursuant to these orders: not to the ministry in 
 general (Barnabas and Saul had both of them been ministers long before 
 this), but to a particular service in the ministry, which had something 
 peculiar in it, and which required a fresh commission, which commission 
 God saw fit at this time to transmit by the hands of <I>these prophets 
 and teachers,</I> for the giving of this direction to the church, that 
 teachers should ordain teachers (for prophets we are not now any longer 
 to expect), and that those who have the dispensing of the oracles of 
 Christ committed to them should, for the benefit of posterity, 
 <I>commit the same to faithful men, who shall be able also to teach 
 others,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:2">2 Tim. ii. 2</A>.

 So here, Simeon, and Lucius, and Manaen, faithful teachers at this time 
 in the church of Antioch, <I>when they had fasted and prayed, laid 
 their hands on Barnabas and Saul, and sent them away</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 according to the directions received. Observe, 

 1. They prayed for them. When good men are going forth about good
 work, they ought to be solemnly and particularly prayed for, especially 
 by their brethren that are their fellow-labourers and fellow-soldiers.

 2. They joined fasting with their prayers, as they did in their other
 ministrations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Christ has taught us this by his abstaining from sleep (a night-fast, 
 if I may so call it) the night before he sent forth his apostles, that
 he might spend it in prayer. 
 
 3. They laid their hands on them. Hereby,
 
 (1.) They gave them their manumission, dismission, or discharge from 
 the present service they were engaged in, in the church of Antioch, 
 acknowledging that they went off not only fairly and with consent, but 
 honourably and with a good report. 

 (2.) They implored a blessing upon them in their present undertaking, 
 begged that God would be with them, and give them success; and, in 
 order to this, that <I>they might be filled with the Holy Ghost</I> in 
 their work. This very thing is explained

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:26"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 26</A>,

 where it is said, concerning Paul and Barnabas, that from <I>Antioch
 they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they 
 fulfilled.</I> As it was an instance of the humility of Barnabas and 
 Saul that they submitted to the imposition of the hands of those that 
 were their equals, or rather their inferiors; so it was of the good 
 disposition of the other teachers that they did not envy Barnabas and 
 Saul the honour to which they were preferred, but cheerfully committed 
 it to them, with hearty prayers for them; and <I>they sent them 
 away</I> with all expedition, out of a concern for those countries 
 where they were to break up fallow ground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto
 Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
 &nbsp; 5 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God
 in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to <I>their</I>
 minister.
 &nbsp; 6 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they
 found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name
 <I>was</I> Bar-jesus:
 &nbsp; 7 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
 prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to
 hear the word of God.
 &nbsp; 8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by
 interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy
 from the faith.
 &nbsp; 9 Then Saul, (who also <I>is called</I> Paul,) filled with the Holy
 Ghost, set his eyes on him,
 &nbsp; 10 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, <I>thou</I>
 child of the devil, <I>thou</I> enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou
 not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
 &nbsp; 11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord <I>is</I> upon thee, and
 thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And
 immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went
 about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
 &nbsp; 12 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being
 astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
 &nbsp; 13 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came
 to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to
 Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A general account of the coming of Barnabas and Saul to the famous 
 island of Cyprus; and perhaps thitherward they steered their course 
 because Barnabas was a native of that country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:36"><I>ch.</I> iv. 36</A>),

 and he was willing they should have the first-fruits of his labours,
 pursuant to his new commission. Observe, 

 1. Their being sent forth by the Holy Ghost was the great thing that
 encouraged them in this undertaking, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 If the Holy Ghost send them forth, he will go along with them, 
 strengthen them, carry them on in their work, and give them success; 
 and then they fear no colours, but can cheerfully venture upon a stormy 
 sea from Antioch, which was now to them a quiet harbour. 

 2. They came to Seleucia, the sea-port town opposite to Cyprus, thence
 crossed the sea to Cyprus, and in that island the first city they came 
 to was Salamis, a city on the east side of the island

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 and, when they had sown good seed there, <I>thence they</I> went onward 
 <I>through the isle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 till they came to Paphos, which lay on the western coast. 

 3. <I>They preached the word of God</I> wherever they came, <I>in the 
 synagogues of the Jews;</I> so far were they from excluding them that 
 they gave them the preference, and so left those among them who 
 believed not inexcusable; <I>they would have gathered them, but they 
 would not.</I> They did not act clandestinely, nor preach the Messiah 
 to others unknown to them, but laid their doctrine open to the censure 
 of the rulers of their synagogues, who might, if they had any thing to 
 say, object against it. Nor would they have acted separately, but in
 concert with them, if they had not driven them out from them, and from 
 their synagogues. 

 4. <I>They had John for their minister;</I> not their servant in
 common things, but their assistant in the things of God, either to 
 prepare their way in places where they designed to come or to carry on 
 their work in places where they had begun it, or to converse familiarly 
 with those to whom they preached publicly, and explain things to them; 
 and such a one might be many ways of use to them, especially in a 
 strange country.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular account of their encounter with <I>Elymas the 
 sorcerer,</I> whom they met with at Paphos, where the governor resided; 
 a place famous for a temple built to Venus there, thence called 
 <I>Paphian Venus;</I> and therefore there was more than ordinary need 
 that <I>the Son of God</I> should there <I>be manifested to destroy the 
 works of the devil.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There the <I>deputy,</I> a Gentile, <I>Sergius Paulus</I> by name, 
 encouraged the apostles, and was willing to hear their message. He was 
 governor <I>of the country,</I> under the Roman emperor; proconsul or 
 propr&aelig;tor, such a one as we should call <I>lord lieutenant of the
 island.</I> He had the character of <I>a prudent man,</I> an 
 intelligent, considerate man, that was ruled by reason, not passion nor 
 prejudice, which appeared by this, that, having a character of Barnabas 
 and Saul, he sent for them, <I>and desired to hear the word of God.</I> 
 Note, When that which we hear has a tendency to lead us to God, it is 
 prudence to desire to hear more of it. Those are wise people, however 
 they may be ranked among the foolish of this world, who are inquisitive 
 after the mind and will of God. Though he was a great man, and a man in 
 authority, and the preachers of the gospel were men that made no 
 figure, yet, if they have a message from God, let him know what it is, 
 and, if it appear to be so, he is ready to receive it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There Elymas, a Jew, a <I>sorcerer,</I> opposed them, and did all he 
 could to obstruct their progress. This justified the apostles in 
 <I>turning to the Gentiles,</I> that this Jew was so malignant against 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This Elymas was a pretender <I>to the gift of prophecy, a 
 sorcerer, a false-prophet</I>--one that would be taken for a divine,
 because he was skilled in the arts of divination; he was a conjurer, 
 and took on him to tell people their fortune, and to discover things 
 lost, and probably was in league with the devil for this purpose; 
 <I>his name was Bar-jesus--the son of Joshua;</I> it signifies <I>the son
 of salvation;</I> but the Syriac calls him, <I>Bar-shoma--the son of
 pride; filius inflationis--the son of inflation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He was hanging on at court, <I>was with the deputy</I> of the 
 country. It does not appear that the deputy called for him, as he did 
 for Barnabas and Saul; but he thrust himself upon him, aiming, no 
 doubt, to make a hand of him, and get money by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He made it his business to withstand Barnabas and Saul, as the 
 magicians of Egypt, in Pharaoh's court, <I>withstood</I> Moses and 
 Aaron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:8">2 Tim. iii. 8</A>.

 He set up himself to be a messenger from heaven, and denied that they
 were. And <I>thus he sought to turn away the deputy from the faith</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 to keep him from receiving the gospel, which he saw him inclined to do. 
 Note, Satan is in a special manner busy with great men and men of 
 power, to keep them from being religious; because he knows that their 
 example, whether good or bad, will have an influence upon many. And 
 those who are in any way instrumental to prejudice people against the 
 truths and ways of Christ are doing the devil's work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Saul (who is here for the first time called Paul) fell upon him
 for this with a holy indignation. <I>Saul, who is also called Paul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Saul was his name as he was a Hebrew, and of the tribe of Benjamin; 
 Paul was his name as he was a citizen of Rome. Hitherto we have had him 
 mostly conversant among the Jews, and therefore called by his Jewish 
 name; but now, when he is sent forth among the Gentiles, he is called 
 by his Roman name, to put somewhat of a reputation upon him in the 
 Roman cities, Paulus being a very common name among them. But some 
 think he was never called Paul till now that he was instrumental in the 
 conversion of Sergius Paulus to the faith of Christ, and that he took 
 the name Paulus as a memorial of this victory obtained by the gospel of 
 Christ, as among the Romans he that had conquered a country took his 
 denomination from it, as <I>Germanicus, Britannicus, Africanus;</I> or 
 rather, Sergius Paulus himself gave him the name Paulus in token of his 
 favour and respect to him, as Vespasian gave his name Flavius to 
 Josephus the Jew. Now of Paul it is said,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That he was <I>filled with the Holy Ghost</I> upon this occasion, 
 filled with a holy zeal against a professed enemy of Christ, which was 
 one of the graces of the Holy Ghost--<I>a spirit of burning;</I> filled
 with power to denounce the wrath of God against him, which was one of 
 the gifts of the Holy Ghost--<I>a spirit of judgment.</I> He felt a more
 than ordinary fervour in his mind, as the prophet did when he was 
 <I>full of power by the Spirit of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:8">Mic. iii. 8</A>),

 and another prophet when <I>his face was made harder than flint</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:9">Ezek. iii. 9</A>),

 and another when his <I>mouth was made like a sharp sword,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:2">Isa. xlix. 2</A>.

 What Paul said did not come from any personal resentment, but from the 
 strong impressions which the Holy Ghost made upon his spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He <I>set his eyes upon him,</I> to face him down, and to show a 
 holy boldness, in opposition to his wicked impudence. He set his eyes 
 upon him, as an indication that the eye of the heart-searching God was 
 upon him, and saw through and through him; nay, <I>that the face of the 
 Lord was against him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:16">Ps. xxxiv. 16</A>.

 He fixed his eyes upon him, to see if he could discern in his
 countenance any marks of remorse for what he had done; for, if he could 
 have discerned the least sign of this, it would have prevented the 
 ensuing doom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] He gave him his true character, not in passion, but by the Holy 
 Ghost, who knows men better than they know themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He describes him to be, <I>First,</I> An agent for hell; and such there 
 have been upon this earth (the seat of the war between <I>the seed of 
 the woman and of the serpent</I>) ever since Cain <I>who was of that 
 wicked one,</I> an incarnate devil, <I>slew his brother,</I> for no 
 other reason than because <I>his own works were evil and his brother's 
 righteous.</I> This Elymas, though called <I>Bar-jesus--a son of
 Jesus,</I> was really a <I>child of the devil,</I> bore his image, did 
 his lusts, and served his interests,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:44">John viii. 44</A>.

 In two things he resembled the devil as a child does his father--

 1. In craftiness. <I>The serpent was more subtle than any beast of the
 field</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:1">Gen. iii. 1</A>),

 and Elymas, though void of all wisdom, was <I>full of all subtlety,</I> 
 expert in all the arts of deceiving men and imposing upon them. 

 2. In malice. He was <I>full of all mischief</I>--a spiteful
 ill-conditioned man, and a sworn implacable enemy to God and goodness. 
 Note, A fulness of subtlety and mischief together make a man indeed a 
 child of the devil. <I>Secondly,</I> An adversary to heaven. If he be a 
 child of the devil, it follows of course that he is <I>an enemy to all 
 righteousness,</I> for the devil is so. Note, Those that are enemies to 
 the doctrine of Christ are enemies to all righteousness, for in it all 
 righteousness is summed up and fulfilled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] He charged upon him his present crime, and expostulated with him 
 upon it: "<I>Wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the 
 Lord,</I> to misrepresent them, to put false colours upon them, and so 
 to discourage people from entering into them, and walking in them?" 
 Note, <I>First,</I> The ways of the Lord are right: they are all so, 
 they are perfectly so. The ways of the Lord Jesus are right, the only 
 right ways to heaven and happiness. <I>Secondly,</I> There are those 
 who pervert these right ways, who not only wander out of these ways 
 themselves (as Elihu's penitent, who owns, <I>I have perverted that 
 which was right and it profited me not</I>), but mislead others, and 
 suggest to them unjust prejudices against these ways: as if the 
 doctrine of Christ were uncertain and precarious, the laws of Christ 
 unreasonable and impractical, and the service of Christ unpleasant and 
 unprofitable, which is an unjust perverting of the right ways of the 
 Lord, and making them seem crooked ways. <I>Thirdly,</I> Those who
 pervert the right ways of the Lord are commonly so hardened in it that, 
 though the equity of those ways be set before them by the most powerful 
 and commanding evidence, yet they will not cease to do it. <I>Etsi 
 suaseris, non persuaseris--You may advise, but you will never
 persuade;</I> they will have it their own way; <I>they have loved 
 strangers, and after them they will go.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [5.] He denounced the judgment of God upon him, in a present blindness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee,</I> a righteous 
 hand. God is now about to lay hands on thee, and make thee his 
 prisoner, for thou art taken in arms against him; <I>thou shalt be 
 blind, not seeing the sun for a season.</I>" This was designed both for 
 the proof of his crime, as it was a miracle wrought to confirm the 
 right ways of the Lord, and consequently to show the wickedness of him 
 who would not cease to pervert them, as also for the punishment of his 
 crime. It was a suitable punishment; he shut his eyes, the eyes of his 
 mind, against the light of the gospel, and therefore justly were the 
 eyes of his body shut against the light of the sun; he sought to blind 
 the deputy (as an agent for <I>the god of this world, who blindeth the 
 minds of those that believe not, lest the light of the gospel should 
 shine unto them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:4">2 Cor. iv. 4</A>),

 and therefore is himself struck blind. Yet it was a moderate
 punishment: he was only struck blind, when he might most justly have 
 been struck dead; and it was only <I>for a season;</I> if he will 
 repent, and give glory to God, by making confession, his sight shall be 
 restored; nay, it should seem, though he do not, yet his sight shall be 
 restored, to try if he will be led to repentance either by the 
 judgments of God or by his mercies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [6.] This judgment was immediately executed: <I>There fell on him a 
 mist and a darkness,</I> as on the Sodomites when they persecuted 
 Elisha. This silenced him presently, filled him with confusion, and was 
 an effectual confutation of all he said against the doctrine of Christ. 
 Let not him any more pretend to be a guide to the deputy's conscience 
 who is himself struck blind. It was also an earnest to him of a much 
 sorer punishment if he repent not; for he is one of those <I>wandering 
 stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:13">Jude 13</A>.

 Elymas did himself proclaim the truth of the miracle, when <I>he went
 about seeking some to lead him by the hand;</I> and where now is all 
 his skill in sorcery, upon which he had so much valued himself, when he 
 can neither find his way nor find a friend that will be so kind as to 
 lead him!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Notwithstanding all the endeavours of Elymas <I>to turn away the 
 deputy from the faith,</I> he was brought to believe, and this miracle, 
 wrought upon the magician himself (like <I>the boils of Egypt,</I> 
 which <I>were upon the magicians, so that they could not stand before 
 Moses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:11">Exod. ix. 11</A>),

 contributed to it. The deputy was a very sensible man, and observed 
 something uncommon, and which intimated its divine original,

 (1.) In Paul's preaching: he was <I>astonished at the doctrine of the
 Lord,</I> the Lord Christ--the doctrine that <I>is from him,</I> the
 discoveries he has made of the Father--the doctrine that <I>is
 concerning him,</I> his person, natures, offices, undertaking. Note,
 The doctrine of Christ has a great deal in it that is astonishing; and 
 the more we know of it the more reason we shall see to wonder and stand 
 amazed at it. 

 (2.) In this miracle: <I>When he saw what was done,</I> and how much 
 Paul's power transcended that of the magician, and how plainly Elymas 
 was baffled and confounded, he believed. It is not said that he was 
 baptized, and so made a complete convert, but it is probable that he 
 was. Paul would not do his business by the halves; <I>as for God, his 
 work is perfect.</I> When he became a Christian, he neither laid down 
 his government, nor was turned out of it, but we may suppose, as a 
 Christian magistrate, by his influence helped very much to propagate 
 Christianity in that island. The tradition of the Romish church, which 
 has taken care to find bishoprics for all the eminent converts we read 
 of in <I>the Acts,</I> has made this Sergius Paulus bishop of Narbon in 
 France, left there by Paul in his journey to Spain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Their departure from the island of Cyprus. It is probable that 
 they did a great deal more there than is recorded, where an account is 
 given only of that which was extraordinary--the conversion of the
 deputy. When they had done what they had to do, 

 1. They quitted the country, and <I>went to Perga.</I> Those that went 
 were <I>Paul and his company,</I> which, it is probable, was increased 
 in Cyprus, many being desirous to accompany him. <B><I>Anachthentes
 hoi peri ton Paulon</I></B>--<I>Those that were about Paul loosed from
 Paphos,</I> which supposes that he went too; but such an affection had 
 his new friends for him that they were always about him, and by their 
 good will would be never from him. 

 2. Then John <I>Mark quitted them, and returned to Jerusalem,</I>
 without the consent of Paul and Barnabas; either he did not like the 
 work, or he wanted to go and see his mother. It was his fault, and we
 shall hear of it again.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
 Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat
 down.
 &nbsp; 15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers
 of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, <I>Ye</I> men <I>and</I> brethren,
 if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
 &nbsp; 16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with <I>his</I> hand said, Men
 of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.
 &nbsp; 17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and
 exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of
 Egypt, and with a high arm brought he them out of it.
 &nbsp; 18 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners
 in the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of
 Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.
 &nbsp; 20 And after that he gave <I>unto them</I> judges about the space of
 four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
 &nbsp; 21 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them
 Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space
 of forty years.
 &nbsp; 22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to
 be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have
 found David the <I>son</I> of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which
 shall fulfil all my will.
 &nbsp; 23 Of this man's seed hath God according to <I>his</I> promise
 raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:
 &nbsp; 24 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism
 of repentance to all the people of Israel.
 &nbsp; 25 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye
 that I am? I am not <I>he.</I> But, behold, there cometh one after me,
 whose shoes of <I>his</I> feet I am not worthy to loose.
 &nbsp; 26 Men <I>and</I> brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and
 whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this
 salvation sent.
 &nbsp; 27 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because
 they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are
 read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled <I>them</I> in condemning
 <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 28 And though they found no cause of death <I>in him,</I> yet
 desired they Pilate that he should be slain.
 &nbsp; 29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him,
 they took <I>him</I> down from the tree, and laid <I>him</I> in a
 sepulchre.
 &nbsp; 30 But God raised him from the dead:
 &nbsp; 31 And he was seen many days of them which came up with him
 from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.
 &nbsp; 32 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise
 which was made unto the fathers,
 &nbsp; 33 God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that
 he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the
 second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
 &nbsp; 34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, <I>now</I>
 no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will
 give you the sure mercies of David.
 &nbsp; 35 Wherefore he saith also in another <I>psalm,</I> Thou shalt not
 suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
 &nbsp; 36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the
 will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and
 saw corruption:
 &nbsp; 37 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.
 &nbsp; 38 Be it known unto you therefore, men <I>and</I> brethren, that
 through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:
 &nbsp; 39 And by him all that believe are justified from all things,
 from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
 &nbsp; 40 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken
 of in the prophets;
 &nbsp; 41 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a
 work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe,
 though a man declare it unto you.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Perga in Pamphylia was a noted place, especially for a temple there 
 erected to the goddess Diana, yet nothing at all is related of what 
 Paul and Barnabas did there, only that <I>thither they came</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 and <I>thence they departed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 But the history of the apostles' travels, as that of Christ's, passes 
 by many things worthy to have been recorded, because, <I>if all had 
 been written, the world could not have contained the books.</I> But the 
 next place we find them in is another Antioch, said to be in Pisidia, 
 to distinguish it from that Antioch in Syria from which they were sent 
 out. Pisidia was a province of the Lesser Asia, bordering upon 
 Pamphylia; this Antioch, it is likely, was the metropolis of it. 
 Abundance of Jews lived there, and to them <I>the gospel was to be 
 first preached;</I> and Paul's sermon to them is what we have in these 
 verses, which, it is likely, is the substance of what was preached by 
 the apostles generally to the Jews in all places; for in dealing with 
 them the proper way was to show them how the New Testament, which they 
 would have them to receive, exactly agreed with the Old Testament, 
 which they not only received, but were zealous for. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The appearance which Paul and Barnabas made in a religious assembly 
 of the Jews at Antioch, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Though they had lately had such good success with a Roman deputy, yet,
 <I>when they came to Antioch,</I> they did not enquire for the chief 
 magistrate, nor make their court to him, but they applied to the Jews, 
 which is a further proof of their good affection to them and their 
 desire of their welfare. 

 1. They observed their time of worship, <I>on the sabbath day,</I> the 
 Jewish sabbath. <I>The first day of the week</I> they observed among 
 themselves as a Christian sabbath; but, if they will meet the Jews, it 
 must be on the seventh-day sabbath, which therefore, upon such 
 occasions, they did as yet sometimes observe. For, though it was by the 
 death of Christ that the ceremonial law died, yet it was in the ruins 
 of Jerusalem that it was to be buried; and therefore, though the 
 morality of the fourth commandment was entirely transferred to the 
 Christian sabbath, yet it was not incongruous to join with the Jews in 
 their sabbath sanctification. 

 2. They met them in their place of worship, <I>in the synagogue.</I>
 Note, Sabbath days should be kept holy in solemn assemblies; they are 
 instituted chiefly for public worship. <I>The sabbath day is a holy 
 convocation,</I> and for that reason <I>no servile work must be done 
 therein.</I> Paul and Barnabas were strangers; but, wherever we come, 
 we must enquire out God's faithful worshippers, and join with them (as 
 these apostles here did), as those that desire to keep up a communion 
 with all saints; though they were strangers, yet they were admitted 
 into the synagogue, and to sit down there. Care should be taken in 
 places of public worship that strangers be accommodated, even the 
 poorest; for, of those of whom we know nothing else, we know this, that 
 they have precious souls, for which our charity binds us to be 
 concerned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The invitation given them to preach. 

 1. The usual service of the synagogue was performed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>The law and the prophets were read,</I> a portion of each, the 
 lessons for the day. Note, When we come together to worship God, we 
 must do it not only by prayer and praise, but by the reading and 
 hearing of the word of God; hereby we <I>give him the glory due to his 
 name,</I> as our Lord and Lawgiver. 

 2. When that was done, they were asked by <I>the rulers of the
 synagogue</I> to give them a sermon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 They sent a messenger to them with the respectful message, <I>Men and 
 brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say 
 on.</I> It is probable that the rulers of the synagogue had met with 
 them, and been in private conversation with them before; and, if they 
 had not an affection to the gospel, yet they had at least the curiosity 
 to hear Paul preach; and therefore not only gave him permission, but 
 begged the favour of him that he would speak a <I>word of exhortation 
 to the people.</I> Note, 

 (1.) The bare reading of the scriptures in the public assemblies is not 
 sufficient, but they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out 
 of them. This is spreading the net, and assisting people in doing that 
 which is necessary to the making of the word profitable to them--that
 is, the applying of it to themselves. 

 (2.) Those that preside, and have power, in public assemblies, should 
 provide for a word of exhortation to the people, whenever they come 
 together. 

 (3.) Sometimes a word of exhortation from a strange minister may be of 
 great use to the people, provided he be well approved. It is likely 
 Paul did <I>often preach in the synagogue,</I> when he was not thus 
 invited to it by the rulers of the synagogues; for he often preached 
 <I>with much contention,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:2">1 Thess. ii. 2</A>.

 But these were more noble, more generous, than the rulers of the
 synagogues generally were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The sermon Paul preached in the synagogue of the Jews, at the 
 invitation of the rulers of the synagogue. He gladly embraced the 
 opportunity given him to preach Christ to his countrymen the Jews. He 
 did not object to them that he was a stranger, and that it was none of 
 his business; nor object to himself, that he might get ill-will by 
 preaching Christ among the Jews; but <I>stood up,</I> as one prepared 
 and determined to speak, <I>and beckoned with his hand,</I> to excite 
 and prepare them to hear. He waved his hand as an orator, not only
 desiring silence and attention, but endeavouring to move affection, and 
 to show himself in earnest. Perhaps, upon the moving of them <I>to give 
 an exhortation to the people,</I> there were those in the synagogue 
 that were ready to mutiny against the rulers, and opposed the 
 toleration of Paul's preaching, and that occasioned some tumult and 
 commotion, which Paul endeavoured to quiet by that decent motion of his 
 hand; as also by his modest desire of a patient impartial hearing: 
 "<I>Men of Israel,</I> that are <I>Jews</I> by birth, <I>and you that 
 fear God,</I> that are proselyted to the Jewish religion, <I>give 
 audience;</I> let me beg your attention a little, for I have something 
 to say to you which concerns your everlasting peace, and would not say 
 it in vain." Now this excellent sermon is recorded, to show that those 
 who preached the gospel to the Gentiles did it not till they had first 
 used their utmost endeavours with the Jews, to persuade them to come in
 and take the benefit of it; and that they had no prejudice at all 
 against the Jewish nation, nor any desire <I>that they should perish, 
 but rather that they should turn and live.</I> Every thing is touched 
 in this sermon that might be proper either to convince the judgment or 
 insinuate into the affections of the Jews, to prevail with them to 
 receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He owns them to be God's favourite people, whom he had taken into 
 special relation to himself, and for whom he had done great things. 
 Probably <I>the Jews of the dispersion,</I> that lived in other 
 countries, being more in danger of mingling with the nations, were more 
 jealous of their peculiarity than those that lived in their own land 
 were; and therefore Paul is here very careful to take notice of it, to 
 their honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That <I>the God of the whole earth</I> was, in a particular 
 manner, <I>the God of this people Israel,</I> a God <I>in covenant with 
 them,</I> and that he had given them a revelation of his mind and will, 
 such as he <I>had not given to any other nation or people;</I> so that 
 hereby they were distinguished from, and dignified above, all their 
 neighbours, having peculiar precepts to be governed by, and peculiar 
 promises to depend upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That he had <I>chosen their fathers</I> to be his friends: Abraham 
 was called <I>the friend of God;</I> to be his prophets, by whom he 
 would reveal his mind to his church, and to be the trustees of his 
 covenant with the church. He puts them in mind of this, to let them 
 know that the reason why God favoured them, though undeserving, and ill 
 deserving, was because he would adhere to the choice he had made of 
 <I>their fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7,8">Deut. vii. 7, 8</A>.

 <I>They were beloved</I> purely <I>for the fathers' sakes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:28">Rom. xi. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That he had <I>exalted that people,</I> and put a great deal of 
 honour upon them, had advanced them into a people, and raised them from 
 nothing, <I>when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt,</I> and 
 had nothing in them to recommend them to the divine favour. They ought 
 to remember this, and to infer hence that God was no debtor to them; 
 for it was <I>ex mero motu--out of his mere good pleasure,</I> and not
 upon a valuable consideration, that they had the grant of the divine 
 favour; and therefore it was revocable at pleasure; and God did them no 
 wrong if he at length plucked up the hedge of their peculiarity. But 
 they were debtors to him, and obliged to receive such further 
 discoveries as he should make to his church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That he had <I>with a high hand brought them out of Egypt,</I> 
 where they were not only strangers, but captives, had delivered them at 
 the expense of a great many miracles, both of mercy to them and 
 judgment on their oppressors (<I>signs and wonders,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:34">Deut. iv. 34</A>),

 and at the expense of a great many lives, <I>all the first-born of 
 Egypt, Pharaoh, and all his host, in the Red Sea; I gave Egypt for thy 
 ransom, gave men for thee.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:3,4">Isa. xliii. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) That <I>he had suffered their manners forty years in the 
 wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,

 <B><I>Etropophoresen.</I></B> Some think it should be read, 
 <B><I>etrophophoresen</I></B>--<I>he educated them,</I> because this is
 the word the Septuagint use concerning the fatherly care God took of 
 that people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:31">Deut. i. 31</A>.
 
 Both may be included; for,
 
 [1.] God made a great deal of provision for them for forty years in the
 wilderness: miracles were their daily bread, and kept them from 
 starving: <I>They lacked not any thing.</I> 

 [2.] He exercised a great deal of patience with them. They were a 
 provoking, murmuring, unbelieving people; and yet he bore with them, 
 did not deal with them as they deserved, but suffered his anger many a 
 time to be turned away by the prayer and intercession of Moses. So many 
 years as we have each of us lived in this world, we must own that God 
 has thus been as a tender father to us, has supplied our wants, has 
 <I>fed us all our life long unto this day,</I> has been indulgent to 
 us, a God of pardons (as he was to Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:17">Neh. ix. 17</A>),

 and <I>not extreme to mark what we have done amiss;</I> we have tried 
 his patience, and yet not tired it. Let not the Jews insist too much 
 upon the privileges of their peculiarity, for they have forfeited them 
 a thousand times.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) That he had put them in possession of the land of Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan,</I> that 
 were doomed to be rooted out to make room for them, <I>he divided their 
 land to them by lot,</I> and put them in possession of it. This was a 
 signal favour of God to them, and he owns that hereby a great honour 
 was put upon them, from which he would not in the least derogate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) That he had raised up men, inspirited from heaven, to deliver them
 out of the hands of those that invaded their rights, and oppressed them 
 after their settlement in Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 [1.] He <I>gave them judges,</I> men qualified for public service, and, 
 by an immediate impulse upon their spirits, called to it, <I>pro re 
 nata--as the occasion required.</I> Though they were a provoking
 people, and were never in servitude but their sin brought them to it, 
 yet upon their petition a deliverer was raised up. The critics find 
 some difficulty in computing <I>these four hundred and fifty years.</I> 
 From the <I>deliverance out of Egypt</I> to David's expulsion of <I>the 
 Jebusites from the stronghold of Zion,</I> which completed the casting 
 out of the heathen nations, <I>was four hundred and fifty years;</I> 
 and most of that time they were under judges. Others thus: The 
 government of the judges, from the death of Joshua to the death of Eli, 
 was just <I>three hundred and thirty-nine years,</I> but it is said to 
 be [<B><I>os</I></B>] as it were <I>four hundred and fifty years,</I> 
 because the years of their servitude to the several nations that 
 oppressed them, though really they were included in the years of the 
 judges, are yet mentioned in the history as if they had been distinct 
 from them. Now these, all put together, make <I>one hundred and eleven 
 years,</I> which added to the <I>three hundred and thirty nine,</I> 
 make them <I>four hundred and fifty;</I> as so many, though not really 
 so many. 

 [2.] He governed them by a <I>prophet, Samuel,</I> a man divinely 
 inspired to preside in their affairs. 

 [3.] He <I>afterwards</I> at their request <I>set a king over them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 <I>Saul, the son of Cis.</I> Samuel's government and his lasted 
 <I>forty years,</I> which was a kind of transition from the theocracy 
 to the kingly government. 
 
 [4.] At last, he made David their king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 <I>When God had removed Saul,</I> for his mal-administration, <I>he
 raised up unto them David to be their king,</I> and made <I>a covenant 
 of royalty with him, and with his seed.</I> When he had removed one 
 king, he did not leave them as sheep without a shepherd, but soon 
 raised up another, raised him up from a mean and low estate, <I>raised 
 him up on high,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:1">2 Sam. xxiii. 1</A>.

 He quotes the testimony God gave concerning him, <I>First,</I> That his
 choice was divine: <I>I have found David,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:20">Ps. lxxxix. 20</A>.

 God himself pitched upon him. Finding implies seeking; as if God had
 ransacked all the families of Israel to find a man fit for his purpose, 
 and this was he. <I>Secondly,</I> That his character was divine: <I>A 
 man after my own heart,</I> such a one as I would have, one on whom the 
 image of God is stamped, and therefore one in whom God is well pleased 
 and whom he approves. This character was given of him before he was 
 first anointed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:14">1 Sam. xiii. 14</A>.

 <I>The Lord hath sought out a man after his own heart,</I> such a one
 as he would have. <I>Thirdly,</I> That his conduct was divine, and 
 under divine direction: <I>He shall fulfil all my will.</I> He shall 
 desire and endeavour to do the will of God, and shall be enabled to do 
 it, and employed in the doing of it, and go through with it. Now all 
 this seems to show not only the special favour of God to the people of 
 Israel (with the acknowledgment of which the apostle is very willing to 
 oblige them) but the further favours of another nature which he 
 designed them, and which were now, by the preaching of the gospel, 
 offered to them. Their deliverance out of Egypt, and settlement in
 Canaan, <I>were types and figures of good things to come.</I> The 
 changes of their government showed that it <I>made nothing perfect,</I> 
 and therefore must give way to the spiritual kingdom of the Messiah, 
 which was now in the setting up, and which, if they would admit it and 
 submit to it, would be <I>the glory of their people Israel;</I> and 
 therefore they needed not conceive any jealousy at all of the preaching 
 of the gospel, as if it tended in the least to damage the true 
 excellences of the Jewish church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives them a full account of our Lord Jesus, passing from David 
 to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Of this man's seed,</I> from that <I>root of Jesse,</I> from that 
 <I>man after God's own heart, hath God, according to his promise, 
 raised unto Israel a Saviour--Jesus,</I> who carries salvation in his
 name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How welcome should the preaching of the gospel of Christ be to the 
 Jews, and how should they embrace it, as <I>well worthy of all 
 acceptation,</I> when it brought them the tidings, 

 [1.] Of a Saviour, to deliver <I>them out of the hands of their 
 enemies,</I> as the judges of old, who were therefore called 
 <I>saviours;</I> but this <I>a Saviour</I> to do that for them which, 
 it appears by the history, those could not do--<I>to save them from
 their sins,</I> their worst enemies.

 [2.] A Saviour of God's raising up, that has his commission from 
 heaven. 

 [3.] Raised up <I>to be a Saviour unto Israel,</I> to them in the first 
 place: <I>He was sent to bless them;</I> so far was the gospel from 
 designing the gathering of them. 

 [4.] Raised up <I>of the seed of David,</I> that ancient royal family, 
 which the people of Israel gloried so much in, and which at this time, 
 to the great disgrace of the whole nation, was buried in obscurity. It 
 ought to be a great satisfaction to them <I>that God had raised up this 
 horn of salvation for them in the house of his servant David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:69">Luke i. 69</A>.

 [5.] Raised up <I>according to his promise,</I> the promise to David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:11">Ps. cxxxii. 11</A>),

 the promise to the Old-Testament church in the latter times of it: <I>I 
 will raise unto David a righteous branch,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:5">Jer. xxiii. 5</A>.

 This promise was it <I>to which the twelve tribes hoped to come</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:7"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 7</A>);

 why then should they entertain it so coldly, now that it was brought to
 them? Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Concerning this Jesus, he tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That John the Baptist was his harbinger and forerunner, that great 
 man whom all acknowledged to be a prophet. Let them not say that the 
 Messiah's coming was a surprise upon them, and that this might excuse 
 them if they took time to consider whether they should entertain him or 
 no; for they had sufficient warning by John, who <I>preached before his 
 coming,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Two things he did--<I>First,</I> He made way for his entrance, by
 preaching <I>the baptism of repentance,</I> not to a few select 
 disciples, but <I>to all the people of Israel.</I> He showed them their 
 sins, <I>warned them of the wrath to come, called them to 
 repentance,</I> and <I>to bring forth fruits meet for repentance,</I> 
 and bound those to this who were willing to be bound by the solemn rite 
 or sign of baptism; and by this he <I>made ready a people prepared for 
 the Lord Jesus,</I> to whom his grace would be acceptable when they 
 were thus brought to know themselves. <I>Secondly,</I> He gave notice 
 of his approach

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>As he fulfilled his course,</I> when he was going on vigorously in 
 his work, and had had wonderful success in it, and an established 
 interest: "Now," saith he to those that attended his ministry, "<I>Whom 
 think you that I am?</I> What notions have you of me, what expectations 
 from me? You may be thinking that I am <I>the Messiah,</I> whom you 
 expect; but you are mistaken, <I>I am not he</I> (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:20">John i. 20</A>),

 but he is at the door; <I>behold, there cometh one</I> immediately 
 <I>after me,</I> who will so far exceed me upon all accounts, <I>that I 
 am not worthy</I> to be employed in the meanest office about him, no, 
 not to help him on and off with his shoes--<I>whose shoes of his feet I
 am not worthy to loose,</I> and you may guess who that must be."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That the rulers and people of the Jews, who should have welcomed 
 him, and been his willing, forward, faithful subjects, were his 
 persecutors and murderers. When the apostles preach Christ as <I>the 
 Saviour,</I> they are so far from concealing his ignominious death, and 
 drawing a veil over it, that they always <I>preach Christ 
 crucified,</I> yea, and (though this added much to the reproach of his 
 sufferings) crucified by his own people, by <I>those that dwelt in 
 Jerusalem,</I> the holy city--the royal city, and <I>their rulers,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 <I>First,</I> Their sin was <I>that though they found no cause of death 
 in him,</I> could not prove him, no, nor had any colour to suspect him, 
 guilty of any crime (the judge himself that tried him, when he had 
 heard all they could say against him, declared he <I>found no fault 
 with him), yet they desired Pilate that he might be slain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 and presented their address against Christ with such fury and outrage
 that they compelled Pilate to crucify him, not only contrary to his 
 inclination, but contrary to his conscience; they condemned him <I>to 
 so great a death,</I> though they could not convict him of the least 
 sin. Paul cannot charge this upon his hearers, as Peter did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23"><I>ch.</I> ii. 23</A>):

 <I>You have with wicked hands crucified and slain him;</I> for these,
 though Jews, were far enough off; but he charges it upon the Jews at 
 Jerusalem and the rulers, to show what little reason those Jews of the 
 dispersion had to be so jealous for the honour of their nation as they 
 were, when it had brought upon itself such a load and stain of guilt as 
 this, and how justly they might have been cut off from all benefit by 
 the Messiah, who had thus abused him, and yet they were not; but, 
 notwithstanding all this, the preaching of this gospel shall begin at 
 Jerusalem. <I>Secondly,</I> The reason of this was because <I>they knew 
 him not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 They knew not who he was, nor what errand he came into the world upon; 
 for, <I>if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of 
 glory.</I> Christ owned this in extenuation of their crime: <I>They 
 know not what they do;</I> and so did Peter: <I>I wot that through 
 ignorance you did this,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:17"><I>ch.</I> iii. 17</A>.

 It was also because they knew not the voice of the prophets though they
 heard them read every sabbath day. They did not understand nor consider 
 that it was foretold that the Messiah should suffer, or else they would 
 never have been the instruments of his suffering. Note, Many that read 
 the prophets do not know the voice of the prophets, do not understand 
 the meaning of the scriptures; they have the sound of the gospel in 
 their ears, but not the sense of it in their heads, nor the savour of 
 it in their hearts. And <I>therefore</I> men do not know Christ, nor 
 know how to carry it towards him, because they do not know the voice of 
 the prophets, who <I>testified beforehand concerning Christ. 
 Thirdly,</I> God overruled them, for the accomplishment of the 
 prophecies of the Old-Testament: <I>Because they knew not the voice of 
 the prophets,</I> which warned them not to touch God's Anointed, 
 <I>they fulfilled them in condemning him;</I> for so it was written 
 that <I>Messiah the prince shall be cut off, but not for himself.</I> 
 Note, It is possible that men may be fulfilling scripture prophecies, 
 even when they are breaking scripture precepts, particularly in the 
 persecution of the church, as in the persecution of Christ. And this 
 justifies the reason which is sometimes given for the obscurity of 
 scripture prophecies, that, if they were too plain and obvious, the 
 accomplishment of them would thereby be prevented. So Paul saith here, 
 <I>Because they knew not the voice of the prophets,</I> therefore 
 <I>they have fulfilled them,</I> which implies that if they had 
 understood them they would not have fulfilled them. <I>Fourthly,</I> 
 All that was foretold concerning the sufferings of the Messiah was 
 fulfilled in Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>When they had fulfilled all</I> the rest <I>that was written of 
 him,</I> even to the giving of him vinegar to drink in his thirst, then 
 they fulfilled what was foretold concerning his being buried. They 
 <I>took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.</I> This 
 is taken notice of here as that which made his resurrection the more 
 illustrious. Christ was separated from this world, as those that are 
 buried have nothing more to do with this world, nor this world with 
 them; and therefore our complete separation from sin is represented by 
 our being <I>buried with Christ.</I> And a good Christian will be 
 willing to be buried alive with Christ. They laid him in a sepulchre, 
 and thought they had him fast.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] That he <I>rose again from the dead,</I> and saw no corruption. 
 This was the great truth that was to be preached; for it is the main 
 pillar, by which the whole fabric of the gospel is supported, and 
 therefore he insists largely upon this, and shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> That he rose by consent. When he was imprisoned in the 
 grave for our debt, he did not break prison, but had a fair and legal 
 discharge from the arrest he was under 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>God raised him from the dead,</I> sent an angel on purpose to roll 
 away the stone from the prison-door, returned to him the spirit which 
 at his death he had committed into the hands of his Father, and 
 quickened him by the Holy Ghost. His enemies laid him in a sepulchre, 
 with design he should always lay there; but God said, <I>No;</I> and it 
 was soon seen whose purpose should stand, his or theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> That there was sufficient proof of his having risen 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>He was seen many days,</I> in divers places, upon divers occasions, 
 by those that were most intimately acquainted with him; for they 
 <I>came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem,</I> were his constant 
 attendants, and <I>they are his witnesses unto the people.</I> They 
 were appointed to be so, have attested the thing many a time, and are 
 ready to attest it, though they were to die for the same. Paul says 
 nothing of his own seeing him, which was more convincing to himself 
 than it could be when produced to others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> That the resurrection of Christ was the performance of 
 the promise made to the patriarchs; it was not only true news, but good
 news: "In declaring this, we <I>declare unto you glad tidings</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>),

 which should be in a particular manner acceptable to you Jews. So far
 are we from designing to put any slur upon you, or do you any wrong, 
 that the doctrine we preach, if you receive it aright, and understand 
 it, brings you the greatest honour and satisfaction imaginable; for it 
 is in the resurrection of Christ that <I>the promise which was made to 
 your fathers is fulfilled to you.</I>" He acknowledges it to be the 
 dignity of the Jewish nation that <I>to them pertained the promises</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Rom. ix. 4</A>),

 that they were the heirs of the promise, as they were the children of 
 the patriarchs to whom the promises were first made. The great promise 
 of the Old Testament was that of the Messiah, <I>in whom all the 
 families of the earth should be blessed,</I> and not the family of 
 Abraham only; though it was to be the peculiar honour of that family 
 that he should be raised up of it, yet it was to be the common benefit 
 of all families that he should be raised up to them. Note, 

 1. God hath <I>raised up Jesus,</I> advanced him, and exalted him; 
 <I>raised</I> him <I>again</I> (so we read it), meaning <I>from the 
 dead.</I> We may take in both senses. God raised up Jesus to be a 
 prophet at his baptism, to be a priest to make atonement at his death, 
 and to be a king to rule over all at his ascension; and <I>his raising 
 him up from the dead</I> was the confirmation and ratification of all 
 these commissions, and proved him raised of God to these offices. 

 2. This is the fulfilling of the promises made to the fathers, the
 promise of sending the Messiah, and of all those benefits and blessings 
 which were to be had with him and by him: "This is he that should come, 
 and in him you have all that God promised in the Messiah, though not 
 all that you promised yourselves." Paul puts himself into the number of 
 the Jews to whom the promise was fulfilled: <I>To us their 
 children.</I> Now, if those who preached the gospel brought them 
 <I>these glad tidings,</I> instead of looking upon them as enemies to 
 their nation, they ought to caress them as their best friends, and 
 embrace their doctrine with both arms; for if they valued the promise 
 so much, and themselves by it, much more the performance. And the
 preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, which was the great thing that 
 the Jews found themselves aggrieved at, was so far from infringing the 
 promise made to them that the promise itself, that <I>all the families 
 of the earth</I> should be blessed in the Messiah, could not otherwise 
 be accomplished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> That the resurrection of Christ was the great proof of 
 his being the Son of God, and confirms what was written in the second 
 Psalm (thus ancient was the order in which the Psalms are now placed), 
 <I>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</I> That the 
 resurrection of Christ from the dead was designed to evidence and 
 evince this is plain from that of the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:4">Rom. i. 4</A>):

 <I>He was declared to be the Son of God with power, by the resurrection 
 from the dead.</I> When he was first raised up out of obscurity, God 
 declared concerning him by a voice from heaven, <I>This is my beloved 
 Son</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:17">Matt. iii. 17</A>),

 which has a plain reference to that in the second Psalm, <I>Thou art my 
 Son.</I> Abundance of truth there is couched in those words: that this 
 Jesus was <I>begotten of the Father before all worlds</I>--was <I>the
 brightness of his glory and the express image of his person,</I> as the 
 son is of the father's--that he was the <B><I>logos,</I></B> the
 <I>eternal thought of the eternal mind,</I>--that he was conceived by
 the power of the Holy Ghost in the womb of the virgin; for upon this 
 account, also, <I>that holy thing was called the Son of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:35">Luke i. 35</A>),

 that he was God's agent in creating and governing the world, and in 
 redeeming it and reconciling it to himself, and <I>faithful as a son in 
 his own house,</I> and as such was <I>heir of all things.</I> Now all 
 this, which was declared at Christ's baptism and again at his 
 transfiguration, was undeniably proved by his resurrection. The decree 
 which was so long before declared was then confirmed; and the reason 
 why it was impossible he should be held by the bands of death was 
 because he was the Son of God, and consequently had <I>life in 
 himself,</I> which he could not lay down but with a design to resume 
 it. When his eternal generation is spoken of, it is not improper to 
 say, <I>This day have I begotten thee;</I> for <I>from everlasting to 
 everlasting</I> is with God as it were one and the same eternal day.
 Yet it may also be accommodated to his resurrection, in a subordinate 
 sense, "This day have I made it to appear that I have begotten thee, 
 and this day have I begotten all that are given to thee;" for it is 
 said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:3">1 Pet. i. 3</A>)

 that <I>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</I> as our God and 
 Father, <I>hath begotten us again to a lively hope, by the resurrection 
 of Jesus Christ from the dead.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fifthly,</I> That his being raised the third day, so as not to see
 corruption, and to a heavenly life, so as no more to return to 
 corruption, that is, to the state of the dead, as others did who were 
 raised to life, further confirms his being the Messiah promised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> He rose to die no more; so it is expressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:9">Rom. vi. 9</A>:

 <I>As concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to 
 return to corruption,</I> that is, to the grave, which is called 
 <I>corruption,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:14">Job xvii. 14</A>.

 Lazarus came out of the grave with his grave-clothes on, because he was
 to use them again; but Christ, having no more occasion for them, left 
 them behind. Now this was the fulfilling of that scripture

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:3">Isa. lv. 3</A>),

 <I>I will give you the sure mercies of David;</I> <B><I>ta hosia Dabid
 ta pista</I></B>--<I>the holy things of David, the faithful things;</I>
 for in the promise made to David, and in him to Christ, great stress is 
 laid upon the faithfulness of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:1,2,5,24,33">Ps. lxxxix. 1, 2, 5, 24, 33</A>),
 
 and upon the oath God had sworn <I>by his holiness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:35">Ps. lxxxix. 35</A>.

 Now this makes them sure mercies indeed that he who is entrusted with 
 the dispensing of them has risen to die no more; so that he ever lives 
 to see his own will executed, and the blessings he hath purchased for 
 us given out to us. As, if Christ had died and had not risen again, so 
 if he had risen to die again, we had come short of the sure mercies, or 
 at least could not have been sure of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> He rose so soon after he was dead that his body did not see 
 corruption; for it is not till the third day that the body begins to 
 change. Now this was promised to David; it was one of <I>the sure 
 mercies of David,</I> for it was said to him in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:10">Ps. xvi. 10</A>,

 <I>Neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 God had promised to David that he would raise up the Messiah of his
 seed, who should therefore be a man, but should not, like other men, 
 see corruption. This promise could not have its accomplishment in 
 David, but looked forward to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) It could not be accomplished in David himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 for <I>David, after he had served his own generation, by the will of 
 God,</I> who raised him up to be what he was, <I>fell asleep, and was 
 laid to his fathers, and saw corruption.</I> Here we have a short 
 account of the life, death, and burial, of the patriarch David, and his 
 continuance under the power of death. 

 [<I>a.</I>] His life: <I>He served his own generation, by the will of 
 God,</I> before he slept the sleep of death. David was a useful good 
 man; he did good in the world <I>by the will of God.</I> He made God's 
 precepts his rule; he <I>served his own generation</I> so as therein to 
 serve God; he so <I>served</I> and <I>pleased men (as whatever the king 
 did pleased the people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:36">2 Sam. iii. 36</A>),
 
 as still to keep himself the faithful servant of God. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:10">Gal. i. 10</A>.

 He served the good of men, but did not serve the will of men. Or, by 
 the will of God's providence so ordering it, qualifying him for, and 
 calling him to, a public station, he <I>served his own generation;</I> 
 for every creature is that to us which God makes it to be. David was a 
 great blessing to the age wherein he lived; he was the <I>servant</I> 
 of his generation: many are the curse, and plague, and burden of their 
 generation. Even those that are in a lower and narrower sphere must 
 look upon it that they live to <I>serve their generation;</I> and those 
 that will do good in the world must make themselves <I>servants of 
 all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:19">1 Cor. ix. 19</A>.

 We were not born for ourselves, but are members of communities, to
 which we must study to be serviceable. Yet here is the difference 
 between David and Christ, that David was to serve only his own 
 generation, that generation in which he lived, and therefore when he 
 had done what he had to do, and written what he had to write, he died, 
 and continued in the grave; but Christ (not by his writings or words 
 upon record only as David, but by his personal agency) was to serve 
 <I>all</I> generations, must ever live to reign over the house of 
 Jacob, not as David, for forty years, but for all ages, as long as the 
 sun and moon endure,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:29,36,37">Ps. lxxxix. 29, 36, 37</A>.

 His throne must be as the days of heaven, and all generations must be
 blessed in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:17">Ps. lxxii. 17</A>.

 [<I>b.</I>] His death: <I>He fell asleep.</I> Death is a sleep, a quiet 
 rest, to those who, while they lived, laboured in the service of God 
 and their generation. Observe, He did not fall asleep till he had 
 served his generation, till he had done the work for which God raised 
 him up. God's servants have their work assigned them; and, when they 
 have <I>accomplished as a hireling their day,</I> then, and not till 
 then, they are called to rest. God's witnesses never die till they have 
 finished their testimony; and then <I>the sleep,</I> the death, <I>of 
 the labouring man will be sweet.</I> David was not permitted to build 
 the temple, and therefore when he had made preparation for it, which 
 was the service he was designed to, he fell asleep, and left the work 
 to Solomon. 

 [<I>c.</I>] His burial: <I>He was laid to his fathers.</I> Though he 
 was buried in <I>the city of David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:10">1 Kings ii. 10</A>),

 and not in the sepulchre of Jesse his father in Bethlehem, yet he might
 be said to be <I>laid to his fathers;</I> for the grave, in general, is 
 the habitation of our fathers, of those that are gone before us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:19">Ps. xlix. 19</A>.

 [<I>d.</I>] His continuance in the grave: <I>He saw corruption.</I> We
 are sure he did not rise again; this Peter insists upon when he freely 
 speaks of the patriarch David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:29"><I>ch.</I> ii. 29</A>):

 <I>He is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this
 day.</I> He saw corruption, and therefore that promise could not have 
 its accomplishment in him. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) It was accomplished in the Lord Jesus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>He whom God raised again saw no corruption;</I> for it was in him 
 that the sure mercies were to be reserved for us. He rose the third 
 day, and therefore did not see corruption then; and he rose to die no 
 more, and therefore never did. Of him therefore the promise must be 
 understood, and no other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>c.</I> Having given them this account of the Lord Jesus, he comes to 
 make application of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) In the midst of his discourse, to engage their attention,
 he had told his hearers that they were concerned in all this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):
 
 "<I>To you is the word of this salvation sent,</I> to you first. If you 
 by your unbelief make it a word of rejection to you, you may thank 
 yourselves; but it is sent to you for a word of salvation; if it be not 
 so, it is your own fault." Let them not peevishly argue that because it 
 was sent to the Gentiles, who had no communion with them, therefore it 
 was not sent to them; for to them it was sent in the first place. 
 "<I>To you men</I> this is sent, and not to the angels that sinned. To 
 you living men, and not to the congregation of the dead and damned, 
 whose day of grace is over." He therefore speaks to them with 
 tenderness and respect: You are <I>men and brethren;</I> and so we are 
 to look upon all those that stand fair with us for the great salvation 
 as having the word of salvation sent to them. Those to whom he does by 
 warrant from heaven here bring the <I>word of salvation</I> are, 
 
 [<I>a.</I>] The native Jews, Hebrews of the Hebrews, as Paul himself 
 was: "<I>Children of the stock of Abraham,</I> though a degenerate 
 race, yet to you is this word of salvation sent; nay, it is therefore 
 sent to you, to save you from your sins." It is an advantage to be of a 
 good stock; for, though salvation does not always follow the children 
 of godly parents, yet the word of salvation does: <I>Abraham will 
 command his children and his house-hold after him.</I>

 [<I>b.</I>] The proselytes, the Gentiles by birth, that were in some
 degree brought over to the Jews' religion: "<I>Whosoever among you that 
 feareth God.</I> You that have a sense of natural religion, and have 
 subjected yourselves to the laws of that, and taken hold of the 
 comforts of that, <I>to you is the word of this salvation sent;</I> you 
 need the further discoveries and directions of revealed religion, are 
 prepared for them, and will bid them welcome, and therefore shall 
 certainly be welcome to take the benefit of them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) In the close of his discourse he applies what he had said 
 concerning Christ to his hearers. He had told them a long story 
 concerning <I>this Jesus;</I> now they would be ready to ask, What is 
 all this to us? And he tells them plainly what it is to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>a.</I>] It will be their unspeakable advantage if they embrace
 Jesus Christ, and believe this word of salvation. It will relieve them 
 where their greatest danger lies; and that is from the guilt of their 
 sins: "<I>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren</I>--we are
 warranted to proclaim it to you, and you are called to take notice of 
 it." He did not stand up to preach before them, but to preach to them, 
 and not without hopes of prevailing with them; for they are men, 
 reasonable creatures, and capable of being argued with; they are 
 <I>brethren,</I> spoken to, and dealt with, by men like themselves; not 
 only of the same nature, but of the same nation. It is proper for the 
 preachers of the gospel to call their hearers brethren, as speaking 
 familiarly to them, and with an affectionate concern for their welfare, 
 and as being equally interested with them in the gospel they preach. 
 Let all that hear the gospel of Christ know these two 
 things--<I>1st,</I> That it is an act of indemnity granted by the King
 of kings to the children of men, who stand attainted at his bar of 
 treason against his crown and dignity; and it is for and in 
 consideration of the mediation of Christ between God and man that this 
 act of grace is passed and proclaimed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>"Through this man,</I> who died and rose again, <I>is preached unto 
 you the forgiveness of sins.</I> We have to tell you, in God's name, 
 that your sins, though many and great, may be forgiven, and how it is 
 come about that they may be so, without any injury to God's honour, and 
 how you may obtain the forgiveness of your sins. We are to preach 
 repentance for the remission of sins, and divine grace giving both 
 <I>repentance and remission of sins.</I> The remission of sins is 
 <I>through this man.</I> By his merit it was purchased, in his name it 
 is offered, and by his authority it is bestowed; and therefore you are 
 concerned to be acquainted with him, and interested in him. We preach 
 to you <I>the forgiveness of sins.</I> That is the salvation we bring 
 you, the word of God; and therefore you ought to bid us welcome and 
 look upon us as your friends, and messengers of good tidings." 
 <I>2ndly,</I> That it does that for us which the law of Moses could not 
 do. The Jews were jealous for the law, and because it prescribed 
 expiatory and pacificatory sacrifices, and a great variety of 
 purifications, fancied they might be justified by it before God. "No," 
 saith Paul, "be it known to you that it is by Christ only that <I>those 
 who believe in him,</I> and none else, are <I>justified from all 
 things,</I> from all the guilt and stain of sin, <I>from which you 
 could not be justified by the law of Moses</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>);

 therefore they ought to entertain and embrace the gospel, and not to 
 adhere to the law in opposition to it, because the gospel is 
 perfective, not destructive, of the law. Note, 

 1. The great concern of sinners it to be justified, to be acquitted
 from guilt and accepted as righteous in God's sight. 

 2. Those who are truly justified are acquitted from all their guilt;
 for if any be left charged upon the sinner he is undone. 

 3. It was impossible for a sinner to be justified by the law of Moses. 
 Not by his moral law, for we have all broken it, and are transgressing 
 it daily, so that instead of justifying us it condemns us. Not by his 
 remedial law, for it was not possible that the <I>blood of bulls and 
 goats should take away sin,</I> should satisfy God's offended justice, 
 or pacify the sinner's wounded conscience. It was but a ritual and 
 typical institution. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:9,10:1,4">Heb. ix. 9; x. 1, 4</A>.

 4. By Jesus Christ we obtain a complete justification; for by him a
 complete atonement was made for sin. We are justified, not only by him
 as our Judge, but by him as our righteousness, <I>the Lord our
 righteousness.</I> 

 5. All that believe in Christ, that rely upon him and give up
 themselves to be ruled by him, are justified by him, and none but they.
 
 6. What the law <I>could not do</I> for us, <I>in that it was weak,</I>
 that the gospel of Christ does; and therefore it was folly, out of a 
 jealousy for the law of Moses and the honour of that institution, to 
 conceive a jealousy of the gospel of Christ and the designs of that 
 more perfect institution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>b.</I>] It is at their utmost peril if they reject the gospel of
 Christ, and turn their backs upon the offer now made them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:40,41"><I>v.</I> 40, 41</A>):

 <I>Beware therefore;</I> you have a fair invitation given you, look to
 yourselves, lest you either neglect or oppose it." Note, Those to whom
 the gospel is preached must see themselves upon their trial and good
 behaviour, and are concerned to beware lest they be found refusers of
 the grace offered. "Beware lest you not only come short of the
 blessings and benefits spoken of in the prophets as coming upon those
 that believe, but fall under the doom spoken of in the prophets as
 coming upon those that persist in unbelief: <I>lest that come upon you
 which is spoken of.</I>" Note, The threatenings are warnings ; what we
 are told will come upon impenitent sinners is designed to awaken us to
 beware lest it should come upon us. Now the prophecy referred to we
 have

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:5">Hab. i. 5</A>,

 where the destruction of the Jewish nation by the Chaldeans is foretold 
 as an incredible unparalleled destruction; and this is here applied to
 the destruction that was coming upon that nation by the Romans, for 
 their rejecting the gospel of Christ. The apostle follows the 
 Septuagint translation, which reads, <I>Behold, you despisers</I> (for, 
 <I>behold, you among the heathen</I>); because it made the text more 
 apposite to his purpose.

 1<I>st,</I> "Take heed lest the guilt come upon you which was spoken of 
 in the prophets--the guilt of despising the gospel and the tenders of
 it, and despising the Gentiles that were advanced to partake of it. 
 Beware lest it be said to you, <I>Behold, you despisers.</I>" Note, It 
 is the ruin of many that they despise religion, they look upon it as a 
 thing below them, and are not willing to stoop to it.

 2<I>ndly,</I> "Take heed lest the judgment come upon you which was 
 spoken of in the prophets: that <I>you shall wonder and perish,</I> 
 that is, wonderfully perish; your perdition shall be amazing to 
 yourselves and all about you." Those that will not wonder and be saved 
 shall wonder and perish. Those that enjoyed the privileges of the
 church, and flattered themselves with a conceit that these would save 
 them, will wonder when they find their ,,am presumption overruled and 
 that their privileges do but make their condemnation the more 
 intolerable. Let the unbelieving Jews expect that God will <I>work a 
 work in their days which you shall in no wise believe, though a man 
 declare it unto you.</I> This may be understood as a prediction, 
 either,

 1. Of their sin, that they should be incredulous, that that great work
 of God, the redemption of the world by Christ, though it should be in
 the most solemn manner declared unto them, yet they would <I>in no wise
 believe it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1">Isa. liii. 1</A>,

 <I>Who hath believed our report?</I> Though it was of God's working, to 
 whom nothing is impossible, and of his declaring, who cannot lie, yet 
 they would not give credit to it. Those that had the honour and 
 advantage to have this work wrought in their days had not the grace to 
 believe it. Or,

 2. Of their destruction. The dissolving of the Jewish polity, the
 taking of the kingdom of God from them and giving it to the Gentiles,
 the destruction of their holy house and city, and the dispersion of 
 their people, was a work which one would not have believed should have 
 ever been done, considering how much they had been the favourites of 
 Heaven. The calamities that were brought upon them were such as were 
 never before brought upon any people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:21">Matt. xxiv. 21</A>.

 It was said of their destruction by the Chaldeans, and it was true of
 their last destruction, <I>All the inhabitants of the world would not 
 have believed that the enemy would have entered into the gates of 
 Jerusalem as they did,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:12">Lam. iv. 12</A>.

 Thus is there a <I>strange punishment to the workers of iniquity,</I>
 especially to the despisers of Christ,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>42 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the
 Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the
 next sabbath.
 &nbsp; 43 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews
 and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who,
 speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
 &nbsp; 44 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together
 to hear the word of God.
 &nbsp; 45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
 envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul,
 contradicting and blaspheming.
 &nbsp; 46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was
 necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to
 you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy
 of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
 &nbsp; 47 For so hath the Lord commanded us, <I>saying,</I> I have set thee
 to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for
 salvation unto the ends of the earth.
 &nbsp; 48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and
 glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to
 eternal life believed.
 &nbsp; 49 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
 region.
 &nbsp; 50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and
 the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul
 and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.
 &nbsp; 51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and
 came unto Iconium.
 &nbsp; 52 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy
 Ghost.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The design of this story being to vindicate the apostles, especially 
 Paul (as he doth himself at large, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1-36">Rom. xi.</A>),

 from the reflections of the Jews upon him for preaching the gospel to
 the Gentiles, it is here observed that he proceeded therein with all 
 the caution imaginable, and upon due consideration, of which we have 
 here an instance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. There were some of the Jews that were so incensed against the 
 preaching of the gospel, not to the Gentiles, but to themselves, that 
 they would not bear to hear it, but <I>went out of the synagogue</I> 
 while Paul was preaching 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>),

 in contempt of him and his doctrine, and to the disturbance of the 
 congregation. It is probable they whispered among themselves, exciting 
 one another to it, and did it by consent. Now this bespoke, 

 1. An open infidelity, as plain a profession of unbelief as coming to 
 hear the gospel is of faith. They thus publicly avowed their contempt 
 of Christ and of his doctrine and law, were not ashamed, neither could 
 they blush; and they thus endeavoured to beget prejudices in the minds 
 of others against the gospel; they went out to draw others to follow 
 their pernicious ways. 

 2. An obstinate infidelity. They went out of the synagogue, not only to
 show that they did not believe the gospel, but because they were 
 resolved they would not, and therefore got out of the hearing of those 
 things that had a tendency to convince them. They stopped their ears 
 like the deaf adder. Justly therefore was the gospel taken from them, 
 when they first took themselves from it, and turned themselves out of 
 the church before they were turned out of it. For it is certainly true
 that God never leaves any till they first leave him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Gentiles were as willing to hear the gospel as those rude and 
 ill-conditioned Jews were to get out of the hearing of it: <I>They 
 besought that these words,</I> or words to this effect, <I>might be 
 preached to them the next sabbath;</I> in <I>the week between,</I> so 
 some take it; on the second and fifth days of the week, which in some 
 synagogues were their lecture days. But it appears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>)

 that it was the next sabbath day that they came together. They begged, 
 
 1. That the same offer might be made to them that was made to the Jews. 
 Paul in this sermon had brought the word of salvation to the Jews and 
 proselytes, but had taken no notice of the Gentiles; and therefore they 
 begged that forgiveness of sins through Christ might be preached to 
 them, as it was to the Jews. The Jews' leavings, nay, loathings, were 
 their longings. This justifies Paul in his preaching to them, that he 
 was invited to it, as Peter was sent for to Cornelius. Who could refuse 
 to break the bread of life to those who begged so hard for it, and to 
 give that to the poor at the door which the children at the table threw 
 under their feet? 

 2. That the same instructions might be given to them. They had heard
 the doctrine of Christ, but did not understand it at the first hearing, 
 nor could they remember all that they had heard, and therefore they 
 begged it might be preached to them again. Note, It is good to have the 
 word of Christ repeated to us. What we have heard we should desire to 
 hear again, that it may take deep root in us, and the nail that is 
 driven may be clenched and be <I>as a nail in a sure place.</I> To hear 
 <I>the same things</I> should not be grievous, because it is safe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1">Phil. iii. 1</A>.

 It aggravates the bad disposition of the Jews that the Gentiles desired
 to hear that often which they were not willing to hear once; and 
 commends the good disposition of the Gentiles that they did not follow 
 the bad example which the Jews set them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. There were some, nay, there were many, both of Jews and 
 proselytes, that were wrought upon by the preaching of the gospel. 
 Those who aggravated the matter of the Jews' rejection by the preaching 
 of the gospel, cried out, as is usual in such cases, "They have cast 
 away, and cast off, all the people of God." "Nay," says Paul, "it is
 not so; for abundance of the Jews have embraced Christ, and are taken
 in;" himself for one, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1,5">Rom. xi. 1, 5</A>.

 So it was here: <I>Many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed
 Paul and Barnabas,</I> and received further instructions and 
 encouragement from them.

 1. They submitted to the grace of God, and were admitted to the benefit 
 and comfort of it, which is implied in their being exhorted to continue 
 in it. They <I>followed Paul and Barnabas;</I> they became their 
 disciples, or rather the disciples of Christ, whose agents they were. 
 Those that join themselves to Christ will join themselves to his 
 ministers, and follow them. And Paul and Barnabas, though they were 
 sent to the Gentiles, yet bade those of the Jews welcome that were 
 willing to come under their instructions, such hearty well-wishers were 
 they to all the Jews and their friends, if they pleased. 

 2. They were exhorted and encouraged to persevere herein: <I>Paul and
 Barnabas, speaking to them</I> with all the freedom and friendship 
 imaginable, <I>persuaded them to continue in the grace of God,</I> to 
 hold fast that which they had received, to continue in their belief of 
 the gospel of grace, their dependence upon the Spirit of grace, and 
 their attendance upon the means of grace. And the grace of God shall 
 not be wanting to those who thus continue in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. There was a cheerful attendance upon the preaching of the gospel 
 the <I>next sabbath day</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):

 <I>Almost the whole city</I> (the generality of whom were Gentiles) 
 <I>came together to hear the word of God.</I> 

 1. It is probable that Paul and Barnabas were not idle in the 
 week-days, but took all opportunities in the week between (as some 
 think the Gentiles desired) to bring them acquainted with Christ, and 
 to raise their expectations from him. They did a great deal of service 
 to the gospel in private discourse and conversation, as well as in 
 their public sermons. Wisdom cried in the chief places of concourse, 
 and the opening of the gates, as well as in the synagogues, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:20,21">Prov. i. 20, 21</A>.

 2. This brought a vast concourse of people to the synagogue on the 
 sabbath day. Some came out of curiosity, the thing being new; others 
 longing to see what the Jews would do upon the second tender of the 
 gospel to them; and many who had heard something of the word of God 
 came to hear more, and to hear it, <I>not as the word of men but as the 
 word of God,</I> by which we must be ruled and judged. Now this 
 justified Paul in preaching to the Gentiles, that he met with the most 
 encouraging auditors among them. There <I>the fields were white to the
 harvest,</I> and therefore why should he not there put in his 
 sickle?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The Jews were enraged at this; and not only would not receive the 
 gospel themselves, but were filled with indignation at those that 
 crowded after it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>):

 <I>When the Jews saw the multitudes,</I> and considered what an 
 encouragement it was to Paul to go on in his work when he saw the 
 people thus flying like doves to their windows, and what probability 
 there was that among these multitudes some would be, without doubt, 
 wrought upon, and probably the greater part, to embrace Christ--this
 <I>filled them with envy.</I> 

 1. They grudged the interest the apostles had in the people, were vexed 
 to see the synagogue so full when they were going to preach. This was 
 the same spirit that worked in the Pharisees towards Christ; they were 
 cut to the heart when they saw <I>the whole world go after him.</I> 
 When the kingdom of heaven was opened they not only would not go in 
 themselves, but were angry with those that did. 

 2. They opposed the doctrine the apostles preached: <I>They spoke
 against those things that were spoken by Paul,</I> cavilled at them, 
 started objections against them, finding some fault or other with every 
 thing he said, <I>contradicting and blaspheming;</I> <B><I>antelegon 
 antilegontes</I></B>--<I>contradicting, they contradicted.</I> They did
 it with the utmost spite and rage imaginable: they persisted in their 
 contradiction, and nothing would silence them, they contradicted for 
 contradiction-sake, and denied that which was most evident; and, when 
 they could find no colour of objection, they broke out into ill 
 language against Christ and his gospel, blaspheming him and it. From 
 the language of the carnal man that receives not the things of the 
 Spirit of God, and therefore contradicts them, they proceed to the 
 language of incarnate devils, and blaspheme them. Commonly those who 
 begin with contradicting end with blaspheming.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The apostles hereupon solemnly and openly declare themselves 
 discharged from their obligations to the Jews, and at liberty to bring 
 the word of salvation to the Gentiles, even by the tacit consent of the 
 Jews themselves. Never let the Jew lay the fault of the carrying of the 
 kingdom of God to the Gentiles upon the apostles, for that complaint of 
 theirs is for ever silenced by their own act and deed, for what they 
 did here is for ever a bar to it. "Tender and refusal (we say) are good 
 payment in law." The Jews had the tender of the gospel, and did refuse 
 it, and therefore ought not to say any thing against the Gentiles 
 having it. In declaring this, it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>),

 <I>Paul and Barnabas waxed bold,</I> more bold than they had been while 
 they were shy of looking favourably upon the Gentiles, for fear of 
 giving offence to the Jews, and laying a stumbling-block in their way. 
 Note, There is a time for the preachers of the gospel to show as much 
 of the boldness of the lion as of the wisdom of the serpent and the 
 harmlessness of the dove. When the adversaries of Christ's cause begin
 to be daring, it is not for its advocates to be timid. While there is 
 any hope of working upon those that oppose themselves they must be 
 <I>instructed with meekness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:25">2 Tim. ii. 25</A>);

 but, when that method has long been tried in vain, we must wax bold, 
 and tell them what will be the issue of their opposition. The impudence 
 of the enemies of the gospel, instead of frightening, should rather 
 embolden its friends; for they are sure that they have a good cause, 
 and they know in whom they have trusted to bear them out. Now Paul and 
 Barnabas, having made the Jews a fair offer of gospel grace, here give 
 them fair notice of their bringing it to the Gentiles, <I>if by any 
 means</I> (as Paul says 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:14">Rom. xi. 14</A>)

 <I>they might provoke them to emulation.</I> 

 1. They own that the Jews were entitled to the first offer: "<I>It was 
 necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to 
 you,</I> to whom the promise was made, to you <I>of the lost sheep of 
 the house of Israel,</I> to whom Christ reckoned himself first sent." 
 And his charge to the preachers of his gospel to <I>begin at 
 Jerusalem</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:47">Luke xxiv. 47</A>)

 was a tacit direction to all that went into other countries to begin 
 with the Jews, <I>to whom pertained the giving of the law,</I> and 
 therefore the preaching of the gospel. <I>Let the children first be 
 served,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:27">Mark vii. 27</A>.

 2. They charge them with the refusal of it: "<I>You put it from
 you;</I> you will not accept of it; nay, you will not so much as bear 
 the offer of it, but take it as an affront to you." If men put the 
 gospel from them, God justly takes it from them; why should manna be 
 given to those that loathe it and call it <I>light bread,</I> or the 
 privileges of the gospel forced on those that put them away, and say, 
 <I>We have no part in David?</I> Herein they <I>judge themselves 
 unworthy of everlasting life.</I> In one sense we must all judge 
 ourselves unworthy of everlasting life, for there is nothing in us, nor 
 done by us, by which we can pretend to merit it, and we must be made 
 sensible of this; but here the meaning is, "You discover, or make it to 
 appear, that you are not meet for eternal life; you throw away all your 
 claims and give up your pretensions to it; since you will not take it 
 from his hands, into whose hand the Father has given it, 
 <B><I>krinete,</I></B> <I>you do,</I> in effect, <I>pass this 
 judgment</I> upon yourselves, and <I>out of your own mouth you shall be 
 judged;</I> you will not have it by Christ, by whom alone it is to be 
 had, and so shall your doom be, you shall not have it at all." 

 3. Upon this they ground their preaching the gospel to the 
 uncircumcised: "Since you will not accept eternal life as it is 
 offered, our way is plain, <I>Lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</I> If one 
 will not, another will. If those that were first invited to the 
 wedding-feast will not come, we must invite out of the highways and 
 hedges those that will, for <I>the wedding must be furnished with 
 guests.</I> If he that is next of kin will not do the kinsman's part, 
 he must not complain that another will,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:4">Ruth iv. 4</A>.
 
 4. They justify themselves in this by a divine warrant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>):

 "<I>For so hath the Lord commanded us;</I> the Lord Jesus gave us
 directions to witness to him in Jerusalem and Judea first, and after 
 that <I>to the utmost part of the earth,</I> to preach the gospel to 
 <I>every creature,</I> to <I>disciple all nations.</I>" This is 
 according to what was foretold in the Old-Testament. When the Messiah,
 in the prospect of the Jews' infidelity, was ready to say, <I>I have 
 laboured in vain,</I> he was told, to his satisfaction, that though 
 <I>Israel were not gathered,</I> yet <I>he should be glorious,</I> that 
 his blood should not be shed in vain, nor his purchase made in vain, 
 nor his doctrine preached in vain, nor his Spirit sent in vain--"For
 <I>I have set thee,</I> not only raised thee up, but established thee, 
 to be <I>a light of the Gentiles,</I> not only a shining light for a 
 time, but a standing light, set thee for a light, <I>that thou shouldst 
 be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.</I>" Note, 

 (1.) Christ is not only the Saviour, but the salvation, is himself our 
 righteousness, and life, and strength. 

 (2.) Wherever Christ is designed to be salvation, he is set up to be a 
 light; he enlightens the understanding, and so saves the soul. 

 (3.) He is, and is to be, light and salvation to the Gentiles, to the 
 ends of the earth. Those of every nation shall be welcome to him, some 
 of every nation have heard of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:18">Rom. x. 18</A>),

 and all nations shall at length become his kingdom. This prophecy has 
 had its accomplishment in part in the setting up of the kingdom of 
 Christ in this island of ours, which lies, as it were, in the <I>ends 
 of the earth,</I> a corner of the world, and shall be accomplished more 
 and more when the time comes for the <I>bringing in of the fulness of 
 the Gentiles.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The Gentiles cheerfully embraced that which the Jews scornfully 
 rejected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:48,49"><I>v.</I> 48, 49</A>.

 Never was land lost for want of heirs; <I>through the fall of the Jews, 
 salvation is come to the Gentiles:</I> the <I>casting off of them was 
 the reconciling of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of
 the Gentiles;</I> so the apostle shows at large, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:11,12,15">Rom. xi. 11, 12, 15</A>.

 The Jews, the natural branches, were broken off, and the Gentiles, that
 were branches of the wild olive, were thereupon grafted in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17,19"><I>v.</I> 17, 19</A>.

 Now here we are told how the Gentiles welcomed this happy turn in their 
 favour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They took the comfort of it: <I>When they heard this they were 
 glad.</I> It was good news to them that they might have admission into 
 covenant and communion with God by a clearer, nearer, and better way 
 than submitting to the ceremonial law, and being proselyted to the 
 Jewish religion--that the partition-wall was taken down and they were as
 welcome to the benefits of the Messiah's kingdom as the Jews 
 themselves, and might share in their promise, without coming under 
 their yoke. This was indeed <I>glad tidings of great joy to all 
 people.</I> Note, Our being put into a possibility of salvation, and a 
 capacity for it, ought to be the matter of our rejoicing; when the 
 Gentiles did but hear that the offers of grace should be made them, the 
 word of grace preached to them, and the means of grace afforded them, 
 <I>they were glad.</I> "Now there is some hope for us." Many grieve 
 under doubts whether they have an interest in Christ or no, when they 
 should be rejoicing that they have an interest in him; the golden 
 sceptre is held out to them, and they are invited to come and touch the 
 top of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They gave God the praise of it: <I>They glorified the word of the 
 Lord;</I> that is, Christ (so some), the essential Word; they 
 entertained a profound veneration for him, and expressed the high 
 thoughts they had of him. Or, rather, <I>the gospel;</I> the more they 
 knew of it, the more they admired it. Oh! what a light, what a power, 
 what a treasure, does this gospel bring along with it! How excellent 
 are its truths, its precepts, its promises! How far transcending all 
 other institutions! How plainly divine and heavenly is its origin! Thus 
 they <I>glorified the word of the Lord,</I> and it is this which he has 
 himself <I>magnified above all his name</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:2">Ps. cxxxviii. 2</A>),

 and will <I>magnify</I> and <I>make honourable,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:21">Isa. xlii. 21</A>.

 They glorified the word of the Lord, 

 (1.) Because now the knowledge of it was diffused and not confined to 
 the Jews only. Note, It is the glory of the word of the Lord that the 
 further it spreads the brighter it shines, which shows it to be not 
 like the light of the candle, but like that of the sun when he goes 
 forth in his strength. 

 (2.) Because now the knowledge of it was brought to them. Note, Those 
 speak best of the honour of the word of the Lord that speak 
 experimentally, that have themselves been subdued by its power, and 
 comforted by its sweetness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Many of them became, not only professors of the Christian faith, but 
 sincerely obedient to the faith: <I>As many as were ordained to eternal 
 life believed.</I> God by his Spirit wrought true faith in those for 
 whom he had in his councils from everlasting designed a happiness to 
 everlasting. 

 (1.) Those believed to whom God gave grace to believe, whom by a secret 
 and mighty operation he brought into subjection to the gospel of 
 Christ, and made willing in the day of his power. Those came to Christ 
 whom the Father drew, and to whom the Spirit made the gospel call 
 effectual. It is called <I>the faith of the operation of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:12">Col. ii. 12</A>),

 and is said to be <I>wrought by the same power that raised up 
 Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:19,20">Eph. i. 19, 20</A>.

 (2.) God gave this grace to believe to all those among them who were 
 ordained to eternal life (for <I>whom he had predestinated, them he 
 also called,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:30">Rom. viii. 30</A>);

 or, <I>as many as were disposed to eternal life,</I> as many as had a 
 concern about their eternal state, and aimed to make sure of eternal 
 life, believed in Christ, in whom God hath treasured up that life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:11">1 John v. 11</A>),

 and who is the only way to it; and it was the grace of God that wrought 
 it in them. Thus all those captives, and those only, took the benefit 
 of Cyrus's proclamation, <I>whose spirit God had raised up to build the 
 house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:5">Ezra i. 5</A>.

 Those will be brought to believe in Christ that by his grace are well
 disposed to eternal life, and make this their aim.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. When they believed they did what they could to spread the knowledge 
 of Christ and his gospel among their neighbours 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):

 <I>And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the 
 region.</I> When it was received with so much satisfaction in the chief 
 city, it soon spread into all parts of the country. Those new converts 
 were themselves ready to communicate to others that which they were so 
 full of themselves. <I>The Lord gave the word, and then great was the 
 company of those that published it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:11">Ps. lxviii. 11</A>.

 Those that have become acquainted with Christ themselves will do what
 they can to bring others acquainted with him. Those in great and rich 
 cities that have received the gospel should not think to engross it, as 
 if, like learning and philosophy, it were only to be the entertainment 
 of the more polite and elevated part of mankind, but should do what 
 they can to get it published in the country among the ordinary sort of 
 people, the poor and unlearned, who have souls to be saved as well as 
 they.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. Paul and Barnabas, having sown the seeds of a Christian church 
 there, quitted the place, and went to do the like else-where. We read 
 not any thing of their working miracles here, to confirm their 
 doctrine, and to convince people of the truth of it; for, though God 
 then did ordinarily make use of that method of conviction, yet he 
 could, when he pleased, do his work without it; and begetting faith by 
 the immediate influence of his Spirit was itself the greatest miracle 
 to those in whom it was wrought. Yet, it is probable that they did work 
 miracles, for we find they did in the next place they came to, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:3"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 3</A>.

 Now here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How <I>the unbelieving Jews</I> expelled the apostles out of that 
 country. They first turned their back upon them, and then <I>lifted up 
 the heel against them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>):

 <I>They raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas,</I> excited the 
 mob to persecute them in <I>their</I> way by insulting their persons as 
 they went along the streets; excited the magistrates to persecute them 
 in <I>their</I> way, by imprisoning and punishing them. When <I>they 
 could not resist the wisdom and spirit wherewith they spoke,</I> they 
 had recourse to these brutish methods, the last refuge of an obstinate 
 infidelity. Satan and his agents are most exasperated against the 
 preachers of the gospel when they see them go on successfully, and 
 therefore then will be sure to raise persecution against them. Thus it 
 has been the common lot of the best men in the world to suffer ill for 
 doing well, to be persecuted instead of being preferred for the good 
 services they have done to mankind. Observe, 

 (1.) What method the Jews took to give them trouble: <I>They stirred up 
 the devout and honourable women</I> against them. They could not make 
 any considerable interest themselves, but they applied to some ladies 
 of quality in the city, that were well affected to the Jewish religion, 
 and were proselytes of the gate, therefore called <I>devout women.</I> 
 These, according to the genius of their sex, were zealous in their way, 
 and bigoted; and it was easy, by false stories and misrepresentations, 
 to incense them against the gospel of Christ, as if it had been 
 destructive of all religion, of which really it is perfective. It is 
 good to see honourable women devout, and well affected to religious 
 worship: The less they have to do in the world, the more they should do 
 for their souls, and the more time they should spend in communion with 
 God; but it is sad when, under colour of devotion to God, they conceive 
 an enmity to Christ, as those here mentioned. What! women persecutors! 
 Can they forget the tenderness and compassion of their sex? What!
 honourable women! Can they thus stain their honour, and disgrace 
 themselves, and do so mean a thing? But, which is strangest of all,
 devout women! Will they kill Christ's servants, and think therein they 
 do God service? Let those therefore that have zeal see that it be 
 according to knowledge. By these devout and honourable women they 
 stirred up likewise <I>the chief men of the city,</I> the magistrates 
 and the rulers, who had power in their hands and set them against the 
 apostles, and they had so little consideration as to suffer themselves 
 to be made the tools of this ill-natured party, who <I>would neither go 
 into the kingdom of heaven themselves nor suffer those who were 
 entering to go in.</I> 

 (2.) How far they carried it, so far that <I>they expelled them out of 
 their coasts;</I> they banished them, ordered them to be carried, as we 
 say, from constable to constable, till they were forced out of their 
 jurisdiction; so that it was not by fear, but downright violence, that 
 they were driven out. This was one method which the overruling
 providence of God took to keep the first planters of the church from 
 staying too long at a place; as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:23">Matt. x. 23</A>,

 <I>When they persecute you in one city flee to another,</I> that thus
 you may the sooner <I>go over the cities of Israel.</I> This was 
 likewise a method God took to make those that were well disposed the 
 more warmly affected towards the apostles; for it is natural to us to 
 pity those that are persecuted, to think the better of those that 
 suffer when we know they suffer unjustly, and to be the more ready to 
 help them. The expelling of the apostles out of their coasts made 
 people inquisitive what evil they had done, and perhaps raised them 
 more friends than conniving at them in their coasts would have 
 done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How the apostles abandoned and rejected the unbelieving Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>):

 <I>They shook off the dust of their feet against them.</I> When they 
 went out of the city they used this ceremony in the sight of those that 
 sat in the gate; or, when they went out of the borders of their 
 country, in the sight of those that were sent to see the country rid of 
 them. Hereby, 

 (1.) They declared that they would have no more to do with them, would 
 take nothing that was theirs; for <I>they sought not theirs, but 
 them.</I> Dust they are, and let them keep their dust to themselves, it 
 shall not cleave to them. 

 (2.) They expressed their detestation of their infidelity, and that, 
 though they were Jews by birth, yet, having rejected the gospel of 
 Christ, they were in their eyes no better than heathen and profane. As 
 Jews and Gentiles, if they believe, are equally acceptable to God and 
 good men; so, if they do not, they are equally abominable. 

 (3.) Thus they set them at defiance, and expressed their contempt of 
 them and their malice, which they looked upon as impotent. It was as
 much as to say, "Do your worst, we do not fear you; we know whom we 
 serve and whom we have trusted." 

 (4.) Thus they left a testimony behind them that they had had a fair 
 offer made them of the grace of the gospel, which shall be proved 
 against them in the day of judgment. This dust will prove that the 
 preachers of the gospel had been among them, but were expelled by them. 
 Thus Christ had ordered them to do, and for this reason, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:14,Lu+9:5">Matt. x. 14; Luke ix. 5</A>.

 When <I>they left them, they came to Iconium,</I> not so much for
 safety, as for work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What frame they left the new converts in <I>at Antioch</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>):
 
 <I>The disciples,</I> when they saw with what courage and cheerfulness 
 Paul and Barnabas not only bore the indignities that were done them, 
 but went on with their work notwithstanding, they were in like manner 
 inspirited. 

 (1.) They were very cheerful. One would have expected that when Paul 
 and Barnabas were expelled out of their coasts, and perhaps forbidden 
 to return upon pain of death, the disciples would have been full of 
 grief and full of fear, looking for no other than that, if the planters 
 of Christianity go, the plantation would soon come to nothing; or that 
 it would be their turn next to be banished the country, and to them it 
 would be more grievous, for it was their own. But no; <I>they were 
 filled with joy</I> in Christ, had such a satisfactory assurance of 
 Christ's carrying on and perfecting his own work in them and among 
 them, and that either he would screen them from trouble or bear them up 
 under it, that all their fears were swallowed up in their believing 
 joys. 

 (2.) They were courageous, wonderfully animated with a holy resolution 
 to cleave to Christ, whatever difficulties they met with. This seems
 especially to be meant by <I>their being filled with the Holy 
 Ghost,</I> for the same expression is used of Peter's boldness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:8"><I>ch.</I> iv. 8</A>),
 
 and Stephen's
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:55"><I>ch.</I> vii. 55</A>),

 and Paul's,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:9"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 9</A>.

 The more we relish the comforts and encouragements we meet with in the
 power of godliness, and the fuller our hearts are of them, the better 
 prepared we are to face the difficulties we meet with in the profession 
 of godliness.</P>
