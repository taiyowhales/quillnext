 In this chapter the apostle blames, and endeavours to rectify, some 
 great indecencies and manifest disorders in the church of Corinth; as, 
 
 I. The misconduct of their women (some of whom seem to have been
 inspired) in the public assembly, who laid by their veils, the common 
 token of subjection to their husbands in that part of the world. This 
 behaviour he reprehends, requires them to keep veiled, asserts the 
 superiority of the husband, yet so as to remind the husband that both 
 were made for mutual help and comfort,

 II. He blames them for their discord and neglect and contempt of the
 poor, at the Lord's supper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17-22">ver. 17-22</A>.

 III. To rectify these scandalous disorders, he sets before them the
 nature and intentions of this holy institution, directs them how they 
 should attend on it, and warns them of the danger of a conduct to 
 indecent as theirs, and of all unworthy receiving,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Be ye followers of me, even as I also <I>am</I> of Christ.
 &nbsp; 2  Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all
 things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered <I>them</I> to you.
 &nbsp; 3  But I would have you know, that the head of every man is
 Christ; and the head of the woman <I>is</I> the man; and the head of
 Christ <I>is</I> God.
 &nbsp; 4  Every man praying or prophesying, having <I>his</I> head covered,
 dishonoureth his head.
 &nbsp; 5  But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with <I>her</I> head
 uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if
 she were shaven.
 &nbsp; 6  For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but
 if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be
 covered.
 &nbsp; 7  For a man indeed ought not to cover <I>his</I> head, forasmuch as
 he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of
 the man.
 &nbsp; 8  For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
 &nbsp; 9  Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for
 the man.
 &nbsp; 10  For this cause ought the woman to have power on <I>her</I> head
 because of the angels.
 &nbsp; 11  Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither
 the woman without the man, in the Lord.
 &nbsp; 12  For as the woman <I>is</I> of the man, even so <I>is</I> the man also
 by the woman; but all things of God.
 &nbsp; 13  Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God
 uncovered?
 &nbsp; 14  Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have
 long hair, it is a shame unto him?
 &nbsp; 15  But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for
 <I>her</I> hair is given her for a covering.
 &nbsp; 16  But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such
 custom, neither the churches of God.

 Paul, having answered the cases put to him, proceeds in this chapter to 
 the redress of grievances. The 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1">first verse</A>

 of the chapter is put, by those who divided the epistle into chapters,
 as a preface to the rest of the epistle, but seems to have been a more 
 proper close to the last, in which he had enforced the cautions he had 
 given against the abuse of liberty, by his own example: <I>Be ye 
 followers of me, as I also am of Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 fitly closes his argument; and the way of speaking in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:2">next verse</A>

 looks like a transition to another. But, whether it more properly
 belong to this or the last chapter, it is plain from it that Paul not 
 only preached such doctrine as they ought to believe, but led such a 
 life as they ought to imitate. "Be ye followers of me," that is, "Be 
 imitators of me; live as you see me live." Note, Ministers are likely 
 to preach most to the purpose when they can press their hearers to 
 follow their example. Yet would not Paul be followed blindly neither. 
 He encourages neither implicit faith nor obedience. He would be 
 followed himself no further than he followed Christ. Christ's pattern 
 is a copy without a blot; so is no man's else. Note, We should follow 
 no leader further than he follows Christ. Apostles should be left by us 
 when they deviate from the example of their Master. He passes next to 
 reprehend and reform an indecency among them, of which the women were 
 more especially guilty, concerning which observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he prefaces it. He begins with a commendation of what was 
 praiseworthy in them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I praise you, that you remember me in all things, and keep the 
 ordinances as I delivered them to you.</I> Many of them, it is 
 probable, did this in the strictest sense of the expression: and he 
 takes occasion thence to address the body of the church under this good 
 character; and the body might, in the main, have continued to observe 
 the ordinances and institutions of Christ, though in some things they 
 deviated from, and corrupted, them. Note, When we reprove what is amiss 
 in any, it is very prudent and fit to commend what is good in them; it 
 will show that the reproof is not from ill-will, and a humour of 
 censuring and finding fault; and it will therefore procure the more 
 regard to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he lays the foundation for his reprehension by asserting the 
 superiority of the man over the woman: <I>I would have you know that 
 the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, 
 and the head of Christ is God.</I> Christ, in his mediatorial character 
 and glorified humanity, is at the head of mankind. He is not only first 
 of the kind, but Lord and Sovereign. He has a name above every name: 
 though in this high office and authority he has a superior, God being 
 his head. And as God is the head of Christ, and Christ the head of the 
 whole human kind, so the man is the head of the two sexes: not indeed
 with such dominion as Christ has over the kind or God has over the man 
 Christ Jesus; but a superiority and headship he has, and the woman 
 should be in subjection and not assume or usurp the man's place. This 
 is the situation in which God has placed her; and for that reason she 
 should have a mind suited to her rank, and not do any thing that looks 
 like an affectation of changing places. Something like this the women 
 of the church of Corinth seem to have been guilty of, who were under 
 inspiration, and prayed and prophesied even in their assemblies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 It is indeed an apostolical canon, that the women <I>should keep 
 silence in the churches</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:34,1Ti+2:12"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 34; 1 Tim. ii. 12</A>),

 which some understand without limitation, as if a woman under
 inspiration also must keep silence, which seems very well to agree with 
 the connection of the apostle's discourse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:1-23"><I>ch.</I> xiv</A>.

 Others with a limitation: though a woman might not from her own
 abilities pretend to teach, or so much as question and debate any thing 
 in the church yet when under inspiration the case was altered, she had 
 liberty to speak. Or, though she might not preach even by inspiration 
 (because teaching is the business of a superior), yet she might pray or 
 utter hymns by inspiration, even in the public assembly. She did not 
 show any affectation of superiority over the man by such acts of public 
 worship. It is plain the apostle does not in this place prohibit the 
 thing, but reprehend the manner of doing it. And yet he might utterly 
 disallow the thing and lay an unlimited restraint on the woman in 
 another part of the epistle. These things are not contradictory. It is 
 to his present purpose to reprehend the manner wherein the women prayed 
 and prophesied in the church, without determining in this place whether 
 they did well or ill in praying or prophesying. Note, The manner of 
 doing a thing enters into the morality of it. We must not only be 
 concerned to do good, but that the good we do be well done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The thing he reprehends is the woman's praying or prophesying 
 uncovered, or the man's doing either covered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 To understand this, it must be observed that it was a signification 
 either of shame or subjection for persons to be veiled, or covered, in 
 the eastern countries, contrary to the custom of ours, where the being 
 bare-headed betokens subjection, and being covered superiority and 
 dominion. And this will help us the better to understand,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The reasons on which he grounds his reprehension. 

 1. <I>The man that prays or prophesies with his head covered
 dishonoureth his head,</I> namely, Christ, the head of every man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 by appearing in a habit unsuitable to the rank in which God has placed 
 him. Note, We should, even in our dress and habits, avoid every thing 
 that may dishonour Christ. <I>The woman,</I> on the other hand, <I>who 
 prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head,</I> 
 namely, the man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 She appears in the dress of her superior, and throws off the token of 
 her subjection. She might, with equal decency, cut her hair short, or 
 cut it close, which was the custom of the man in that age. This would 
 be in a manner to declare that she was desirous of changing sexes, a 
 manifest affectation of that superiority which God had conferred on the 
 other sex. And this was probably the fault of these prophetesses in the 
 church of Corinth. It was doing a thing which, in that age of the 
 world, betokened superiority, and therefore a tacit claim of what did 
 not belong to them but the other sex. Note, The sexes should not affect 
 to change places. The order in which divine wisdom has placed persons 
 and things is best and fittest: to endeavour to amend it is to destroy 
 all order, and introduce confusion. The woman should keep to the rank 
 God has chosen for her, and not dishonour her head; for this, in the 
 result, is to dishonour God. If she was made out of the man, and for 
 the man, and made to be the glory of the man, she should do nothing, 
 especially in public, that looks like a wish of having this order 
 inverted. 

 2. Another reason against this conduct is that <I>the man is the image
 and glory of God,</I> the representative of that glorious dominion and 
 headship which God has over the world. It is the man who is set at the 
 head of this lower creation, and therein he bears the resemblance of 
 God. The woman, on the other hand, <I>is the glory of the man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 she is his representative. Not but she has dominion over the inferior 
 creatures, as she is a partaker of human nature, and so far is God's 
 representative too, but it is at second-hand. She is the image of God, 
 inasmuch as she is the image of the man: <I>For the man was not made 
 out of the woman, but the woman out of the man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The man was first made, and made head of the creation here below, and 
 therein the image of the divine dominion; and the woman was made out of 
 the man, and shone with a reflection of his glory, being made superior 
 to the other creatures here below, but in subjection to her husband, 
 and deriving that honour from him out of whom she was made. 

 3. <I>The woman was made for the man,</I> to be his help-meet, <I>and
 not the man for the woman.</I> She was naturally, therefore, made 
 subject to him, because made for him, for his use, and help, and 
 comfort. And she who was intended to be always in subjection to the man 
 should do nothing, in Christian assemblies, that looks like an 
 affectation of equality. 

 4. <I>She ought to have power on her head, because of the angels.</I>
 Power, that is, a veil, the token, not of her having the power or 
 superiority, but being under the power of her husband, subjected to 
 him, and inferior to the other sex. Rebekah, when she met Isaac, and 
 was delivering herself into his possession, put on her veil, in token 
 of her subjection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:65">Gen. xxiv. 65</A>.

 Thus would the apostle have the women appear In Christian assemblies,
 even though they spoke there by inspiration, <I>because of the 
 angels,</I> that is, say some, because of the evil angels. The woman 
 <I>was first in the transgression, being deceived by the devil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:14">1 Tim. ii. 14</A>),

 which increased her subjection to man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:16">Gen. iii. 16</A>.

 Now, believe evil angels will be sure to mix in all Christian 
 assemblies, therefore should women wear the token of their 
 shamefacedness and subjection, which in that age and country, was a 
 veil. Others say because of the good angels. Jews and Christians have
 had an opinion that these ministering spirits are many of them present 
 in their assemblies. Their presence should restrain Christians from
 all indecencies in the worship of God. Note, We should learn from all 
 to behave in the public assemblies of divine worship so as to express a 
 reverence for God, and a content and satisfaction with that rank in 
 which he has placed us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He thinks fit to guard his argument with a caution lest the 
 inference be carried too far 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):

 <I>Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman 
 without the man in the Lord.</I> They were made for one another. <I>It 
 is not good for him to be alone</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:18">Gen. ii. 18</A>),

 and therefore was a woman made, and made for the man; and the man was 
 intended to be a comfort, and help, and defence, to the woman, though 
 not so directly and immediately made for her. They were made to be a 
 mutual comfort and blessing, not one a slave and the other a tyrant. 
 <I>Both were to be one flesh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:24">Gen. ii. 24</A>),

 and this for the propagation of a race of mankind. They are reciprocal 
 instruments of each other's production. As the woman was first formed 
 out of the man, the man is ever since propagated by the woman 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 all by the divine wisdom and power of the First Cause so ordaining it. 
 The authority and subjection should be no greater than are suitable to 
 two in such near relation and close union to each other. Note, As it is 
 the will of God that the woman know her place, so it is his will also 
 that the man abuse not his power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He enforces his argument from the natural covering provided for the 
 woman 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:13-15"><I>v.</I> 13-15</A>):

 "<I>Judge in yourselves</I>--consult your own reason, hearken to what 
 nature suggests--<I>is it comely for a woman to pray to God 
 uncovered?</I> Should there not be a distinction kept up between the 
 sexes in wearing their hair, since nature has made one? Is it not a 
 distinction which nature has kept up among all civilized nations? The 
 woman's hair is a natural covering; to wear it long is a glory to her; 
 but for a man to have long hair, or cherish it, is a token of softness 
 and effeminacy." Note, It should be our concern, especially in 
 Christian and religious assemblies, to make no breach upon the rules of 
 natural decency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. He sums up all by referring those who were contentious to the 
 usages and customs of the churches, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Custom is in a great measure the rule of decency. And the common 
 practice of the churches is what would have them govern themselves by. 
 He does not silence the contentious by mere authority, but lets them 
 know that they would appear to the world as very odd and singular in 
 their humour if they would quarrel for a custom to which all the 
 churches of Christ were at that time utter strangers, or against a 
 custom in which they all concurred, and that upon the ground of natural 
 decency. It was the common usage of the churches for women to appear in 
 public assemblies, and join in public worship, veiled; and it was 
 manifestly decent that they should do so. Those must be very 
 contentious indeed who would quarrel with this, or lay it aside.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this passage the apostle sharply rebukes them for much greater 
 disorders than the former, in their partaking of the Lord's supper, 
 which was commonly done in the first ages, as the ancients tell us, 
 with a love-feast annexed, which gave occasion to the scandalous 
 disorders which the apostle here reprehends, concerning which 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The manner in which he introduces his charge: "<I>Now in this that I 
 declare to you I praise you not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 I cannot commend, but must blame and condemn you." It is plain, from 
 the beginning of the chapter, that he was willing and pleased to 
 commend as far as he could. But such scandalous disorders, in so sacred 
 an institution, as they were guilty of, called for a sharp 
 reprehension. They quite turned the institution against itself. It was 
 intended to make them better, to promote their spiritual interests; but 
 it really made them worse. <I>They came together, not for the better, 
 but for the worse.</I> Note, The ordinances of Christ, if they do not 
 make us better, will be very apt to make us worse; if they do not do 
 our souls good, they do us harm; if they do not melt and mend, they 
 will harden. Corruptions will be confirmed in us, if the proper means 
 do not work a cure of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He enters upon his charge against them in more particulars than 
 one. 

 1. He tells them that, upon coming together, they fell into
 <I>divisions, schisms</I>--<B><I>schismata.</I></B> Instead of 
 concurring unanimously in celebrating the ordinance, they fell a 
 quarrelling with one another. Note, There may be schism where there is 
 no separation of communion. Persons may come together in the same 
 church, and sit down at the same table of the Lord, and yet be 
 schismatics. Uncharitableness, alienation of affection, especially if 
 it grows up to discord, and feuds, and contentions, constitute schism.
 Christians may separate from each other's communion, and yet be 
 uncharitable one towards another; they may continue in the same 
 communion, and yet be uncharitable. This latter is schism, rather than 
 the former. The apostle had heard a report of the Corinthians' 
 divisions, and he tells them he had too much reason to believe it. For, 
 adds he, there must be heresies also; not only quarrels, but factions, 
 and perhaps such corrupt opinions as strike at the foundation of 
 Christianity, and all sound religion. Note, No marvel there should be 
 breaches of Christian love in the churches, when such offences will 
 come as shall make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience. Such 
 offences must come. Note that men are necessitated to be guilty of 
 them; but the event is certain, and God permits them, that those who 
 are approved (such honest hearts as will bear the trial) may be set to 
 view, and appear faithful by their constant adherence to the truths and 
 ways of God, notwithstanding the temptations of seducers. Note, The 
 wisdom of God can make the wickedness and errors of others a foil to 
 the piety and integrity of the saints. 

 2. He charges them not only with discord and division, but with
 scandalous disorder: <I>For in eating every one taketh before the other 
 his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Heathens used to drink plentifully at their feasts upon their 
 sacrifices. Many of the wealthier Corinthians seem to have taken the
 same liberty at the Lord's table, or at least at their 
 <B><I>Agapai,</I></B> or <I>love-feasts,</I> that were annexed to the 
 supper. They would not stay for one another; the rich despised the 
 poor, and ate and drank up the provisions they themselves brought, 
 before the poor were allowed to partake; and thus some wanted, while 
 others had more than enough. This was profaning a sacred institution, 
 and corrupting a divine ordinance, to the last degree. What was 
 appointed to feed the soul was employed to feed their lusts and 
 passions. What should have been a bond of mutual amity and affection 
 was made an instrument of discord and disunion. The poor were deprived 
 of the food prepared for them, and the rich turned a feast of charity 
 into a debauch. This was scandalous irregularity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle lays the blame of this conduct closely on them, 

 1. By telling them that their conduct perfectly destroyed the purpose
 and use of such an institution: <I>This is not to eat the Lord's 
 supper,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 It was coming to the Lord's table, and not coming. They might as well 
 have staid away. Thus to eat the outward elements was not to eat 
 Christ's body. Note, There is a careless and irregular eating of the 
 Lord's supper which is as none at all; it will turn to no account, but 
 to increase guilt. Such an eating was that of the Corinthians; their 
 practices were a direct contradiction to the purposes of this sacred 
 institution. 

 2. Their conduct carried in it a contempt of God's house, or of the
 church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 If they had a mind to feast, they might do it at home in their own 
 houses; but to come to the Lord's table, and cabal and quarrel, and 
 keep the poor from their share of the provision there made for them as 
 well as rich, was such an abuse of the ordinance, and such a contempt 
 of the poorer members of the church more especially, as merited a very 
 sharp rebuke. Such a behaviour tended much to the shame and 
 discouragement of the poor, whose souls were as dear to Christ, and 
 cost him as much, as those of the rich. Note, Common meals may be 
 managed after a common manner, but religious feasts should be attended 
 religiously. Note, also, It is a heinous evil, and severely to be 
 censured, for Christians to treat their fellow-christians with contempt 
 and insolence, but especially at the Lord's table. This is doing what 
 they can to pour contempt on divine ordinances. And we should look 
 carefully to it that nothing in our behaviour at the Lord's table have 
 the appearance of contemning so sacred an institution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered
 unto you, That the Lord Jesus the <I>same</I> night in which he was
 betrayed took bread:
 &nbsp; 24  And when he had given thanks, he brake <I>it,</I> and said, Take,
 eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in
 remembrance of me.
 &nbsp; 25  After the same manner also <I>he took</I> the cup, when he had
 supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this
 do ye, as oft as ye drink <I>it,</I> in remembrance of me.
 &nbsp; 26  For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
 show the Lord's death till he come.
 &nbsp; 27  Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink <I>this</I>
 cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and
 blood of the Lord.
 &nbsp; 28  But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of <I>that</I>
 bread, and drink of <I>that</I> cup.
 &nbsp; 29  For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and
 drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
 &nbsp; 30  For this cause many <I>are</I> weak and sickly among you, and
 many sleep.
 &nbsp; 31  For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
 &nbsp; 32  But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that
 we should not be condemned with the world.
 &nbsp; 33  Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry
 one for another.
 &nbsp; 34  And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not
 together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when
 I come.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To rectify these gross corruptions and irregularities, the apostle sets 
 the sacred institution here to view. This should be the rule in the 
 reformation of all abuses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He tells us how he came by the knowledge of it. He was not among the 
 apostles at the first institution; but <I>he had received from the Lord 
 what he delivered to them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He had the knowledge of this matter by revelation from Christ: and what 
 he had received he communicated, without varying from the truth a 
 tittle, without adding or diminishing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives us a more particular account of the institution than we 
 meet with elsewhere. We have here an account,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Of the author--our Lord Jesus Christ. The king of the church only has
 power to institute sacraments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The time of the institution: <I>It was the very night wherein he was 
 betrayed;</I> just as he was entering on his sufferings which are 
 therein to be commemorated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The institution itself. Our Saviour took bread, and when he had 
 given thanks, or <I>blessed</I> (as it is in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:26">Matt. xxvi. 26</A>),

 <I>he broke, and said, Take, eat; this is my body, broken for you; this
 do in remembrance of me. And in like manner he took the cup, when he 
 had supped, saying, This cup is the New Testament in my blood; this do, 
 as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The materials of this sacrament; both, 

 [1.] As to the visible signs; these are bread and the cup, the former 
 of which is called bread many times over in this passage, even after 
 what the papists call consecration. What is eaten is called bread, 
 though it be at the same time said to be <I>the body of the Lord,</I> a 
 plain argument that the apostle knew nothing of their monstrous and 
 absurd doctrine of transubstantiation. The latter is as plainly a part 
 of this institution as words can make it. St. Matthew tells us, our
 Lord bade them all drink of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:27"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 27</A>),

 as if he would, by this expression, lay in a caveat against the
 papists' depriving the laity of the cup. Bread and the cup are both 
 made use of, because it is a holy feast. Nor is it here, or any where,
 made necessary, that any particular liquor should be in the cup. In one
 evangelist, indeed, it is plain that wine was the liquor used by our
 Saviour, though it was, perhaps, mingled with water, according to the
 Jewish custom; <I>vide</I> Lightfoot on

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:27">Matt. xxvi</A>.

 But this by no means renders it unlawful to have a sacrament where
 persons cannot come at wine. In every place of scripture in which we 
 have an account of this part of the institution it is always expressed 
 by a figure. The cup is put for what was in it, without once specifying 
 what the liquor was, in the words of the institution. 

 [2.] The things signified by these outward signs; they are Christ's 
 body and blood, his body broken, his blood shed, together with all the 
 benefits which flow from his death and sacrifice: <I>it is the New 
 Testament in his blood.</I> His blood is the seal and sanction of all 
 the privileges of the new covenant; and worthy receivers take it as 
 such, at this holy ordinance. They have the New Testament, and their 
 own title to all the blessings of the new covenant, confirmed to them 
 by his blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We have here the sacramental actions, the manner in which the 
 materials of the sacrament are to be used. 

 [1.] Our Saviour's actions, which are taking the bread and cup, giving 
 thanks, breaking the bread, and giving about both the one and the 
 other.

 [2.] The actions of the communicants, which were to take the bread and 
 eat, to take the cup and drink, and both in remembrance of Christ. But 
 the external acts are not the whole nor the principal part of what is 
 to be done at this holy ordinance; each of them has a significancy. Our 
 Saviour, having undertaken to make an offering of himself to God, and 
 procure, by his death, the remission of sins, with all other gospel 
 benefits, for true believers, did, at the institution, deliver his body 
 and blood, with all the benefits procured by his death, to his 
 disciples, and continues to do the same every time the ordinance is 
 administered to the true believers. This is here exhibited, or set 
 forth, as the food of souls. And as food, though ever so wholesome or
 rich, will yield no nourishment without being eaten, here the 
 communicants are to take and eat, or to receive Christ and feed upon 
 him, his grace and benefits, and by faith convert them into nourishment 
 to their souls. They are to take him as their Lord and life, yield 
 themselves up to him, and live upon him. <I>He is our life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:4">Col. iii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) We have here an account of the ends of this institution. 

 [1.] It was appointed to be done <I>in remembrance of Christ,</I> to 
 keep fresh in our minds an ancient favour, his dying for us, as well as 
 to remember an absent friend, even Christ interceding for us, in virtue 
 of his death, at God's right hand. The best of friends, and the 
 greatest acts of kindness, are here to be remembered, with the exercise 
 of suitable affections and graces. The motto on this ordinance, and the 
 very meaning of it, is, <I>When this you see, remember me.</I>

 [2.] It was <I>to show forth Christ's death,</I> to declare and publish 
 it. It is not barely in remembrance of Christ, of what he has done and 
 suffered, that this ordinance was instituted; but to commemorate, to 
 celebrate, his glorious condescension and grace in our redemption. We 
 declare his death to be our life, the spring of all our comforts and 
 hopes. And we glory in such a declaration; we show forth his death, and 
 spread it before God, as our accepted sacrifice and ransom. We set it 
 in view of our own faith, for our own comfort and quickening; and we 
 own before the world, by this very service, that we are the disciples 
 of Christ, who trust in him alone for salvation and acceptance with 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) It is moreover hinted here, concerning this ordinance, 

 [1.] That it should be frequent: <I>As often as you eat this bread,</I> 
 &c. Our bodily meals return often; we cannot maintain life and health 
 without this. And it is fit that this spiritual diet should be taken 
 often tool The ancient churches celebrated this ordinance every Lord's 
 day, if not every day when they assembled for worship.

 [2.] That it must be perpetual. It is to be celebrated <I>till the Lord 
 shall come;</I> till he shall come the second time, without sin, for 
 the salvation of those that believe, and to judge the world. This is 
 our warrant for keeping this feast. It was our Lord's will that we 
 should thus celebrate the memorials of his death and passion, till he 
 come in his own glory, and the Father's glory, with his holy angels, 
 and put an end to the present state of things, and his own mediatorial 
 administration, by passing the final sentence. Note, The Lord's supper 
 is not a temporary, but a standing and perpetual ordinance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He lays before the Corinthians the danger of receiving unworthily, 
 of prostituting this institution as they did, and using it to the 
 purposes of feasting and faction, with intentions opposite to its 
 design, or a temper of mind altogether unsuitable to it; or keeping up 
 the covenant with sin and death, while they are there professedly 
 renewing and confirming their covenant with God. 

 1. It is great guilt which such contract. They shall <I>be guilty of
 the body and blood of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 of violating this sacred institution, of despising his body and blood. 
 They act as if they <I>counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith 
 they are sanctified, an unholy thing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:29">Heb. x. 29</A>.

 They profane the institution, and in a manner crucify their Saviour
 over again. Instead of being cleansed by his blood, they are guilty of 
 his blood.

 2. It is a great hazard which they run: <I>They eat and drink judgment
 to themselves,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 They provoke God, and are likely to bring down punishment on 
 themselves. No doubt but they incur great guilt, and so render
 themselves liable to damnation, to spiritual judgments and eternal 
 misery. Every sin is in its own nature damning; and therefore surely so 
 heinous a sin as profaning such a holy ordinance is so. And it is 
 profaned in the grossest sense by such irreverence and rudeness as the 
 Corinthians were guilty of. But fearful believers should not be 
 discouraged from attending at this holy ordinance by the sound of these 
 words, as if they bound upon themselves the sentence of damnation by 
 coming to the table of the Lord unprepared. Thus sin, as well as all 
 others, leaves room for forgiveness upon repentance; and the Holy 
 Spirit never indited this passage of scripture to deter serious 
 Christians from their duty, though the devil has often made this 
 advantage of it, and robbed good Christians of their choicest comforts.
 The Corinthians came to the Lord's table as to a common feast, <I>not 
 discerning the Lord's body</I>--not making a difference or distinction 
 between that and common food, but setting both on a level: nay, they 
 used much more indecency at this sacred feast than they would have done 
 at a civil one. This was very sinful in them, and very displeasing to 
 God, and brought down his judgments on them: <I>For this cause many are 
 weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</I> Some were punished with 
 sickness, and some with death. Note, A careless and irreverent 
 receiving of the Lord's supper may bring temporal punishments. Yet the 
 connection seems to imply that even those who were thus punished were 
 in a state of favour with God, at least many of them: <I>They were 
 chastened of the Lord, that they should not be condemned with the 
 world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Now divine chastening is a sign of divine love: <I>Whom the Lord loveth 
 he chasteneth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:6">Heb. xii. 6</A>),

 especially with so merciful a purpose, to prevent their final 
 condemnation. In the midst of judgment, God remembers mercy: he 
 frequently punishes those whom he tenderly loves. It is kindness to
 use the rod to prevent the child's ruin. He will visit such iniquity as 
 this under consideration with stripes, and yet make those stripes the 
 evidence of his lovingkindness. Those were in the favour of God who yet 
 so highly offended him in this instance, and brought down judgments on 
 themselves; at least many of them were; for they were punished by him 
 out of fatherly good-will, punished now that they might not perish for 
 ever. Note, It is better to bear trouble in this world than to be 
 miserable to eternity. And God punishes his people now, to prevent 
 their eternal woe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He points out the duty of those who would come to the Lord's table. 
 
 1. In general: <I>Let a man examine himself</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 try and approve himself. Let him consider the sacred intention of this 
 holy ordinance, its nature, and use, and compare his own views in 
 attending on it and his disposition of mind for it; and, when he has 
 approved himself to his own conscience in the sight of God, then let 
 him attend. Such self-examination is necessary to a right attendance
 at this holy ordinance. Note, Those who, through weakness of 
 understanding, cannot try themselves, are by no means fit to eat of 
 this bread and drink of this cup; nor those who, upon a fair trial, 
 have just ground to charge themselves with impenitency, unbelief, and 
 alienation from the life of God. Those should have the wedding-garment 
 on who would be welcome at this marriage-feast--grace in habit, and 
 grace in exercise. 

 2. The duty of those who were yet unpunished for their profanation of
 this ordinance: <I>If we would judge ourselves, we should not be 
 judged,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 If we would thoroughly search and explore ourselves, and condemn and 
 correct what we find amiss, we should prevent divine judgments. Note,
 To be exact and severe on ourselves and our own conduct is the most 
 proper way in the world not to fall under the just severity of our 
 heavenly Father. We must not judge others, lest we be judged

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:1">Matt. vii. 1</A>);
 
 but we must judge ourselves, to prevent our being judged and condemned
 by God. We may be critical as to ourselves, but should be very candid 
 in judging others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He closes all with a caution against the irregularities of which 
 they were guilty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>),

 charging them to avoid all indecency at the Lord's table. They were to 
 eat for hunger and pleasure only at home, and not to change the holy 
 supper to a common feast; and much less eat up the provisions before 
 those who could bring none did partake of them, lest they should come 
 together for condemnation. Note, Our holy duties, through our own 
 abuse, may prove matter of condemnation. Christians may keep Sabbaths, 
 hear sermons, attend at sacraments, and only aggravate guilt, and bring 
 on a heavier doom. A sad but serious truth! O! let all look to it that 
 they do not come together at any time to God's worship, and all the 
 while provoke him, and bring down vengeance on themselves. Holy things 
 are to be used in a holy manner, or else they are profaned. What else 
 was amiss in this matter, he tells them, he would rectify when he came 
 to them.</P>
