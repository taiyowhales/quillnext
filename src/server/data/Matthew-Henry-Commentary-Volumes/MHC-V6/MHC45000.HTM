 we may compare scripture with scripture, and take the opinion of some 
 devout and pious persons, in the Old Testament David's Psalms, and in 
 the New Testament Paul's Epistles, are stars of the first magnitude, 
 that differ from the other stars in glory. The whole scripture is 
 indeed an epistle from heaven to earth: but in it we have upon record 
 several particular epistles, more of Paul's than of any other, for he 
 was the chief of the apostles, and laboured more abundantly than they 
 all. His natural parts, I doubt not, were very pregnant; his 
 apprehension was quick and piercing; his expressions were fluent and 
 copious; his affections, wherever he took, very warm and zealous, and 
 his resolutions no less bold and daring: this made him, before his 
 conversion, a very keen and bitter persecutor; but when the strong man 
 armed was dispossessed, and the stronger than he came to divide the 
 spoil and to sanctify these qualifications, he became the most skilful 
 zealous preacher; never any better fitted to win souls, nor more 
 successful. Fourteen of his epistles we have in the canon of scripture; 
 many more, it is probable, he wrote in the course of his ministry, 
 which might be profitable enough for doctrine, for reproof, &c., but, 
 not being given by inspiration of God, they were not received as 
 canonical scripture, nor handed down to us. Six epistles, said to be 
 Paul's, written to Seneca, and eight of Seneca's to him, are spoken of 
 by some of the ancients [<I>Sixt. Senens. Biblioth. Sanct.</I> lib. 2] 
 and are extant; but, upon the first view, they appear spurious and 
 counterfeit.</P>

 This epistle to the Romans is placed first, not because of the priority 
 of its date, but because of the superlative excellency of the epistle, 
 it being one of the longest and fullest of all, and perhaps because of 
 the dignity of the place to which it is written. Chrysostom would have 
 this epistle read over to him twice a week. It is gathered from some 
 passages in the epistle that it was written <I>Anno Christi</I> 56, 
 from Corinth, while Paul made a short stay there in his way to Troas,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:5,6">Acts xx. 5, 6</A>.

 He commendeth to the Romans Phebe, a servant of the church at Cenchrea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:1"><I>ch.</I> xvi.</A>),

 which was a place belonging to Corinth. He calls Gaius his <I>host,</I>
 or the man with whom he lodged

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:23"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 23</A>),

 and he was a Corinthian, not the same with Gaius of Derbe, mentioned
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:4">Acts xx</A>.

 Paul was now going up to Jerusalem, with the money that was given to
 the poor saints there; and of that he speaks,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:26"><I>ch.</I> xv. 26</A>.

 The great mysteries treated of in this epistle must needs produce in
 this, as in other writings of Paul, many things dark and hard to be
 understood,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:16">2 Peter iii. 16</A>.

 The method of this (as of several other of the epistles) is observable;
 the former part of it doctrinal, in the first eleven chapters; the 
 latter part practical, in the last five: to inform the judgment and to 
 reform the life. And the best way to understand the truths explained in 
 the former part is to abide and abound in the practice of the duties 
 prescribed in the latter part; for, if any man will do his will, he 
 shall know of the doctrine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The doctrinal part of the epistles instructs us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning the way of salvation 

 (1.) The foundation of it laid in justification, and that not by the 
 Gentiles' works of nature

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:32"><I>ch.</I> i.</A>),

 nor by the Jews' works of the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:1-3:31"><I>ch.</I> ii., iii.</A>),

 for both Jews and Gentiles were liable to the curse; but only by faith
 in Jesus Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:21-4:25"><I>ch.</I> iii. 21, &c.; <I>ch.</I> iv</A>.

 (2.) The steps of this salvation are,
 
 [1.] Peace with God,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:1-21"><I>ch.</I> v</A>.

 [2.] Sanctification,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:1-7:25"><I>ch.</I> vi., vii</A>.

 [3.] Glorification,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:1-39"><I>ch.</I> viii</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Concerning the persons saved, such as belong to the election of 
 grace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:1-33"><I>ch.</I> ix.</A>),
 
 Gentiles and Jews,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:1-11:36"><I>ch.</I> x., xi</A>.

 By this is appears that the subject he discourses of were such as were
 then the present truths, as the apostle speaks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:12">2 Peter i. 12</A>.

 Two things the Jews then stumbled at--justification by faith without
 the works of the law, and the admission of the Gentiles into the 
 church; and therefore both these he studied to clear and vindicate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The practical part follows, wherein we find, 

 1. Several general exhortations proper for all Christians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1-21"><I>ch.</I> xii</A>.

 2. Directions for our behaviour, as members of civil society,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:1-14"><I>ch.</I> xiii</A>.

 3. Rules for the conduct of Christians to one another, as members of
 the Christian church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:1-15:14"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 
 and <I>ch.</I> xv. 1-14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. As he draws towards a conclusion, he makes an apology for writing
 to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:14-16"><I>ch.</I> xv. 14-16</A>),

 gives them an account of himself and his own affairs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:17-21"><I>v.</I> 17-21</A>),

 promises them a visit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:22-29"><I>v.</I> 22-29</A>),

 begs their prayers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:30-32"><I>v.</I> 30-32</A>),

 sends particular salutations to many friends there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:1-16"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 1-16</A>),

 warns them against those who caused divisions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:17-20"><I>v.</I> 17-20</A>),

 adds the salutations of his friends with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:21-23"><I>v.</I> 21-23</A>),

 and ends with a benediction to them and a doxology to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:24-27"><I>v.</I> 24-27</A>).</P>
