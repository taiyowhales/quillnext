 In this chapter the apostle applies what he had said in the chapter 
 foregoing concerning the priesthood of Christ, 

 I. In a serious pathetic exhortation that this great high priest, who
 was discovered to them, might be seriously considered by them,

 II. He then adds many weighty counsels and cautions,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,
 consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ
 Jesus;
 &nbsp; 2  Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses
 <I>was faithful</I> in all his house.
 &nbsp; 3  For this <I>man</I> was counted worthy of more glory than Moses,
 inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than
 the house.
 &nbsp; 4  For every house is builded by some <I>man;</I> but he that built
 all things <I>is</I> God.
 &nbsp; 5  And Moses verily <I>was</I> faithful in all his house, as a
 servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken
 after;
 &nbsp; 6  But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we,
 if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm
 unto the end.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have the application of the doctrine laid down in 
 the close of the last chapter concerning the priesthood of our Lord 
 Jesus Christ. And observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In how fervent and affectionate a manner the apostle exhorts 
 Christians to have this high priest much in their thoughts, and to make 
 him the object of their close and serious consideration; and surely no 
 one in earth or heaven deserves our consideration more than he. That 
 this exhortation might be made the more effectual, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The honourable compellation used towards those to whom he wrote: 
 <I>Holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling.</I> 

 (1.) Brethren, not only my brethren, but the brethren of Christ, and in 
 him brethren to all the saints. All the people of God are brethren, and 
 should love and live like brethren. 

 (2.) Holy brethren; holy not only in profession and title, but in 
 principle and practice, in heart and life. This has been turned by some 
 into scorn: "These," say they, "are the holy brethren;" but it is 
 dangerous jesting with such edge-tools; <I>be not mockers, lest your 
 bands be made strong.</I> Let those that are thus despised and scorned 
 labour to be holy brethren indeed, and approve themselves so to God; 
 and they need not be ashamed of the title nor dread the scoffs of the 
 profane. The day is coming when those that make this a term of reproach 
 would count it their greatest honour and happiness to be taken into 
 this sacred brotherhood. 

 (3.) <I>Partakers of the heavenly calling</I>--partakers of the means 
 of grace, and of the Spirit of grace, that came from heaven, and by 
 which Christians are effectually called out of darkness into marvelous 
 light, that calling which brings down heaven into the souls of men, 
 raises them up to a heavenly temper and conversation, and prepares them 
 to live for ever with God in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The titles he gives to Christ, whom he would have them consider, 
 
 (1.) As the apostle of our profession, the prime-minister of the gospel 
 church, a messenger and a principal messenger sent of God to men, upon 
 the most important errand, the great revealer of that faith which we 
 profess to hold and of that hope which we profess to have. 

 (2.) Not only the apostle, but the high priest too, of our profession, 
 the chief officer of the Old Testament as well as the New, the head of 
 the church in every state, and under each dispensation, upon whose 
 satisfaction and intercession we profess to depend for pardon of sin, 
 and acceptance with God. 

 (3.) As Christ, the Messiah, anointed and every way qualified for the 
 office both of apostle and high priest.

 (4.) As Jesus, our Saviour, our healer, the great physician of souls, 
 typified by the brazen serpent that Moses lifted up in the wilderness, 
 that those who were stung by the fiery serpents might look to him, and 
 be saved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have the duty we owe to him who bears all these high and 
 honourable titles, and that is to consider him as thus characterized. 
 Consider what he is in himself, what he is to us, and what he will be 
 to us hereafter and for ever; consider him, fix your thoughts upon him 
 with the greatest attention, and act towards him accordingly; look unto 
 Jesus, the author and finisher of your faith. Here observe, 

 1. Many that profess faith in Christ have not a due consideration for
 him; he is not so much thought of as he deserves to be, and desires to 
 be, by those that expect salvation from him. 

 2. Close and serious consideration of Christ would be of great
 advantage to us to increase our acquaintance with him, and to engage 
 our love and our obedience to him, and reliance on him. 

 3. Even those that are holy brethren, and partakers of the heavenly
 calling, have need to stir up one another to think more of Christ than 
 they do, to have him more in their minds; the best of his people think 
 too seldom and too slightly of him. 

 4. We must consider Christ as he is described to us in the scriptures,
 and form our apprehensions of him thence, not from any vain conceptions 
 and fancies of our own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have several arguments drawn up to enforce this duty of 
 considering Christ the apostle and high priest of our profession.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The first is taken from his fidelity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He was faithful to him that appointed him, as Moses was in all his 
 house.

 (1.) Christ is an appointed Mediator; God the Father has sent and 
 sealed him to that office, and therefore his mediation is acceptable to 
 the Father. 

 (2.) He is faithful to that appointment, punctually observing all the 
 rules and orders of his mediation, and fully executing the trust 
 reposed in him by his Father and by his people.

 (3.) That he is as faithful to him that appointed him as Moses was in 
 all his house. Moses was faithful in the discharge of his office to the 
 Jewish church in the Old Testament, and so is Christ under the New; 
 this was a proper argument to urge upon the Jews, who had so high an 
 opinion of the faithfulness of Moses, and yet his faithfulness was but 
 typical of Christ's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Another argument is taken from the superior glory and excellence of 
 Christ above Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:3-6"><I>v.</I> 3-6</A>);

 therefore they were more obliged to consider Christ. 

 (1.) Christ was a maker of the house, Moses but a member in it. By the 
 house we are to understand the church of God, the people of God 
 incorporated together under Christ their maker and head, and under 
 subordinate officers, according to his law, observing his institutions. 
 Christ is the maker of this house of the church in all ages: Moses was 
 a minister in the house, he was instrumental under Christ in governing 
 and edifying the house, but Christ is the maker of all things; for he 
 is God, and no one less than God could build the church, either lay the 
 foundation or carry on the superstructure. No less power was requisite 
 to make the church than to make the world; the world was made out of 
 nothing, the church made out of materials altogether unfit for such a 
 building. Christ, who is God, drew the ground-plan of the church,
 provided the materials, and by almighty power disposed them to receive 
 the form; he has compacted and united this his house, has settled the 
 orders of it, and crowned all with his own presence, which is the true 
 glory of this house of God. 

 (2.) Christ was the master of this house, as well as the maker, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 This house is styled his house, as the Son of God. Moses was only a
 faithful servant, for a testimony of those things that were afterwards 
 to be revealed. Christ, as the eternal Son of God, is the rightful 
 owner and sovereign ruler of the church. Moses was only a typical 
 governor, for a testimony of all those things relating to the church 
 which would be more clearly, completely, and comfortably revealed in 
 the gospel by the Spirit of Christ; and therefore Christ is worthy of 
 more glory than Moses, and of greater regard and consideration. This 
 argument the apostle concludes,

 [1.] With a comfortable accommodation of it to himself and all true 
 believers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>).

 <I>Whose house we are:</I> each of us personally, as we are the temples 
 of the Holy Ghost, and Christ dwells in us by faith; all of us jointly, 
 as we are united by the bonds of graces, truths, ordinances, gospel 
 discipline, and devotions. 

 [2.] With a characteristic description of those persons who constitute 
 this house: "<I>If we hold fast the confidence, and the rejoicing of 
 the hope, firmly to the end;</I> that is, if we maintain a bold and 
 open profession of the truths of the gospel, upon which our hopes of 
 grace and glory are built, and live upon and up to those hopes, so as 
 to have a holy rejoicing in them, which shall abide firm to the end, 
 notwithstanding all that we may meet with in so doing." So that you see 
 there must not only be a setting out well in the ways of Christ, but a 
 stedfastness and perseverance therein unto the end. We have here a 
 direction what those must do who would partake of the dignity and 
 privileges of the household of Christ. <I>First,</I> They must take
 the truths of the gospel into their heads and hearts. <I>Secondly,</I>
 They must build their hopes of happiness upon those truths. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> They must make an open profession of those truths. 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> They must live so up to them as to keep their 
 evidences clear, that they may rejoice in hope, and then they must in 
 all persevere to the end. In a word, they must walk closely, 
 consistently, courageously, and constantly, in the faith and practice 
 of the gospel, that their Master, when he comes, may own and approve 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear
 his voice,
 &nbsp; 8  Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of
 temptation in the wilderness:
 &nbsp; 9  When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works
 forty years.
 &nbsp; 10  Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They
 do alway err in <I>their</I> heart; and they have not known my ways.
 &nbsp; 11  So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
 &nbsp; 12  Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil
 heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
 &nbsp; 13  But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day;
 lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
 &nbsp; 14  For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the
 beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
 &nbsp; 15  While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden
 not your hearts, as in the provocation.
 &nbsp; 16  For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all
 that came out of Egypt by Moses.
 &nbsp; 17  But with whom was he grieved forty years? <I>was it</I> not with
 them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
 &nbsp; 18  And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his
 rest, but to them that believed not?
 &nbsp; 19  So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle proceeds in pressing upon them serious counsels and 
 cautions to the close of the chapter; and he recites a passage out of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:7">Ps. xc. 7</A>,

 &c., where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What he counsels them to do--to give a speedy and present attention
 to the call of Christ. "Hear his voice, assent to, approve of, and 
 consider, what God in Christ speaks unto you; apply it to yourselves 
 with suitable affections and endeavours, and set about it this very 
 day, for to-morrow it may be too late."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What he cautions them against--hardening their hearts, turning the
 deaf ear to the calls and counsels of Christ: "When he tells you of the 
 evil of sin, the excellency of holiness, the necessity of receiving him 
 by faith as your Saviour, do not shut your ear and heart against such a 
 voice as this." Observe, The hardening of our hearts is the spring of 
 all our other sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Whose example he warns them by--that of the Israelites their
 fathers in the wilderness: <I>As in the provocation and day of 
 temptation;</I> this refers to that remarkable passage at Massah 
 Meribah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:2-7">Exod. xvii. 2-7</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Days of temptation are often days of provocation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To provoke God, when he is trying us, and letting us see that we 
 entirely depend and live immediately upon him, is a provocation with a 
 witness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The sins of others, especially our relations, should be a warning to 
 us. Our fathers' sins and punishments should be remembered by us, to 
 deter us from following their evil examples. Now as to the sin of the 
 fathers of the Jews, here reflected upon, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The state in which these fathers were, when they thus sinned: they 
 were in the wilderness, brought out of Egypt, but not got into Canaan, 
 the thoughts whereof should have restrained them from sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The sin they were guilty of: they tempted and provoked God; they 
 distrusted God, murmured against Moses, and would not attend to the 
 voice of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The aggravations of their sin: they sinned in the wilderness, 
 where they had a more immediate dependence upon God: they sinned when 
 God was trying them; they sinned when they saw his works--works of
 wonder wrought for their deliverance out of Egypt, and their support 
 and supply in the wilderness from day to day. They continued thus to 
 sin against God for forty years. These were heinous aggravations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The source and spring of such aggravated sins, which were, 

 [1.] They erred in their hearts; and these heart-errors produced many 
 other errors in their lips and lives.

 [2.] They did not know God's ways, though he had walked before them. 
 They did not know his ways; neither those ways of his providence in 
 which he had walked towards them, nor those ways of his precept in 
 which they ought to have walked towards God; they did not observe 
 either his providences or his ordinances in a right manner.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The just and great resentment God had at their sins, and yet the
 great patience he exercised towards them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Wherefore I was grieved with that generation.</I> Note, 

 [1.] All sin, especially sin committed by God's professing privileged 
 people, does not only anger and affront God, but it grieves him.

 [2.] God is loth to destroy his people in or for their sin, he waits 
 long to be gracious to them.

 [3.] God keeps an exact account of the time that people go on in 
 sinning against him, and in grieving him by their sins; but at length, 
 if they by their sins continue to grieve the Spirit of God, their sins 
 shall be made grievous to their own spirits, either in a way of 
 judgment or mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) The irreversible doom passed upon them at last for their sins. God 
 swore in his wrath that they should not enter into his rest, the rest 
 either of an earthly or of a heavenly Canaan. Observe, 

 [1.] Sin, long continued in, will kindle the divine wrath, and make it 
 flame out against sinners.

 [2.] God's wrath will discover itself in its righteous resolution to 
 destroy the impenitent; he will swear in his wrath, not rashly, but 
 righteously, and his wrath will make their condition a restless 
 condition; there is no resting under the wrath of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What use the apostle makes of their awful example, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>,

 &c. He gives the Hebrews a proper caution, and enforces it with an
 affectionate compellation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He gives the Hebrews a proper caution; the word is, <I>Take 
 heed,</I> <B><I>blepete</I></B>--<I>look to it.</I> "Look about you; be
 upon your guard against enemies both within and without; be 
 circumspect. You see what kept many of your forefathers out of Canaan, 
 and made their carcasses fall in the wilderness; take heed lest you 
 fall into the same sin and snare and dreadful sentence. For you see 
 Christ is head of the church, a much greater person than Moses, and 
 your contempt of him must be a greater sin than their contempt of 
 Moses; and so you are in danger of falling under a severer sentence 
 than they." Observe, The ruin of others should be a warning to us to 
 take heed of the rock they split upon. Israel's fall should for ever be
 a warning to all who come after them; for <I>all these things happened
 to them for ensamples</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:11">1 Cor. x. 11</A>),

 and should be remembered by us. Take heed; all who would get safely to 
 heaven must look about them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He enforces the admonition with an affectionate compellation: 
 "<I>Brethren,</I> not only in the flesh, but in the Lord; brethren whom 
 I love, and for whose welfare I labour and long." And here he enlarges 
 upon the matter of the admonition: <I>Take heed, brethren, lest there 
 be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living 
 God.</I> Here observe, 

 (1.) A heart of unbelief is an evil heart. Unbelief is a great sin, it
 vitiates the heart of man. 

 (2.) An evil heart of unbelief is at the bottom of all our sinful 
 departures from God; it is a leading step to apostasy; if once we allow 
 ourselves to distrust God, we may soon desert him. 

 (3.) Christian brethren have need to be cautioned against apostasy. 
 <I>Let those that think they stand take heed lest they fall.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He subjoins good counsel to the caution, and advises them to that 
 which would be a remedy against this evil heart of unbelief--that they
 should <I>exhort one another daily, while it is called to-day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) We should be doing all the good we can to one another while we are 
 together, which will be but a short and uncertain time.

 (2.) Since to-morrow is none of ours, we must make the best improvement 
 of to-day.

 (3.) If Christians do not exhort one another daily, they will be in 
 danger of being hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. Note,

 [1.] There is a great deal of deceitfulness in sin; it appears fair, 
 but is filthy; it appears pleasant, but is pernicious; it promises 
 much, but performs nothing.

 [2.] The deceitfulness of sin is of a hardening nature to the soul; one 
 sin allowed prepares for another; every act of sin confirms the habit; 
 sinning against conscience is the way to sear the conscience; and 
 therefore it should be the great concern of every one to exhort himself 
 and others to beware of sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He comforts those who not only set out well, but hold on well, and 
 hold out to the end 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>We are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our 
 confidence stedfast to the end.</I> Here observe, 

 (1.) The saints' privilege: they are made partakers of Christ, that is, 
 of the Spirit, nature, graces, righteousness, and life of Christ; they 
 are interested in all that is Christ's, in all that he is, in all that 
 he has done, or can do. 

 (2.) The condition on which they hold that privilege, namely, their 
 perseverance in the bold and open profession and practice of Christ and 
 Christianity unto the end. Not but they shall persevere, being kept by 
 the mighty power of God through faith to salvation, but to be pressed 
 thus to it is one means by which Christ helps his people to persevere. 
 This tends to make them watchful and diligent, and so keeps them from 
 apostasy. Here observe, 

 [1.] The same spirit with which Christians set out in the ways of God 
 they should maintain and evidence to the end. Those who begin
 seriously, and with lively affections and holy resolutions and humble 
 reliance, should go on in the same spirit. But,

 [2.] There are a great many who in the beginning of their profession 
 show a great deal of courage and confidence, but do not hold them fast 
 to the end. 

 [3.] Perseverance in faith is the best evidence of the sincerity of our 
 faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The apostle resumes what he had quoted before from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:7">Ps. xc. 7</A>,

 &c., and he applies it closely to those of that generation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>,

 &c. While it is said, <I>To-day if you will hear,</I> &c.; as if he
 should say, "What was recited before from that scripture belonged not 
 only to former ages, but to you now, and to all who shall come after 
 you; that you take heed you fall not into the same sins, lest you fall 
 under the same condemnation." The apostle tells them that though some 
 who had heard the voice of God did provoke him, yet all did not so. 
 Observe, 

 (1.) Though the majority of hearers provoked God by unbelief, yet some 
 there were who believed the report. 

 (2.) Though the hearing of the word be the ordinary means of salvation, 
 yet, if it be not hearkened to, it will expose men more to the anger of 
 God. 

 (3.) God will have a remnant that shall be obedient to his voice, and 
 he will take care of such and make mention of them with honour.

 (4.) If these should fall in a common calamity, yet they shall partake 
 of eternal salvation, while disobedient hearers perish for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The apostle puts some queries upon what had been before mentioned, 
 and gives proper answers to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:17-19"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>):

 <I>But with whom was he grieved forty years? With those that sinned. 
 And to whom did he swear?</I> &c. Whence observe, 

 (1.) God is grieved only with those of his people who sin against him, 
 and continue in sin.

 (2.) God is grieved and provoked most by sins publicly committed by the 
 generality of a nation; when sin becomes epidemic, it is most 
 provoking. 

 (3.) Though God grieves long, and bears long, when pressed with the
 weight of general and prevailing wickedness, yet he will at length ease 
 himself of public offenders by public judgments. 

 (4.) Unbelief (with rebellion which is the consequent of it) is the
 great damning sin of the world, especially of those who have a 
 revelation of the mind and will of God. This sin shuts up the heart of 
 God, and shuts up the gate of heaven, against them; it lays them under 
 the wrath and curse of God, and leaves them there; so that in truth and 
 justice to himself he is obliged to cast them off for ever.</P>
