 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The sin and punishment of Ananias and Sapphira, who, for lying to
 the Holy Ghost, were struck dead at the word of Peter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. The flourishing state of the church, in the power that went along
 with the preaching of the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:12-16">ver. 12-16</A>.

 III. The imprisonment of the apostles, and their miraculous discharge
 out of prison, with fresh orders to go on to preach the gospel, which
 they did, to the great vexation of their persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:17-26">ver. 17-26</A>.

 IV. Their arraignment before the great sanhedrim, and their
 justification of themselves in what they did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:27-33">ver. 27-33</A>.

 V. Gamaliel's counsel concerning them, that they should not persecute
 them, but let them alone, and see what would come of it, and their
 concurrence, for the present, with this advice, in the dismission of
 the apostles with no more than a scourging,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:34-40">ver. 34-40</A>.

 VI. The apostles' cheerful progress in their work notwithstanding the
 prohibition laid upon them and the indignity done them,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold
 a possession,
 &nbsp; 2 And kept back <I>part</I> of the price, his wife also being privy
 <I>to it,</I> and brought a certain part, and laid <I>it</I> at the
 apostles' feet.
 &nbsp; 3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to
 lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back <I>part</I> of the price of
 the land?
 &nbsp; 4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was
 sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this
 thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.
 &nbsp; 5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the
 ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.
 &nbsp; 6 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried <I>him</I> out,
 and buried <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 7 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his
 wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
 &nbsp; 8 And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land
 for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.
 &nbsp; 9 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed
 together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of
 them which have buried thy husband <I>are</I> at the door, and shall
 carry thee out.
 &nbsp; 10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up
 the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and,
 carrying <I>her</I> forth, buried <I>her</I> by her husband.
 &nbsp; 11 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as
 heard these things.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The chapter begins with a melancholy <I>but,</I> which puts a stop to 
 the pleasant and agreeable prospect of things which we had in the 
 foregoing chapters; as every man, so every church, in its best state 
 has its <I>but.</I> 

 1. The disciples were very holy, and heavenly, and seemed to be all
 exceedingly good; <I>but</I> there were hypocrites among them, whose 
 <I>hearts were not right in the sight of God,</I> who, when they were 
 baptized, and took upon them <I>the form of godliness, denied the power 
 of godliness,</I> and stopped short of that. There is a mixture of bad 
 with good in the best societies on this side heaven; tares will grow 
 among the wheat until the harvest. 

 2. It was the praise of the disciples that they came up to that 
 perfection which Christ recommended to the rich young man--they <I>sold
 what they had, and gave to the poor; but</I> even that proved a cloak 
 and cover of hypocrisy which was thought the greatest proof and 
 evidence of sincerity. 

 3. The signs and wonders which the apostles wrought were hitherto
 miracles of mercy; <I>but</I> now comes in a miracle of judgment, and 
 here is an instance of severity following the instances of goodness, 
 that God may be both loved and feared. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sin of Ananias and Sapphira his wife. It is good to see husband 
 and wife joining together in that which is good, but to be confederate 
 in evil is to be like Adam and Eve, when they agreed to eat the 
 forbidden fruit, and were one in their disobedience. Now their sin was, 
 
 1. That they were ambitious of being thought eminent disciples, and of
 the first rank, when really they were not true disciples; they would 
 pass for some of the most fruitful trees in Christ's vineyard, when 
 really the root of the matter was not found in them. They <I>sold a 
 possession, and brought the money</I> (as Barnabas did) <I>to the 
 apostles' feet,</I> that they might not seem to be behind the very 
 chief of believers, but might be applauded and cried up, and stand so 
 much the fairer for preferment in the church, which perhaps they 
 thought would shortly shine in secular pomp and grandeur. Note, It is 
 possible that hypocrites may deny themselves in one thing, but then it 
 is to serve themselves in another; they may forego their secular 
 advantage in one instance, with a prospect of finding their account in 
 something else. Ananias and Sapphira would take upon them a profession 
 of Christianity, <I>and make a fair show in the flesh</I> with it, and 
 so would mock God, and deceive others, when they knew they could not go 
 through with the Christian profession. It was commendable, and so far 
 it was right, in that rich young man, that he would not pretend to 
 follow Christ, when, if it should come to a pinch, he knew he could not 
 come up to his terms, <I>but he went away sorrowful.</I> Ananias and 
 Sapphira pretended they could come up to the terms, that they might 
 have the credit of being disciples, when really they could not, and so 
 were a discredit to discipleship. Note, It is often of fatal 
 consequence for people to go a greater length in profession than their 
 inward principle will admit of. 

 2. That they were covetous of the wealth of the world, and distrustful 
 of God and his providence: <I>They sold their land,</I> and perhaps 
 then, in a pang of zeal, designed no other than to dedicate the whole 
 of the purchase-money to pious uses, and made a vow, or at least 
 conceived a full purpose, to do so; but, when the money was received, 
 their heart failed them, and <I>they kept back part of the price,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 because they loved the money, and thought it was too much to part with 
 at once, and to trust in the apostles' hands, and because they knew not 
 but they might want it themselves; though now all things were common, 
 yet it would not be so long, and what should they do in a time of need, 
 if they should leave themselves nothing to take to? They could not take 
 God's word that they should be provided for, but thought they would 
 play a wiser part than the rest had done, and lay up for a rainy day. 
 Thus they thought to serve both God and mammon--God, by bringing part
 of the money to the apostles' feet, and mammon, by keeping the other 
 part in their own pockets; as if there were not an all-sufficiency in 
 God to make up the whole to them, except they retained some in their 
 own hands by way of caution-money. Their hearts were divided, so 
 <I>they were found faulty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:2">Hos. x. 2</A>.

 They <I>halted between two;</I> if they had been thorough-paced
 worldlings, they would not have sold their possession; and, if they had 
 been thorough-paced Christians, they would not have detained part of
 the price. 

 3. That they thought to deceive the apostles, and make them believe
 they brought the whole purchase-money, when really it was but a part. 
 They came with as good an assurance, and as great a show of piety and 
 devotion, as any of them, and <I>laid the money at the apostles' 
 feet,</I> as if it were their all. They dissembled with God and his 
 Spirit, with Christ and his church and ministers; and this was their 
 sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The indictment of Ananias, which proved both his condemnation and 
 execution for this sin. When he brought the money, and expected to be 
 commended and encouraged, as others were, Peter took him to task about 
 it, He, without any enquiry or examination of witnesses concerning it, 
 charges him peremptorily with the crime, and aggravates it, and lays a 
 load upon him for it, showing it to him in its own colour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 The Spirit of God in Peter not only discovered the fact without any 
 information (when perhaps no man in the world knew it but the man and 
 his wife themselves), but likewise discerned the principle of reigning 
 infidelity in the heart of Ananias, which was at the bottom of it, and 
 therefore proceeded against him so suddenly. Had it been a sin of 
 infirmity, through the surprise of a temptation, Peter would have taken 
 Ananias aside, and have bidden him go home, and fetch the rest of the 
 money, and repent of his folly in attempting to put this cheat upon 
 them; but he knew <I>that his heart was fully set in him to do this 
 evil,</I> and therefore allowed him not space to repent. He here showed 
 him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The origin of his sin: <I>Satan filled his heart;</I> he not only 
 suggested it to him, and put it into his head, but hurried him on with 
 resolution to do it. Whatever is contrary to the good Spirit proceeds 
 from the evil spirit, and those hearts are filled by Satan in which 
 worldliness reigns, and has the ascendant. Some think that Ananias was 
 one of those that had received the Holy Ghost, and was filled with his 
 gifts, but, having provoked the Spirit to withdraw from him, now 
 <I>Satan filled his heart;</I> as, <I>when the Spirit of the Lord 
 departed from Saul, an evil spirit from God troubled him.</I> Satan is 
 a lying spirit; he was so in the mouth of Ahab's prophets, and so he 
 was in the mouth of Ananias, and by this made it appear that he filled 
 his heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The sin itself: <I>He lied to the Holy Ghost;</I> a sin of such a 
 heinous nature that he could not have been guilty of it if Satan had 
 not filled his heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The phrase which we render <I>lying to the Holy Ghost,</I> 
 <B><I>pseusasthai se to pneuma to hagion</I></B>, some read, <I>to 
 belie the Holy Ghost,</I> which may be taken two ways: 

 [1.] That he belied the Holy Ghost in himself; so Dr. Lightfoot takes 
 it, and supposes that Ananias was not an ordinary believer, but a 
 minister, and one that had received the gift of the Holy Ghost with the 
 hundred and twenty (for mention is made of him immediately after 
 Barnabas); yet he durst thus, by dissembling, belie and shame that 
 gift. Or thus; Those who had sold their estates, and laid the money at 
 the apostles' feet, did it by the special impulse of the Holy Ghost, 
 enabling them to do an act so very great and generous; and Ananias 
 pretended that he was moved by the Holy Ghost to do what he did, as 
 others were; whereas it appeared by his baseness that he was not under 
 the influence of the good Spirit at all; for, had it been his work, it 
 would have been perfect. 

 [2.] That he belied the Holy Ghost in the apostles, to whom he brought 
 the money; he misrepresented the Spirit they were actuated by, either 
 by a suspicion that they would not faithfully distribute what they were 
 entrusted with (which was a base suggestion, as if they were false to 
 the trust reposed in them), or by an assurance that they could not 
 discover the fraud. He belied the Holy Ghost when by what he did he 
 would have it thought that those who are endued with the gifts of the 
 Holy Ghost might as easily be imposed upon as other men; like Gehazi, 
 whom his master convicted of his error by that word, <I>Went not my 
 heart with thee?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:26">2 Kings v. 26</A>.

 It is charged upon the house of Israel and Judah, when, like Ananias
 here, they dealt very treacherously, that they belied the Lord, 
 <I>saying, It is not he,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:11,12">Jer. v. 11, 12</A>.

 Thus Ananias thought the apostles were altogether such as himself, and
 this was belying the Holy Ghost in them, as if he were not in them a 
 discerner of spirits, whereas they had all the gifts of the Spirit in 
 them, which to others were divided severally. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:8-11">1 Cor. xii. 8-11</A>.

 Those that pretend to an inspiration of the Spirit, in imposing upon
 the church their own fancies, either in opinion or practice--that say
 they are moved from above when they are carried on by their pride, 
 covetousness, or affectation of dominion, belie the Holy Ghost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) But we read it, <I>to lie unto the Holy Ghost,</I> which reading 
 is countenanced by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>,

 <I>Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.</I> 

 [1.] Ananias told a lie, a deliberate lie, and with a purpose to 
 deceive; he told Peter that he had sold a possession (house or lands) 
 and this was the purchase-money. Perhaps he expressed himself in words 
 that were capable of a double meaning, used some equivocations about 
 it, which he thought might palliate the matter a little, and save him 
 from the guilt of a downright lie: or perhaps he said nothing; but it 
 was all one, he did as the rest did who brought the whole price, and 
 would be thought to do so, and expected the praise those had that did 
 so, and the same privilege and access to the common stock as they had; 
 and therefore it was an implicit protestation that he brought the whole 
 price, as they did; and this was a lie, for he kept back part. Note, 
 Many are brought to gross lying by reigning pride, and affectation of 
 the applause of men, particularly in works of charity to the poor. That 
 therefore we may not be found boasting of a false gift given to us, or 
 given by us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:14">Prov. xxv. 14</A>),

 we must not boast even of a true gift, which is the meaning of our 
 Saviour's caution in works of charity, <I>Let not thy left hand know 
 what thy right hand doeth.</I> Those that boast of good works they 
 never did, or promise good works they never do, or make the good works 
 they do more or better than really they are, come under the guilt of 
 Ananias's lie, which it concerns us all to dread the thought of. 

 [2.] He told this lie <I>to the Holy Ghost.</I> It was not so much to 
 the apostles as to the Holy Ghost in them that the money was brought, 
 and that was said which was said,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>,

 <I>Thou hast not lied unto men</I> (not to men only, not to men 
 chiefly, though the apostles be but men), <I>but thou hast lied unto 
 God.</I> Hence it is justly inferred that the Holy Ghost is God; for he 
 that lieth to the Holy Ghost lieth to God. "Those that lied to the 
 apostles, actuated and acting by the Spirit of God, are said to lie to 
 God, because the apostles acted by the power and authority of God, 
 whence it follows (as Dr. Whitby well observes) that the power and 
 authority of the Spirit must be the power and authority of God." And, 
 as he further argues, "Ananias is said to lie to God, because he lied 
 to that Spirit in the apostles which enabled them to discern the 
 secrets of men's hearts and actions, which being the property of God 
 alone, he that lies to him must therefore lie to God, because he lies 
 to one who has the incommunicable property of God, and consequently the 
 divine essence."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The aggravations of the sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>While it remained, was it not thine own? And, after it was sold, was 
 it not in thine own power?</I> Which may be understood two ways:--

 (1.) "Thou wast under no temptation <I>to keep back part of the 
 price;</I> before it was sold it was thy own, and not mortgaged nor 
 encumbered, nor any way engaged for debt; and when it was sold it was 
 in thy own power to dispose of the money at thy pleasure; so that thou 
 mightest as well have brought the whole as a part. Thou hadst no debts 
 to pay, perhaps no children to provide for; so that thou wast not under 
 the influence of any particular inducement to keep back part of the 
 price. Thou was a transgressor without a cause." Or,

 (2.) "Thou wast under no necessity of selling thy land at all, nor 
 bringing any of the money to the apostles' feet. Thou mightest have 
 kept the money, if thou hadst pleased, and the land too, and never have 
 pretended to this piece of perfection." This rule of charity the 
 apostle gives, that people be not pressed, and that it be not urged as 
 of necessity, because God loves a cheerful giver 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:7">2 Cor. ix. 7</A>),

 and Philemon must do a good work, <I>not as it were of necessity, but 
 willingly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Philem+1:14">Philem. 14</A>.

 As it is better not to vow than to vow and not to pay, so better had it
 been for him not to have sold his land at all than thus to keep back 
 part of the price; not to have pretended to do the good work than thus 
 to do it by the halves. "<I>When it was sold, it was in thine own 
 power;</I> but it was not so when it was vowed: thou hadst then opened 
 thy mouth to the Lord, and couldst not go back." Thus, in giving our 
 hearts to God, we are not admitted to divide them. Satan, like the 
 mother whose own the child was not, would take up with a half; but God 
 will have all or none.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. All this guilt, thus aggravated, is charged upon him: <I>Why hast 
 thou conceived this thing in thine heart?</I> Observe, Though Satan 
 filled his heart to do it, yet he is said to have conceived it in his 
 own heart, which shows that we cannot extenuate our sins by laying the 
 fault of them upon the devil; he tempts, but he cannot force; it is of 
 <I>our own lusts that we are drawn away and enticed.</I> The evil 
 thing, whatever it is, that is said or done, the sinner has conceived 
 it in his own heart; and therefore, <I>if thou scornest, thou alone 
 shalt bear it.</I> The close of the charge is very high, but very just: 
 <I>Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.</I> What emphasis does 
 the prophet lay upon that of Ahaz, <I>not wearying men only, but 
 wearying my God also!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:13">Isa. vii. 13</A>.

 And Moses upon that of Israel, <I>Your murmurings are not against us,
 but against the Lord!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:8">Exod. xvi. 8</A>.

 So here, Thou mightest have imposed upon us, who are men like thyself;
 but, <I>be not deceived, God is not mocked.</I> If we think to put a 
 cheat upon God, we shall prove in the end to have put a fatal cheat 
 upon our own souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The death and burial of Ananias, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He died upon the spot: <I>Ananias, hearing these words, was 
 speechless,</I> in the same sense that he was who was charged with 
 intruding into the wedding feast without a wedding garment: he had 
 nothing to say for himself; but this was not all: he was struck 
 speechless with a witness, for he was struck dead: <I>He fell down, and 
 gave up the ghost.</I> It does not appear whether Peter designed and 
 expected that this would follow upon what he said to him; it is 
 probable that he did, for to Sapphira his wife Peter particularly spoke 
 death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Some think that an angel struck him, that he died, as Herod,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:23"><I>ch.</I> xii. 23</A>.

 Or, his own conscience smote him with such horror and amazement at the
 sense of his guilt, that he sunk and died away under the load of it. 
 And perhaps, when he was convicted of lying to the Holy Ghost, he 
 remembered the unpardonableness of <I>the blasphemy against the Holy 
 Ghost,</I> which struck him like a dagger to the heart. See the power 
 of the word of God in the mouth of the apostles. As it was to some
 <I>a savour of life unto life,</I> so it was to others <I>a savour of 
 death unto death.</I> As there are those whom the gospel justifies, so 
 there are those whom it condemns. This punishment of Ananias may seem 
 severe, but we are sure it was just. 

 (1.) It was designed to maintain the honour of the Holy Ghost as now 
 lately poured out upon the apostles, in order to the setting up of the 
 gospel kingdom. It was a great affront which Ananias put upon the Holy 
 Ghost, as if he could be imposed upon: and it had a direct tendency to 
 invalidate the apostles' testimony; for, if they could not by the 
 Spirit discover this fraud, how could they by this Spirit discover the 
 deep things of God, which they were to reveal to the children of men?
 It was therefore necessary that the credit of the apostles' gifts and 
 powers should be supported, though it was at this expense. 

 (2.) It was designed to deter others from the like presumptions, now at 
 the beginning of this dispensation. Simon Magus afterwards was not
 thus punished, nor Elymas; but Ananias was made an example now at 
 first, that, with the sensible proofs given what a comfortable thing it 
 is to receive the Spirit, there might be also sensible proofs given 
 what a dangerous thing it is to resist the Spirit, and do despite to 
 him. How severely was the worshipping of the golden calf punished, and 
 the gathering of sticks on the sabbath-day, when the laws of the second 
 and fourth commandments were now newly given! So was the offering of 
 strange fire by Nadab and Abihu, and the mutiny of Korah and his 
 company, when the fire from heaven was now newly given, and the 
 authority of Moses and Aaron now newly established. The doing of this 
 by the ministry of Peter, who himself with a lie denied his Master but 
 a little while ago, intimates that it was not the resentment of a wrong 
 done to himself; for then he, who had himself been faulty, would have 
 had charity for those that offended; and he, who himself had repented 
 and been forgiven, would have forgiven this affront, and endeavoured to 
 bring this offender to repentance; but it was the act of the Spirit of 
 God in Peter: to him the indignity was done, and by him the punishment 
 was inflicted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was buried immediately, for this was the manner of the Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The young men,</I> who it is probable were appointed to that office 
 in the church of burying the dead, as among the Romans the 
 <I>libitinarii</I> and <I>polinctores;</I> or the young men that 
 attended the apostles, and waited on them, they <I>wound up</I> the 
 dead body in grave-clothes, <I>carried it out</I> of the city, and 
 <I>buried it</I> decently, though he died in sin, and by an immediate 
 stroke of divine vengeance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The reckoning with Sapphira, the wife of Ananias, who perhaps was 
 first in the transgression, and tempted her husband to eat this 
 forbidden fruit. <I>She came in</I> to the place where the apostles 
 were, which, as it should seem, was Solomon's porch, for there we find 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 a part of the temple where Christ used to walk, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:23">John x. 23</A>.

 <I>She came in about three hours after,</I> expecting to share in the
 thanks of the house for her coming in, and consenting to the sale of 
 the land, of which perhaps she was entitled to her dower or thirds; for 
 <I>she knew not what had been done.</I> It was strange that nobody ran 
 to tell her of the sudden death of her husband, that she might keep 
 away; perhaps some one did, and she was not at home; and so when she 
 came to present herself before the apostles, as a benefactor to the 
 fund she met with a breach instead of a blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She was found guilty of sharing with her husband in his sin, by a 
 question that Peter asked her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Tell me whether you sold the land for so much?</I> naming the sum 
 which Ananias had brought and laid at the apostles' feet. "Was this all 
 you received for the sale of the land, and had you no more for it?" 
 "No," saith she, "we had no more, but that was every farthing we 
 received." Ananias and his wife agreed to tell the same story, and the 
 bargain being private, and by consent kept to themselves, nobody could 
 disprove them, and therefore they thought they might safely stand in 
 the lie, and should gain credit to it. It is sad to see those relations 
 who should quicken one another to that which is good harden one another 
 in that which is evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Sentence was passed upon her, that she should partake in her 
 husband's doom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Her sin is opened: <I>How is it that you have agreed together to 
 tempt the Spirit of the Lord?</I> Before he passes sentence, he makes 
 her to know her abominations, and shows her the evil of her sin. 
 Observe, 

 [1.] That they tempted the Spirit of the Lord; as Israel tempted God in 
 the desert, when they said, <I>Is the Lord among us, or is he not?</I> 
 after they had seen so many miraculous proofs of his power; and not 
 only his presence, but his presidency, when they said, <I>Can God 
 furnish a table?</I> So here, "Can the Spirit in the apostles discover 
 this fraud? Can they discern that this is but a part of the price, when 
 we tell them it is the whole?" <I>Can he judge through this dark 
 cloud?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:13">Job xxii. 13</A>.

 They saw that the apostles had the gift of tongues; but had they the
 gift of discerning spirits? Those that presume upon security and 
 impunity in sin tempt the Spirit of God; they tempt God as if he were 
 altogether such a one as themselves.

 [2.] That they agreed together to do it, making the bond of their 
 relation to each other (which by the divine institution is a sacred 
 tie) to become a bond of iniquity. It is hard to say which is worse 
 between yoke-fellows and other relations--a discord in good or concord
 in evil. It seems to intimate that their agreeing together to do it
 was a further tempting of the Spirit; as if, when they had engaged to 
 keep one another's counsel in this matter, even the Spirit of the Lord 
 himself could not discover them. Thus they <I>digged deep to hide their 
 counsel from the Lord,</I> but were made to know it is in vain. "How is 
 it that you are thus infatuated? What strange stupidity has seized you, 
 that you would venture to make trial of that which is past dispute? How 
 is it that you, who are baptized Christians, do not understand 
 yourselves better? How durst you run so great a risk?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Her doom is read: <I>Behold, the feet of those who have buried thy 
 husband are at the door</I> (perhaps he heard them coming, or knew that 
 they could not be long): <I>and</I> they <I>shall carry thee out.</I> 
 As Adam and Eve, who agreed to eat the forbidden fruit, were turned 
 together out of paradise, so Ananias and Sapphira, who agreed to tempt 
 the Spirit of the Lord, were together chased out of the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The sentence executed itself. There needed no executioner, a killing 
 power went along with Peter's word, as sometimes a healing power did; 
 for the God in whose name he spoke <I>kills and makes alive;</I> and 
 <I>out of his mouth</I> (and Peter was now his mouth) <I>both evil and 
 good proceed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Then fell she down straightway at his feet.</I> Some sinners God 
 makes quick work with, while others he bears long with; for which 
 difference, doubtless, there are good reasons; but he is not 
 accountable to us for them. She heard not till now that her husband was 
 dead, the notice of which, with the discovery of her sin, and the 
 sentence of death passed upon her, struck her as a thunderbolt and took 
 her away as with a whirlwind. And many instances there are of sudden 
 deaths which are not to be looked upon as the punishment of some gross 
 sin, like this. We must not think that all who die suddenly are sinners 
 above others; perhaps it is in favour to them, that they have a quick 
 passage: however, it is forewarning to all to be always ready. But
 here it is plain that it was in judgment. Some put the question 
 concerning the eternal state of Ananias and Sapphira, and incline to 
 think that the destruction of the flesh was that <I>the spirit might be 
 saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</I> And I should go in with that 
 charitable opinion if there had been any space given them to repent, as 
 there was to the incestuous Corinthian. But secret things belong not to 
 us. It is said, <I>She fell down at Peter's feet;</I> there, where she 
 should have laid the whole price and did not, she was herself laid, as 
 it were to make up the deficiency. The <I>young men</I> that had the 
 care of funerals coming in <I>found her dead;</I> and it is not said, 
 <I>They wound her up,</I> as they did Ananias, but, <I>They carried her 
 out</I> as she was, <I>and buried her by her husband;</I> and probably 
 an inscription was set over their graves, intimating that they were 
 joint-monuments of divine wrath against those that lie to the Holy 
 Ghost. Some ask whether the apostles kept the money which they did 
 bring, and concerning which they lied? I am apt to think they did; they 
 had not the superstition of those who said, <I>It is not lawful for us 
 to put it into the treasury:</I> for unto the pure all things are pure.
 What they brought was not polluted to those to whom they brought it; 
 but what they kept back was polluted to those that kept it back. Use 
 was made of the censers of Korah's mutineers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The impression that this made upon the people. Notice is taken of 
 this in the midst of the story 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Great fear came upon all that heard these things,</I> that heard 
 what Peter said, and saw what followed; or upon all that heard the 
 story of it; for, no doubt, it was all the talk of the city. And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>Great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these
 things.</I> 

 1. Those that had joined themselves to the church were thereby struck
 with an awe of God and of his judgments, and with a greater veneration
 for this dispensation of the Spirit which they were now under. It was
 not a damp or check to their holy joy, but it taught them to be serious
 in it, and to rejoice with trembling. All that laid their money at the
 apostles' feet after this were afraid of keeping back any part of the
 price. 

 2. All that heard it were put into a consternation by it, and were
 ready to say, <I>Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God</I> and
 his Spirit in the apostles? As

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
 wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in
 Solomon's porch.
 &nbsp; 13 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the
 people magnified them.
 &nbsp; 14 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes
 both of men and women.)
 &nbsp; 15 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets,
 and laid <I>them</I> on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow
 of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.

 unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed
 with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the progress of the gospel, notwithstanding 
 this terrible judgment inflicted upon two hypocrites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a general account of the miracles which the apostles wrought 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>By the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought 
 among the people,</I> many miracles of mercy for one of judgment. Now 
 the gospel power returned to its proper channel, which is that of mercy 
 and grace. God had come out of his place to punish, but now returns to 
 his place, to his mercy-seat again. The miracles they wrought proved 
 their divine mission. They were not a few, but many, of divers kinds 
 and often repeated; they were signs and wonders, such wonders as were 
 confessedly signs of a divine presence and power. They were not done in 
 a corner, but among the people, who were at liberty to enquire into 
 them, and, if there had been any fraud or collusion in them, would have 
 discovered it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are here told what were the effects of these miracles which the 
 apostles wrought.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The church was hereby kept together, and confirmed in its adherence 
 both to the apostles and to one another: <I>They</I> of the church 
 <I>were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.</I> 

 (1.) They met in the temple, in the open place that was called 
 Solomon's porch. It was strange that the rulers of the temple suffered 
 them to keep their meeting there. But God inclined their hearts to 
 tolerate them there awhile, for the more convenient spreading of the 
 gospel; and those who permitted buyers and sellers could not for shame 
 prohibit such preachers and healers there. They all met in public 
 worship; so early was the institution of religious assemblies observed 
 in the church, which must by no means be forsaken or let fall, for in 
 them a profession of religion is kept up. 

 (2.) They were there with one accord, unanimous in their doctrine, 
 worship, and discipline; and there was no discontent nor murmuring 
 about the death of Ananias and Sapphira, as there was against Moses and 
 Aaron about the death of Korah and his company: <I>You have killed the 
 people of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:41">Num. xvi. 41</A>.

 The separation of hypocrites, by distinguishing judgments, should make
 the sincere cleave so much the closer to each other and to the gospel 
 ministry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It gained the apostles, who were the prime ministers in Christ's 
 kingdom, very great respect. 

 (1.) The other ministers kept their distance: <I>Of the rest</I> of 
 their company <I>durst no man join himself to them,</I> as their equal 
 or an associate with them; though others of them were endued with the 
 Holy Ghost, and spoke with tongues, yet none of them at this time did 
 such signs and wonders as the apostles did: and therefore they 
 acknowledged their superiority, and in every thing yielded to them. 
 
 (2.) All <I>the people magnified them,</I> and had them in great 
 veneration, spoke of them with respect, and represented them as the 
 favourites of Heaven, and unspeakable blessings to this earth. Though 
 the chief priests vilified them, and did all they could to make them 
 contemptible, this did not hinder the people from magnifying them, who 
 saw the thing in a true light. Observe, The apostles were far from
 magnifying themselves; they transmitted the glory of all they did very 
 carefully and faithfully to Christ, and yet the people magnified them; 
 for those that humble themselves shall be exalted, and those honoured 
 that honour God only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The church increased in number 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Believers were the more added to the Lord,</I> and no doubt joined 
 themselves to the church, when they saw that God was in it of a truth, 
 even <I>multitudes both of men and women.</I> They were so far from 
 being deterred by the example that was made of Ananias and Sapphira 
 that they were rather invited by it into a society that kept such a 
 strict discipline. Observe, 

 (1.) Believers are added to the Lord Jesus, joined to him, and so 
 joined to his mystical body, from which nothing can separate us and cut 
 us off, but that which separates us and cuts us off from Christ. Many 
 have been brought to the Lord, and yet there is room for others to be 
 added to him, added to the number of those that are united to him; and 
 additions will still be making till the mystery of God shall be 
 finished, and the number of the elect accomplished.

 (2.) Notice is taken of the conversion of <I>women</I> as well as 
 <I>men;</I> more notice than generally was in the Jewish church, in 
 which they neither received the sign of circumcision nor were obliged 
 to attend the solemn feasts; and the <I>court of the women</I> was one 
 of the outer courts of the temple. But, as among those that followed 
 Christ while he was upon earth, so among those that believed on him 
 after he went to heaven, great notice was taken of the good women.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The apostles had abundance of patients, and gained abundance of 
 reputation both to themselves and their doctrine by the cure of them 
 all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 So many <I>signs and wonders were wrought by the apostles</I> that all 
 manner of people put in for the benefit of them, both in city and 
 country, and had it.

 (1.) In the city: They <I>brought forth their sick into the 
 streets;</I> for it is probable that the priests would not suffer them 
 to bring them into the temple to Solomon's porch, and the apostles had 
 not leisure to go to the houses of them all. And they <I>laid them on 
 beds and couches</I> (because they were so weak that they could neither 
 go nor stand), <I>that at the least the shadow of Peter, passing by, 
 might overshadow some of them,</I> though it could not reach them all; 
 and, it should seem, it had the desired effect, as the woman's touch of 
 the hem of Christ's garment had; and in this, among other things, that 
 word of Christ was fulfilled, <I>Greater works than these shall you 
 do.</I> God expresses his care of his people, by his being their 
 <I>shade on their right hand;</I> and the benign influences of Christ 
 as a king are compared to the <I>shadow of a great rock.</I> Peter 
 comes between them and the sun, and so heals them, cuts them off from a 
 dependence upon creature sufficiency as insufficient, that they may 
 expect help only from that Spirit of grace with whom he was filled. 
 And, if such miracles were wrought by Peter's shadow, we have reason to 
 think they were so by the other apostles, as by the handkerchiefs from 
 Paul's body

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:12"><I>ch.</I> xix. 12</A>),
 
 no doubt both being with an actual intention in the minds of the
 apostles thus to heal; so that it is absurd to infer hence a healing 
 virtue in the relics of saints that are dead and gone; we read not of 
 any cured by the relics of Christ himself, after he was gone, as 
 certainly we should if there had been any such thing. 

 (2.) In the country towns: Multitudes came to Jerusalem from <I>the 
 cities round about, bringing sick folks</I> that were afflicted in 
 body, and <I>those that were vexed with unclean spirits,</I> that were 
 troubled in mind, and they were <I>healed every one;</I> distempered 
 bodies and distempered minds were set to rights. Thus opportunity was 
 given to the apostles, both to convince people's judgments by these 
 miracles of the heavenly origin of the doctrine they preached, and also 
 to engage people's affections both to them and it, by giving them a 
 specimen of its beneficial tendency to the welfare of this lower 
 world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with
 him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with
 indignation,
 &nbsp; 18 And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the
 common prison.
 &nbsp; 19 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors,
 and brought them forth, and said,
 &nbsp; 20 Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the
 words of this life.
 &nbsp; 21 And when they heard <I>that,</I> they entered into the temple
 early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and
 they that were with him, and called the council together, and all
 the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to
 have them brought.
 &nbsp; 22 But when the officers came, and found them not in the
 prison, they returned, and told,
 &nbsp; 23 Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and
 the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had
 opened, we found no man within.
 &nbsp; 24 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and
 the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them
 whereunto this would grow.
 &nbsp; 25 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye
 put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the
 people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Never did any good work go on with any hope of success, but it met with 
 opposition; those that are bent to do mischief cannot be reconciled to 
 those who make it their business to do good. Satan, the destroyer of 
 mankind, ever was, and will be, an adversary to those who are the 
 benefactors of mankind; and it would have been strange if the apostles 
 had gone on thus teaching and healing and had had no check. In these 
 verses we have the malice of hell and the grace of heaven struggling 
 about them, the one to drive them off from this good work, the other to 
 animate them in it,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The priests were enraged at them, and shut them up in prison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. Who their enemies and persecutors were. The high priest was the 
 ringleader, Annas or Caiaphas, who saw their wealth and dignity, their 
 power and tyranny, that is, their all, at stake, and inevitably lost, 
 if the spiritual and heavenly doctrine of Christ should get ground and 
 prevail among the people. Those that were most forward to join with the 
 high priest herein were the <I>sect of the Sadducees,</I> who had a 
 particularly enmity to the gospel of Christ, because it confirmed and 
 established the doctrine of the invisible world, the resurrection of 
 the dead, and the future state, which they denied. It is not strange if 
 men of no religion be bigoted in their opposition to true and pure 
 religion. 

 2. How they were affected towards them, ill affected, and exasperated
 to the last degree. When they heard and saw what flocking there was to 
 the apostles, and how considerable they were become, they <I>rose 
 up</I> in a passion, as men that could no longer bear it, and were 
 resolved to make head against it, being <I>filled with indignation</I> 
 at the apostles for preaching the doctrine of Christ, and curing the 
 sick,--at the people for hearing them, and bringing the sick to them to
 be cured,--and at themselves and their own party for suffering this
 matter to go so far, and not knocking it on the head at first. Thus are 
 the enemies of Christ and his gospel a torment to themselves. <I>Envy 
 slays the silly one.</I> 
 
 3. How they proceeded against them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>They laid their hands on them,</I> perhaps their own hands (so low
 did their malice make them stoop), or, rather, the hands of their 
 officers, and <I>put them in the common prison,</I> among the worst of 
 malefactors. Hereby they designed, 

 (1.) To put a restraint upon them; though they could not lay any thing 
 criminal to their charge worthy of death or of bonds, yet while they 
 had them in prison they kept them from going on in their work, and this 
 they reckoned a good point gained. Thus early were the ambassadors of 
 Christ in bonds. 

 (2.) To put a terror upon them, and so to drive them off from their 
 work. The last time they had them before them, they only threatened 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:21"><I>ch.</I> iv. 21</A>);

 but now, finding that this did not do, they imprisoned them, to make
 them afraid of them. 

 (3.) To put a disgrace upon them, and therefore they chose to clap them 
 up in the common prison, that, being thus vilified, the people might 
 not, as they had done, magnify them. Satan has carried on his design 
 against the gospel very much by making the preachers and professors of 
 it appear despicable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God sent his angel to release them out of prison, and to renew 
 their commission to preach the gospel. The powers of darkness fight 
 against them, but the Father of lights fights for them, and sends an 
 angel of light to plead their cause. The Lord will never desert his 
 witnesses, his advocates, but will certainly stand by them, and bear 
 them out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The apostles are discharged, legally discharged, from their 
 imprisonment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>The angel of the Lord by night,</I> in spite of all the locks and 
 bars that were upon them, <I>opened the prison doors,</I> and, in spite 
 of all the vigilance and resolution of the keepers that <I>stood 
 without before the doors, brought forth</I> the prisoners (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 gave them authority to go out without crime, and led them through all 
 opposition. This deliverance is not so particularly related as that of 
 Peter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:7"><I>ch.</I> xii. 7</A>,

 &c.); but the miracle here was the very same. Note, There is no prison
 so dark, so strong, but God can both visit his people in it, and, if he 
 pleased, fetch them out of it. This discharge of the apostles out of 
 prison by an angel was a resemblance of Christ's resurrection, and his 
 discharge out of the prison of the grave, and would help to confirm the 
 apostles' preaching of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are charged, and legally charged, to go on with their work, so 
 as thereby to be discharged from the prohibition which the high priest 
 laid them under; the angel bade them, <I>Go, stand, and speak in the 
 temple to the people all the words of this life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 When they were miraculously set at liberty, they must not think it was 
 that they might save their lives by making their escape out of the 
 hands of their enemies. No; it was that they might to on with their 
 work with so much the more boldness. Recoveries from sickness, releases 
 out of trouble, are granted us, and are to be looked upon by us as 
 granted, not that we may enjoy the comforts of our life, but that God 
 may be honoured with the services of our life. <I>Let my soul live, and 
 it shall praise thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:175">Ps. cxix. 175</A>.

 <I>Bring my soul out of prison</I> (as the apostles here), <I>that I 
 may praise thy name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:7">Ps. cxliii. 7</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:22">Isa. xxxviii. 22</A>.

 Now in this charge given them, observe, 

 (1.) Where they must preach: <I>Speak in the temple.</I> One would 
 think, though they might not quit their work, yet it had been prudent 
 to go on with it in a more private place, where it would give less 
 offence to the priests than in the temple, and so would the less expose 
 them. No; "Speak in the temple, for this is the place of concourse, 
 this is your Father's house, and it is not to be as yet quite left 
 desolate." It is not for the preachers of Christ's gospel to retire 
 into corners, as long as they can have any opportunity of preaching in 
 the great congregation.

 (2.) To whom they must preach: "<I>Speak to the people;</I> not to the 
 princes and rulers, for they will not hearken; but to the people, who 
 are willing and desirous to be taught, and whose souls are as precious 
 to Christ, and ought to be so to you, as the souls of the greatest.
 Speak to the people, to all in general, for all are concerned." 

 (3.) How they must preach: <I>Go, stand, and speak,</I> which 
 intimates, not only they must speak publicly, stand up and speak, that 
 all may hear; but that they must speak boldly and resolutely: <I>Stand 
 and speak;</I> that is, "Speak it as those that resolve to stand to it, 
 to live and die by it." 

 (4.) What they must speak: <I>All the words of this life. This
 life</I> which you have been speaking of among yourselves, referring 
 perhaps to the conferences concerning heaven which they had among 
 themselves for their own and one another's encouragement in prison: 
 "Go, and preach the same to the world, that others may be comforted 
 with the same comforts with which you yourselves are comforted of God." 
 Or, "of this life which the Sadducees deny, and therefore persecute 
 you; preach this, though you know it is this that they have indignation 
 at." Or, "of this life emphatically; this heavenly, divine life, in 
 comparison with which the present earthly life does not deserve the 
 name." Or, "<I>these words of life,</I> the very same you have 
 preached, these words which the Holy Ghost puts into your mouth." Note, 
 The words of the gospel are the words of life, quickening words; they 
 are spirit, and they are life; <I>words whereby we may be 
 saved</I>--that is the same with this here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:14"><I>ch.</I> xi. 14</A>.

 The gospel is the word of this life, for it secures to us the
 privileges of our way as well as those of our home, and the promises of 
 the life that now is as well as of that to come. And yet even spiritual 
 and eternal life are brought so much to light in the gospel that they 
 may be called <I>this life;</I> for the word is nigh thee. Note, The 
 gospel is concerning matters of life and death, and ministers must 
 preach it and people hear it accordingly. They must speak <I>all the 
 words of this life,</I> and not conceal any for fear of offending, or 
 in hope of ingratiating themselves with their rulers. Christ's 
 witnesses are sworn to speak the whole truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They went on with their work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>When they heard this,</I> when they heard that it was the will of 
 God that they should continue to preach in the temple, they <I>returned 
 to Solomon's porch,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 1. It was a great satisfaction to them to have these fresh orders.
 Perhaps they began to question whether, if they had their liberty, they 
 should preach as publicly in the temple as they had done, because they 
 had been told, when they were <I>persecuted in one city, to flee to 
 another.</I> But, now that the angel ordered them to go preach in the 
 temple, their way was plain, and they ventured without any difficulty, 
 entered into the temple, and feared not the face of man. Note, If we 
 may but be satisfied concerning our duty, our business is to keep close 
 to this, and then we may cheerfully trust God with our safety.

 (2.) They set themselves immediately to execute them, without dispute 
 or delay. They <I>entered into the temples early in the morning</I> (as 
 soon as the gates were opened, and people began to come together 
 there), and taught them the gospel of the kingdom: and did not at all 
 fear what man could do unto them. The case here was extraordinary: the 
 whole treasure of the gospel is lodged in their hands; if they be 
 silent now the springs are shut up, and the whole work falls to the 
 ground and is made to cease, which is not the case of ordinary 
 ministers, who therefore are not by this example bound to throw 
 themselves into the mouth of danger; and yet when God gives opportunity 
 of doing good, though we be under the restraint and terror of human 
 powers, we should venture far rather than let go such an 
 opportunity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The high priest and his party went on with their prosecution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 They, supposing they had the apostles sure enough, <I>called the 
 council together,</I> a great and extraordinary council, for they 
 summoned <I>all the senate of the children of Israel.</I> See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How they were prepared, and how big with expectation, to crush the 
 gospel of Christ and the preachers of it, for they raised the whole 
 posse. The last time they had the apostles in custody they convened 
 them only before a committee of those that were of the kindred of the 
 high priest, who were obliged to act cautiously; but now, that they 
 might proceed further and with more assurance, they called together, 
 <B><I>pasan ten gerousian</I></B>--<I>all the eldership,</I> that is
 (says Dr. Lightfoot), all the three courts or benches of judges in 
 Jerusalem, not only the great sanhedrim, consisting of seventy elders, 
 but the other two judicatories that were erected one in the outer-court 
 gate of the temple, the other in the inner or beautiful gate, 
 consisting of twenty-three judges each; so that, if there was a full 
 appearance, here were one hundred and sixteen judges. Thus God ordered 
 it, that the confusion of the enemies, and the apostles' testimony 
 against them, might be more public, and that those might hear the 
 gospel who would not hear it otherwise than from the bar. Howbeit, the 
 high priest <I>meant not so, neither did his heart think so;</I> but it 
 was in his heart to rally all his forces against the apostles, and by a 
 universal consent to cut them all off at once.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How they were disappointed, and had their faces filled with shame: 
 <I>He that sits in heaven laughs at them,</I> and so may we too, to see 
 how gravely the court is set; and we may suppose the high priest makes 
 a solemn speech to them, setting forth the occasion of their coming 
 together--that a very dangerous faction was now lately raised at
 Jerusalem, by the preaching of the doctrine of Jesus, which it was 
 needful, for the preservation of their church (which never was in such 
 danger as now), speedily and effectually to suppress--that it was now in
 the power of their hands to do it, for he had the ringleaders of the 
 faction now in the common prison, to be proceeded against, if they 
 would but agree to it, with the utmost severity. An officer is, in 
 order hereunto, despatched immediately to fetch the prisoners to the 
 bar. But see how they are baffled. 

 (1.) The officers come, and tell them that they are not to be found in 
 the prison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 They last time they were forthcoming when they were called for,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:7"><I>ch.</I> iv. 7</A>.

 But now they were gone, and the report which the officers make is,
 "<I>The prison-doors truly found we shut with all safety</I>" (nothing 
 had been done to weaken them); "<I>the keepers</I> had not been wanting 
 to their duty; we found them <I>standing without before the doors,</I> 
 and knowing nothing to the contrary but that the prisoners were all 
 safe: but when we went in <I>we found no man</I> therein, that is, none 
 of the men we were sent to fetch." It is probable that they found the 
 common prisoners there. Which way the angel fetched them, whether by 
 some back way, or opening the door and fastening it closely again (the 
 keepers all the while asleep), we are not told; however it was, they 
 were gone. The Lord knows, though we do not, how to deliver the godly 
 out of temptation, and how to loose those that are in bonds for his 
 name's sake, and he will do it, as here, when he has occasion for them.
 Now think how confused the court looked, when the officers made this 
 return upon their order 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:25"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>When the high priest, and the captain of the temple,</I> and the 
 <I>chief priests, heard these things,</I> they were all at a plunge, 
 and looked one upon another, <I>doubting what this thing should be.</I> 
 They were extremely perplexed, were at their wits' end, having never 
 been so disappointed in all their lives of any thing they were so sure 
 of. It occasioned various speculations, some suggesting that they were 
 conjured out of the prison, and made their escape by magic arts; others 
 that the keepers had played tricks with them, knowing how many friends 
 these prisoners had, that were so much the darlings of the people. Some 
 feared that, having made such a wonderful escape, they would be the 
 more followed; others that, though perhaps they had frightened them 
 from Jerusalem, they should hear of them again in some part or other of 
 the country, where they would do yet more mischief, and it would be yet 
 more out of their power to stop the spreading of the infection; and now 
 they begin to fear that instead of curing the ill they have made it 
 worse. Note, Those often distress and embarrass themselves that think 
 to distress and embarrass the cause of Christ. 

 (2.) Their doubt is, in part, determined; and yet their vexation is 
 increased by another messenger, who brings them word that their 
 prisoners are preaching in the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>Behold, the men whom you put in prison,</I> and have sent for to 
 your bar, <I>are now</I> hard by you here, <I>standing in the 
 temple,</I> under your nose and in defiance of you, <I>teaching the 
 people.</I>" Prisoners, that have broken prison, usually abscond, for 
 fear of being retaken; but these prisoners, that here made their 
 escape, dare to show their faces even where their persecutors have the 
 greatest influence. Now this confounded them more than any thing.
 Common malefactors may have art enough to break prison; but those are 
 uncommon ones that have courage enough to avow it when they have so 
 done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>26 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them
 without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should
 have been stoned.
 &nbsp; 27 And when they had brought them, they set <I>them</I> before the
 council: and the high priest asked them,
 &nbsp; 28 Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not
 teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with
 your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.
 &nbsp; 29 Then Peter and the <I>other</I> apostles answered and said, We
 ought to obey God rather than men.
 &nbsp; 30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and
 hanged on a tree.
 &nbsp; 31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand <I>to be</I> a Prince
 and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness
 of sins.
 &nbsp; 32 And we are his witnesses of these things; and <I>so is</I> also
 the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
 &nbsp; 33 When they heard <I>that,</I> they were cut <I>to the heart,</I> and
 took counsel to slay them.
 &nbsp; 34 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
 Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the
 people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;
 &nbsp; 35 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to
 yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.
 &nbsp; 36 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to
 be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined
 themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were
 scattered, and brought to nought.
 &nbsp; 37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
 taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished;
 and all, <I>even</I> as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.
 &nbsp; 38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
 alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come
 to nought:
 &nbsp; 39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye
 be found even to fight against God.
 &nbsp; 40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the
 apostles, and beaten <I>them,</I> they commanded that they should not
 speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
 &nbsp; 41 And they departed from the presence of the council,
 rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his
 name.
 &nbsp; 42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not
 to teach and preach Jesus Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are not told what it was that the apostles preached to the people;
 no doubt it was according to the direction of the angel--<I>the words of
 this life;</I> but what passed between them and the council we have 
 here an account of; for in their sufferings there appeared more of a 
 divine power and energy than even in their preaching. Now here we 
 have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The seizing of the apostles a second time. We may think, if God 
 designed this, "Why were they rescued from their first imprisonment?" 
 But this was designed to humble the pride, and check the fury, of their 
 persecutors; and now he would show that they were discharged, not 
 because they feared a trial, for they were ready to surrender 
 themselves and make their appearance before the greatest of their 
 enemies. 

 1. They brought them without violence, with all the respect and 
 tenderness that could be: did not pull them out of the pulpit, nor bind 
 them, nor drag them along, but accosted them respectfully; and one 
 would think they had reason to do so, in reverence to the temple, that 
 holy place, and for fear of the apostles, lest they should strike them, 
 as they did Ananias, or call for fire from heaven upon them, as Elias 
 did; but all that restrained their violence was their fear of the 
 people, who had such a veneration for the apostles that they would have 
 stoned the officers if they had offered them any abuse.

 2. Yet they brought them to those who, they knew, were violent against
 them, and were resolved to take violent courses with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 They <I>brought them, to set them before the council,</I> as
 delinquents. Thus the powers that should have been a terror to evil
 works and workers became so to the good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their examination. Being brought before this august assembly, the 
 high priest, as the mouth of the court, told them what it was they had 
 to lay to their charge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 1. That they had disobeyed the commands of authority, and would not 
 submit to the injunctions and prohibitions given them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 "<I>Did not we,</I> by virtue of our authority, strictly charge and 
 command you, upon pain of our highest displeasure, <I>that you should 
 not teach in this name?</I> But you have disobeyed our commands, and 
 gone on to preach not only without our licence, but against our express 
 order." Thus those who make void the commandments of God are commonly 
 very strict in binding on their own commandments, and insisting upon 
 their own power: <I>Did not we command you?</I> Yes, they did; but did 
 not Peter at the same time tell them that God's authority was superior 
 to theirs, and his commands must take place of theirs? And they had 
 forgotten this. 

 2. That they had spread false doctrine among the people, or at least a
 singular doctrine, which was not allowed by the Jewish church, nor 
 agreed with what was delivered form Moses's chair. "<I>You have filled
 Jerusalem with your doctrine,</I> and thereby have disturbed the public 
 peace, and drawn people from the public establishment." Some take this 
 for a haughty scornful word: "This silly senseless doctrine of yours, 
 that is not worth taking notice of, you have made such a noise with, 
 that even Jerusalem, the great and holy city, is become full of it, and 
 it is all the talk of the town." They are angry that men, whom they 
 look upon as despicable, should make themselves thus considerable. 

 3. That they had a malicious design against the government, and aimed
 to stir up the people against it, by representing it as wicked and 
 tyrannical, and as having made itself justly odious both to God and 
 man: "<I>You intend to bring this man's blood,</I> the guilt of it 
 before God, the shame of it before men, <I>upon us.</I>" Thus they 
 charge them not only with contumacy and contempt of the court, but with 
 sedition and faction, and a plot both to set the people against them, 
 for having persecuted even to death not only so innocent but so good 
 and great a man as this Jesus, and also the Romans, for having drawn 
 them into it. See here how those who with a great deal of presumption 
 will do an evil thing yet cannot bear to hear of it afterwards, nor to 
 have it charged upon them. When they were in the heat of the
 persecution they could cry daringly enough, "<I>His blood be upon us 
 and upon our children;</I> let us bear the blame for ever." But now 
 that they have time for a cooler thought they take it as a great 
 affront to have his blood laid at their door. Thus are they convicted
 and condemned by their own consciences, and dread lying under that 
 guilt in which they were not afraid to involve themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Their answer to the charge exhibited against them: <I>Peter and 
 the other apostles</I> all spoke to the same purport; whether severally 
 examined, or answering jointly, they spoke as one and the same Spirit 
 gave them utterance, depending upon the promise their Master had made 
 them, that, when they were brought before councils, it should be 
 <I>given them in that same hour what they should speak,</I> and courage 
 to speak it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They justified themselves in their disobedience to the commands of 
 the great sanhedrim, great as it was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>We ought to obey God rather than men.</I> They do not plead the 
 power they had to work miracles (this spoke sufficiently for them, and 
 therefore they humbly decline mentioning it themselves), but they 
 appeal to a maxim universally owned, which even natural conscience 
 subscribes to, and which comes home to their case. God had commanded 
 them to teach in the name of Christ, and therefore they ought to do it, 
 though the chief priests forbade them. Note, Those rulers set up in 
 opposition to God, and have a great deal to answer for, who punish men 
 for disobedience to them in that which is their duty to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They justified themselves in doing what they could to fill Jerusalem 
 with the doctrine of Christ, though, in preaching him up, they did 
 indeed reflect upon those that maliciously ran him down, and if they 
 thereby bring his blood upon them they may thank themselves. It is 
 charged upon them as a crime that they preached Christ and his gospel. 
 "Now," say they, "we will tell you who this Christ is, and what his 
 gospel is, and then do you judge whether we ought not to preach it; 
 nay, and we shall take this opportunity to preach it to you, <I>whether 
 you will hear, or whether you will forbear.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The chief priests are told to their faces the indignities they did 
 to this Jesus: "<I>You slew him and hanged him on a tree,</I> you 
 cannot deny it." The apostles, instead of making an excuse, or begging 
 their pardon, for bringing the guilt of this man's blood upon them, 
 repeat the charge, and stand to it: "It was you that slew him; it was 
 your act and deed," Note, People's being unwilling to hear of their 
 faults is no good reason why they should not be faithfully told of 
 them. It is a common excuse made for not reproving sin that the times 
 will not bear it. But those whose office it is to reprove must not be 
 awed by this; the times must bear it, and shall bear it. <I>Cry aloud 
 and spare not;</I> cry aloud and fear not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They are told also what honours God put upon this Jesus, and then 
 let them judge who was in the right, the persecutors of his doctrine or 
 the preachers of it. He calls God the <I>God of our fathers,</I> not 
 only <I>ours,</I> but <I>yours,</I> to show that in preaching Christ 
 they did not preach a new god, nor entice people to come and worship 
 other gods; not did they set up an institution contrary to that of 
 Moses and the prophets, but they adhered to the God of the Jewish 
 fathers; and that name of Christ which they preached answered the 
 promises made to the fathers, and the covenant God entered into with 
 them, and the types and figures of the law he gave them. The God of 
 <I>Abraham, Isaac,</I> and <I>Jacob,</I> is the <I>God and Father of 
 our Lord Jesus Christ;</I> see what honour he did him. 

 [1.] He <I>raised him up;</I> he qualified him for, and called him to, 
 his great undertaking. It seems to refer to the promise God made by 
 Moses, <I>A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you.</I> God 
 raised him up out of obscurity, and made him great. Or, it may be meant 
 of his raising him up from the grave: "You put him to death, but God 
 has restored him to life, so that God and you are manifestly contesting 
 about this Jesus; and which must we side with?" 

 [2.] He <I>exalted him with his right hand,</I> 
 <B><I>hypsose</I></B>--<I>hath lifted him up.</I> "You loaded him with
 disgrace, but God has crowned him with honour; and ought we not to 
 honour him whom God honours?" God has <I>exalted him,</I> <B><I>te 
 dexia autou</I></B>--<I>with his right hand,</I> that is, by his power
 put forth; Christ is said to <I>live by the power of God.</I> Or, to 
 his right hand, to sit there, to rest there, to rule there. "He has 
 invested him with the highest authority, and therefore we must teach in 
 his name, for God has <I>given him a name above every name.</I>" 

 [3.] "He has appointed him to be <I>a prince and a Saviour,</I> and 
 therefore we ought to preach in his name, and to publish the laws of 
 his government as he is a prince, and the offers of his grace as he is 
 a Saviour." Observe, There is no having Christ to be our Saviour, 
 unless we be willing to take him for our prince. We cannot expect to be 
 redeemed and healed by him, unless we give up ourselves to be ruled by 
 him. The judges of old were saviours. Christ's ruling is in order to
 his saving, and faith takes an entire Christ, that came, not to save us 
 in our sins, but to save us from our sins. 

 [4.] He is appointed, as a prince and a Saviour, to <I>give repentance 
 to Israel and remission of sins.</I> Therefore they must preach in his 
 name to the people of Israel, for his favours were designed primarily 
 and principally for them; and none that truly loved their country could 
 be against this. Why should the rulers and elders of Israel oppose one
 who came with no less a blessing to Israel than repentance and pardon? 
 Had he been exalted to give deliverance to Israel from the Roman yoke, 
 and dominion over the neighbouring nations, the chief priests would 
 have welcomed him with all their hearts. But repentance and remission 
 of sins are blessings they neither value nor see their need of, and 
 therefore they can by no means admit his doctrine. Observe here, 
 <I>First,</I> Repentance and remission go together; wherever repentance 
 is wrought, remission is without fail granted, and the favour is given 
 to all those to whom is given the qualification for it. On the other 
 hand, no remission without repentance; none are freed from the guilt 
 and punishment of sin but those that are freed from the power and 
 dominion of sin, that are turned from it and turned against it. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> It is Jesus Christ that gives, and is authorized to 
 give, both repentance and remission. Whatsoever is required in the 
 gospel-covenant is promised. Are we appointed to repent? Christ is
 appointed to give repentance, by his Spirit working with the word, to 
 awaken the conscience, to work contrition for sin, and an effectual 
 change in the heart and life. The new heart is his work, and the broken 
 spirit a sacrifice of his providing; and, when he has given repentance, 
 if he should not give remission he would <I>forsake the work of his own 
 hands.</I> See how necessary it is that we repent, and that we apply 
 ourselves to Christ by faith for his grace to work repentance in us.
 
 [5.] All this is well attested, <I>First,</I> by the apostles 
 themselves; they are ready to testify upon oath, if required, that they 
 saw him alive after his resurrection, and saw him ascend into heaven; 
 and also that they experienced the power of his grace upon their 
 hearts, raising them up to that which was far above their natural 
 capacities: "<I>We are his witnesses,</I> appointed by him to publish 
 this to the world; and if we should be silent, as you would have us, we 
 should betray a trust, and be false to it." When a cause is trying, 
 witnesses, of all men, ought not to be silenced, for the issue of the 
 cause depends on their testimony. <I>Secondly,</I> By the Spirit of 
 God: "We are witnesses, competent ones, and whose testimony is 
 sufficient before any human judicature." But this is not all: <I>The 
 Holy Ghost is witness,</I> a witness from heaven; for God hath given 
 his gifts and graces to those that obey Christ. Therefore we must 
 preach in this name, because for this end the Holy Ghost is given us, 
 whose operations we cannot stifle. Note, The giving of the Holy Ghost
 to obedient believers, not only to bring them to the obedience of 
 faith, but to make them eminently useful therein, is a very strong 
 proof of the truth of Christianity. God gave the Holy Ghost by his Son 
 and in his name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:26">John xiv. 26</A>),

 and in answer to his prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:16">John xiv. 16</A>),

 nay, it was Christ that sent him from the Father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:26,16:7">John xv. 26; xvi. 7</A>),

 and this proves the glory to which the Father has exalted him. The 
 great work of the Spirit being not only to justify Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16">1 Tim. iii. 16</A>),

 but to glorify him, and all his gifts having a direct tendency to exalt 
 his name, prove that his doctrine is divine, else it would not be 
 carried on thus by divine power. And, <I>Lastly,</I> The giving of the 
 Holy Ghost to those that obey Christ, both for their assistance in 
 their obedience and as a present recompence for their obedience, is a 
 plain evidence that it is the will of God that Christ should be obeyed; 
 "judge then whether we ought to obey you in opposition to him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The impression which the apostles' defence of themselves made upon 
 the court. It was contrary to what one would have expected from men 
 that pretended to reason, learning, and sanctity. Surely such fair 
 reasoning could not but clear the prisoners, and convert the judges. 
 No, instead of yielding to it, they raged against it, and were filled, 
 
 1. With indignation at what the apostles said: They were <I>cut to the
 heart,</I> angry to see their own sin set in order before them; stark 
 mad to find that the gospel of Christ had so much to say for itself, 
 and consequently was likely to get ground. When a sermon was preached 
 to the people to this purport, they were <I>pricked to the heart,</I> 
 in remorse and godly sorrow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:37"><I>ch.</I> ii. 37</A>.

 These here were <I>cut to the heart</I> with rage and indignation. Thus
 the same gospel is to some a savour of life unto life, to others of 
 death unto death. The enemies of the gospel not only deprive themselves 
 of its comforts, but fill themselves with terrors, and are their own 
 tormentors. 

 2. With malice against the apostles themselves. Since they see they
 cannot stop their mouths any other way than by stopping their breath, 
 they <I>take counsel to slay them,</I> hoping that so they shall 
 <I>cause the work to cease.</I> While the apostles went on in the 
 service of Christ, with a holy security and serenity of mind, perfectly 
 composed, and in a sweet enjoyment of themselves, their persecutors 
 went on in their opposition to Christ, with a constant perplexity and 
 perturbation of mind, and vexation to themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The grave advice which Gamaliel, a leading man in the council, gave 
 upon this occasion, the scope of which was to moderate the fury of 
 these bigots, and check the violence of the prosecution. This Gamaliel 
 is here said to be a <I>Pharisee</I> by his profession and sect, and by 
 office a <I>doctor of the law,</I> one that studied the scriptures of 
 the Old Testament, read lectures upon the sacred authors, and trained 
 up pupils in the knowledge of them. Paul was brought up at his feet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:3"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 3</A>),

 and tradition says that so were Stephen and Barnabas. Some say he was
 the son of that Simeon that took up Christ in his arms, when he was 
 presented in the temple, and grandson of the famous Hillel. He is here 
 said to be <I>in reputation among all the people</I> for his wisdom and 
 conduct, it appearing by this passage that he was a moderate man, and 
 not apt to go in with furious measures. Men of temper and charity are 
 justly had in reputation, for checking the incendiaries that otherwise 
 would set the world on fire. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The necessary caution he gives to the council, with reference to the 
 case before them: <I>He commanded to put the apostles forth a little 
 while,</I> that he might speak the more freely, and be the more freely 
 answered (it was fit that the prisoners should withdraw when their case 
 was to be debated); and then put the house in mind of the importance of 
 this matter, which in their heat they were not capable of considering 
 as they ought: <I>You men of Israel,</I> saith he, <I>take heed to 
 yourselves,</I> consider what you do, or <I>intend to do, as touching 
 these men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 It is not a common case, and therefore should not be hastily 
 determined. He calls them <I>men of Israel,</I> to enforce this 
 caution: "You are men, that should be governed by reason, be not then 
 as <I>the horse and the mule that have no understanding;</I> you are 
 men of Israel, that should be governed by revelation, be not then as 
 strangers and heathens, that have no regard to God and his word.
 <I>Take heed to yourselves</I> now that you are angry with these men, 
 lest you <I>meddle to your own hurt.</I>" Note, The persecutors of 
 God's people had best look to themselves, lest they fall into the pit 
 which they dig. We have need to be cautious whom we give trouble to, 
 lest we be found making the hearts of the righteous sad. 

 2. The cases he cites, to pave the way to his opinion. Two instances he
 gives of factious seditious men (such as they would have the apostles 
 thought to be), whose attempts came to nothing of themselves; whence he 
 infers that if these men were indeed such as they represented them the 
 cause would sink with its own weight, and Providence would infatuate 
 and defeat them, and then they needed not persecute them.

 (1.) There was one <I>Theudas,</I> that made a mighty noise for awhile, 
 as one sent of God, <I>boasting himself to be somebody, some great 
 one</I> (so the word is), either a teacher or a prince, with a divine 
 commission to effect some great revolution in the church or in the 
 state; and he observes here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>)

 concerning him, 

 [1.] How far he prevailed: "<I>A number of men, about four hundred</I> 
 in all, joined themselves to him, that knew not what to do with 
 themselves, or hoped to better themselves; and they seemed then a 
 formidable body." 

 [2.] How soon his pretensions were all dashed: "When <I>he was 
 slain</I>" (probably in war) "there needed no more ado, <I>all, as many 
 as obeyed him, were scattered,</I> and melted away like snow before the 
 sun. Now compare that case with this. You have slain Jesus, the 
 ringleader of this faction; you have taken him off. Now if he was, as 
 you say he was, an impostor and pretender, his death, like that of 
 Theudas, will be the death of his cause, and the final dispersion of 
 his followers." From what has been we may infer what will be in a like 
 case; the smiting of the shepherd will be the scattering of the sheep: 
 and, if the God of peace had not <I>brought again from the dead that 
 great Shepherd,</I> the dispersion of the sheep, at his death, had been 
 total and final.

 (2.) The case was the same with <I>Judas of Galilee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 [1.] The attempt he made. It is said to be <I>after this,</I> which 
 some read, <I>besides this,</I> or, Let me mention, <I>after 
 this,</I>--supposing that Judas's insurrection was long before that of
 Theudas; for it was <I>in the time of the taxation,</I> namely, that at 
 our Saviour's birth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:1">Luke ii. 1</A>),

 and that of Theudas, whom Josephus speaks of, that mutinied, in the 
 time of <I>Cuspius Fadus;</I> but this was in the days of Claudius 
 C&aelig;sar, some years after Gamaliel spoke this, and therefore could 
 not be the same. It is not easy to determine particularly when these 
 events happened, nor whether this taxing was the same with that at our 
 Saviour's birth or one of a later date. Some think this Judas of 
 Galilee was the same with Judas Gaulonites, whom Josephus speaks of, 
 others not. It is probable that they were cases which lately happened, 
 and were fresh in memory. This <I>Judas drew away much people after 
 him,</I> who gave credit to his pretensions. But,

 [2.] Here is the defeat of his attempt, and that without any interposal 
 of the great sanhedrim, or any decree of theirs against him (it did not 
 need it); <I>he also perished, and all, even as many as obeyed him,</I> 
 or were persuaded by him, were dispersed. Many have foolishly thrown 
 away their lives, and brought others into the same snares, by a 
 jealousy for their liberties, <I>in the days of the taxing,</I> who had 
 better have been content, when Providence had so determined, <I>to 
 serve the king of Babylon.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His opinion upon the whole matter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That they should not persecute the apostles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>Now I say unto you,</I> <B><I>ta nyn</I></B>--<I>for the
 present,</I> as the matter now stands, my advice is, "<I>Refrain from 
 these men;</I> neither punish them for what they have done nor restrain 
 them for the future. Connive at them; let them take their course; 
 <I>let not our hand be upon them.</I>" It is uncertain whether he spoke 
 this out of policy, for fear of offending either the people or the 
 Romans and making further mischief. The apostles did not attempt any 
 thing by outward force. The weapons of their warfare were not carnal; 
 and therefore why should any outward force be used against them? Or, 
 whether he was under any present convictions, at least of the 
 probability of the truth of the Christian doctrine, and thought it 
 deserved better treatment, at least a fair trial. Or, whether it was 
 only the language of a mild quiet spirit, that was against persecution 
 for conscience' sake. Or, whether God put this word into his mouth 
 beyond his own intention, for the deliverance of the apostles at this 
 time. We are sure there was an overruling Providence in it, that the 
 servants of Christ might not only come off, but come off 
 honourably.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That they should refer this matter to Providence: "Wait the issue, 
 and see what it will come to. <I>If it be of men, it will come to 
 nought</I> of itself; <I>if of God, it will stand,</I> in spite of all 
 your powers and policies." That which is apparently wicked and immoral 
 must be suppressed, else the magistrate bears the sword in vain; but 
 that which has a show of good, and it is doubtful whether it be of God 
 or men, it is best to let it alone, and let it take its fate, not to 
 use any external force for the suppressing of it. Christ rules by the 
 power of truth, not of the sword. What Christ asked concerning John's 
 baptism, <I>Was it from heaven or of men?</I> was a question proper to 
 be asked concerning the apostles' doctrine and baptism, which followed 
 Christ, as John Baptist's went before him. Now they, having owned, 
 concerning the former, that they could not tell whether it was from 
 heaven or of men, ought not to be too confident concerning the latter. 
 But, take it which way you will, it is a reason why they should not be 
 persecuted. 

 [1.] "If this <I>counsel, and this work,</I> this forming of a society, 
 and incorporating it in the name of Jesus, <I>be of men, it will come 
 to nothing.</I> If it be the counsel and work of foolish crack-brained 
 men that know not what they do, let them alone awhile, and they will 
 run themselves out of breath, and <I>their folly will be manifest 
 before all men,</I> and they will make themselves ridiculous. If it be
 the counsel and work of politic and designing men, who under colour of 
 religion are setting up a secular interest, let them alone awhile, and 
 they will throw off the mask, and their knavery will be manifest to all 
 men, and they will make themselves odious; Providence will never 
 countenance it. <I>It will come to nothing</I> in a little time; and, 
 if so, your persecuting and opposing it is very needless; there is no 
 occasion for giving yourselves so much trouble, and bringing such an 
 odium upon yourselves, to kill that which, if you give it a little 
 time, will die of itself. The unnecessary use of power is an abuse of 
 it. But," 

 [2.] "If it should prove (and as wise men as you have been mistaken) 
 <I>that this counsel and this work is of God,</I> that these preachers 
 have their commissions and instructions from him, that they are as 
 truly his messengers to the world as the Old-Testament prophets were, 
 then what do you think of persecuting them, of this attempt of yours

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>)

 <I>to slay them?</I> You must conclude it to be," <I>First,</I> "A 
 fruitless attempt against them: <I>If it be of God, you cannot 
 overthrow it;</I> for <I>there is no wisdom nor counsel against the 
 Lord; he that sits in heaven laughs at you.</I>" It may be the comfort 
 of all who are sincerely on God's side, who have a single eye to his 
 will as their rule and his glory as their end, that whatsoever is of 
 God cannot be overthrown totally and finally, though it may be very 
 vigorously opposed; it may be run upon, but cannot be run down. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> "A dangerous attempt to yourselves. Pray let it alone, 
 <I>lest haply you be found even to fight against God;</I> and I need 
 not tell you who will come off by the worse in that contest." <I>Woe 
 unto him that strives with his Maker;</I> for he will not only be 
 overcome as an impotent enemy, but severely reckoned with as a rebel 
 and traitor against his rightful prince. Those that hate and abuse 
 God's faithful people, that restrain and silence his faithful 
 ministers, fight against God, for he takes what is done against them as 
 done against himself. <I>Whoso touches them, touches the apple of his 
 eye.</I> Well, this was the advice of Gamaliel: we wish it were duly 
 considered by those that persecute for conscience' sake, for it was a 
 good thought, and natural enough, though we are uncertain what the man 
 was. The tradition of the Jewish writers is that, for all this, he 
 lived and died an inveterate enemy to Christ and his gospel; and though 
 (now at least) he was not for persecuting the followers of Christ, yet
 he was the man who composed that prayer which the Jews use to this day 
 for the extirpating of Christians and Christianity. On the contrary, 
 the tradition of the Papists is that he turned Christian, and became an 
 eminent patron of Christianity and a follower of Paul, who had formerly 
 sat at his feet. If it had been so, it is very probable that we should 
 have heard of him somewhere in the <I>Acts</I> or <I>Epistles.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The determination of the council upon the whole matter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 1. Thus far they agreed with Gamaliel that they let fall the design of
 putting the apostles to death. They saw a great deal of reason in what 
 Gamaliel said, and, for the present, it gave some check to their fury, 
 and a reminder of their wrath was restrained by it. 

 2. Yet they could not forbear giving some vent to their rage (so
 outrageous was it) contrary to the convictions of their judgments and 
 consciences; for, though they were advised to let them alone, yet,

 (1.) <I>They beat them,</I> scourged them as malefactors, stripped 
 them, and whipped them, as they used to do in the synagogues, and 
 notice is taken 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>)

 of the ignominy of it. Thus they thought to make them ashamed of 
 preaching, and the people ashamed of hearing them; as Pilate scourged 
 our Saviour to expose him, when yet he declared he found no fault in 
 him. 

 (2.) <I>They commanded them that they should not speak</I> any more 
 <I>in the name of Jesus,</I> that, if they could find no other fault 
 with their preaching, they might have this ground to reproach it, that 
 it was against law, and not only without the permissions, but against 
 the express order of their superiors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The wonderful courage and constancy of the apostles in the midst 
 of all these injuries and indignities done them. When they were 
 dismissed <I>they departed from the council,</I> and we do not find one 
 word they said by way of reflection upon the court and the unjust 
 treatment given them. <I>When they were reviled they reviled not again; 
 and when they suffered they threatened not; but committed their cause 
 to him</I> to whom Gamaliel had referred it, even <I>to a God who 
 judgeth righteously.</I> All their business was to preserve the 
 possession of their own souls, and to make full proof of their 
 ministry, notwithstanding the opposition given them; and both these 
 they did to admiration.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They bore their sufferings with an invincible cheerfulness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):
 
 When <I>they went out,</I> perhaps with the marks of the lashes given 
 them on their arms and hands appearing, hissed at by the servants and 
 rabble, it may be, or public notice given of the infamous punishment 
 they had undergone, instead of being ashamed of Christ, and their 
 relation to him, <I>they rejoiced that they were counted worthy to 
 suffer shame for his name.</I> They were men, and men in reputation, 
 that had never done any thing to make themselves vile, and therefore 
 could not but have a sense of the shame they suffered, which, it should 
 seem, was more grievous to them than the smart, as it usually is to 
 ingenuous minds; but they considered that it was for the name of Christ 
 that they were thus abused, because they belonged to him and served his 
 interest, and their sufferings should be made to contribute to the 
 further advancement of his name; and therefore, 

 (1.) They reckoned it an honour, looked upon it <I>that they were 
 counted worthy to suffer shame,</I> <B><I>katexiothesan 
 atimasthenai</I></B>--<I>that they were honoured to be dishonoured for
 Christ.</I> Reproach for Christ is true preferment, as it makes us 
 conformable to his pattern and serviceable to his interest. 

 (2.) They rejoiced in it, remembering what their Master had said to 
 them at their first setting out 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:11,12">Matt. v. 11, 12</A>):

 <I>When men shall revile you, and persecute you, rejoice and be 
 exceedingly glad.</I> They rejoiced, not only though they suffered 
 shame (their troubles did not diminish their joy), but <I>that they 
 suffered shame;</I> their troubles increased their joy, and added to 
 it. If we suffer ill for doing well, provided we suffer it well, and as 
 we should, we ought to rejoice in that grace which enables us so to 
 do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They went on in their work with indefatigable diligence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):
 
 They were punished for preaching, and were commanded <I>not to 
 preach,</I> and <I>yet they ceased not to teach and preach;</I> they 
 omitted no opportunity, nor abated any thing of their zeal or 
 forwardness. Observe, 

 (1.) When they preached--<I>daily;</I> not only on sabbath days, or on
 Lord's days, but every day, as duly as the day came, without 
 intermitting any day, as their Master did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:55,Lu+19:47">Matt. xxvi. 55, Luke xix. 47</A>),

 not fearing that they should either kill themselves or cloy their 
 hearers.

 (2.) Where they preached--both publicly <I>in the temple,</I> and
 privately <I>in every house;</I> in promiscuous assemblies, to which 
 all resorted, and in the select assemblies of Christians for special 
 ordinances. They did not think that either one would excuse them from 
 the other, for the word must be <I>preached in season and out of 
 season.</I> Though in the temple they were more exposed, and under the 
 eye of their enemies, yet they did not confine themselves to their 
 little oratories in their own houses, but ventured into the post of 
 danger; and though they had the liberty of the temple, a consecrated 
 place, yet they made no difficulty of preaching in houses, in every 
 house, even the poorest cottage. They visited the families of those 
 that were under their charge, and gave particular instructions to them 
 according as their case required, even to the children and servants.
 
 (3.) What was the subject matter of their preaching: <I>They preached 
 Jesus Christ;</I> they preached concerning him; and this was not all, 
 they preached him up, they proposed him to those who heard them, <I>to 
 be their prince and Saviour.</I> They did <I>not preach themselves, but 
 Christ,</I> as faithful friends to the bridegroom, making it their 
 business to advance his interest. This was the preaching that gave most 
 offence to the priests, who were willing they should preach any thing 
 but Christ; but they would not alter their subject to please them. It 
 ought to be the constant business of gospel ministers to preach Christ; 
 <I>Christ, and him crucified; Christ, and him glorified;</I> nothing 
 besides this but what is reducible to it.</P>
