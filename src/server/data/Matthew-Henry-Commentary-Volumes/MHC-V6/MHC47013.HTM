 In this chapter the apostle threatens to be severe against obstinate
 sinners, and assigns the reason thereof

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>);

 then he makes a suitable prayer to God on the behalf of the
 Corinthians, with the reasons inducing him thereto

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>),

 and concludes his epistle with a valediction and a benediction,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  This <I>is</I> the third <I>time</I> I am coming to you. In the mouth
 of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
 &nbsp; 2  I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present,
 the second time; and being absent now I write to them which
 heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again,
 I will not spare:
 &nbsp; 3  Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to
 you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.
 &nbsp; 4  For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth
 by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall
 live with him by the power of God toward you.
 &nbsp; 5  Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your
 own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is
 in you, except ye be reprobates?
 &nbsp; 6  But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle threatens to be severe against obstinate sinners when he 
 should come to Corinth, having now sent to them a first and second 
 epistle, with proper admonitions and exhortations, in order to reform 
 what was amiss among them. Concerning this we may notice, 

 1. The caution with which he proceeded in his censures: he was not
 hasty in using severity, but gave a first and second admonition. So 
 some understand his words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>This is the third time I am coming to you,</I> referring to his 
 first and second epistles, by which he admonished them, as if he were 
 present with them, though in person he was absent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 According to this interpretation, these two epistles are the witnesses 
 he means in the first verse, referring rather to the direction of our 
 Saviour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:16">Matt. xvii. 16</A>)

 concerning the manner how Christians should deal with offenders before 
 they proceed to extremity than to the law of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:6,19:15">Deut. xvii. 6; xix. 15</A>)

 for the behaviour of judges in criminal matters. We should go, or send, 
 to our brother, once and again, to tell him of his fault. Thus the 
 apostle had told these Corinthians before, in his former epistle, and 
 now he tells them, or <I>writes to those who heretofore had sinned, and 
 to all others,</I> giving warning unto all before he came in person 
 <I>the third time,</I> to exercise severity against scandalous 
 offenders. Others think that the apostle had designed and prepared for 
 his journey to Corinth twice already, but was providentially hindered, 
 and now informs them of his intentions a third time to come to them.
 However this be, it is observable that he kept an account how often he 
 endeavoured, and what pains he took with these Corinthians for their 
 good: and we may be sure that an account is kept in heaven, and we must 
 be reckoned with another day for the helps we have had for our souls, 
 and how we have improved them. 

 2. The threatening itself: <I>That if</I> (or when) <I>he came
 again</I> (in person) <I>he would not spare</I> obstinate sinners, and 
 such as were impenitent, in their scandalous enormities. He had told 
 them before, he feared <I>God would humble him among them,</I> because 
 he should find some who <I>had sinned and had not repented;</I> and now 
 he declares he would not spare such, but would inflict church-censures 
 upon them, which are thought to have been accompanied in those early 
 times with visible and extraordinary tokens of divine displeasure.
 Note, Though it is God's gracious method to bear long with sinners, yet 
 he will not bear always; at length he will come, and will not spare 
 those who remain obstinate and impenitent, notwithstanding all his 
 methods to reclaim and reform them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle assigns a reason why he would be thus severe, namely, 
 for <I>a proof of Christ's speaking in him,</I> which they <I>sought 
 after,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The evidence of his apostleship was necessary for the credit, 
 confirmation, and success, of the gospel he preached; and therefore 
 such as denied this were justly and severely to be censured. It was
 the design of the false teachers to make the Corinthians call this 
 matter into question, of which yet they had not weak, but strong and 
 mighty proofs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 notwithstanding the mean figure he made in the world and the contempt 
 which by some was cast upon him. Even as Christ himself <I>was 
 crucified through weakness,</I> or appeared in his crucifixion as a 
 weak and contemptible person, <I>but liveth by the power of God,</I> or 
 in his resurrection and life manifests his divine power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 so the apostles, how mean and contemptible soever they appeared to the 
 world, did yet, as instruments, manifest the power of God, and 
 particularly the power of his grace, in converting the world to 
 Christianity. And therefore, as a proof to those who among the 
 <I>Corinthians sought a proof of</I> Christ's speaking in the apostle, 
 he puts them upon proving their Christianity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Examine yourselves,</I> &c. Hereby he intimates that, if they could
 prove their own Christianity, this would be a proof of his apostleship; 
 for if they were in the faith, if Jesus Christ was in them, this was a 
 proof that Christ spoke in him, because it was by his ministry that 
 they did believe. He had been not only an instructor, but a father to 
 them. He had begotten them again by the gospel of Christ. Now it could 
 not be imagined that a divine power should go along with his 
 ministrations if he had not his commission from on high. If therefore 
 they could prove themselves <I>not to be reprobates,</I> not to be 
 rejected of Christ, <I>he trusted they would know that he was not a 
 reprobate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 not disowned by Christ. What the apostle here says of the duty of the 
 Corinthians to <I>examine themselves,</I> &c., with the particular view 
 already mentioned, is applicable to the great duty of all who call 
 themselves Christians, to examine themselves concerning their spiritual 
 state. We should examine whether we be in the faith, because it is a 
 matter in which we may be easily deceived, and wherein a deceit is 
 highly dangerous: we are therefore concerned to <I>prove our own 
 selves,</I> to put the question to our own souls, whether Christ be in 
 us, or not; and <I>Christ is in us, except we be reprobates:</I> so 
 that either we are true Christians or we are great cheats; and what a 
 reproachful thing is it for a man not to know himself, not to know his 
 own mind!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should
 appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest,
 though we be as reprobates.
 &nbsp; 8  For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
 &nbsp; 9  For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and
 this also we wish, <I>even</I> your perfection.
 &nbsp; 10  Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being
 present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the
 Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle's prayer to God on the behalf of the Corinthians, that 
 they might <I>do no evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This is the most desirable thing we can ask of God, both for ourselves 
 and for our friends, to be kept from sin, that we and they may do no 
 evil; and it is most needful that we often pray to God for his grace to 
 keep us, because without this we cannot keep ourselves. We are more 
 concerned to pray that we may not do evil than that we may not suffer 
 evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reasons why the apostle put up this prayer to God on behalf of 
 the Corinthians, which reasons have a special reference to their case, 
 and the subject-matter about which he was writing to them. Observe, he 
 tells them, 

 1. It was not so much for his own personal reputation as for the honour
 of religion: "<I>Not that we should appear approved, but that you 
 should do that which is honest,</I> or decent, and for the credit of 
 religion, though we should be reproached and vilified, and accounted as 
 reprobates,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) The great desire of faithful ministers of the gospel is that the 
 gospel they preach may be honoured, however their persons may be 
 vilified. 

 (2.) The best way to adorn our holy religion is <I>to do that which is 
 honest,</I> and of good report, to walk as becomes the gospel of 
 Christ. 

 2. Another reason was this: that they might be free from all blame and
 censure when he should come to them. This is intimated in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>,

 <I>We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</I> If 
 therefore they did not do evil, nor act contrary to their profession of 
 the gospel, the apostle had no power nor authority to punish them. He 
 had said before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:8"><I>ch.</I> x. 8</A>)

 and says here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 that the power which the Lord had given him was to edification, not to 
 destruction; so that, although the apostle had great powers committed 
 to him for the credit and advancement of the gospel, yet he could not 
 do anything to the disparagement of the truth, nor the discouragement 
 of those who obeyed it. He could not, that is, he would not, he dared 
 not, he had no commission to act against the truth; and it is 
 remarkable how the apostle did rejoice in this blessed impotency: 
 "<I>We are glad,</I>" says he 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 "<I>when we are weak and you are strong;</I> that is, that we have no 
 power to censure those who are strong in faith and fruitful in good 
 works." Some understand this passage thus: "Though we are weak through 
 persecutions and contempt, we bear it patiently, and also joyfully, 
 while we see that you are strong, that you are prosperous in holiness, 
 and persevering in well-doing." For, 
 
 3. He desired their perfection
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 that is, that they might be sincere, and aim at perfection (sincerity
 is our gospel-perfection), or else he wished there might be a thorough 
 reformation among them. He not only desired that they might be kept 
 from sin, but also that they might grow in grace, and increase in 
 holiness, and that all that was amiss among them might be rectified and 
 reformed. This was the great end of his writing this epistle, and that 
 freedom he used with them by <I>writing these things</I> (those 
 friendly admonitions and warnings), <I>being absent, that so, being 
 present, he should not use sharpness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 that is, not proceed to the utmost extremity in the exercise of the 
 power which the Lord had given him as an apostle, <I>to revenge all 
 disobedience,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort,
 be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace
 shall be with you.
 &nbsp; 12  Greet one another with a holy kiss.
 &nbsp; 13  All the saints salute you.
 &nbsp; 14  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
 the communion of the Holy Ghost, <I>be</I> with you all. Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus the apostle concludes this epistle with,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A valediction. He gives them a parting farewell, and takes his leave 
 of them for the present, with hearty good wishes for their spiritual 
 welfare. In order to this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He gives them several good exhortations. 

 (1.) To be perfect, or to be knit together in love, which would tend 
 greatly to their advantage as a church, or Christian society. 

 (2.) To be of good comfort under all the sufferings and persecutions 
 they might endure for the cause of Christ or any calamities and 
 disappointments they might meet with in the world. 

 (3.) To be of one mind, which would greatly tend to their comfort; for 
 the more easy we are with our brethren the more ease we shall have in 
 our own souls. The apostle would have them, as far as was possible, to 
 be of the same opinion and judgment; however, if this could not be 
 attained, yet, 

 (4.) He exhorts them to live in peace, that difference in opinion 
 should not cause an alienation of affections--that they should be at 
 peace among themselves. He would have all the schisms that were among 
 them healed, that there should be no more contention and wrath found 
 among them, to prevent which they should avoid <I>debates, envyings, 
 backbitings, whisperings,</I> and such like enemies to peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He encourages them with the promise of God's presence among them: 
 <I>The God of love and peace shall be with you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) God is the God of love and peace. He is the author of peace, and 
 lover of concord. He hath loved us, and is willing to be at peace with 
 us; he commands us to love him, and to be reconciled to him, and also 
 that we love one another, and be at peace among ourselves. 

 (2.) God will be with those who live in love and peace. He will love 
 those who love peace; he will dwell with them here, and they shall 
 dwell with him for ever. Such shall have God's gracious presence here, 
 and be admitted to his glorious presence hereafter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He gives directions to them to salute each other, and sends kind 
 salutations to them from those who were with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 He would have them testify their affection to one another by the sacred 
 rite of a kiss of charity, which was then used, but has long been 
 disused, to prevent all occasions of wantonness and impurity, in the 
 more declining and degenerate state of the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostolical benediction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the 
 communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.</I> Thus the apostle 
 concludes his epistle, and thus it is usual and proper to dismiss 
 worshipping assemblies. This plainly proves the doctrine of the gospel, 
 and is an acknowledgment that Father, Son, and Spirit, are three 
 distinct persons, yet but one God; and herein the same, that they are 
 the fountain of all blessings to men. It likewise intimates our duty, 
 which is to have an eye by faith to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost--to 
 live in a continual regard to the three persons in the Trinity, into 
 whose name we were baptized, and in whose name we are blessed. This is 
 a very solemn benediction, and we should give all diligence to inherit 
 this blessing. The grace of Christ, the love of God, and the communion 
 (or communication) of the Holy Ghost: the grace of Christ as Redeemer, 
 the love of God who sent the Redeemer, and all the communications of 
 this grace and love, which come to us by the Holy Ghost; it is the 
 communications of the Holy Ghost that qualify us for an interest in the 
 grace of Christ, and the love of God: and we can desire no more to make 
 us happy than the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the communion 
 of the Holy Ghost. <I>Amen.</I></P>
