 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When our Lord Jesus called his apostles out to be employed in services 
 and sufferings for him, he told them that yet the last should be first, 
 and the first last, which was remarkably fulfilled in St. Stephen and 
 St. Paul, who were both of them late converts, in comparison of the 
 apostles, and yet got the start of them both in services and 
 sufferings; for God, in conferring honours and favours, often crosses 
 hands. In this chapter we have the martyrdom of Stephen, the first 
 martyr of the Christian church, who led the van in the noble army. And 
 therefore his sufferings and death are more largely related than those 
 of any other, for direction and encouragement to all those who are 
 called out to resist unto blood, as he did. Here is, 

 I. His defence of himself before the council, in answer to the matters
 and things he stood charged with, the scope of which is to show that it
 was no blasphemy against God, nor any injury at all to the glory of his
 name, to say that the temple should be destroyed and the customs of the
 ceremonial law changed. And, 

 1. He shows this by going over the history of the Old Testament, and 
 observing that God never intended to confine his favours to that place, 
 or that ceremonial law; and that they had no reason to expect he
 should, for the people of the Jews had always been a provoking people, 
 and had forfeited the privileges of their peculiarity: nay, that that
 holy place and that law were but figures of good things to come, and it 
 was no disparagement at all to them to say that they must give place to 
 better things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:1-50">ver. 1-50</A>.
 
 And then, 

 2. He applies this to those that prosecuted him, and sat in judgment 
 upon him, sharply reproving them for their wickedness, by which they 
 had brought upon themselves the ruin of their place and nation, and 
 then could not bear to hear of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:51-53">ver. 51-53</A>.

 II. The putting of him to death by stoning him, and his patient,
 cheerful, pious submission to it,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then said the high priest, Are these things so?
 &nbsp; 2 And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of
 glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in
 Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
 &nbsp; 3 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy
 kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.
 &nbsp; 4 Then came he out of the land of the Chald&aelig;ans, and dwelt in
 Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed
 him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.
 &nbsp; 5 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not <I>so much as</I>
 to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him
 for a possession, and to his seed after him, when <I>as yet</I> he had
 no child.
 &nbsp; 6 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a
 strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and
 entreat <I>them</I> evil four hundred years.
 &nbsp; 7 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge,
 said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in
 this place.
 &nbsp; 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so
 <I>Abraham</I> begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and
 Isaac <I>begat</I> Jacob; and Jacob <I>begat</I> the twelve patriarchs.
 &nbsp; 9 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt:
 but God was with him,
 &nbsp; 10 And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him
 favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he
 made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
 &nbsp; 11 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and
 Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no
 sustenance.
 &nbsp; 12 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent
 out our fathers first.
 &nbsp; 13 And at the second <I>time</I> Joseph was made known to his
 brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.
 &nbsp; 14 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to <I>him,</I> and
 all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
 &nbsp; 15 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our
 fathers,
 &nbsp; 16 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre
 that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor <I>the
 father</I> of Sychem.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Stephen is now at the bar before the great council of the nation, 
 indicted for blasphemy: what the witnesses swore against him we had an 
 account of in the foregoing chapter, that he spoke blasphemous words 
 against Moses and God; for he spoke against this holy place and the 
 law. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The high priest calls upon him to answer for himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He was president, and, as such, the mouth of the court, and therefore 
 he saith, "You, the prisoner at the bar, you hear what is sworn against 
 you; what do you say to it? <I>Are these things so?</I> Have you ever 
 spoken any words to this purport? If you have, will you recant them, or 
 will you stand to them? <I>Guilty or not guilty?</I>" This carried a 
 show of fairness, and yet seems to have been spoken with an air of 
 haughtiness; and thus far he seems to have prejudged the cause, that, 
 if it were so, that he had spoken such and such words, he shall 
 certainly be adjudged a blasphemer, whatever he may offer in 
 justification or explanation of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He begins his defence, and it is long; but it should seem by his 
 breaking off abruptly, just when he came to the main point 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>),
 
 that it would have been much longer if his enemies would have given him
 leave to say all he had to say. In general we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That in this discourse he appears to be a man ready and mighty in 
 the scriptures, and thereby thoroughly furnished for every good word 
 and work. He can relate scripture stories, and such as were very 
 pertinent to his purpose, off-hand without looking in his Bible. He was 
 <I>filled with the Holy Ghost,</I> not so much to reveal to him new 
 things, or open to him the secret counsels and decrees of God 
 concerning the Jewish nation, with them to convict these gainsayers; 
 no, but to bring to his remembrance the scriptures of the Old 
 Testament, and to teach him how to make use of them for their 
 conviction. Those that are full of the Holy Ghost will be full of the 
 scripture, as Stephen was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he quotes the scriptures according to the Septuagint 
 translation, by which it appears he was one of the Hellenist Jews, who 
 used that version in their synagogues. His following this, occasions 
 divers variations from the Hebrew original in this discourse, which the 
 judges of the court did not correct, because they knew how he was led 
 into them; nor is it any derogation to the authority of that Spirit by 
 which he spoke, for the variations are not material. We have a maxim, 
 <I>Apices juris non sunt jura--Mere points of law are not law
 itself.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:1-16">These verses</A>

 carry on this his compendium of church history to the end of the book
 of Genesis. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His preface: <I>Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken.</I> He gives 
 them, though not flattering titles, yet civil and respectful ones,
 signifying his expectation of fair treatment with them; from men he 
 hopes to be treated with humanity, and he hopes that brethren and 
 fathers will use him in a fatherly brotherly way. They are ready to 
 look upon him as an apostate from the Jewish church, and an enemy to 
 them. But, to make way for their conviction to the contrary, he 
 addresses himself to them as <I>men, brethren, and fathers,</I> 
 resolving to look on himself as one of them, though they would not so 
 look on him. He craves their attention: <I>Hearken;</I> though he was 
 about to tell them what they already knew, yet he begs them to hearken 
 to it, because, though they knew it all, yet they would not without a 
 very close application of mind know how to apply it to the case before 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His entrance upon the discourse, which (whatever it may seem to
 those that read it carelessly) is far from being a long ramble only to 
 amuse the hearers, and give them a diversion by telling them an old 
 story. No; it is all pertinent and <I>ad rem--to the purpose,</I> to
 show them that God had no this heart so much upon that holy place and 
 the law as they had; but, as he had a church in the world many ages 
 before that holy place was founded and the ceremonial law given, so he 
 would have when they should both have had their period.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He begins with the call of Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees, by 
 which he was set apart for God to be the trustee of the promise, and 
 the father of the Old-Testament church. This we had an account of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:1">Gen. xii. 1</A>,

 &c.), and it is referred to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:7,8">Neh. ix. 7, 8</A>.

 His native country was an idolatrous country, it was Mesopotamia, 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 <I>the land of the Chaldeans</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 thence God brought him at two removes, not too far at once, dealing
 tenderly with him; he first brought him out of the land of the 
 Chaldeans to Charran, or Haran, a place midway between that and Canaan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:31">Gen. xi. 31</A>),

 and thence five years after, when his father was dead, he <I>removed 
 him into</I> the land of <I>Canaan, wherein you now dwell.</I> It 
 should seem, the first time that God spoke to Abraham, he appeared in 
 some visible display of the divine presence, as the <I>God of glory</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 to settle a correspondence with him: and then afterwards he kept up 
 that correspondence, and spoke to him from time to time as there was 
 occasion, without repeating his visible appearances as the God of 
 glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> From this call of Abraham we may observe, 

 1. That in all our ways we must acknowledge God, and attend the
 directions of his providence, as of the pillar of cloud and fire. It is 
 not said, Abraham removed, but, <I>God removed him into this land 
 wherein you now dwell,</I> and he did but follow his Leader. 

 2. Those whom God takes into covenant with himself he distinguishes
 from the children of this world; they are effectually called out of the 
 state, out of the land, of their nativity; they must sit loose to the 
 world, and live above it and every thing in it, even that in it which 
 is most dear to them, and must trust God to make it up to them in 
 another and better country, that is, the heavenly, which he will show 
 them. God's chosen must follow him with an implicit faith and 
 obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> But let us see what this is to Stephen's case. 

 1. They had charged him as a blasphemer of God, and an apostate from
 the church; therefore he shows that he is a son of Abraham, and values 
 himself upon his being able to say, <I>Our father Abraham,</I> and that 
 he is a faithful worshipper of the God of Abraham, whom therefore he 
 here calls <I>the God of glory.</I> He also shows that he owns divine 
 revelation, and that particularly by which the Jewish church was 
 founded and incorporated. 

 2. They were proud of their being circumcised; and therefore he shows
 that Abraham was taken under God's guidance, and into communion with 
 him, before he was circumcised, for that was not till

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 With this argument Paul proves that Abraham was justified by faith, 
 because he was justified when he was in uncircumcision: and so here. 

 3. They had a mighty jealousy for this holy place, which may be meant
 of the whole land of Canaan; for it was called the <I>holy land, 
 Immanuel's land;</I> and the destruction of the holy house inferred 
 that of the holy land. "Now," says Stephen, "you need not be so proud 
 of it; for,"

 (1.) "You came originally out of <I>Ur of the Chaldees,</I> where 
 <I>your fathers served other gods</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:2">Josh. xxiv. 2</A>),

 and you were not the first planters of this country. Look therefore 
 <I>unto the rock whence you were hewn, and the holy of the pit out of 
 which you were digged;</I>" that is, as it follows there, "<I>look unto 
 Abraham your father,</I> for <I>I called him alone</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:1,2">Isa. li. 1, 2</A>)--

 think of the meanness of your beginnings, and how you are entirely 
 indebted to divine grace, and then you will see boasting to be for ever 
 excluded. It was God that <I>raised up the righteous man from the</I>
 east, <I>and called him to his foot.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:2">Isa. xli. 2</A>.

 But, if his seed degenerate, let them know that God can destroy this
 holy place, and raise up to himself another people, for he is not a 
 debtor to them."

 (2.) "God appeared in his glory to Abraham a great way off in 
 Mesopotamia, before he came near Canaan, nay, before he dwelt in 
 Charran; so that you must not think God's visits are confined to 
 <I>this land;</I> no; he that brought the seed of the church from a 
 country so far east can, if he pleases, carry the fruit of it to 
 another country as far west." 

 (3.) "God made no haste to bring him into this land, but let him linger 
 some years by the way, which shows that God has not his heart so much 
 upon this land as you have yours, neither is his honour, nor the 
 happiness of his people, bound up in it. It is therefore neither 
 blasphemy nor treason to say, It shall be destroyed,"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The unsettled state of Abraham and his seed for many ages after he 
 was called out of Ur of the Chaldees. God did indeed promise that he 
 would <I>give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 But, <I>First, As yet he had no child,</I> nor any by Sarah for many 
 years after. <I>Secondly,</I> He himself was but a stranger and a 
 sojourner in that land, and God <I>gave him no inheritance in it, no, 
 not so much as to set his foot on;</I> but there he was as in a strange 
 country, where he was always upon the remove, and could call nothing 
 his own. <I>Thirdly,</I> His posterity did not come to the possession 
 of it for a long time: <I>After four hundred years</I> they shall come 
 <I>and serve me in this place,</I> and not till then, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Nay, <I>Fourthly,</I> They must undergo a great deal of hardship and 
 difficulty before they shall be put into the possession of that land: 
 they shall be brought into bondage, and ill treated in a strange land: 
 and this, not as the punishment of any particular sin, as their 
 wandering in the wilderness was, for we never find any such account 
 given of their bondage in Egypt; but so God had appointed, and it must 
 be. And <I>at the end of four hundred years,</I> reckoning from the 
 birth of Isaac, <I>that nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I 
 judge, saith God.</I> Now this teaches us, 

 1. That <I>known unto God are all his works</I> beforehand. When
 Abraham had neither inheritance nor heir, yet he was told he should 
 have both, the one a land of promise, and the other a child of promise; 
 and therefore both had, and received, by faith. 

 2. That God's promises, though they are slow, are sure in the operation
 of them; they will be fulfilled in the season of them, though perhaps 
 not so soon as we expect. 

 3. That though the people of God may be in distress and trouble for a
 time, yet God will at length both rescue them and reckon with those 
 that do oppress them; for, <I>verily there is a God that judgeth in the 
 earth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But let us see how this serves Stephen's purpose. 

 1. The Jewish nation, for the honour of which they were so jealous, was
 very inconsiderable in its beginnings; as their common father Abraham 
 was fetched out of obscurity in Ur of the Chaldees, so their tribes, 
 and the heads of them, were fetched out of servitude in Egypt, when 
 they were the <I>fewest of all people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7">Deut. vii. 7</A>.

 And what need is there of so much ado, as if their ruin, when they
 bring it upon themselves by sin, must be the ruin of the world, and of 
 all God's interests in it? No; he that brought them out of Egypt can 
 bring them into it again, as he threatened

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:68">Deut. xxviii. 68</A>),

 and yet be no loser, while he can out of stones raise up children unto 
 Abraham. 

 2. The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced towards 
 the performance, and the many seeming contradictions here taken notice 
 of, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land 
 principally intended to be conveyed and secured by it was the <I>better 
 country, that is, the heavenly;</I> as the apostle shows from this very 
 argument that the patriarchs <I>sojourned in the land of promise, as in 
 a strange country,</I> thence inferring that <I>they looked for a city 
 that had foundations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:9,10">Heb. xi. 9, 10</A>.

 It was therefore no blasphemy to say, <I>Jesus shall destroy this
 place,</I> when at the same time we say, "He shall lead us to the 
 heavenly Canaan, and put us in possession of that, of which the earthly 
 Canaan was but a type and figure."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The building up of the family of Abraham, with the entail of 
 divine grace upon it, and the disposals of divine Providence concerning 
 it, which take up the rest of the book of Genesis.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> God engaged to be a God to Abraham and his seed; and, in 
 token of this, appointed that he and his male seed should be 
 circumcised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:9,10">Gen. xvii. 9, 10</A>.

 He <I>gave him the covenant of circumcision,</I> that is, the covenant 
 of which circumcision was the seal; and accordingly, when Abraham had a 
 son born, he <I>circumcised him the eighth day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 by which he was both bound by the divine law and interested in the 
 divine promise; for circumcision had reference to both, being a seal of 
 the covenant both on God's part--I will be to thee <I>a God
 all-sufficient,</I> and on man's part--<I>Walk before me, and be thou
 perfect.</I> And then when effectual care was thus taken for the 
 securing of Abraham's seed, to be a <I>seed to serve the Lord,</I> they 
 began to multiply: <I>Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob the twelve 
 patriarchs,</I> or roots of the respective tribes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Joseph, the darling and blessing of his father's 
 house, was abused by his brethren; they <I>envied him</I> because of 
 his dreams, and <I>sold him into Egypt.</I> Thus early did the children 
 of Israel begin to grudge those among them that were eminent and 
 outshone others, of which their enmity to Christ, who, like Joseph, was 
 a <I>Nazarite among his brethren,</I> was a great instance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:2,21">Gen. xxxix. 2, 21</A>),

 by the influence of his Spirit, both on his mind, giving him comfort, 
 and on the minds of those he was concerned with, giving him favour in 
 their eyes. And thus at length he <I>delivered him out of his 
 afflictions,</I> and Pharaoh made him the second man in the kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:20-22">Ps. cv. 20-22</A>.

 And thus he not only arrived at great preferment among the Egyptians,
 but became the <I>shepherd and stone of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:24">Gen. xlix. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> Jacob was compelled to go down into Egypt, by a famine 
 which forced him out of Canaan, <I>a dearth</I> (which was a <I>great 
 affliction</I>), to that degree that <I>our fathers found no 
 sustenance</I> in Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 That <I>fruitful land was turned into barrenness.</I> But, hearing that 
 there was <I>corn in Egypt</I> (treasured up by the wisdom of his own 
 son), he <I>sent out our fathers first</I> to fetch corn, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 And the <I>second time</I> that they went, Joseph, who at first made 
 himself strange to them, made himself known to them, and it was 
 notified to Pharaoh that they were Joseph's kindred and had a 
 dependence upon him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 whereupon, with Pharaoh's leave, <I>Joseph sent for his father Jacob to 
 him into Egypt,</I> with <I>all his kindred and family,</I> to the 
 number of <I>seventy-five souls,</I> to be subsisted there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 In Genesis they are said to be <I>seventy souls,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:27">Gen. xlvi. 27</A>.

 But the Septuagint there makes them seventy-five, and Stephen or Luke 
 follows that version, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:36">Luke iii. 36</A>,

 where Cainan is inserted, which is not in the Hebrew text, but in the 
 Septuagint. Some, by excluding Joseph and his sons, who were in Egypt 
 before (which reduces the number to sixty-four), and adding the sons of 
 the eleven patriarch, make the number seventy-five.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fifthly,</I> Jacob and his sons died in Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 but were carried over to be buried in Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 A very considerable difficulty occurs here: it is said, <I>They were 
 carried over into Sychem,</I> whereas Jacob was buried not in Sychem, 
 but near Hebron, in the cave of Machpelah, where Abraham and Isaac were 
 buried, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:13">Gen. l. 13</A>.
 
 Joseph's bones indeed were buried in Sychem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:32">Josh. xxiv. 32</A>),
 
 and it seems by this (though it is not mentioned in the story) that the
 bones of all the other patriarchs were carried with his, each of them 
 giving the same commandment concerning them that he had done; and of 
 them this must be understood, not of Jacob himself. But then the 
 sepulchre in Sychem was bought by Jacob 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:19">Gen. xxxiii. 19</A>),
 
 and by this it is described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:32">Josh. xxiv. 32</A>.

 How then is it here said to be bought by Abraham? Dr. Whitby's
 solution of this is very sufficient. He supplies it thus: <I>Jacob went 
 down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers;</I> and (<I>our fathers</I>)
 <I>were carried over into Sychem; and he,</I> that is, <I>Jacob,</I> was
 laid <I>in the sepulchre that Abraham brought for a sum of money,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:16">Gen. xxiii. 16</A>.

 (Or, they were laid there, that is, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.) <I>And 
 they,</I> namely, the other patriarchs, were <I>buried in the sepulchre 
 bought of the sons of Emmor, the father of Sychem.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us now see what this is to Stephen's purpose. 

 1. He still reminds them of the mean beginning of the Jewish nation, as
 a check to their priding themselves in the glories of that nation; and 
 that it was by a miracle of mercy that they were raised up out of 
 nothing to what they were, from so small a number to be so great a 
 nation; but, if they answer not the intention of their being so raised, 
 they can expect no other than to be destroyed. The prophets frequently 
 put them in mind of the bringing of them out of Egypt, as a aggravation 
 of their contempt of the law of God, and here it is urged upon them as 
 an aggravation of their contempt of the gospel of Christ. 

 2. He reminds them likewise of the wickedness of those that were the
 patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph, and 
 selling him into Egypt; and the same spirit was still working in them 
 towards Christ and his ministers. 

 3. Their holy land, which they doted so much upon, their fathers were
 long kept out of the possession of, and met with dearth and great 
 affliction in it; and therefore let them not think it strange if, after 
 it has been so long polluted with sin, it be at length destroyed. 

 4. The faith of the patriarchs in desiring to be buried in the land of
 Canaan plainly showed that they had an eye to the heavenly country, to 
 which it was the design of this Jesus to lead them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had
 sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
 &nbsp; 18 Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.
 &nbsp; 19 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated
 our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the
 end they might not live.
 &nbsp; 20 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and
 nourished up in his father's house three months:
 &nbsp; 21 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up,
 and nourished him for her own son.
 &nbsp; 22 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,
 and was mighty in words and in deeds.
 &nbsp; 23 And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart
 to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 24 And seeing one <I>of them</I> suffer wrong, he defended <I>him,</I>
 and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:
 &nbsp; 25 For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that
 God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.
 &nbsp; 26 And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove,
 and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are
 brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
 &nbsp; 27 But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying,
 Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
 &nbsp; 28 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?
 &nbsp; 29 Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the
 land of Madian, where he begat two sons.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Stephen here goes on to relate,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The wonderful increase of the people of Israel in Egypt; it was by a 
 wonder of providence that in a little time they advanced from a family 
 into a nation. 

 1. It was <I>when the time of the promise drew nigh</I>--the time when
 they were to be formed into a people. During the first two hundred and 
 fifteen years after the promise made to Abraham, the children of the 
 covenant were increased but to seventy; but in the latter two hundred 
 and fifteen years they increased to six hundred thousand fighting men. 
 The motion of providence is sometimes quickest when it comes nearest 
 the centre. Let us not be discouraged at the slowness of the 
 proceedings towards the accomplishment of God's promises; God knows how 
 to redeem the time that seems to have been lost, and, <I>when the year 
 of the redeemed is at hand,</I> can do a double work in a single day. 
 
 2. It was <I>in Egypt,</I> where they were oppressed, and ruled with
 rigour; when their lives were made so bitter to them that, one would 
 think, they should have wished to be written childless, yet they 
 married, in faith that God in due time would visit them; and God 
 <I>blessed them,</I> who thus honoured him, saying, <I>Be fruitful, and 
 multiply.</I> Suffering times have often been growing times with the 
 church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The extreme hardships which they underwent there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 When the Egyptians observed them to increase in number they increased 
 their burdens, in which Stephen observes three things:--

 1. Their base ingratitude: They were oppressed by <I>another king that
 knew not Joseph,</I> that is, did not consider the good service that 
 Joseph had done to that nation; for, if he had, he would not have made 
 so ill a requital to his relations and family. Those that injure good 
 people are very ungrateful, for they are the blessings of the age and 
 place they live in. 

 2. Their hellish craft and policy: <I>They dealt subtly with our
 kindred. Come on,</I> said they, <I>let us deal wisely,</I> thinking 
 thereby to secure themselves, but it proved dealing foolishly, for they 
 did but treasure up wrath by it. Those are in a great mistake who think 
 they deal wisely for themselves when they deal deceitfully or 
 unmercifully with their brethren. 

 3. Their barbarous and inhuman cruelty. That they might effectually
 extirpate them, <I>they cast out their young children, to the end they 
 might not live.</I> The killing of their infant seed seemed a very 
 likely way to crush an infant nation. Now Stephen seems to observe this 
 to them, not only that they might further see how mean their beginnings 
 were, fitly represented (perhaps with an eye to the exposing of the 
 young children in Egypt) by the forlorn state of a helpless, out-cast 
 infant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:4">Ezek. xvi. 4</A>),

 and how much they were indebted to God for his care of them, which they 
 had forfeited, and made themselves unworthy of: but also that they 
 might consider that what they were now doing against the Christian 
 church in its infancy was as impious and unjust, and would be in the 
 issue as fruitless and ineffectual, as that was which the Egyptians did 
 against the Jewish church in its infancy. "You think you deal subtly in 
 your ill treatment of us, and, in persecuting young converts, you do as 
 they did in casting out the young children; but you will find it is to 
 no purpose, in spite of your malice Christ's disciples will <I>increase 
 and multiply.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The raising up of <I>Moses to be their deliverer.</I> Stephen was 
 charged with having spoken blasphemous words against Moses, in answer 
 to which charge he here speaks very honourably of him. 

 1. Moses was born when the persecution of Israel was at the hottest,
 especially in that most cruel instance of it, the murdering of the 
 new-born children: <I>At that time, Moses was born</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 and was himself in danger, as soon as he came into the world (as our
 Saviour also was at Bethlehem) of falling a sacrifice to that bloody 
 edict. God is preparing for his people's deliverance, when their way is 
 darkest, and their distress deepest. 

 2. <I>He was exceedingly fair;</I> his face began to shine as soon as
 he was born, as a happy presage of the honour God designed to put upon 
 him; he was <B><I>asteios to Theo</I></B>--<I>fair towards God;</I> he
 was sanctified from the womb, and this made him beautiful in God's 
 eyes; for it is the beauty of holiness that is in God's sight of great 
 price. 

 3. He was wonderfully preserved in his infancy, first, by the care of
 his tender parents, who <I>nourished him three months in their own 
 house,</I> as long as they durst; and then by a favourable providence 
 that threw him <I>into the arms of Pharaoh's daughter, who took him up, 
 and nourished him as her own son</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 for those whom God designs to make special use of he will take special 
 care of. And did he thus protect the child Moses? Much more will he
 secure the interests of his holy child Jesus (as he is called

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:27"><I>ch.</I> iv. 27</A>)

 from <I>the enemies that are gathered together against him.</I> 

 4. He became a great scholar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>He was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,</I> who were then 
 famed for all manner of polite literature, particularly philosophy, 
 astronomy, and (which perhaps helped to lead them to idolatry) 
 hieroglyphics. Moses, having his education at court, had opportunity
 of improving himself by the best books, tutors, and conversation, in 
 all the arts and sciences, and had a genius for them. Only we have 
 reason to think that he had not so far forgotten the God of his fathers 
 as to acquaint himself with the unlawful studies and practices of the 
 magicians of Egypt, any further than was necessary to the confuting of 
 them. 

 5. He became a prime minister of state in Egypt. This seems to be meant
 by his being <I>mighty in words and deeds.</I> Though he had not a 
 ready way of expressing himself, but stammered, yet he spoke admirably 
 good sense, and every thing he said commanded assent, and carried its 
 own evidence and force of reason along with it; and, in business, none 
 went on with such courage, and conduct, and success. Thus was he
 prepared, by human helps, for those services, which, after all, he 
 could not be thoroughly furnished for without divine illumination. Now, 
 by all this, Stephen will make it appear that, notwithstanding the 
 malicious insinuations of his persecutors, he had as high and 
 honourable thoughts of Moses as they had.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The attempts which Moses made to deliver Israel, which they 
 spurned, and would not close in with. This Stephen insists much upon, 
 and it serves for a key to this story 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:11-15">Exod. ii. 11-15</A>),

 as does also that other construction which is put upon it by the 
 apostle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:24-26">Heb. xi. 24-26</A>.

 There it is represented as an act of holy self-denial, here as a 
 designed prelude to, or entrance upon, the public service he was to be 
 called out to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>When he was full forty years old,</I> in the prime of his time for 
 preferment in the court of Egypt, <I>it came into his heart</I> (for 
 God put it there) <I>to visit his brethren the children of Israel,</I> 
 and to see which way he might do them any service; and he showed 
 himself as a public person, with a public character. 

 1. As Israel's saviour. This he gave a specimen of in avenging an
 oppressed Israelite, and killing the Egyptian that abused him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>).

 <I>Seeing one of his brethren suffer wrong,</I> he was moved with 
 compassion towards the sufferer, and a just indignation at the 
 wrong-doer, as men in public stations should be, and <I>he avenged him
 that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian,</I> which, if he had been 
 only a private person, he could not lawfully have done; but he knew 
 that his commission from heaven would bear him out, and <I>he supposed 
 that his brethren</I> (who could not but have some knowledge of the 
 promise made to Abraham, <I>that the nation that should oppress them 
 God would judge) would have understood that God by his hand would 
 deliver them;</I> for he could not have had either presence of mind or 
 strength of body to do what he did, if he had not been clothed with 
 such a divine power as evinced a divine authority. If they had but 
 understood the signs of the times, they might have taken this for the 
 dawning of the day of their deliverance; <I>but they understood 
 not,</I> they did not take this, as it was designed, for the setting up 
 of a standard, and sounding of a trumpet, to proclaim Moses <I>their 
 deliverer.</I> 

 2. As Israel's judge. This he gave a specimen of, <I>the</I> very
 <I>next day,</I> in offering to accommodate matters between two 
 contending Hebrews, wherein he plainly assumed a public character

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>He showed himself to them as they strove,</I> and, putting on an air
 of majesty and authority, <I>he would have set them at one again,</I> 
 and as their prince have determined the controversy between them, 
 <I>saying, Sirs, you are brethren,</I> by birth and profession of 
 religion; <I>why do you wrong one to another?</I> For he observed that 
 (as in most strifes) there was a fault on both sides; and therefore, in 
 order to peace and friendship, there must be a mutual remission and 
 condescension. When Moses was to be Israel's deliverer out of Egypt, he 
 slew the Egyptians, and so delivered Israel out of their hands; but, 
 when he was to be Israel's judge and lawgiver, he ruled them with the 
 golden sceptre, not the iron rod; he did not kill and slay them when 
 they strove, but gave them excellent laws and statutes, and decided 
 upon their complaints and appeals made to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:16">Exod. xviii. 16</A>.

 <I>But</I> the contending Israelite that was most in <I>the wrong
 thrust him away</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 would not bear the reproof, though a just and gentle one, but was ready 
 to fly in his face, with, <I>Who made thee a ruler and a judge over 
 us?</I> Proud and litigious spirits are impatient of check and control. 
 Rather would these Israelites have their bodies ruled with rigour by 
 their task-masters than be delivered, and have their minds ruled with 
 reason, by their deliverer. The wrong-doer was so enraged at the 
 reproof given him that he upbraided Moses with the service he had done 
 to their nation in killing the Egyptian, which, if they had pleased, 
 would have been the earnest of further and greater service: <I>Wilt 
 thou kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>,

 charging that upon him as his crime, and threatening to accuse him for 
 it, which was the hanging out of the flag of defiance to the Egyptians, 
 and the banner of love and deliverance to Israel. Hereupon <I>Moses 
 fled into the land of Midian,</I> and made no further attempt to 
 deliver Israel till forty years after; he settled as a stranger in 
 Midian, married, and had two sons, by Jethro's daughter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now let us see how this serves Stephen's purpose. 

 1. They charged him with blaspheming Moses, in answer to which he
 retorts upon them the indignities which their fathers did to Moses, 
 which they ought to be ashamed of, and humbled for, instead of picking 
 quarrels thus, under pretence of zeal for the honour of Moses, with one 
 that had as great a veneration for him as any of them had. 

 2. They persecuted him for disputing in defence of Christ and his
 gospel, in opposition to which they set up Moses and his law: "But," 
 saith he, "you had best take heed,"

 (1.) "Lest you hereby do as your fathers did, refuse and reject one 
 <I>whom God has raised up to be to you a prince and a Saviour;</I> you 
 may understand, if you will not wilfully shut your eyes against the 
 light, that God will, by this Jesus, deliver you out of a worse slavery 
 than that in Egypt; take heed then of thrusting him away, but receive 
 him as a ruler and a judge over you." 

 (2.) "Lest you hereby fare as your fathers fared, who for this were 
 very justly left to die in their slavery, for the deliverance came not 
 till forty years after. This will be the issue of it, you put away the 
 gospel from you, and it will be <I>sent to the Gentiles;</I> you will 
 not have Christ, and you shall not have him, so shall your doom be."

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>30 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in
 the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of
 fire in a bush.
 &nbsp; 31 When Moses saw <I>it,</I> he wondered at the sight: and as he
 drew near to behold <I>it,</I> the voice of the Lord came unto him,
 &nbsp; 32 <I>Saying,</I> I <I>am</I> the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham,
 and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled,
 and durst not behold.
 &nbsp; 33 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet:
 for the place where thou standest is holy ground.
 &nbsp; 34 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which
 is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to
 deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
 &nbsp; 35 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler
 and a judge? the same did God send <I>to be</I> a ruler and a
 deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the
 bush.
 &nbsp; 36 He brought them out, after that he had showed wonders and
 signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the
 wilderness forty years.
 &nbsp; 37 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel,
 A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your
 brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.
 &nbsp; 38 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with
 the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and <I>with</I> our
 fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:
 &nbsp; 39 To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust <I>him</I> from
 them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,
 &nbsp; 40 Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for <I>as
 for</I> this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we
 wot not what is become of him.
 &nbsp; 41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice
 unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Stephen here proceeds in his story of Moses; and let any one judge 
 whether these are the words of one that was a blasphemer of Moses or 
 no; nothing could be spoken more honourably of him. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The vision which he saw of the glory of God at the bush 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):
 
 <I>When forty years had expired</I> (during all which time Moses was
 buried alive in Midian, and was now grown old, and one would think past 
 service), that it might appear that all his performances were products 
 of a divine power and promise (as it appeared that Isaac was a child of 
 promise by his being born of parents stricken in years), now, at eighty 
 years old, he enters upon that post of honour to which he was born, in 
 recompence for his self-denial at forty years old. Observe, 

 1. Where God appeared to him: <I>In the wilderness of Mount Sinai,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 
 And, when he appeared to him there, that was holy ground 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 which Stephen takes notice of, as a check to those who prided 
 themselves in the temple, that holy place, as if there were no 
 communion to be had with God but there; whereas God met Moses, and 
 manifested himself to him, in a remote obscure place in the wilderness 
 of Sinai. They deceive themselves if they think God is confined to 
 places; he can bring his people into a wilderness, and there speak 
 comfortably to them. 

 2. How he appeared to him: <I>In a flame of fire</I> (for our God is a
 consuming fire), and yet <I>the bush,</I> in which this fire was, 
 though combustible matter, <I>was not consumed,</I> which, as it 
 represented the state of Israel in Egypt (where, though they were in 
 the fire of affliction, yet they were not consumed), so perhaps it may 
 be looked upon as a type of Christ's incarnation, and the union between 
 the divine and human nature: God, manifested in the flesh, was as the 
 flame of fire manifested in the bush. 

 3. How Moses was affected with this:

 (1.) <I>He wondered at the sight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 It was a phenomenon with the solution of which all his Egyptian 
 learning could not furnish him. He had the curiosity at first to pry
 into it: <I>I will turn aside now, and see this great sight;</I> but 
 the nearer he drew the more he was struck with amazement; and,

 (2.) <I>He trembled, and durst not behold,</I> durst not look 
 stedfastly upon it; for he was soon aware that it was not a fiery 
 meteor, but <I>the angel of the Lord;</I> and no other than <I>the 
 Angel of the covenant,</I> the Son of God himself. This set him a
 trembling. Stephen was accused for blaspheming Moses and God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:11"><I>ch.</I> vi. 11</A>),

 as if Moses had been a little god; but by this it appears that he was a
 <I>man, subject to like passions as we are,</I> and particularly that 
 of fear, upon any appearance of the divine majesty and glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The declaration which he heard of the covenant of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):
 
 <I>The voice of the Lord came to him;</I> for faith comes by hearing; 
 and this was it: <I>I am the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;</I> 
 and therefore, 

 1. "I am the same that I was." The covenant God made with Abraham some
 ages ago was, <I>I will be to thee a God,</I> a God all-sufficient. 
 "Now," saith God, "that covenant is still in full force; it is not 
 cancelled nor forgotten, but I am, as I was, the God of Abraham, and 
 now I will make it to appear so;" for all the favours, all the honours 
 God put upon Israel, were founded upon this covenant with Abraham, and 
 flowed from it.

 2. "I will be the same that I am." For if the death of Abraham, Isaac, 
 and Jacob, cannot break the covenant-relation between God and them (as 
 by this it appears it cannot), then nothing else can: and then he will 
 be a God, 

 (1.) To their souls, which are now separated from their bodies. Our 
 Saviour by this proves the future state, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:31,32">Matt. xxii. 31, 32</A>.

 Abraham is dead, and yet God is still his God, therefore Abraham is 
 still alive. God never did that for him in this world which would
 answer the true intent and full extent of that promise, that he would 
 be the God of Abraham; and therefore it must be done for him in the 
 other world. Now this is that life and immortality which are brought to 
 light by the gospel, for the full conviction of the Sadducees, who 
 denied it. Those therefore who stood up in defence of the gospel, and 
 endeavoured to propagate it, were so far from blaspheming Moses that 
 they did the greatest honour imaginable to Moses, and that glorious 
 discovery which God made of himself to him at the bush. 

 (2.) To their seed. God, in declaring himself thus the God of their 
 fathers, intimated his kindness to their seed, that they should be 
 <I>beloved for the fathers' sakes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:28,De+7:8">Rom. xi. 28; Deut. vii. 8</A>.

 Now the preachers of the gospel preached up this covenant, <I>the
 promise made of God unto the fathers; unto which promise</I> those of 
 <I>the twelve tribes</I> that did continue <I>serving God hoped to 
 come,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:6,7"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 6, 7</A>.

 And shall they, under colour of supporting the holy place and the law,
 oppose the covenant which was made with Abraham and his seed, his 
 spiritual seed, before the law was given, and long before the holy 
 place was built? Since God's glory must be for ever advanced, and our 
 glorying for ever silenced, God will have our salvation to be by 
 promise, and not by the law; the Jews therefore who persecuted the 
 Christians, under pretence that they blasphemed the law, did themselves 
 blaspheme the promise, and forsook all their own mercies that were 
 contained in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The commission which God gave him to deliver Israel out of Egypt. 
 The Jews set up Moses in competition with Christ, and accused Stephen 
 as a blasphemer because he did not do so too. But Stephen here shows 
 that Moses was an eminent type of Christ, as he was Israel's deliverer. 
 When God had declared himself the God of Abraham he proceeded, 

 1. To order Moses into a reverent posture: "<I>Put off thy shoes from 
 thy feet.</I> Enter not upon sacred things with low, and cold, and 
 common thoughts. <I>Keep thy foot,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:1">Eccl. v. 1</A>.

 Be not hasty and rash in thy approaches to God; tread softly."

 2. To order Moses into a very eminent service. When he is ready to
 receive commands, he shall have commission. He is commissioned to
 demand leave from Pharaoh for Israel to go out of his land, and to
 enforce that demand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) The notice God took both of their sufferings and of their sense of
 their sufferings: <I>I have seen, I have seen their affliction, and 
 have heard their groaning.</I> God has a compassionate regard to the 
 troubles of his church, and the groans of his persecuted people; and 
 their deliverance takes rise from his pity. 

 (2.) The determination he fixed to redeem them by the hand of Moses: 
 <I>I am come down to deliver them.</I> It should seem, though God is 
 present in all places, yet he uses that expression here of coming down 
 to deliver them because that deliverance was typical of what Christ 
 did, when, <I>for us men, and for our salvation, he came down from 
 heaven; he that ascended first descended.</I> Moses is the man that 
 must be employed: <I>Come, and I will send thee into Egypt:</I> and, if
 God send him, he will own him and give him success.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His acting in pursuance of this commission, wherein he was a figure 
 of the Messiah. And Stephen takes notice here again of the slights they 
 had put upon him, the affronts they had given him, and their refusal to 
 have him to reign over them, as tending very much to magnify his agency 
 in their deliverance. 

 1. God put honour upon him whom they put contempt upon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>This Moses whom they refused</I> (whose kind offers and good offices
 they rejected with scorn, <I>saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? 
 Thou takest too much upon thee, thou son of Levi,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:3">Num. xvi. 3</A>),

 this same Moses <I>did God send to be a ruler, and a deliverer, by the
 hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.</I> It may be 
 understood either that God sent to him by the hand of the angel going 
 along with him he became a complete deliverer. Now, by this example, 
 Stephen would intimate to the council <I>that this Jesus whom they now 
 refused,</I> as their fathers did Moses, <I>saying, Who made thee a 
 prophet and a king? Who gave thee this authority?</I> even this same 
 has God advanced <I>to be a prince and a Saviour, a ruler and a 
 deliverer;</I> as the apostles had told them awhile ago

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:30"><I>ch.</I> v. 30, 31</A>),

 <I>that the stone which the builders refused was become the head-stone
 in the corner,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:11"><I>ch.</I> iv. 11</A>.

 2. God showed favour to them by him, and he was very forward to serve
 them, though they had thrust him away. God might justly have refused 
 them his service, and he might justly have declined it; but it is all 
 forgotten: they are not so much as upbraided with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 <I>He brought them out,</I> notwithstanding, <I>after he had shown 
 wonders and signs in the land of Egypt</I> (which were afterwards 
 continued for the completing of their deliverance, according as the 
 case called for them) <I>in the Red Sea and in the wilderness forty 
 years.</I> So far is he from blaspheming Moses that he admires him as a 
 glorious instrument in the hand of God for the forming of the 
 Old-Testament church. But it does not at all derogate from his just 
 honour to say that he was but an instrument, and that he is outshone by 
 this Jesus, whom he encourages these Jews yet to close with, and to 
 come into his interest, not fearing but that then they should be 
 received into his favour, and receive benefit by him, as the people of 
 Israel were delivered by Moses, though they had once refused him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His prophecy of Christ and his grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 He not only was a type of Christ (many were so that perhaps had not an 
 actual foresight of his day), but Moses spoke of him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>This is that Moses who said unto the children of Israel, A prophet 
 shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren.</I> This is 
 spoken of as one of the greatest honours God put upon him (nay, as that 
 which exceeded all the rest), that by him he gave notice to the 
 children of Israel of the great prophet that should come into the 
 world, raised their expectation of him, and required them to receive 
 him. When his bringing them out of Egypt is spoken of it is with an 
 emphasis of honour, <I>This is that Moses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:26">Exod. vi. 26</A>.

 And so it is here, <I>This is that Moses.</I> Now this is very full to
 Stephen's purpose; in asserting that Jesus should change the customs of 
 the ceremonial law, he was so far from blaspheming Moses that really he 
 did him the greatest honour imaginable, by showing how the prophecy of 
 Moses was accomplished, which was so clear, that, as Christ told them 
 himself, <I>If they had believed Moses, they would have believed 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:46">John v. 46</A>.

 1. Moses, in God's name, told them that, in the fulness of time, they
 should have a prophet raised up among them, one of their own nation, 
 that should be like unto him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:15,18">Deut. xviii. 15, 18</A>),--

 a ruler and a deliverer, a judge and a lawgiver, like him,--who should
 therefore have authority to change the customs that he had delivered, 
 and to bring in a better hope, as <I>the Mediator of a better 
 testament.</I> 

 2. He charged them to hear that prophet, to receive his dictates, to
 admit the change he would make in their customs, and to submit to him 
 in every thing; "and this will be the greatest honour you can do to 
 Moses and to his law, who said, <I>Hear you him;</I> and came to be a 
 witness to the repetition of this charge by <I>a voice from heaven,</I> 
 at the transfiguration of Christ, and by his silence gave consent to 
 it,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:5">Matt. xvii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The eminent services which Moses continued to do to the people of 
 Israel, after he had been instrumental to bring them out of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 And herein also he was a type of Christ, who yet so far exceeds him 
 that it is no blasphemy to say, "He has authority to change the customs 
 that Moses delivered." It was the honour of Moses, 

 1. That <I>he was in the church in the wilderness;</I> he presided in
 all the affairs of it for forty years, was king in Jeshurun,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:5">Deut. xxxiii. 5</A>.

 The camp of Israel is here called <I>the church in the wilderness;</I>
 for it was a sacred society, incorporated by a divine charter under a 
 divine government, and blessed with divine revelation. The church in 
 the wilderness was a church, though it was not yet perfectly formed, as 
 it was to be when they came to Canaan, <I>but every man did that which 
 was right in his own eyes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:8,9">Deut. xii. 8, 9</A>.

 It was the honour of Moses that he was in that church, and many a time 
 it had been destroyed if Moses had not been in it to intercede for it. 
 But Christ is the president and guide of a more excellent and glorious 
 church than that in the wilderness was, and is more in it, as the life
 and soul of it, than Moses could be in that.

 2. That <I>he was with the angel that spoke to him in the mount Sinai,
 and with our fathers</I>--was with him in the holy mount twice forty
 days, with the angel of the covenant, Michael, our prince. Moses was
 immediately conversant with God, but never lay in his bosom as Christ 
 did from eternity. Or these words may be taken thus: <I>Moses was in 
 the church in the wilderness,</I> but it was <I>with the angel that 
 spoke to him in mount Sinai,</I> that is, at the burning bush; for that 
 was said to be at mount Sinai

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>);

 that angel went before him, and was guide to him, else he could not 
 have been a guide to Israel; of this God speaks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:20">Exod. xxiii. 20</A>),

 <I>I send an angel before thee,</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:2">Exod. xxxiii. 2</A>.
 
 And see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:16">Num. xx. 16</A>.

 He was in the church with the angel, without whom he could have done no
 service to the church; but Christ is himself that angel which was with 
 the church in the wilderness, and therefore has an authority above 
 Moses.

 3. That <I>he received the lively oracles to give unto them;</I> not 
 only the ten commandments, but the other instructions which <I>the Lord 
 spoke unto Moses, saying, Speak them to the children of Israel.</I>

 (1.) The words of God are <I>oracles,</I> certain and infallible, and
 of unquestionable authority and obligation; they are to be consulted as 
 oracles, and by them all controversies must be determined. 

 (2.) They are <I>lively oracles,</I> for they are the oracles of the 
 living God, not of the dumb and dead idols of the heathens: the word 
 that God speaks is spirit and life; not that the law of Moses could 
 give life, but it showed the way to life: <I>If thou wilt enter into 
 life, keep the commandments.</I> 

 (3.) Moses received them from God, and delivered nothing as an oracle 
 to the people but what <I>he had first received from God.</I> 

 (4.) The lively oracles which he received from God he faithfully gave 
 to the people, to be observed and preserved. It was the principal 
 privilege of the Jews that <I>to them were committed the oracles of 
 God;</I> and it was by the hand of Moses that they were committed. As 
 Moses gave them not that bread, so neither did he give them that law 
 from heaven 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:32">John vi. 32</A>),

 but God gave it to them; and he that gave them those customs by his 
 servant Moses might, no doubt, when he pleased, change the customs by 
 his Son Jesus, who received more lively oracles to give unto us than 
 Moses did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The contempt that was, after this, and notwithstanding this, put 
 upon him by the people. Those that charged Stephen with speaking 
 against Moses would do well to answer what their own ancestors had 
 done, and they tread in their ancestors' steps. 

 1. <I>They would not obey him, but thrust him from them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 They murmured at him, mutinied against him, refused to obey his orders, 
 and sometimes were ready to stone him. Moses did indeed give them an 
 excellent law, but by this it appeared that <I>it could not make the 
 comers there unto perfect</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1">Heb. x. 1</A>),

 for <I>in their hearts they turned back again into Egypt,</I> and 
 preferred their garlic and onions there before the manna they had under 
 the guidance of Moses, or the milk and honey they hoped for in Canaan. 
 Observe, Their secret disaffection to Moses, with their inclination to 
 Egyptianism, if I may so call it. This was, in effect, turning back to 
 Egypt; it was doing it in heart. Many that pretend to be going forward 
 towards Canaan, by keeping up a show and profession of religion, are, 
 at the same time, in their hearts turning back to Egypt, like Lot's 
 wife to Sodom, and will be dealt with as deserters, for it is the heart 
 that God looks at. Now, if the customs that Moses delivered to them 
 could not prevail to change them, wonder not that Christ comes to 
 change the customs, and to introduce a more spiritual way of worship. 
 
 2. <I>They made a golden calf</I> instead of him, which besides the
 affront that was thereby offered to God, was a great indignity to 
 Moses: for it was upon this consideration that they made the calf, 
 because "<I>as for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, 
 we know not what is become of him;</I> therefore make us gods of gold;" 
 as if a calf were sufficient to supply the want of Moses, and as 
 capable of going before them into the promised land. <I>So they made a
 calf in those days</I> when the law was given them, <I>and offered 
 sacrifices unto the idol, and rejoiced in the work of their own 
 hands.</I> So proud were they of their new god that when they had 
 <I>sat down to eat and drink, they rose up to play!</I> By all this it 
 appears that there was a great deal which the law could not do, <I>in 
 that it was weak through the flesh;</I> it was therefore necessary that 
 this law should be perfected by a better hand, and he was no blasphemer 
 against Moses who said that Christ had done it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>42 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of
 heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house
 of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices <I>by
 the space of</I> forty years in the wilderness?
 &nbsp; 43 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of
 your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I
 will carry you away beyond Babylon.
 &nbsp; 44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness,
 as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it
 according to the fashion that he had seen.
 &nbsp; 45 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus
 into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before
 the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;
 &nbsp; 46 Who found favour before God, and desired to find a
 tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
 &nbsp; 47 But Solomon built him a house.
 &nbsp; 48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things we have in these verses:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Stephen upbraids them with the idolatry of their fathers, which God 
 gave them up to, as a punishment for their early forsaking him in 
 worshipping the golden calf; and this was the saddest punishment of all 
 for that sin, as it was of the idolatry of the Gentile world <I>that 
 God gave them up to a reprobate mind.</I> When <I>Israel was joined to 
 idols,</I> joined to the golden calf, and not long after to Baal-peor, 
 God said, <I>Let them alone;</I> let them go on 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):

 <I>Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven.</I> 
 He particularly cautioned them not to do it, at their peril, and gave 
 them reasons why they should not; but, when they were bent upon it, 
 <I>he gave them up to their own hearts; lust,</I> withdrew his 
 restraining grace, and then they walked in their own counsels, and were 
 so scandalously mad upon their idols as never any people were. Compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19,Jer+8:2">Deut. iv. 19 with Jer. viii. 2</A>.
 
 For this he quotes a passage out of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:25">Amos v. 25</A>.
 
 For it would be less invidious to tell them their own [character and
 doom] from an Old-Testament prophet, who upbraids them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For not sacrificing to their own God in the wilderness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):
 
 <I>Have you offered to me slain beasts, and sacrifices, by the space of 
 forty years in the wilderness?</I> No; during all that time sacrifices 
 to God were intermitted; they did not so much as keep the passover 
 after the second year. It was God's condescension to them that he did 
 not insist upon it during their unsettled state; but then let them 
 consider how ill they requited him in offering sacrifices to idols, 
 when God dispensed with their offering them to him. This is also a 
 check to their zeal for the customs that Moses delivered to them, and 
 their fear of having them changed by <I>this Jesus,</I> that 
 immediately after they were delivered these customs were for forty 
 years together disused as needless things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. For sacrificing to other gods after they came to Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):
 
 <I>You took up the tabernacle of Moloch.</I> Moloch was the idol of the 
 children of Ammon, to which they barbarously offered their own children 
 in sacrifice, which they could not do without great terror and grief to 
 themselves and their families; yet this unnatural idolatry they arrived 
 at, when <I>God gave them up to worship the host of heaven.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:3">2 Chron. xxviii. 3</A>.

 It was surely the strongest delusion that ever people were given up to,
 and the greatest instance of the power of Satan in the children of 
 disobedience, and therefore it is here spoken of emphatically: <I>Yea, 
 you took up the tabernacle of Moloch,</I> you submitted even to that, 
 and to the worship of <I>the star of your god Remphan.</I> Some think 
 Remphan signifies <I>the moon,</I> as Moloch does <I>the sun;</I> 
 others take it for <I>Saturn,</I> for that planet is called 
 <I>Remphan</I> in the Syriac and Persian languages. The Septuagint puts 
 it for <I>Chiun,</I> as being a name more commonly known. They had 
 images representing the star, like the silver shrines for Diana, here 
 called <I>the figures which they made to worship.</I> Dr. Lightfoot 
 thinks they had figures representing the whole starry firmament, with 
 all the constellations, and the planets, and these are called 
 <I>Remphan</I>--"the high representation," like the celestial globe: a
 poor thing to make an idol of, and yet better than a golden calf! Now 
 for this it is threatened, <I>I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</I> 
 In Amos it is <I>beyond Damascus,</I> meaning <I>to Babylon, the land 
 of the north.</I> But Stephen changes it, with an eye to the captivity 
 of the ten tribes, who were <I>carried away beyond Babylon, by the 
 river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:6">2 Kings xvii. 6</A>.

 Let it not therefore seem strange to them to hear of the destruction of
 this place, for they had heard of it many a time from the prophets of 
 the Old Testament, who were not therefore accused as blasphemers by any 
 but the wicked rulers. It was observed, in the debate on Jeremiah's 
 case, that Micah was not called to an account though he prophesied, 
 saying, <I>Zion shall be ploughed as a field,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+26:18,19">Jer. xxvi. 18, 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives an answer particularly to the charge exhibited against him
 relating to the temple, <I>that he spoke blasphemous words against that
 holy place,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:44-50"><I>v.</I> 44-50</A>.

 He was accused for saying that Jesus would destroy this holy place:
 "And what if I did say so?" (saith Stephen) "the glory of the holy God 
 is not bound up in the glory of this holy place, but that may be 
 preserved untouched, though this be laid in the dust;" for, 

 1. "It was not till our fathers came into the wilderness, in their way
 to Canaan, that they had any fixed place of worship; and yet the 
 patriarchs, many ages before, worshipped God acceptably at the altars 
 they had adjoining to their own tents <I>in the open air--sub dio;</I>
 and he that was worshipped without a holy place in the first, and best, 
 and purest ages of the Old-Testament church, may and will be so when 
 this holy place is destroyed, without any diminution to his glory." 

 2. The holy place was at first but a tabernacle, mean and movable,
 showing itself to be short-lived, and not designed to continue always. 
 Why might not this holy place, though built of stones, be decently 
 brought to its end, and give place to its betters, as well as that 
 though framed of curtains? As it was no dishonour, but an honour to
 God, that the tabernacle gave way to the temple, so it is now that the 
 material temple gives way to the spiritual one, and so it will be when, 
 at last, the spiritual temple shall give way to the eternal one. 

 3. That tabernacle was <I>a tabernacle of witness,</I> or of
 testimony, <I>a figure of good things to come, of the true tabernacle 
 which the Lord pitched, and not men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:2">Heb. viii. 2</A>.

 This was the glory both of the tabernacle and temple, that they were
 erected for a testimony of that temple of God which in the latter days 
 should be opened in heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:19">Rev. xi. 19</A>),

 and of Christ's tabernacling on earth (as the word is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14">John i. 14</A>),

 and of the temple of his body. 

 4. That tabernacle was framed just as God appointed, and <I>according 
 to the fashion which Moses saw in the mount,</I> which plainly 
 intimates that it had reference to good things to come. Its rise being 
 heavenly, its meaning and tendency were so; and therefore it was no 
 diminution at all to its glory to say that this temple made with hands 
 should be destroyed, in order to the building of <I>another made 
 without hands,</I> which was Christ's crime 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:58">Mark xiv. 58</A>),

 and Stephen's. 

 5. That tabernacle was pitched first in the wilderness; it was not a 
 native of this land of yours (to which you think it must for ever be 
 confined), but was brought in in the next age, by our fathers, who came 
 after those who first erected it, into the possession of the Gentiles, 
 into the land of Canaan, which had long been in the possession of the 
 devoted nations <I>whom God drove out before the face of our 
 fathers.</I> And why may not God set up his spiritual temple, as he had 
 done the material tabernacle, in those countries that were now the 
 possession of the Gentiles? That tabernacle was brought in by those who 
 came <I>with Jesus,</I> that is, <I>Joshua.</I> And I think, for 
 distinction sake, and to prevent mistakes, it ought to be so read, both 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:45,Heb+4:8">here and Heb. iv. 8</A>.

 Yet in naming <I>Joshua</I> here, which in Greek is <I>Jesus,</I> there
 may be a tacit intimation that as the Old-Testament Joshua brought in 
 that typical tabernacle, so the New-Testament Joshua should bring in 
 the true tabernacle into the possession of the Gentiles.

 6. That tabernacle continued for many ages, <I>even to the days of
 David,</I> above four hundred years, before there was any thought of
 building a temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 David, having <I>found favour before God,</I> did indeed desire this 
 further favour, to have leave to build God a house, to be a constant 
 settled tabernacle, or dwelling-place, for the Shechinah, or the tokens 
 of the presence of the God of Jacob, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.

 Those who have found favour with God should show themselves forward to 
 advance the interests of his kingdom among men.

 7. God had his heart so little upon a temple, or such a holy place as
 they were so jealous for, that, when David desired to build one, he was
 forbidden to do it; God was in no haste for one, as he told David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:7">2 Sam. vii. 7</A>),

 and therefore it was not he, but his son Solomon, some years after, 
 that built him a house. David had all that sweet communion with God in
 public worship which we read of in his Psalms before there was any 
 temple built. 

 8. God often declared that temples made with hands were not his 
 delight, nor could add any thing to the perfection of his rest and joy. 
 Solomon, when he dedicated the temple, acknowledged that God 
 <I>dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</I> he has not need of 
 them, is not benefited by them, cannot be confined to them. The whole 
 world is his temple, in which he is every where present, and fills it 
 with his glory; and what occasion has he for a temple then to manifest 
 himself in? Indeed the pretended deities of the heathen needed temples 
 made with hands, for they were gods made with hands

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 and had no other place to manifest themselves in than in their own 
 temples; but the one only true and living God needs no temple, for 
 <I>the heaven is his throne,</I> in which he rests, <I>and the earth is 
 his footstool,</I> over which he rules 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:49,50"><I>v.</I> 49, 50</A>),

 and therefore, <I>What house will you build me,</I> comparable to this 
 which I have already? <I>Or, what is the place of my rest?</I> What
 need have I of a house, either to repose myself in or to show myself? 
 <I>Hath not my hand made all these things?</I> And <I>these show his 
 eternal power and Godhead</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:20">Rom. i. 20</A>);

 they so show themselves to all mankind that those who worship other 
 gods are without excuse. And as the world is thus God's temple, wherein 
 he is manifested, so it is God's temple in which he will be worshipped. 
 As the earth is full of his glory, and is therefore his temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:3">Isa. vi. 3</A>),
 
 so the earth is, or shall be, full of his praise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:3">Hab. iii. 3</A>),
 
 <I>and all the ends of the earth shall fear him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:7">Ps. lxvii. 7</A>),

 and upon this account it is his temple. It was therefore no reflection 
 at all upon this holy place, however they might take it, to say <I>that 
 Jesus should destroy this temple,</I> and set up another, into which 
 all nations should be admitted,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:16,17"><I>ch.</I> xv. 16, 17</A>.

 And it would not seem strange to those who considered that scripture
 which Stephen here quotes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:1-3">Isa. lxvi. 1-3</A>),

 which, as it expressed God's comparative contempt of the external part 
 of his service, so it plainly foretold the rejection of the unbelieving 
 Jews, and the welcome of the Gentiles that were of a contrite spirit 
 into the church.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>51 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do
 always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers <I>did,</I> so <I>do</I> ye.
 &nbsp; 52 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Stephen was going on in his discourse (as it should seem by the thread 
 of it) to show that, as the temple, so the temple-service must come to 
 an end, and it would be the glory of both to give way to that worship 
 of the Father in spirit and in truth which was to be established in the 
 kingdom of the Messiah, stripped of the pompous ceremonies of the old 
 law, and so he was going to apply all this which he had said more 
 closely to his present purpose; but he perceived they could not bear 
 it. They could patiently hear the history of the Old Testament told (it 
 was a piece of learning which they themselves dealt much in); but if 
 Stephen go about to tell them that their power and tyranny must come 
 down, and that the church must be governed by a spirit of holiness and 
 love, and heavenly-mindedness, they will not so much as give him the 
 hearing. It is probable that he perceived this, and that they were 
 going to silence him; and therefore he breaks off abruptly in the midst 
 of his discourse, and by that spirit of wisdom, courage, and power, 
 wherewith he was filled, he sharply rebuked his persecutors, and 
 exposed their true character; for, if they will not admit the testimony 
 of the gospel to them, it shall become a testimony against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They, like their fathers, were stubborn and wilful, and would not be 
 wrought upon by the various methods God took to reclaim and reform 
 them; they were like their fathers, inflexible both to the word of God 
 and to his providences. 

 1. They were <I>stiff-necked</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 and would not submit their necks to the sweet and easy yoke of God's 
 government, nor draw in it, but were <I>like a bullock unaccustomed to 
 the yoke;</I> or they would not bow their heads, no, not to God 
 himself, would not do obeisance to him, would not humble themselves 
 before him. The stiff neck is the same with the hard heart, obstinate 
 and contumacious, and that will not yield--the general character of the
 Jewish nation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:9;33:3,5;De+9:6,13;31:27;Eze+2:4">Exod. xxxii. 9; 
 xxxiii. 3, 5; xxxiv. 9; Deut. ix. 6, 13; xxxi. 27; Ezek. ii. 4</A>.

 2. They were <I>uncircumcised in heart and ears</I> their hearts and
 ears were not devoted and given up to God, as the body of the people 
 were in profession by the sign of circumcision: "In name and show you 
 are circumcised Jews, but in heart and ears you are still uncircumcised 
 heathens, and pay no more deference to the authority of your God than 
 they do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:26">Jer. ix. 26</A>.

 You are under the power of unmortified lusts and corruptions, which
 stop your ears to the voice of God, and harden your hearts to that 
 which is both most commanding and most affecting." They had not that 
 <I>circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins 
 of the flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:11">Col. ii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They, like their fathers, were not only not influenced by the 
 methods God took to reform them, but they were enraged and incensed 
 against them: <I>You do always resist the Holy Ghost.</I> 

 1. They resisted the Holy Ghost speaking to them by the prophets, whom
 they opposed and contradicted, hated and ridiculed; this seems 
 especially meant here, by the following explication, <I>Which of the 
 prophets have not your fathers persecuted?</I> In persecuting and 
 silencing those that spoke by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost they 
 resisted the Holy Ghost. Their fathers resisted the Holy Ghost in the 
 prophets that God raised up to them, and so did they in Christ's 
 apostles and ministers, who spoke by the same Spirit, and had greater 
 measures of his gifts than the prophets of the Old Testament had, and 
 yet were more resisted.

 2. They resisted the Holy Ghost striving with them by their own
 consciences, and would not comply with the convictions and dictates of 
 them. God's Spirit strove with them as with the old world, but in vain; 
 they resisted him, took part with their corruptions against their 
 convictions, and rebelled against the light. There is that in our
 sinful hearts that always resists the Holy Ghost, a flesh that lusts 
 against the Spirit, and wars against his motions; but in the hearts of 
 God's elect, when the fulness of time comes, this resistance is 
 overcomer and overpowered, and after a struggle the throne of Christ is 
 set up in the soul, and every thought that had exalted itself against 
 it is brought into captivity to it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:4,5">2 Cor. x. 4, 5</A>.

 That grace therefore which effects this change might more fitly be
 called <I>victorious</I> grace than <I>irresistible.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They, like their fathers, persecuted and slew those whom God sent 
 unto them to call them to duty, and make them offers of mercy. 

 1. Their fathers had been the cruel and constant persecutors of the
 Old-Testament prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>):

 <I>Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?</I> More or 
 less, one time or other, they had a blow at them all. With regard even 
 to those that lived in the best reigns, when the princes did not 
 persecute them, there was a malignant party in the nation that mocked 
 at them and abused them, and most of them were at last, either by 
 colour of law or popular fury, put to death; and that which aggravated 
 the sin of persecuting the prophets was, that the business of the 
 prophets they were so spiteful at was to <I>show before of the coming 
 of the just One,</I> to give notice of God's kind intentions towards 
 that people, to send the Messiah among them in the fulness of time. 
 Those that were the messengers of such glad tidings should have been 
 courted and caressed, and have had the preferments of the best of 
 benefactors; but, instead of this, they had the treatment of the worst 
 of malefactors. 

 2. They had been the <I>betrayers and murderers of the just One</I>
 himself, as Peter had told them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:14,15;5:30"><I>ch.</I> iii. 14, 15; v. 30</A>.

 They had hired Judas to betray him, and had in a manner forced Pilate
 to condemn him; and therefore it is charged upon them that they were 
 his betrayers and murders. Thus they were the genuine seed of those who 
 slew the prophets that foretold his coming, which, by slaying him, they 
 showed they would have done if they had lived then; and thus, as our 
 Saviour had told them, they brought upon themselves the guilt of the 
 blood of all the prophets. To which of the prophets would those have 
 shown any respect who had no regard to the Son of God himself?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They, like their fathers, put contempt upon divine revelation, and 
 would not be guided and governed by it; and this was the aggravation of 
 their sin, that God had given, as to their fathers his law, so to them 
 his gospel, in vain. 

 1. Their fathers received the law, and did not observe it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>.

 God wrote to them the great things of his law, after he had first 
 spoken them to them; and yet they were counted by them as a strange or 
 foreign thing, which they were no way concerned in. The law is said to 
 be <I>received by the disposition of angels,</I> because angels were 
 employed in the solemnity of giving the law, in the thunderings and 
 lightnings, and the sound of the trumpet. It is said to be <I>ordained 
 by angels</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:19">Gal. iii. 19</A>),

 God is said to come <I>with ten thousand</I> of his saints to give the 
 law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:2">Deut. xxxiii. 2</A>),
 
 and it was a <I>word spoken by angels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:2">Heb. ii. 2</A>.
 
 This put an honour both upon the law and the Lawgiver, and should 
 increase our veneration for both. But those that thus received the law
 yet kept it not, but by making the golden calf broke it immediately in 
 a capital instance. 

 2. They received the gospel now, by the disposition, not of angels, but
 of the Holy Ghost,--not with the sound of a trumpet, but, which was
 more strange, in the gift of tongues, and yet they did not embrace it. 
 They would not yield to the plainest demonstrations, any more than 
 their fathers before them did, for they were resolved not to comply 
 with God either in his law or in his gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have reason to think Stephen had a great deal more to say, and would 
 have said it if they would have suffered him; but they were wicked and 
 unreasonable men with whom he had to do, that could no more hear reason 
 than they could speak it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart,
 and they gnashed on him with <I>their</I> teeth.
 &nbsp; 55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly
 into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the
 right hand of God,
 &nbsp; 56 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of
 man standing on the right hand of God.
 &nbsp; 57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their
 ears, and ran upon him with one accord,
 &nbsp; 58 And cast <I>him</I> out of the city, and stoned <I>him:</I> and the
 witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose
 name was Saul.
 &nbsp; 59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon <I>God,</I> and saying,
 Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
 &nbsp; 60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay
 not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell
 asleep.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the death of the first martyr of the Christian church, and 
 there is in this story a lively instance of the outrage and fury of the 
 persecutors (such as we may expect to meet with if we are called out to 
 suffer for Christ), and of the courage and comfort of the persecuted, 
 that are thus called out. Here is hell in its fire and darkness, and 
 heaven in its light and brightness; and these serve as foils to set off 
 each other. It is not here said that the votes of the council were 
 taken upon his case, and that by the majority he was found guilty, and 
 then condemned and ordered to be stoned to death, according to the law, 
 as a blasphemer; but, it is likely, so it was, and that it was not by 
 the violence of the people, without order of the council, that he was 
 put to death; for here is the usual ceremony of regular executions--he
 was cast out of the city, and the hands of the witnesses were first 
 upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us observe here the wonderful discomposure of the spirits of his 
 enemies and persecutors, and the wonderful composure of his spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See the strength of corruption in the persecutors of Stephen--malice
 in perfection, hell itself broken loose, men become incarnate devils, 
 and the serpent's seed spitting their venom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>When they heard these things they were cut to the heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>),
 
 <B><I>dieprionto,</I></B> the same word that is used 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:37">Heb. xi. 37</A>,

 and translated <I>they were sawn asunder.</I> They were put to as much 
 torture in their minds as ever the martyrs were put to in their bodies. 
 They were filled with indignation at the unanswerable arguments that 
 Stephen urged for their conviction, and that they could find nothing to 
 say against them. They were not pricked to the heart with sorrow, as 
 those were 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:37"><I>ch.</I> ii. 37</A>,

 but cut to the heart with rage and fury, as they themselves were,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:33"><I>ch.</I> v. 33</A>.

 Stephen rebuked them sharply, as Paul expresses it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:13">Tit. i. 13</A>),
 
 <B><I>apotomos</I></B>--<I>cuttingly,</I> for they were cut to the heart
 by the reproof. Note, Rejecters of the gospel and opposers of it are 
 really tormentors to themselves. Enmity to God is a heart-cutting 
 thing; faith and love are heart-healing. When they heard how he that 
 <I>looked like an angel</I> before he began his discourse talked like 
 an angel, like a messenger from heaven, before he concluded it, they 
 were <I>like a wild bull in a net, full of the fury of the Lord,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:20">Isa. li. 20</A>),

 despairing to run down a cause so bravely pleaded, and yet resolved not 
 to yield to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They <I>gnashed upon him with their teeth.</I> This denotes, 

 (1.) Great malice and rage against him. Job complained of his enemy 
 that he <I>gnashed upon him with his teeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:9">Job xvi. 9</A>.

 The language of this was, <I>Oh that we had of his flesh to eat!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:31">Job xxxi. 31</A>.

 They <I>grinned at him,</I> as dogs at those they are enraged at; and 
 therefore Paul, cautioning against those of the circumcision, says, 
 <I>Beware of dogs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:2">Phil. iii. 2</A>.

 Enmity at the saints turns men into brute beasts. 

 (2.) Great vexation within themselves; they fretted to see in him such 
 manifest tokens of a divine power and presence, and it vexed them to 
 the heart. The <I>wicked shall see it and be grieved, he shall gnash 
 with his teeth and melt away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:10">Ps. cxii. 10</A>.

 Gnashing with the teeth is often used to express the horror and
 torments of the damned. Those that have the malice of hell cannot but 
 have with it some of the pains of hell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>They cried out with a loud voice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>),

 to irritate and excite one another, and to drown the noise of the 
 clamours of their own and one another's consciences; when he said, <I>I 
 see heaven opened,</I> they cried with a loud voice, that he might not 
 be heard to speak. Note, It is very common for a righteous cause, 
 particularly the righteous cause of Christ's religion, to be attempted 
 to be run down by noise and clamour; what is wanting in reason is made 
 up in tumult, and <I>the cry of him that ruleth among fools, while the 
 words of the wise are heard in quiet.</I> They cried with a loud voice, 
 as soldiers when they are going to engage in battle, mustering up all 
 their spirit and vigour for this desperate encounter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They <I>stopped their ears,</I> that they might not hear their own 
 noisiness; or perhaps under pretence that they could not bear to hear 
 his blasphemies. As Caiaphas rent his clothes when Christ said, 
 <I>Hereafter you shall see the Son of man coming in glory</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:64,65">Matt. xxvi. 64, 65</A>),

 so here these <I>stopped their ears</I> when Stephen said, <I>I now see 
 the Son of man standing in glory,</I> both pretending that what was 
 spoken was not to be heard with patience. Their stopping their ears 
 was, 

 (1.) A manifest specimen of their wilful obstinacy; they were resolved 
 they would not hear what had a tendency to convince them, which was 
 what the prophets often complained of: they were <I>like the deaf 
 adder, that will not hear the voice of the charmer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:4,5">Ps. lviii. 4, 5</A>.

 (2.) It was a fatal omen of that judicial hardness to which God would
 give them up. They stopped their ears, and then God, in a way of 
 righteous judgment, stopped them. This was the work that was now in 
 doing with the unbelieving Jews: <I>Make the heart of this people fat, 
 and their ears heavy;</I> thus was Stephen's character of them 
 answered, <I>You uncircumcised in heart and ears.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They <I>ran upon him with one accord</I>--the people and the elders
 of the people, judges, prosecutors, witnesses, and spectators, they all 
 flew upon him, as beasts upon their prey. See how violent they were, 
 and in what haste--they ran upon him, though there was no danger of his
 outrunning them; and see how unanimous they were in this evil 
 thing--they ran upon him <I>with one accord,</I> one and all, hoping
 thereby to terrify him, and put him into confusion, envying him his 
 composure and comfort in soul, with which he wonderfully enjoyed 
 himself in the midst of this hurry; they did all they could to ruffle 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. They <I>cast him out of the city, and stoned him,</I> as if he were 
 not worthy to live in Jerusalem; nay, not worthy to live in this world, 
 pretending herein to execute the law of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:16">Lev. xxiv. 16</A>),

 <I>He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord shall surely be put to 
 death, all the congregation shall certainly stone him.</I> And thus 
 they had put Christ to death, when this same court had found him guilty 
 of blasphemy, but that, for his greater ignominy, they were desirous he 
 should be crucified, and God overruled it for the fulfilling of the 
 scripture. The fury with which they managed the execution is intimated 
 in this: they cast him out of the city, as if they could not bear the 
 sight of him; they treated him as an anathema, as the offscouring of 
 all things. The witnesses against him were the leaders in the 
 execution, according to the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:7">Deut. xvii. 7</A>),

 <I>The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him, to put him to
 death,</I> and particularly in the case of blasphemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:14,De+13:9">Lev. xxiv. 14; Deut. xiii. 9</A>.

 Thus they were to confirm their testimony. Now, the stoning of a man 
 being a laborious piece of work, the witnesses took off their upper 
 garments, that they might not hang in their way, <I>and they laid them 
 down at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul,</I> now a pleased 
 spectator of this tragedy. It is the first time we find mention of his 
 name; we shall know it and love it better when we find it changed to 
 <I>Paul,</I> and him changed from a persecutor into a preacher. This 
 little instance of his agency in Stephen's death he afterwards 
 reflected upon with regret

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:20"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 20</A>):

 <I>I kept the raiment of those that slew him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See the strength of grace in Stephen, and the wonderful instances 
 of God's favour to him, and working in him. As his persecutors were 
 full of Satan, so was he <I>full of the Holy Ghost,</I> fuller than 
 ordinary, anointed with fresh oil for the comb at, that, as the day, so 
 might the strength be. Upon this account those are <I>blessed who are 
 persecuted for righteousness' sake,</I> that <I>the Spirit of God and 
 of glory rests upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:14">1 Pet. iv. 14</A>.

 When he was chosen to public service, he was described to be a man
 <I>full of the Holy Ghost</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:5"><I>ch.</I> vi. 5</A>),

 and now he is called out to martyrdom he has still the same character.
 Note, Those that are full of the Holy Ghost are fit for any thing, 
 either to act for Christ or to suffer for him. And those whom God calls 
 out to difficult services for his name he will qualify for those 
 services, and carry comfortably through them, by filling them with the 
 Holy Ghost, that, as their afflictions for Christ abound, their 
 consolation in him may yet more abound, and then <I>none of these 
 things move them.</I> Now here we have a remarkable communion between 
 this blessed martyr and the blessed Jesus in this critical moment. When 
 the followers of Christ are for his sake <I>killed all the day long, 
 and accounted as sheep for the slaughter,</I> does this separate them 
 from the love of Christ? Does he love them the less? Do they love him 
 the less? No, by no means; and so it appears by this narrative, in 
 which we may observe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ's gracious manifestation of himself to Stephen, both for his 
 comfort and for his honour, in the midst of his sufferings. When they 
 were cut to the heart, and gnashed upon him with their teeth, ready to 
 eat him up, then he had a view of the glory of Christ sufficient to 
 fill him with joy unspeakable, which was intended not only for his 
 encouragement, but for the support and comfort of all God's suffering 
 servants in all ages.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He, <I>being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into 
 heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>.

 [1.] Thus he looked above the power and fury of his persecutors, and 
 did as it were despise them, and laugh them to scorn, as the daughter 
 of Zion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:22">Isa. xxxvii. 22</A>.

 They had their eyes fixed upon him, full of malice and cruelty; but he 
 looked up to heaven, and never minded them, was so taken up with the 
 eternal life now in prospect that he seemed to have no manner of 
 concern for the natural life now at state. Instead of looking about 
 him, to see either which way he was in danger or which way he might 
 make his escape, he looks up to heaven; thence only comes his help, and 
 thitherward his way is still open; though they compass him about on 
 every side, they cannot interrupt his intercourse with heaven. Note, A 
 believing regard to God and the upper world will be of great use to us, 
 to set us above the fear of man; for as far as we are under the 
 influence of that fear we <I>forget the Lord our Maker,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:13">Isa. li. 13</A>.

 [2.] Thus he directed his sufferings to the glory of God, to the honour
 of Christ, and did as it were appeal to heaven concerning them (Lord, 
 for thy sake I suffer this) and express his earnest expectation that 
 Christ should be magnified in his body. Now that he was ready to be
 offered he looks up stedfastly to heaven, as one willing to offer 
 himself. 

 [3.] Thus he lifted up his soul with his eyes to God in the heavens, in 
 pious ejaculations, calling upon God for wisdom and grace to carry him 
 through this trial in a right manner. God has promised that he will be
 with his servants whom he calls out to suffer for him; but he will for 
 this be sought unto. He is nigh unto them, but it is <I>in that for 
 which they call upon him. Is any afflicted? Let him pray.</I> 

 [4.] Thus he breathed after the heavenly country, to which he saw the 
 fury of his persecutors would presently send him. It is good for dying 
 saints to look up stedfastly to heaven: "Yonder is the place whither 
 death will carry my better part, and then, <I>O death! where is thy 
 sting?</I>" 

 [5.] Thus he made it to appear that he was full of the Holy Ghost; for, 
 wherever the Spirit of grace dwells, and works, and reigns, he directs 
 the eye of the soul upward. Those that are full of the Holy Ghost will
 look up stedfastly to heaven, for there their heart is. 

 [6.] Thus he put himself into a posture to receive the following 
 manifestation of the divine glory and grace. If we expect to hear from 
 heaven, we must look up stedfastly to heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He saw the glory of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>);

 <I>for he saw,</I> in order to this, <I>the heavens opened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>.
 
 Some think his eyes were strengthened, and the sight of them so raised 
 above its natural pitch, by a supernatural power, that he saw into the 
 third heavens, though at so vast a distance, as Moses's sight was 
 enlarged to see the whole land of Canaan. Others think it was a 
 representation of the glory of God set before his eyes, as, before, 
 Isaiah and Ezekiel; heaven did as it were come down to him, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:2">Rev. xxi. 2</A>.

 The heavens were opened, to give him a view of the happiness he was 
 going to, that he might, in prospect of it, go cheerfully through 
 death, so great a death. Would we by faith look up stedfastly, we might 
 see the heavens opened by the mediation of Christ, the veil being rent, 
 and a new and living way laid open for us into the holiest. The heaven 
 is opened for the settling of a correspondence between God and men, 
 that his favours and blessings may come down to us, and our prayers and 
 praises may go up to him. We may also see the glory of God, as far as 
 he has revealed it in his word, and the sight of this will carry us 
 through all the terrors of sufferings and death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He <I>saw Jesus standing on the right hand of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>),
 
 <I>the Son of man,</I> so it is 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>.

 Jesus, being the Son of man, having taken our nature with him to 
 heaven, and being there clothed with a body, might be seen with bodily 
 eyes, and so Stephen saw him. When the Old-Testament prophets saw the
 glory of God it was attended with angels. The Shechinah or divine 
 presence in Isaiah's vision was attended with seraphim, in Ezekiel's 
 vision with cherubim, both signifying the angels, the ministers of 
 God's providence. But here no mention is made of the angels, though 
 they surround the throne and the Lamb; instead of them Stephen sees 
 Jesus at the right hand of God, the great Mediator of God's grace, from 
 whom more glory redounds to God than from all the ministration of the 
 holy angels. The glory of God shines brightest in the face of Jesus 
 Christ; for there shines the glory of his grace, which is the most 
 illustrious instance of his glory. God appears more glorious with Jesus 
 standing at his right hand than with millions of angels about him. Now, 
 
 [1.] Here is a proof of the exaltation of Christ to the Father's right 
 hand; the apostles saw him ascend, but they did not see him sit down, 
 <I>A cloud received him out of their sight.</I> We are told that he sat 
 down on the right hand of God; but was he ever seen there? Yes, Stephen 
 saw him there, and was abundantly satisfied with the sight. He saw 
 Jesus at the right hand of God, denoting both his transcendent dignity 
 and his sovereign dominion, his uncontrollable ability and his 
 universal agency; whatever God's right hand gives to us, or receives 
 from us, or does concerning us, it is by him; for he is his right hand. 
 
 [2.] He is usually said to <I>sit</I> there; but Stephen sees him 
 <I>standing</I> there, as one more than ordinarily concerned at present 
 for his suffering servant; he stood up as a judge to plead his cause 
 against his persecutors; he is <I>raised up out of his holy 
 habitation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:13">Zech. ii. 13</A>),
 
 <I>comes out of his place to punish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:21">Isa. xxvi. 21</A>.

 He stands ready to receive him and crown him, and in the mean time to 
 give him a prospect of the joy set before him. 

 [3.] This was intended for the encouragement of Stephen. He sees Christ 
 is for him, and then no matter who is against him. When our Lord Jesus 
 was in his agony an angel appeared to him, strengthening him; but 
 Stephen had Christ himself appearing to him. Note, Nothing so
 comfortable to dying saints, nor so animating to suffering saints, as 
 to see Jesus at the right hand of God; and, blessed be God, by faith we 
 may see him there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He told those about him what he saw 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>):

 <I>Behold, I see the heavens opened.</I> That which was a cordial to 
 him ought to have been a conviction to them, and a caution to them to 
 take heed of proceeding against one upon whom heaven thus smiled; and 
 therefore what he saw he declared, let them make what use they pleased 
 of it. If some were exasperated by it, others perhaps might be wrought 
 upon to consider this Jesus whom they persecuted, and to believe in 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Stephen's pious addresses to Jesus Christ. The manifestation of 
 God's glory to him did not set him above praying, but rather set him 
 upon it: <I>They stoned Stephen, calling upon God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>.

 Though he called upon God, and by that showed himself to be a true-born 
 Israelite, yet they proceeded to stone him, not considering how 
 dangerous it is to fight against those who have an interest in heaven.
 Though they stoned him, yet he called upon God; nay, therefore he 
 called upon him. Note, It is the comfort of those who are unjustly 
 hated and persecuted by men that they have a God to go to, a God 
 all-sufficient to call upon. Men stop their ears, as they did here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>),

 but God does not. Stephen was now cast out of the city, but he was not 
 cast out from his God. He was now taking his leave of the world, and 
 therefore calls upon God; for we must do this as long as we live.
 Note, It is good to die praying; then we need help--strength we never
 had, to do a work we never did--and how can we fetch in that help and
 strength but by prayer? Two short prayers Stephen offered up to God in 
 his dying moments, and in them as it were breathed out his soul:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is a prayer for himself: <I>Lord Jesus, receive my 
 spirit.</I> Thus Christ had himself resigned his spirit immediately 
 into the hands of the Father. We are here taught to resign ours into 
 the hands of Christ as Mediator, by him to be recommended to the 
 Father. Stephen saw Jesus standing at the Father's right hand, and he 
 thus calls to him: "Blessed Jesus, do that for me now which thou 
 standest there to do for all thine, receive my departing spirit into 
 thy hand." Observe, 

 [1.] The soul is the man, and our great concern, living and dying, must 
 be about our souls. Stephen's body was to be miserably broken and 
 shattered, and overwhelmed with a shower of stones, the earthly house 
 of this tabernacle violently beaten down and abused; but, however it 
 goes with that, "Lord," saith he, "'let my spirit be safe; let it go 
 well with my poor soul." Thus, while we live, our care should be that 
 though the body be starved or stripped the soul may be fed and clothed, 
 though the body lie in pain the soul may dwell at ease; and, when we 
 die, that though the body be thrown by as a despised broken vessel, and 
 a vessel in which there is no pleasure, yet the soul may be presented a 
 vessel of honour, that God may be the strength of the heart and its 
 portion, though the flesh fail. 

 [2.] Our Lord Jesus is God, to whom we are to seek, and in whom we are 
 to confide and comfort ourselves living and dying. Stephen here prays 
 to Christ, and so must we; for it is the will of God that all men 
 should thus <I>honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</I> It 
 is Christ we are to commit ourselves to, who alone is able to keep what 
 we commit to him against that day; it is necessary that we have an eye 
 to Christ when we come to die, for there is no venturing into another 
 world but under his conduct, no living comforts in dying moments but 
 what are fetched from him. 

 [3.] Christ's receiving our spirits at death is the great thing we are 
 to be careful about, and to comfort ourselves with. We ought to be in 
 care about this while we live, that Christ may receive our spirits when 
 we die; for, if he reject and disown them, whither will they betake 
 themselves? How can they escape being a prey to the roaring lion? To 
 him therefore we must commit them daily, to be ruled and sanctified, 
 and made meet for heaven, and then, and not otherwise, he will receive 
 them. And, if this has been our care while we live, it may be our 
 comfort when we come to die, that we shall be received into everlasting 
 habitations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is a prayer for his persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The circumstances of this prayer are observable; for it seems to 
 have been offered up with something more of solemnity than the former. 
 <I>First,</I> He <I>knelt down,</I> which was an expression of his 
 humility in prayer. <I>Secondly,</I> He <I>cried with a loud voice,</I> 
 which was an expression of his importunity. But why should he thus show 
 more humility and importunity in this request than in the former? Why, 
 none could doubt of his being in good earnest in his prayers for 
 himself, and therefore there he needed not to use such outward 
 expressions of it; but in his prayer for his enemies, because that is 
 so much against the grain of corrupt nature, it was requisite he should 
 give proofs of his being in earnest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The prayer itself: <I>Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.</I> 
 Herein he followed the example of his dying Master, who prayed thus for 
 his persecutors, <I>Father, forgive them;</I> and set an example to all 
 following sufferers in the cause of Christ thus to pray for those that 
 persecute them. Prayer may preach. This did so to those who stoned 
 Stephen, and he knelt down that they might take notice he was going to 
 pray, and cried with a loud voice that they might take notice of what 
 he said, and might learn, <I>First,</I> That what they did was a sin, a 
 great sin, which, if divine mercy and grace did not prevent, would be 
 laid to their charge, to their everlasting confusion. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 That, notwithstanding their malice and fury against him, he was in 
 charity with them, and was so far from desiring that God would avenge 
 his death upon them that it was his hearty prayer to God that it might 
 not in any degree be laid to their charge. A sad reckoning there would 
 be for it. If they did not repent, it would certainly be laid to their 
 charge; but he, for his part, did not desire the woeful day. Let them 
 take notice of this, and, when their thoughts were cool, surely they 
 would not easily forgive themselves for putting him to death who could 
 so easily forgive them. <I>The blood-thirsty hate the upright, but the 
 just seek his soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:10">Prov. xxix. 10</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> That, though the sin was very heinous, yet they must 
 not despair of the pardon of it upon their repentance. If they would 
 lay it to their hearts, God would not lay it to their charge. "Do you 
 think," saith St. Austin, "that Paul heard Stephen pray this prayer? It 
 is likely he did and ridiculed it then (<I>audivit subsannans, sed 
 irrisit--he heard with scorn</I>), but afterwards he had the benefit of
 it, and fared the better for it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His expiring with this: <I>When he had said this, he fell 
 asleep;</I> or, as he was saying this, the blow came that was mortal. 
 Note, Death is but a sleep to good people; not the sleep of the soul 
 (Stephen had given that up into Christ's hand), but the sleep of the 
 body; it is its rest from all its griefs and toils; it is perfect ease 
 from toil and pain. Stephen died as much in a hurry as ever any man 
 did, and yet, when he died, he fell asleep. He applied himself to his
 dying work with as much composure of mind as if he had been going to 
 sleep; it was but closing his eyes, and dying. Observe, He fell asleep 
 when he was praying for his persecutors; it is expressed as if he 
 thought he could not die in peace till he had done this. It contributes 
 very much to our dying comfortably to die in charity with all men; we 
 are then found of Christ in peace; let not the sun of life go down upon 
 our wrath. He fell asleep; the vulgar Latin adds, <I>in the Lord,</I> 
 in the embraces of his love. If he thus sleep, he shall do well; he 
 shall awake again in the morning of the resurrection.</P>
