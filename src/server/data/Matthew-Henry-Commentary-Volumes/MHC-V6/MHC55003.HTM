 I. The apostle forewarns Timothy what the last days would be, with the
 reasons thereof, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. Prescribes various remedies against them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:10-17">ver. 10, to the end</A>),

 particularly his own example ("But thou hast fully known my doctrine," 
 &c.) and the knowledge of the holy scriptures, which are able to make
 us wise unto salvation, and will be the best antidote against the 
 corruptions of the times we live in. In this chapter Paul tells Timothy 
 how bad others would be, and therefore how good he should be; and this 
 use we should make of the badness of others, thereby to engage us to 
 hold our own integrity so much the firmer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
 come.
 &nbsp; 2  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous,
 boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful,
 unholy,
 &nbsp; 3  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers,
 incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
 &nbsp; 4  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than
 lovers of God;
 &nbsp; 5  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof:
 from such turn away.
 &nbsp; 6  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead
 captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
 &nbsp; 7  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the
 truth.
 &nbsp; 8  Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also
 resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the
 faith.
 &nbsp; 9  But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be
 manifest unto all <I>men,</I> as theirs also was.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Timothy must not think it strange if there were in the church bad men; 
 for the net of the gospel was to enclose both good fish and bad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:47,48">Matt. xxii. 47, 48</A>.
 
 Jesus Christ had foretold
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:1-51">Matt. xxiv.</A>)

 that there would come seducers, and therefore we must not be offended
 at it, nor think the worse of religion or the church for it. Even in 
 gold ore there will be dross, and a great deal of chaff among the wheat 
 when it lies on the floor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Timothy must know that in the <I>last days</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 in gospel times, there would <I>come perilous times.</I> Though gospel 
 times were times of reformation in many respects, let him know that 
 even in gospel times there would be perilous times; not so much on 
 account of persecution from without as on account of corruptions 
 within. These would be difficult times, wherein it would be difficult 
 for a man to keep a good conscience. He does not say, "Perilous times 
 shall come, for both Jews and Gentiles shall be combined to root out 
 Christianity;" but "perilous times shall come, for such as have <I>the 
 form of godliness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 shall be corrupt and wicked, and do a great deal of damage to the 
 church." Two traitors within the garrison may do more hurt to it than 
 two thousand besiegers without. Perilous times shall come, for men 
 shall be wicked. Note, 

 1. Sin makes the times perilous. When there is a general corruption of
 manners, and of the tempers of men, this makes the times dangerous to
 live in; for it is hard to keep our integrity in the midst of general
 corruption. 

 2. The coming of perilous times is an evidence of the truth of
 scripture-predictions; if the event in this respect did not answer to
 the prophecy, we might be tempted to question the divinity of the
 Bible. 

 3. We are all concerned to know this, to believe and consider it, that
 we may not be surprised when we see the times perilous: <I>This know 
 also.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Paul tells Timothy what would be the occasion of making these times 
 perilous, or what shall be the marks and signs whereby these times may 
 be known, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>,
 
 &c.

 1. Self-love will make the times perilous. Who is there who does not 
 love himself? But this is meant of an irregular sinful self-love. Men 
 love their carnal selves better than their spiritual selves. Men love 
 to gratify their own lusts, and make provision for them, more than to 
 please God and do their duty. Instead of Christian charity, which takes 
 care for the good of others, they will mind themselves only, and prefer 
 their own gratification before the church's edification. 

 2. Covetousness. Observe, Self-love brings in a long train of sins and
 mischiefs. When men are lovers of themselves, no good can be expected 
 from them, as all good may be expected from those who love God with all 
 their hearts. When covetousness generally prevails, when every man is 
 for what he can get and for keeping what he has, this makes men 
 dangerous to one another, and obliges every man to stand on his guard 
 against his neighbour. 

 3. Pride and vain-glory. The times are perilous when men, being proud
 of themselves, are <I>boasters and blasphemers,</I> boasters before men 
 whom they despise and look upon with scorn, and blasphemers of God and 
 of his name. When men do not fear God they will not regard man, and so 
 <I>vice vers&acirc;.</I> 

 4. When children are disobedient to their parents, and break through
 the obligations which they lie under to them both in duty and 
 gratitude, and frequently in interest, having their dependence upon 
 them and their expectation from them, they make the times perilous; for 
 what wickedness will those stick at who will be abusive to their own 
 parents and rebel against them? 

 5. Unthankfulness and unholiness make the times perilous, and these two
 commonly go together. What is the reason that men are unholy and 
 without the fear of God, but that they are unthankful for the mercies 
 of God? Ingratitude and impiety go together; for call a man
 ungrateful, and you can call him by no worse name. Unthankful, and
 impure, defiled with fleshly lusts, which is an instance of great 
 ingratitude to that God who has provided so well for the support of the 
 body; we abuse his gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our 
 lusts. 

 6. The times are perilous when men will not be held by the bonds either
 of nature or common honesty, when they are <I>without natural 
 affection,</I> and <I>truce-breakers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 There is a natural affection due to all. Wherever there is the human 
 nature, there should be humanity towards those of the same nature, but 
 especially between relations. Times are perilous when children are 
 disobedient to their parents 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 and when parents are without natural affection to their children, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 See what a corruption of nature sin is, how it deprives men even of 
 that which nature has implanted in them for the support of their own 
 kind; for the natural affection of parents to their children is that 
 which contributes very much to the keeping up of mankind upon the 
 earth. And those who will not be bound by natural affection, no marvel 
 that they will not be bound by the most solemn leagues and covenants. 
 <I>They are truce-breakers,</I> that make no conscience of the 
 engagements they have laid themselves under. 

 7. The times are perilous when men are <I>false accusers</I> one of
 another, <B><I>diaboloi</I></B>--<I>devils</I> one to another, having 
 no regard to the good name of others, or to the religious obligations 
 of an oath, but thinking themselves at liberty to say and do what they 
 please,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:4">Ps. xii. 4</A>.

 8. When men have no government of themselves and their own appetites:
 not of their own appetites, for they are <I>incontinent;</I> not of 
 their own passions, for they are <I>fierce;</I> when they have no rule 
 over their own spirits, and therefore are like a city that is broken 
 down, and has no walls; they are soon fired, upon the least 
 provocation. 

 9. When that which is good and ought to be honoured is generally
 despised and looked upon with contempt. It is the pride of persecutors 
 that they look with contempt upon good people, though they are more 
 excellent than their neighbours.

 10. When men are generally treacherous, wilful, and haughty, the times
 are perilous

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)--

 when men are <I>traitors, heady, high-minded.</I> Our Saviour has 
 foretold that the brother shall betray the brother to death and the 
 father the child

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:21">Matt. x. 21</A>),

 and those are the worst sort of traitors: those who delivered up their
 Bibles to persecutors were called <I>traditores,</I> for they betrayed 
 the trust committed to them. When men are petulant and puffed up, 
 behaving scornfully to all about them, and when this temper generally 
 prevails, then the times are perilous. 

 11. When men are generally <I>lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
 God.</I> When there are more epicures than true Christians, then the 
 times are bad indeed. God is to be loved above all. That is a carnal 
 mind, and is full of enmity against him, which prefers any thing before 
 him, especially such a sordid thing as carnal pleasure is. 

 12. When, notwithstanding all this, they <I>have the form of
 godliness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 are called by the Christian name, baptized into the Christian faith, 
 and make a show of religion; but, how plausible soever their form of 
 godliness is, they deny the power of it. When they take upon them the 
 form which should and would bring along with it the power thereof, they 
 will put asunder what God hath joined together: they will assume the 
 form of godliness, to take away their reproach; but they will not 
 submit to the power of it, to take away their sin. Observe here, 

 (1.) Men may be very bad and wicked under a profession of religion; 
 they may be lovers of themselves, &c., yet have a form of godliness. 
 
 (2.) A form of godliness is a very different thing from the power of 
 it; men may have the one and be wholly destitute of the other; yea, 
 they deny it, at least practically in their lives. 

 (3.) From such good Christians must withdraw themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here Paul warns Timothy to take heed of certain seducers, not only 
 that he might not be drawn away by them himself, but that he might arm 
 those who were under his charge against their seduction. 

 1. He shows how industrious they were to make proselytes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 they applied themselves to particular persons, visited them in their 
 houses, not daring to appear openly; for those that do evil hate the 
 light,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:20">John iii. 20</A>.

 They were not forced into houses, as good Christians often were by
 persecution; but they of choice crept into houses, to insinuate 
 themselves into the affections and good opinion of people, and so to 
 draw them over to their party. And see what sort of people those were 
 that they gained, and made proselytes of; they were such as were weak, 
 <I>silly women;</I> and such as were wicked, <I>laden with sins, and 
 led away with divers lusts.</I> A foolish head and a filthy heart make 
 persons, especially women, an easy prey to seducers. 

 2. He shows how far they were from coming to the knowledge of the
 truth, though they pretended to be <I>ever learning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 In one sense we must all be ever learning, that is, growing in 
 knowledge, following on to know the Lord, pressing forward; but these 
 were sceptics, giddy and unstable, who were forward to imbibe every new 
 notion, under pretence of advancement in knowledge, but never came to a 
 right understanding of the truth as it is in Jesus.

 3. He foretels the certain stop that should be put to their progress

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>),

 comparing them to the Egyptian magicians who withstood Moses, and who 
 are here named, <I>Jannes and Jambres;</I> though the names are not to 
 be met with in the story of the Old Testament, yet they are found in 
 some old Jewish writers. When Moses came with a divine command to fetch 
 Israel out of Egypt, these magicians opposed him. Thus those heretics 
 <I>resisted the truth</I> and like them were men <I>of corrupt 
 minds,</I> men who had their understandings perverted, biassed and 
 prejudiced against the truth, and <I>reprobate concerning the 
 faith,</I> or very far from being true Christians; <I>but they shall 
 proceed no further,</I> or not much further, as some read it. Observe, 
 
 (1.) Seducers seek for corners, and love obscurity; for they are afraid 
 to appear in public, and therefore creep into houses. Further, They 
 attack those who are the least able to defend themselves, silly and 
 wicked women. 

 (2.) Seducers in all ages are much alike. Their characters are the 
 same--namely, <I>Men of corrupt minds,</I> &c.; their conduct is much 
 the same--they resist the truth, as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses; 
 and they will be alike in their disappointment. 

 (3.) Those who resist the truth are guilty of folly, yea, of egregious 
 folly; for <I>magna est veritas, et pr&aelig;valebit--Great is the 
 truth, and shall prevail.</I> 

 (4.) Though the spirit of error may be let loose for a time, God has it 
 in a chain. Satan can deceive the nations and the churches no further
 and no longer than God will permit him: <I>Their folly shall be 
 manifest,</I> it shall appear that they are imposters, and every man 
 shall abandon them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life,

 <I>them</I> all the Lord delivered me.
 &nbsp; 12  Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall
 suffer persecution.
 &nbsp; 13  But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,
 deceiving, and being deceived.
 &nbsp; 14  But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle, to confirm Timothy in that way wherein he walked,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Sets before him his own example, which Timothy had been an 
 eye-witness of, having long attended Paul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Thou hast fully known my doctrine.</I> The more fully we know the 
 doctrine of Christ and the apostles, the more closely we shall cleave 
 to it; the reason why many sit loose to it is because they do not fully 
 know it. Christ's apostles had no enemies but those who did not know 
 them, or not know them fully; those who knew them best loved and 
 honoured them the most. Now what is it that Timothy had so fully known
 in Paul? 

 1. The doctrine that he preached. Paul kept back nothing from his
 hearers, but declared to them the whole counsel of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:27">Acts xx. 27</A>),

 so that if it were not their own fault they might fully know it. 
 Timothy had a great advantage in being trained up under such a tutor, 
 and being apprised of the doctrine he preached. 

 2. He had fully known his conversation: <I>Thou hast fully know my
 doctrine, and manner of life;</I> his manner of life was of a piece 
 with his doctrine, and did not contradict it. He did not pull down by 
 his living what he built up by his preaching. Those ministers are 
 likely to do good, and leave lasting fruits of their labours, whose 
 manner of life agrees with their doctrine; as, on the contrary, those 
 cannot expect to profit the people at all that preach well and live 
 ill. 

 3. Timothy fully knew what was the great thing that Paul had in view,
 both in his preaching and in his conversation: "Thou hast known <I>my 
 purpose,</I> what I drive at, how far it is from any worldly, carnal, 
 secular design, and how sincerely I aim at the glory of God and the 
 good of the souls of men." 

 4. Timothy fully knew Paul's good character, which he might gather from
 his doctrine, manner of life, and purpose; for he gave proofs of his 
 <I>faith</I> (that is, of his integrity and fidelity, or his faith in 
 Christ, his faith concerning another world, by which Paul lived), his 
 <I>long-suffering</I> towards the churches to which he preached and 
 over which he presided, his <I>charity</I> towards all men, and his 
 <I>patience.</I> These were graces that Paul was eminent for, and 
 Timothy knew it. 
 
 5. He knew that he had suffered ill for doing well

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "Thou hast fully known the <I>persecutions and afflictions that came 
 unto me</I>" (he mentions those only which happened to him while 
 Timothy was with him, <I>at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra</I>); "and 
 therefore let it be no surprise to thee if thou suffer hard things, it 
 is no more than I have endured before." 

 6. He knew what care God had taken of him: <I>Notwithstanding out of
 them all the Lord delivered me;</I> as he never failed his cause, so 
 his God never failed him. Thou hast fully known my <I>afflictions.</I> 
 When we know the afflictions of good people but in part, they are a 
 temptation to us to decline that cause which they suffer for; when we 
 know only the hardships they undergo for Christ, we may be ready to 
 say, "We will renounce that cause that is likely to cost us so dear in 
 the owning of it;" but when we <I>fully</I> know the afflictions, not 
 only how they suffer, but how they are supported and comforted under 
 their sufferings, then, instead of being discouraged, we shall be 
 animated by them, especially considering that we are told before that 
 we must count upon such things

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer 
 persecution:</I> not always alike; at that time those who professed the 
 faith of Christ were more exposed to persecution than at other times; 
 but at all times, more or less, those who will live godly in Christ 
 Jesus shall suffer persecution. They must expect to be despised, and 
 that their religion will stand in the way of their preferment; those 
 who will live godly must expect it, especially those who will live 
 godly <I>in Christ Jesus,</I> that is, according to the strict rules of 
 the Christian religion, those who will wear the livery and bear the 
 name of the crucified Redeemer. All who will show their religion in 
 their conversation, who will not only be godly, but live godly, let 
 them expect persecution, especially when they are resolute in it.
 Observe, 

 (1.) The apostle's life was very exemplary for three things: for his 
 <I>doctrine,</I> which was according to the will of God; for his 
 <I>life,</I> which was agreeable to his doctrine; and for his 
 <I>persecutions and sufferings.</I> 

 (2.) Though his life was a life of great usefulness, yet it was a life 
 of great sufferings; and none, I believe, came nearer to their great 
 Master for eminent services and great sufferings than Paul: he suffered 
 almost in every place; the Holy Ghost witnessed that bonds and
 afflictions did abide him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:23">Acts xx. 23</A>.

 Here he mentions his persecutions and afflictions at <I>Antioch,</I> at 
 <I>Iconium,</I> at <I>Lystra,</I> besides what he suffered elsewhere.

 (3.) The apostle mentions the Lord's delivering him out of them all,
 for Timothy's and our encouragement under sufferings. 

 (4.) We have the practice and treatment of true Christians: they live 
 godly in Jesus Christ--this is their practice; and they shall suffer 
 persecution--this is the usage they must expect in this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He warns Timothy of the fatal end of seducers, as a reason why he 
 should stick closely to the truth as it is in Jesus: <I>But evil men 
 and seducers shall wax worse and worse,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Observe, As good men, by the grace of God, grow better and better, so
 bad men, through the subtlety of Satan and the power of their own 
 corruptions, grow worse and worse. The way of sin is down-hill; for 
 such proceed from bad to worse, <I>deceiving and being deceived.</I> 
 Those who deceive others do but deceive themselves; those who draw 
 others into error run themselves into more and more mistakes, and they 
 will find it so at last, to their cost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He directs him to keep close to a good education, and particularly 
 to what he had learned out of the holy scriptures 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>):
 
 <I>Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned.</I> Note, It is 
 not enough to learn that which is good, but we must continue in it, and 
 persevere in it unto the end. Then are we Christ's disciples indeed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:31">John viii. 31</A>.

 We should not be any more <I>children, tossed to and fro, and carried 
 about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men and cunning 
 craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:14">Eph. iv. 14</A>.
 
 <I>Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines; for it is a
 good thing that the heart be established with grace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:9">Heb. xiii. 9</A>.

 And for this reason we should continue in the things we have learned
 from the holy scriptures; not that we ought to continue in any errors 
 and mistakes which we may have been led into, in the time of our 
 childhood and youth (for these, upon an impartial enquiry and full 
 conviction, we should forsake); but this makes nothing against our 
 continuing in those things which the holy scriptures plainly assert, 
 and which he that runs may read. If Timothy would adhere to the truth 
 as he had been taught it, this would arm him against the snares and 
 insinuations of seducers. Observe, Timothy must <I>continue in the
 things which he had learned and had been assured of.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is a great happiness to know the certainty of the things wherein 
 we have been instructed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:4">Luke i. 4</A>);

 not only to know what the truths are, but to know that they are of
 undoubted certainty. What we have learned we must labour to be more and 
 more assured of, that, being grounded in the truth, we may be guarded 
 against error, for certainty in religion is of great importance and 
 advantage: <I>Knowing,</I> 

 (1.) "That thou hast had good teachers. Consider of <I>whom thou hast
 learned them;</I> not of evil men and seducers, but good men, who had 
 themselves experienced the power of the truths they taught thee, and 
 been ready to suffer for them, and thereby would give the fullest 
 evidence of their belief of these truths." 

 (2.) "Knowing especially the firm foundation upon which thou hast 
 built, namely, that of the scripture 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>That from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Those who would acquaint themselves with the things of God, and be 
 assured of them, must know the holy scriptures, for these are the 
 summary of divine revelation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is a great happiness to know the holy scriptures from our 
 childhood; and children should betimes get the knowledge of the 
 scriptures. The age of children is the learning age; and those who 
 would get true learning must get it out of the scriptures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The scriptures we are to know are the holy scriptures; they come 
 from the holy God, were delivered by holy men, contain holy precepts, 
 treat of holy things, and were designed to make us holy and to lead us 
 in the way of holiness to happiness; being called the <I>holy 
 scriptures,</I> they are by this distinguished from profane writings of 
 all sorts, and from those that only treat morality, and common justice 
 and honesty, but do not meddle with holiness. If we would know the holy 
 scriptures, we must read and search them daily, as the noble Bereans 
 did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:11">Acts xvii. 11</A>.

 They must not lie by us neglected, and seldom or never looked into. Now 
 here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What is the excellency of the scripture. It is <I>given by 
 inspiration of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and therefore is his word. It is a divine revelation, which we may 
 depend upon as infallibly true. The same Spirit that breathed reason 
 into us breathes revelation among us: <I>For the prophecy came not in 
 old time by the will of man, but holy men spoke as they were moved or 
 carried forth by the Holy Ghost,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:21">2 Pet. i. 21</A>.

 The prophets and apostles did not speak from themselves, but what they
 received of the Lord that they delivered unto us. That the scripture
 was given by inspiration of God appears from the majesty of its
 style,--from the truth, purity, and sublimity, of the doctrines
 contained in it,--from the harmony of its several parts,--from its
 power and efficacy on the minds of multitudes that converse with
 it,--from the accomplishment of many prophecies relating to things
 beyond all human foresight,--and from the uncontrollable miracles that
 were wrought in proof of its divine original: <I>God also bearing them
 witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles and
 gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:4">Heb. ii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What use it will be of to us. 

 [1.] <I>It is able to make us wise to salvation;</I> that is, it is a 
 sure guide in our way to eternal life. Note, Those are wise indeed who 
 are wise to salvation. The scriptures are able to make us truly wise, 
 wise for our souls and another world. "To make thee wise to salvation 
 <I>through faith.</I>" Observe, The scriptures will make us wise to 
 salvation, if they be mixed with faith, and not otherwise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:2">Heb. iv. 2</A>.

 For, if we do not believe their truth and goodness, they will do us no 
 good.

 [2.] It is <I>profitable</I> to us for all the purposes of the
 Christian life, <I>for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for 
 instruction in righteousness.</I> It answers all the ends of divine 
 revelation. It instructs us in that which is true, reproves us for that 
 which is amiss, directs us in that which is good. It is of use to all, 
 for we all need to be instructed, corrected, and reproved: it is of 
 special use to ministers, who are to give instruction, correction, and 
 reproof; and whence can they fetch it better than from the scripture?

 [3.] <I>That the man of God may be perfect,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The Christian, the minister, is the man of God. That which finishes a 
 man of God in this world is the scripture. By it we are <I>thoroughly 
 furnished for every good work.</I> There is that in the scripture which 
 suits every case. Whatever duty we have to do, whatever service is
 required from us, we may find enough in the scriptures to furnish us 
 for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) On the whole we here see, 

 [1.] That the scripture has various uses, and answers divers ends and 
 purposes: <I>It is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for 
 correction</I> of all errors in judgment and practice, and <I>for 
 instruction in righteousness.</I>

 [2.] The scripture is a perfect rule of faith and practice, and was 
 designed for the man of God, the minister as well as the Christian who 
 is devoted to God, for it is <I>profitable for doctrine,</I> &c.

 [3.] If we consult the scripture, which was given by inspiration of
 God, and follow its directions, we shall be made men of God, 
 <I>perfect, and thoroughly furnished to every good work.</I> 

 [4.] There is no occasion for the writings of the philosopher, nor for 
 rabbinical fables, nor popish legends, nor unwritten traditions, to 
 make us perfect men of God, since the scripture answers all these ends 
 and purposes. O that we may love our Bibles more, and keep closer to 
 them than ever! and then shall we find the benefit and advantage 
 designed thereby, and shall at last attain the happiness therein 
 promised and assured to us.</P>
