 I. The apostle expresses concern for the Colossians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. He repeats it again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:5">ver. 5</A>.

 III. He cautions them against false teachers among the Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:4,6,7">ver. 4, 6, 7</A>),

 and against the Gentile philosophy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:8-12">ver. 8-12</A>.

 IV. He represents the privileges of Christians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.
 
 And, 

 V. Concludes with a caution against the judaizing teachers, and those
 who would introduce the worship of angels,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you,
 and <I>for</I> them at Laodicea, and <I>for</I> as many as have not seen my
 face in the flesh;
 &nbsp; 2  That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in
 love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding,
 to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father,
 and of Christ;
 &nbsp; 3  In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here the great concern which Paul had for these 
 Colossians and the other churches which he had not any personal 
 knowledge of. The apostle had never been at Colosse, and the church 
 planted there was not of his planting; and yet he had as tender a care 
 of it as if it had been the only people of his charge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and 
 for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the 
 flesh.</I> Observe,

 1. Paul's care of the church was such as amounted to a conflict. He was
 in a sort of agony, and had a constant fear respecting what would 
 become of them. Herein he was a follower of his Master, who was in an 
 agony for us, and was <I>heard in that he feared.</I> 

 (2.) We may keep up a communion by faith, hope, and holy love, even 
 with those churches and fellow-christians of whom we have no personal 
 knowledge, and with whom we have no conversation. We can think, and 
 pray, and be concerned for one another, at the greatest distance; and 
 those we never saw in the flesh we may hope to meet in heaven.
 But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What was it that the apostle desired for them? <I>That their hearts 
 may be comforted, being knit together in love,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It was their spiritual welfare about which he was solicitous. He does 
 not say that they may be healthy, and merry, and rich, and great, and 
 prosperous; but that their <I>hearts may be comforted.</I> Note, The 
 prosperity of the soul is the best prosperity, and what we should be 
 most solicitous about for ourselves and others. We have here a 
 description of soul-prosperity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When our knowledge grows to an understanding of the mystery of God, 
 and of the Father, and of Christ,--when we come to have a more clear,
 distinct, methodical knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus, then the 
 soul prospers: <I>To understand the mystery,</I> either what was before 
 concealed, but is now made known concerning the Father and Christ, or 
 the mystery before mentioned, of calling the Gentiles into the 
 Christian church, as the Father and Christ have revealed it in the 
 gospel; and not barely to speak of it by rote, or as we have been 
 taught it by our catechisms, but to be led into it, and enter into the 
 meaning and design of it. This is what we should labour after, and then 
 the soul prospers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When our faith grows to a full assurance and bold acknowledgment of 
 this mystery. 

 (1.) To a full assurance, or a well-settled judgment, upon their proper 
 evidence, of the great truths of the gospel, without doubting, or 
 calling them in question, but embracing them with the highest 
 satisfaction, as faithful sayings and worthy of all acceptation. 

 (2.) When it comes to a free acknowledgment, and we not only believe 
 with the heart, but are ready, when called to it, to make confession 
 with our mouth, and are not ashamed of our Master and our holy 
 religion, under the frowns and violence of their enemies. This is 
 called the <I>riches of the full assurance of understanding.</I> Great 
 knowledge and strong faith make a soul rich. This is being rich towards 
 God, and rich in faith, and having the true riches,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:21,16:11,Jam+2:5">Luke xii. 21; xvi. 11; Jam. ii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It consists in the abundance of comfort in our souls: <I>That their 
 hearts might be comforted.</I> The soul prospers when it is filled with 
 joy and peace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:13">Rom. xv. 13</A>),

 and has a satisfaction within which all the troubles without cannot 
 disturb, and is able to joy in the Lord when all other comforts fail,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:17,18">Hab. iii. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The more intimate communion we have with our fellow-christians the 
 more the soul prospers: <I>Being knit together in love.</I> Holy love 
 knits the hearts of Christians one to another; and faith and love both 
 contribute to our comfort. The stronger our faith is, and the warmer 
 our love, the greater will our comfort be. Having occasion to mention 
 Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 according to his usual way, he makes this remark to his honour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>In whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</I> He 
 had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:19"><I>ch.</I> i. 19</A>)

 <I>that all fulness dwells in him:</I> here he mentions particularly
 the <I>treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</I> There is a fulness of 
 wisdom in him, as he has perfectly revealed the will of God to mankind. 
 Observe, The treasures of wisdom are hidden not from us, but for us, in 
 Christ. Those who would be wise and knowing must make application to 
 Christ. We must spend upon the stock which is laid up for us in him, 
 and draw from the treasures which are hidden in him. He is the wisdom 
 of God, and is <I>of God made unto us wisdom,</I> &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:24,30">1 Cor. i. 24, 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His concern for them is repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Though I am absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, 
 joying, and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in 
 Christ.</I> Observe,

 1. We may be present in spirit with those churches and Christians from
 whom we are absent in body; for the communion of saints is a spiritual 
 thing. Paul had heard concerning the Colossians that they were orderly 
 and regular; and though he had never seen them, nor was present with 
 them, he tells them he could easily think himself among them, and look 
 with pleasure upon their good behaviour. 

 2. The order and stedfastness of Christians are matter of joy to 
 ministers; they joy when they behold their order, their regular 
 behaviour and stedfast adherence to the Christian doctrine. 

 3. The more stedfast our faith in Christ is, the better order there
 will be in our whole conversation; for we live and walk by faith,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing
 words.
 &nbsp; 5  For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the
 spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of
 your faith in Christ.
 &nbsp; 6  As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, <I>so</I>
 walk ye in him:
 &nbsp; 7  Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as
 ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
 &nbsp; 8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain
 deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the
 world, and not after Christ.
 &nbsp; 9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
 &nbsp; 10  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all
 principality and power:
 &nbsp; 11  In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made
 without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh
 by the circumcision of Christ:
 &nbsp; 12  Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with
 <I>him</I> through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised
 him from the dead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle cautions the Colossians against deceivers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>And this I say lest any man beguile you with enticing words;</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>,

 <I>Lest any man spoil you.</I> He insists so much upon the perfection 
 of Christ and the gospel revelation, to preserve them from the 
 ensnaring insinuations of those who would corrupt their principles.
 Note,

 1. The way in which Satan spoils souls is by beguiling them. He
 deceives them, and by this means slays them. He is the <I>old serpent 
 who beguiled Eve through his subtlety,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:3">2 Cor. xi. 3</A>.

 He could not ruin us if he did not cheat us; and he could not cheat us
 but by our own fault and folly. 

 2. Satan's agents, who aim to spoil them, beguile them with enticing 
 words. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the 
 flattery of those who lie in wait to deceive, and by the false 
 disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices. 
 <I>By good words, and fair speeches, they deceive the hearts of the 
 simple,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:18">Rom. xvi. 18</A>.

 "You ought to stand upon your guard against enticing words, and be
 aware and afraid of those who would entice you to any evil; for that 
 which they aim at is to spoil you." <I>If sinners entice thee, consent 
 thou not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:10">Prov. i. 10</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A sovereign antidote against seducers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>):

 <I>As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in 
 him, rooted and built up,</I> &c. Here note,

 1. All Christians have, in profession at least, <I>received Jesus
 Christ the Lord,</I> received him as Christ, the great prophet of the 
 church, anointed by God to reveal his will; as Jesus the great high 
 priest, and Saviour from sin and wrath, by the expiatory sacrifice of 
 himself; and as Lord, or sovereign and king, whom we are to obey and be 
 subject to.--<I>Received him,</I> consented to him, taken him for ours
 in every relation and every capacity, and for all the purposes and uses 
 of them. 

 2. The great concern of those who have received Christ is <I>to walk in 
 him</I>--to make their practices conformable to their principles and
 their conversation agreeable to their engagements. As we have received 
 Christ, or consented to be his, so we must walk with him in our daily 
 course and keep up our communion with him. 

 3. The more closely we walk with Christ the more we are <I>rooted and
 established in the faith.</I> A good conversation is the best 
 establishment of a good faith. If we walk in him, we shall be rooted in 
 him; and the more firmly we are rooted in him the more closely we shall 
 walk in him: <I>Rooted and built up.</I> Observe, We cannot be built up 
 in Christ, unless we be first rooted in him. We must be united to him 
 by a lively faith, and heartily consent to his covenant, and then we 
 shall <I>grow up in him in all things.</I>--<I>As you have been
 taught</I>--"according to the rule of the Christian doctrine, in which
 you have been instructed." Observe, A good education has a good 
 influence upon our establishment. We must be <I>established in the
 faith, as we have been taught, abounding therein.</I> Observe, Being 
 established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it 
 more and more; and this with thanksgiving. The way to have the benefit 
 and comfort of God's grace is to be much in giving thanks for it. We 
 must join thanksgiving to all our improvements, and be sensible of the 
 mercy of all our privileges and attainments. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The fair warning given us of our danger: <I>Beware lest any man 
 spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of 
 men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 There is a philosophy which is a noble exercise of our reasonable 
 faculties, and highly serviceable to religion, such a study of the 
 works of God as leads us to the knowledge of God and confirms our faith 
 in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful, which is 
 prejudicial to religion, and sets up the wisdom of man in competition 
 with the wisdom of God, and while it pleases men's fancies ruins their 
 faith; as nice and curious speculations about things above us, or of no 
 use and concern to us; or a care of words and terms of art, which have 
 only an empty and often a cheating appearance of knowledge. <I>After 
 the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world:</I> this 
 plainly reflects upon the Jewish pedagogy or economy, as well as the 
 Pagan learning. The Jews governed themselves by the traditions of their 
 elders and the rudiments or elements of the world, the rites and 
 observances which were only preparatory and introductory to the gospel 
 state; the Gentiles mixed their maxims of philosophy with their 
 Christian principles; and both alienated their minds from Christ. Those 
 who pin their faith on other men's sleeves, and walk in the way of the 
 world, have turned away from following after Christ. The deceivers were 
 especially the Jewish teachers, who endeavoured to keep up the law of 
 Moses in conjunction with the gospel of Christ, but really in 
 competition with it and contradiction to it. Now here the apostle 
 shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That we have in Christ the substance of all the shadows of the 
 ceremonial law; for example, 

 (1.) Had they then the Shechinah, or special presence of God, called 
 the glory, from the visible token of it? So have we now in Jesus Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</I> Under 
 the law, the presence of God dwelt between the cherubim, in a cloud 
 which covered the mercy-seat; but now it dwells in the person of our 
 Redeemer, who partakes of our nature, and is bone of our bone and flesh 
 of our flesh, and has more clearly declared the Father to us. It dwells 
 in him bodily; not as the body is opposed to the spirit, but as the 
 body is opposed to the shadow. The fulness of the Godhead dwells in the 
 Christ really, and not figuratively; for he is both God and man. 

 (2.) Had they circumcision, which was the seal of the covenant? In 
 Christ we are <I>circumcised with the circumcision made without 
 hands</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 by the work of regeneration in us, which is the spiritual or Christian 
 circumcision. <I>He is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is 
 that of the heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:29">Rom. ii. 29</A>.

 This is owing to Christ, and belongs to the Christian dispensation.
 <I>It is made without hands;</I> not by the power of any creature, but
 by the power of the blessed Spirit of God. We are <I>born of the
 Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:5">John iii. 5</A>.

 And it is <I>the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
 Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:5">Tit. iii. 5</A>.

 It consists <I>in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh,</I> in
 renouncing sin and reforming our lives, not in mere external rites. It 
 is not the <I>putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of 
 a good conscience towards God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:21">1 Pet. iii. 21</A>.

 And it is not enough to put away some one particular sin, but we must 
 put off the whole body of sin. The <I>old man must be crucified, and 
 the body of sin destroyed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:6">Rom. vi. 6</A>.

 Christ was circumcised, and, by virtue of our union to him, we partake 
 of that effectual grace which puts off the <I>body of the sins of the 
 flesh.</I> Again, The Jews thought themselves complete in the 
 ceremonial law; but we are <I>complete in Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 That was imperfect and defective; <I>if the first covenant had been 
 faultless, there would no place have been sought for the second</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:7">Heb. viii. 7</A>),
 
 and the <I>law was but a shadow of good things, and could never, by 
 those sacrifices, make the comers thereunto perfect,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1">Heb. x. 1</A>.

 But all the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by the
 complete sacrifice for sin and revelation of the will of God. <I>Which 
 is the head of all principality and power.</I> As the Old-Testament 
 priesthood had its perfection in Christ, so likewise had the kingdom of 
 David, which was the eminent principality and power under the Old 
 Testament, and which the Jews valued themselves so much upon. And he is 
 the Lord and head of all the powers in heaven and earth, of angels and 
 men. <I>Angels, and authorities, and powers are subject to him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:22">1 Pet. iii. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We have communion with Christ in his whole undertaking 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 <I>Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you have risen with 
 him.</I> We are both buried and rise with him, and both are signified 
 by our baptism; not that there is anything in the sign or ceremony of 
 baptism which represents this burying and rising, any more than the 
 crucifixion of Christ is represented by any visible resemblance in the 
 Lord's supper: and he is speaking of the <I>circumcision made without 
 hands;</I> and says it is <I>through the faith of the operation of 
 God.</I> But the thing signified by our baptism is that we are buried 
 with Christ, as baptism is the seal of the covenant and an obligation 
 to our dying to sin; and that we are raised with Christ, as it is a 
 seal and obligation to our living to righteousness, or newness of life. 
 God in baptism engages to be to us a God, and we become engaged to be 
 his people, and by his grace to die to sin and to live to 
 righteousness, or put off the old man and put on the new.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of
 your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven
 you all trespasses;
 &nbsp; 14  Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against
 us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing
 it to his cross;
 &nbsp; 15  <I>And</I> having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a
 show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here represents the privileges we Christians have above the 
 Jews, which are very great.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's death is our life: <I>And you, being dead in your sins and 
 the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 A state of sin is a state of spiritual death. Those who are in sin are 
 dead in sin. As the death of the body consists in its separation from 
 the soul, so the death of the soul consists in its separation from God 
 and the divine favour. As the death of the body is the corruption and 
 putrefaction of it, so sin is the corruption or depravation of the 
 soul. As a man who is dead is unable to help himself by any power of
 his own, so an habitual sinner is morally impotent: though he has a 
 natural power, or the power of a reasonable creature, he has not a 
 spiritual power, till he has the divine life or a renewed nature. It is 
 principally to be understood of the Gentile world, who <I>lay in 
 wickedness.</I> They were <I>dead in the uncircumcision of their 
 flesh,</I> being <I>aliens to the covenant of promise, and without God 
 in the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:11,12">Eph. ii. 11, 12</A>.

 By reason of their uncircumcision they were dead in their sins. It may
 be understood of the spiritual uncircumcision or corruption of nature;
 and so it shows that we are dead in law, and dead in state. Dead in
 law, as a condemned malefactor is called a dead man because he is under
 a sentence of death; so sinners by the guilt of sin are under the
 sentence of the law and <I>condemned already,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:18">John iii. 18</A>.

 And dead in state, by reason of the <I>uncircumcision of our flesh.</I> 
 An unsanctified heart is called an <I>uncircumcised heart:</I> this is 
 our state. Now through Christ we, who were dead in sins, are quickened; 
 that is, effectual provision is made for taking away the guilt of sin, 
 and breaking the power and dominion of it. <I>Quickened together with 
 him</I>--by virtue of our union to him, and in conformity to him.
 Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the 
 quickening of our souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Through him we have the remission of sin: <I>Having forgiven you 
 all trespasses.</I> This is our quickening. The pardon of the crime is 
 the life of the criminal: and this is owing to the resurrection of
 Christ, as well as his death; for, as he <I>died for our sins,</I> so
 he <I>rose again for our justification,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:25">Rom. iv. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Whatever was in force against us is taken out of the way. He has 
 obtained for us a legal discharge from the <I>hand-writing of 
 ordinances, which was against us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 
 which may be understood,

 1. Of that obligation to punishment in which consists the guilt of sin. 
 The curse of the law is the hand-writing against us, like the 
 hand-writing on Belshazzar's wall. <I>Cursed is every one who continues 
 not in every thing.</I> This was a hand-writing which was <I>against 
 us, and contrary to us;</I> for it threatened our eternal ruin. This 
 was removed when he <I>redeemed us from the curse of the law, being 
 made a curse for us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:13">Gal. iii. 13</A>.

 He cancelled the obligation for all who repent and believe. "Upon me be 
 the curse, my father." He vacated and disannulled the judgment which 
 was against us. When he was nailed to the cross, the curse was as it 
 were nailed to the cross. And our indwelling corruption is crucified 
 with Christ, and by virtue of his cross. When we remember the dying of 
 the Lord Jesus, and see him nailed to the cross, we should see the 
 hand-writing against us taken out of the way. Or rather, 

 2. It must be understood of the ceremonial law, the <I>hand-writing of 
 ordinances,</I> the ceremonial institutions or <I>the law of 
 commandments contained in ordinances</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:15">Eph. ii. 15</A>),

 which was a yoke to the Jews and a partition-wall to the Gentiles. The 
 Lord Jesus <I>took it out of the way, nailed it to his cross;</I> that 
 is, disannulled the obligation of it, that all might see and be 
 satisfied that it was no more binding. When the substance came, the 
 shadows fled away. It is abolished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13">2 Cor. iii. 13</A>),

 and <I>that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:13">Heb. viii. 13</A>.

 The expressions are in allusion to the ancient methods of cancelling a 
 bond, either by crossing the writing or striking it through with a 
 nail.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He has obtained a glorious victory for us over the powers of 
 darkness: <I>And, having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a 
 show of them openly, triumphing over them in it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 As the curse of the law was against us, so the power of Satan was 
 against us. He treated with God as the Judge, and redeemed us out of
 the hands of his justice by a price; but out of the hands of Satan the 
 executioner he redeemed us by power and with a high hand. <I>He led 
 captivity captive.</I> The devil and all the powers of hell were 
 conquered and disarmed by the dying Redeemer. The first promise pointed 
 at this; the bruising of the heel of Christ in his sufferings was the 
 breaking of the serpent's head,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>.

 The expressions are lofty and magnificent: let us turn aside and see 
 this great sight. The Redeemer conquered by dying. See his crown of 
 thorns turned into a crown of laurels. He <I>spoiled them,</I> broke 
 the devil's power, and conquered and disabled him, and <I>made a show 
 of them openly</I>--exposed them to public shame, and made a show of
 them to angels and men. Never had the devil's kingdom such a mortal 
 blow given to it as was given by the Lord Jesus. He tied them to his 
 chariot-wheels, and rode forth conquering and to conquer--alluding to
 the custom of a general's triumph, who returned 
 victorious.--<I>Triumphing over them in it;</I> that is, either in his
 cross and by his death; or, as some read it, in himself, by his own 
 power; for he <I>trod the wine-press alone, and of the people there was 
 none with him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle concludes the chapter with exhortations to proper duty, 
 which he infers from the foregoing discourse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a caution to take heed of judaizing teachers, or those who
 would impose upon Christians the yoke of the ceremonial law: <I>Let no
 man therefore judge you in meat nor drink,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Much of the ceremonies of the law of Moses consisted in the distinction
 of meats and days. It appears by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:1-23">Rom. xiv.</A>

 that there were those who were for keeping up those distinctions: but
 here the apostle shows that since Christ has come, and has cancelled 
 the ceremonial law, we ought not to keep it up. "Let no man impose 
 those things upon you, for God has not imposed them: if God has made 
 you free, be not you again <I>entangled in that yoke of bondage.</I>" 
 And this the rather because these things <I>were shadows of things to 
 come</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 intimating that they had no intrinsic worth in them and that they are 
 now done away. <I>But the body is of Christ:</I> the body, of which 
 they were shadows, has come; and to continue the ceremonial 
 observances, which were only types and shadows of Christ and the 
 gospel, carries an intimation that Christ has not yet come and the 
 gospel state has not yet commenced. Observe the advantages we have 
 under the gospel, above what they had under the law: they had the 
 shadows, we have the substance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He cautions them to take heed of those who would introduce the 
 worship of angels as mediators between God and them, as the Gentile 
 philosophers did: <I>Let no man beguile you of your reward, in a 
 voluntary humility and worshipping of angels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It looked like a piece of modesty to make use of the mediation of 
 angels, as conscious to ourselves of our unworthiness to speak 
 immediately to God; but, though it has a show of humility, it is a 
 voluntary, not a commanded humility; and therefore it is not 
 acceptable, yea, it is not warrantable: it is taking that honour which 
 is due to Christ only and giving it to a creature. Besides, the notions 
 upon which this practice was grounded were merely the inventions of men 
 and not by divine revelation,--the proud conceits of human reason, 
 which make a man presume to dive into things, and determine them, 
 without sufficient knowledge and warrant: <I>Intruding into those 
 things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly 
 mind</I>--pretending to describe the order of angels, and their 
 respective ministries, which God has hidden from us; and therefore, 
 though there was a show of humility in the practice, there was a real 
 pride in the principle. They advanced those notions to gratify their 
 own carnal fancy, and were fond of being thought wiser than other 
 people. Pride is at the bottom of a great many errors and corruptions, 
 and even of many evil practices, which have great show and appearance 
 of humility. Those who do so do <I>not hold the head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They do in effect disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between God 
 and man. It is the highest disparagement to Christ, who is the head of 
 the church, for any of the members of it to make use of any 
 intercessors with God but him. When men let go their hold of Christ, 
 they catch at that which is next them and will stand them in no 
 stead.--<I>From which all the body, by joints and bands, having 
 nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase 
 of God.</I> Observe,

 1. Jesus Christ is not only a head of government over the church, but a 
 head of vital influence to it. They are knit to him by joints and 
 bands, as the several members of the body are united to the head, and 
 receive life and nourishment from him. 

 2. The body of Christ is a growing body: <I>it increaseth with the
 increase of God.</I> The new man is increasing, and the nature of grace 
 is to grow, where there is not an accidental hindrance.--<I>With the
 increase of God,</I> with an increase of grace which is from God as its 
 author; or, in a usual Hebraism, with a large and abundant 
 increase.--<I>That you may be filled with all the fulness of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:19">Eph. iii. 19</A>.

 See a parallel expression, <I>Which is the head, even Christ, from whom
 the whole body, fitly joined together, maketh increase of the body,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:15,16">Eph. iv. 15, 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He takes occasion hence to warn them again: "<I>Wherefore, if you 
 be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though 
 living in the world, are you subject to ordinances?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 If as Christians you are dead to the observances of the ceremonial law, 
 why are you subject to them? Such observances as, <I>Touch not, taste 
 not, handle not,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 Under the law there was a ceremonial pollution contracted by touching a 
 dead body, or any thing offered to an idol; or by tasting any forbidden 
 meats, &c., <I>which all are to perish with the using,</I> having no 
 intrinsic worth in themselves to support them, and those who used them 
 saw them perishing and passing away; or, which tend to corrupt the 
 Christian faith, having no other authority than the traditions and 
 injunctions of men.--<I>Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in 
 will-worship and humility.</I> They thought themselves wiser than their 
 neighbours, in observing the law of Moses together with the gospel of 
 Christ, that they might be sure in the one, at least, to be in the 
 right; but, alas! it was but a show of wisdom, a mere invention and 
 pretence. So they seem to neglect the body, by abstaining from such and 
 such meats, and mortifying their bodily pleasures and appetites; but 
 there is nothing of true devotion in these things, for the gospel 
 teaches us to worship God in spirit and truth and not by ritual 
 observances, and through the mediation of Christ alone and not of any 
 angels. Observe,

 1. Christians are freed by Christ from the ritual observances of
 Moses's law, and delivered from that yoke of bondage which God himself
 had laid upon them. 

 2. Subjection to ordinances, or human appointments in the worship of
 God, is highly blamable, and contrary to the freedom and liberty of the
 gospel. The apostle requires Christians <I>to stand fast in the liberty
 with which Christ hath made them free, and not to be entangled again
 with the yoke of bondage,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:1">Gal. v. 1</A>.

 And the imposition of them is invading the authority of Christ, the
 head of the church, and <I>introducing another law of commandments
 contained in ordinances,</I> when Christ has abolished the old one,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:15">Eph. ii. 15</A>.

 3. Such things have only a show of wisdom, but are really folly. It is
 true wisdom to keep close to the appointments of the gospel, and an 
 entire subjection to Christ, the only head of the church.</P>
