 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle John, having in the foregoing chapter written the things 
 which he had seen, now proceeds to write the things that are, according 
 to the command of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:19"><I>ch.</I> i. 19</A>),

 that is, the present state of the seven churches of Asia, with which he
 had a particular acquaintance, and for which he had a tender concern. He 
 was directed to write to every one of them according to their present 
 state and circumstances, and to inscribe every letter to the angel of 
 that church, to the minister or rather ministry of that church, called 
 angels because they are the messengers of God to mankind. In this 
 chapter we have, 

 I. The message sent to Ephesus,

 II. To Smyrna,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things
 saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who
 walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;
 &nbsp; 2  I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how
 thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them
 which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them
 liars:
 &nbsp; 3  And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake
 hast laboured, and hast not fainted.
 &nbsp; 4  Nevertheless I have <I>somewhat</I> against thee, because thou
 hast left thy first love.
 &nbsp; 5  Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent,
 and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly,
 and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou
 repent.
 &nbsp; 6  But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
 Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
 &nbsp; 7  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
 the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the
 tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The inscription, where observe, 

 1. To whom the first of these epistles is directed: <I>To the church of
 Ephesus,</I> a famous church planted by the apostle Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:1-41">Acts xix.</A>),

 and afterwards watered and governed by John, who had his residence very
 much there. We can hardly think that Timothy was the angel, or sole 
 pastor and bishop, of this church at this time,--that he who was of a 
 very excellent spirit, and naturally cared for the good state of the 
 souls of the people, should become so remiss as to deserve the rebukes 
 given to the ministry of this church. Observe,

 2. From whom this epistle to Ephesus was sent; and here we have one of
 those titles that were given to Christ in his appearance to John in the 
 chapter foregoing: <I>He that holds the seven stars in his right hand, 
 and walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:13,16"><I>ch.</I> i. 13, 16</A>.
 
 This title consists of two parts:--

 (1.) <I>He that holds the stars in his right hand.</I> The ministers of
 Christ are under his special care and protection. It is the honour of
 God that he knows the number of the stars, calls them by their names, 
 <I>binds the sweet influences of Pleiades and looses the bands of 
 Orion;</I> and it is the honour of the Lord Jesus Christ that the 
 ministers of the gospel, who are greater blessings to the church than 
 the stars are to the world, are in his hand. He directs all their 
 motions; he disposes of them into their several orbs; he fills them 
 with light and influence; he supports them, or else they would soon be 
 falling stars; they are instruments in his hand, and all the good they 
 do is done by his hand with them. 

 (2.) <I>He walks in the midst of the golden candlesticks.</I> This 
 intimates his relation to his churches, as the other his relation to 
 his ministers. Christ is in an intimate manner present and conversant 
 with his churches; he knows and observes their state; he takes pleasure 
 in them, as a man does to walk in his garden. Though Christ is in 
 heaven, he walks in the midst of his churches on earth, observing what 
 is amiss in them and what it is that they want. This is a great 
 encouragement to those who have the care of the churches, that the Lord 
 Jesus has graven them upon the palms of his hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The contents of the epistle, in which, as in most of those that 
 follow, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The commendation Christ gave this church, ministers and members, 
 which he always brings in by declaring that he knows their works, and 
 therefore both his commendation and reprehension are to be strictly 
 regarded; for he does not in either speak at a venture: he knows what 
 he says. Now the church of Ephesus is commended, 

 (1.) For their diligence in duty: <I>I know thy works, and thy 
 labour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This may more immediately relate to the ministry of this church, which 
 had been laborious and diligent. Dignity calls for duty. Those that are 
 stars in Christ's hand had need to be always in motion, dispensing 
 light to all about them. <I>For my name's sake thou hast laboured, and 
 hast not fainted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Christ keeps an account of every day's work, and every hour's work, his 
 servants do for him, <I>and their labour shall not be in vain in the 
 Lord.</I>

 (2.) For their patience in suffering: <I>Thy labour and thy 
 patience,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It is not enough that we be diligent, but we must be patient, and 
 endure hardness as good soldiers of Christ. Ministers must have and 
 exercise great patience, and no Christian can be without it. There must 
 be bearing patience, to endure the injuries of men and the rebukes of 
 Providence; and there must be waiting patience, that, when they have 
 done the will of God, they may receive the promise: <I>Thou hast borne, 
 and hast patience,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 We shall meet with such difficulties in our way and work as require 
 patience to go on and finish well.

 (3.) For their zeal against what was evil: <I>Thou canst not bear those 
 that are evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It consists very well with Christian patience not to dispense with sin, 
 much less allow it; though we must show all meekness to men, yet we 
 must show a just zeal against their sins. This their zeal was the more 
 to be commended because it was according to knowledge, a discreet zeal 
 upon a previous trial made of the pretences, practices, and tenets of 
 evil men: <I>Thou hast tried those that say they are apostles and are 
 not, and hast found them liars.</I> True zeal proceeds with discretion; 
 none should be cast off till they be tried. Some had risen up in this
 church that pretended to be not ordinary ministers, but apostles; and 
 their pretensions had been examined but found to be vain and false. 
 Those that impartially search after truth may come to the knowledge of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The rebuke given to this church: <I>Nevertheless, I have somewhat
 against thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Those that have much good in them may have something much amiss in 
 them, and our Lord Jesus, as an impartial Master and Judge, takes 
 notice of both; though he first observes what is good, and is most 
 ready to mention this, yet he also observes what is amiss, and will 
 faithfully reprove them for it. The sin that Christ charged this church 
 with was their decay and declension in holy love and zeal: <I>Thou hast 
 left thy first love;</I> not left and forsaken the object of it, but 
 lost the fervent degree of it that at first appeared. Observe,

 (1.) The first affections of men towards Christ, and holiness, and 
 heaven, are usually lively and warm. God remembered the love of 
 Israel's espousals, when she would follow him withersoever he went. 
 
 (2.) These lively affections will abate and cool if great care be not 
 taken, and diligence used, to preserve them in constant exercise.

 (3.) Christ is grieved and displeased with his people when he sees them 
 grow remiss and cold towards him, and he will one way or other make 
 them sensible that he does not take it well from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The advice and counsel given them from Christ: <I>Remember therefore 
 whence thou hast fallen, and repent,</I> &c. 

 (1.) Those that have lost their first love <I>must remember whence they 
 have fallen;</I> they must compare their present with their former 
 state, and consider how much better it was with them then than now, how 
 much peace, strength, purity, and pleasure they have lost, by leaving 
 their first love,--how much more comfortably they could lie down and 
 sleep at night,--how much more cheerfully they could awake in the 
 morning,--how much better they could bear afflictions, and how much 
 more becomingly they could enjoy the favours of Providence,--how much 
 easier the thoughts of death were to them, and how much stronger their 
 desires and hopes of heaven. 

 (2.) They must repent. They must be inwardly grieved and ashamed for 
 their sinful declension; they must blame themselves, and shame 
 themselves, for it, and humbly confess it in the sight of God, and 
 judge and condemn themselves for it. 

 (3.) They must return and do their first works. They must as it were 
 begin again, go back step by step, till they come to the place where 
 they took the first false step; they must endeavour to revive and 
 recover their first zeal, tenderness, and seriousness, and must pray as 
 earnestly, and watch as diligently, as they did when they first set out 
 in the ways of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. This good advice is enforced and urged, 

 (1.) By a severe threatening, if it should be neglected: <I>I will come 
 unto thee quickly, and remove thy candlestick out of its place.</I> If 
 the presence of Christ's grace and Spirit be slighted, we may expect 
 the presence of his displeasure. He will come in a way of judgment, and 
 that suddenly and surprisingly, upon impenitent churches and sinners; 
 he will unchurch them, take away his gospel, his ministers, and his 
 ordinances from them, and what will the churches or the angels of the 
 churches do when the gospel is removed? 

 (2.) By an encouraging mention that is made of what was yet good among 
 them: <I>This thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, 
 which I also hate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 "Though thou hast declined in thy love to what is good, yet thou 
 retainest thy hatred to what is evil, especially to what is grossly 
 so." The Nicolaitans were a loose sect who sheltered themselves under 
 the name of Christianity. They held hateful doctrines, and they were 
 guilty of hateful deeds, hateful to Christ and to all true Christians; 
 and it is mentioned to the praise of the church of Ephesus that they 
 had a just zeal and abhorrence of those wicked doctrines and practices.
 An indifference of spirit between truth and error, good and evil, may 
 be called <I>charity</I> and <I>meekness,</I> but it is not pleasing to 
 Christ. Our Saviour subjoins this kind commendation to his severe 
 threatening, to make the advice more effectual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have the conclusion of this epistle, in which, as in those that 
 follow, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A call to attention: <I>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the 
 Spirit saith unto the churches.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) What is written in the scriptures is spoken by the Spirit of God. 
 
 (2.) What is said to one church concerns all the churches, in every 
 place and age. 

 (3.) We can never employ our faculty of hearing better than in 
 hearkening to the word of God: and we deserve to lose it if we do not 
 employ it to this purpose. Those who will not hear the call of God now 
 will wish at length they had never had a capacity of hearing any thing 
 at all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A promise of great mercy to those who overcome. The Christian life 
 is a warfare against sin, Satan, the world, and the flesh. It is not 
 enough that we engage in this warfare, but we must pursue it to the 
 end, we must never yield to our spiritual enemies, but fight the good 
 fight, till we gain the victory, as all persevering Christians shall 
 do; and the warfare and victory shall have a glorious triumph and 
 reward. That which is here promised to the victors is that they shall 
 <I>eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of 
 God.</I> They shall have that perfection of holiness, and that 
 confirmation therein, which Adam would have had if he had gone well 
 through the course of his trial: he would then have eaten of the tree 
 of life which was in the midst of paradise, and this would have been 
 the sacrament of confirmation to him in his holy and happy state; so 
 all who persevere in their Christian trial and warfare shall derive 
 from Christ, as the tree of life, perfection and confirmation in 
 holiness and happiness in the paradise of God; not in the earthly 
 paradise, but the heavenly,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We now proceed to the second epistle sent to another of the Asian 
 churches, where, as before, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preface or inscription in both parts. 

 1. The superscription, telling us to whom it was more expressly and
 immediately directed: <I>To the angel of the church in Smyrna,</I> a 
 place well known at this day by our merchants, a city of great trade 
 and wealth, perhaps the only city of all the seven that is still known 
 by the same name, now however no longer distinguished for its Christian 
 church being overrun by Mahomedism. 

 2. The subscription, containing another of the glorious titles of our
 Lord Jesus, <I>the first and the last, he that was dead and is 
 alive,</I> taken out of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:17,18"><I>ch.</I> i. 17, 18</A>.

 (1.) Jesus Christ is the <I>first and the last.</I> It is but a little
 scantling of time that is allowed to us in this world, but our Redeemer 
 is the first and the last. He is the first, for by him all things were 
 made, and he was before all things with God and was God himself. He is
 the last, for all things are made for him, and he will be the Judge of 
 all. This surely is the title of God, from everlasting and to 
 everlasting, and it is the title of one that is an unchangeable 
 Mediator between God and man, <I>Jesus, the same yesterday, to-day, and 
 for ever.</I> He was the first, for by him the foundation of the church 
 was laid in the patriarchal state; and he is the last, for by him the 
 top-stone will be brought forth and laid in the end of time. 

 (2.) <I>He was dead and is alive.</I> He was dead, and died for our 
 sins; he is alive, for he rose again for our justification, and he ever 
 lives to make intercession for us. He was dead, and by dying purchased 
 salvation for us; he is alive, and by his life applies this salvation 
 to us. And <I>if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled by his 
 death, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</I> 
 His death we commemorate every sacrament day; his resurrection and life 
 every sabbath day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The subject-matter of this epistle to Smyrna, where, after the 
 common declaration of Christ's omniscience, and the perfect cognizance 
 he has of all the works of men and especially of his churches, he takes 
 notice,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Of the improvement they had made in their spiritual state. This 
 comes in in a short parentheses; yet it is very emphatic: <I>But thou 
 art rich</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 poor in temporals, but rich in spirituals--poor in spirit, and yet rich 
 in grace. Their spiritual riches are set off by their outward poverty. 
 Many who are rich in temporals are poor in spirituals. Thus it was with 
 the church of Laodicea. Some who are poor outwardly are inwardly rich, 
 rich in faith and in good works, rich in privileges, rich in bonds and 
 deeds of gift, rich in hope, rich in reversion. Spiritual riches are 
 usually the reward of great diligence; <I>the diligent hand makes 
 rich.</I> Where there is spiritual plenty, outward poverty may be 
 better borne; and when God's people are impoverished in temporals, for 
 the sake of Christ and a good conscience, he makes all up to them in 
 spiritual riches, which are much more satisfying and enduring.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Of their sufferings: <I>I know thy tribulation and thy 
 poverty</I>--the persecution they underwent, even to the spoiling of
 their goods. Those who will be faithful to Christ must expect to go 
 through many tribulations; but Jesus Christ takes particular notice of 
 all their troubles. In all their afflictions, he is afflicted, and he 
 will recompense tribulation to those who trouble them, but to those 
 that are troubled rest with himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He knows the wickedness and the falsehood of their enemies: <I>I 
 know the blasphemy of those that say they are Jews, but are not;</I> 
 that is, of those who pretend to be the only peculiar covenant-people 
 of God, as the Jews boasted themselves to be, even after God had 
 rejected them; or of those who would be setting up the Jewish rites and 
 ceremonies, which were now not only antiquated, but abrogated; these 
 may say that they only are the church of God in the world, when indeed 
 <I>they are the synagogue of Satan.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) As Christ has a church in the world, the spiritual Israel of God, 
 so the devil has his synagogue. Those assemblies which are set up in 
 opposition to the truths of the gospel, and which promote and propagate 
 damnable errors,--those which are set up in opposition to the purity 
 and spirituality of gospel worship, and which promote and propagate the 
 vain inventions of men and rites and ceremonies which never entered 
 into the thoughts of God,--these are all synagogues of Satan: he 
 presides over them, he works in them, his interests are served by them, 
 and he receives a horrid homage and honour from them. 

 (2.) For the synagogues of Satan to give themselves out to be the 
 church or Israel of God is no less than blasphemy. God is greatly 
 dishonoured when his name is made use of to promote and patronize the 
 interests of Satan; and he has a high resentment of this blasphemy, and 
 will take a just revenge on those who persist in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He foreknows the future trials of his people, and forewarns them of 
 them, and fore-arms them against them. 

 (1.) He forewarns them of future trials: <I>The devil shall cast some 
 of you into prison, and you shall have tribulation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The people of God must look for a series and succession of troubles in 
 this world, and their troubles usually rise higher. They had been 
 impoverished by their tribulations before; now they must be imprisoned.
 Observe, It is the devil that stirs up his instruments, wicked men, to 
 persecute the people of God; tyrants and persecutors are the devil's 
 tools, though they gratify their own sinful malignity, and know not 
 that they are actuated by a diabolical malice.

 (2.) Christ fore-arms them against these approaching troubles, 

 [1.] By his counsel: <I>Fear none of these things.</I> This is not only 
 a word of command, but of efficacy, no, only forbidding slavish fear, 
 but subduing it and furnishing the soul with strength and courage.

 [2.] By showing them how their sufferings would be alleviated and 
 limited. <I>First,</I> They should not be universal. It would be some
 of them, not all, who should be cast into prison, those who were best 
 able to bear it and might expect to be visited and comforted by the 
 rest. <I>Secondly,</I> They were not to be perpetual, but for a set
 time, and a short time: <I>Ten days.</I> It should not be everlasting 
 tribulation, <I>the time should be shortened for the elect's sake.
 Thirdly,</I> It should be to try them, not to destroy them, that their 
 faith, and patience, and courage, might be proved and improved, and be 
 found to honour and glory.

 [3.] By proposing and promising a glorious reward to their fidelity: 
 <I>Be thou faithful to death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</I> 
 Observe, <I>First,</I> The sureness of the reward: <I>I will give 
 thee.</I> He has said it that is able to do it; and he has undertaken 
 that he will do it. They shall have the reward from his own hand, and 
 none of their enemies shall be able to wrest it out of his hand, or to 
 pull it from their heads. <I>Secondly,</I> The suitableness of it. 

 1. <I>A crown,</I> to reward their poverty, their fidelity, and their
 conflict.

 2. <I>A crown of life,</I> to reward those who are faithful even unto
 death, who are faithful till they die, and who part with life itself in 
 fidelity to Christ. The life so worn out in his service, or laid down 
 in his cause, shall be rewarded with another and a much better life 
 that shall be eternal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The conclusion of this message, and that, as before, 

 1. With a call to universal attention, that all men, all the world,
 should hear what passes between Christ and his churches--how he 
 commends them, how he comforts them, how he reproves their failures, 
 how he rewards their fidelity. It concerns all the inhabitants of the 
 world to observe God's dealings with his own people; all the world may 
 learn instruction and wisdom thereby. 

 2. With a gracious promise to the conquering Christian: <I>He that
 overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 (1.) There is not only a first, but a second death, a death after the 
 body is dead. 

 (2.) This second death is unspeakably worse than the first death, both 
 in the dying pangs and agonies of it (which are the agonies of the 
 soul, without any mixture of support) and in the duration; it is 
 <I>eternal death,</I> dying the death, to die and to be always dying. 
 This is hurtful indeed, fatally hurtful, to all who fall under it. 

 (3.) From this hurtful, this destructive death, Christ will save all 
 his faithful servants; the second death shall have no power over those 
 who are <I>partakers of the first resurrection:</I> the first death 
 shall not hurt them, and the second death shall have no power over 
 them.</P>

 Satan's seat <I>is:</I> and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not
 denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas <I>was</I> my
 faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.
 &nbsp; 14  But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast
 there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to
 cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat
 things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.
 &nbsp; 15  So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
 Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.
 &nbsp; 16  Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will
 fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
 &nbsp; 17  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
 the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the
 hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a
 new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth
 <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here also we are to consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The inscription of this message. 

 1. To whom it was sent: <I>To the angel of the church of Pergamos.</I>
 Whether this was a city raised up out of the ruins of old Troy, a Troy 
 <I>nouveau</I> (as our London was once called), or some other city of 
 the same name, is neither certain nor material; it was a place where 
 Christ had called and constituted a gospel church, by the preaching of 
 the gospel and the grace of his Spirit making the word effectual. 

 2. Who it was that sent this message to Pergamos: the same Jesus who
 here describes himself as one that <I>hath the sharp sword with two 
 edges</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:16"><I>ch.</I> i. 16</A>),

 <I>out of whose mouth went a sharp two-edged sword.</I> Some have
 observed that, in the several titles of Christ which are prefixed to 
 the several epistles, there is something suited to the state of those 
 churches; as in that to Ephesus, what could be more proper to awaken 
 and recover a drowsy and declining church than to hear Christ speaking 
 as one that <I>held the stars in his hand, and walked in the midst of 
 the golden candlesticks?</I> &c. The church of Pergamos was infested 
 with men of corrupt minds, who did what they could to corrupt both the 
 faith and manners of the church; and Christ, being resolved to fight 
 against them by the sword of his word, takes the title of him that 
 <I>hath the sharp sword with two edges.</I> 

 (1.) The word of God is a sword; it is a weapon both offensive and 
 defensive, it is, in the hand of God, able to slay both sin and 
 sinners. 

 (2.) It is a <I>sharp sword.</I> No heart is so hard but it is able to 
 cut it; it can divide asunder between the soul and the spirit, that is, 
 between the soul and those sinful habits that by custom have become 
 another soul, or seem to be essential to it.

 (3.) It is a <I>sword with two edges;</I> it turns and cuts every way.
 There is the <I>edge</I> of the law against the transgressors of that 
 dispensation, and the <I>edge</I> of the gospel against the despisers 
 of that dispensation; there is an edge to make a wound, and an edge to 
 open a festered wound in order to its healing. There is no escaping
 the edge of this sword: if you turn aside to the right hand, it has an 
 edge on that side; if on the left hand, you fall upon the edge of the 
 sword on that side; it turns every way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. From the inscription we proceed to the contents of the epistle, in 
 which the method is much the same as is observed in the rest.
 Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ takes notice of the trials and difficulties this church 
 encountered with: <I>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest,</I> 
 &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The works of God's servants are best known when the circumstances under 
 which they did those works are duly considered. Now that which added 
 very much lustre to the good works of this church was the circumstance 
 of the place where this church was planted, a place where <I>Satan's 
 seat</I> was. As our great Lord takes notice of all the advantages and 
 opportunities we have for duty in the places where we dwell, so he 
 takes notice of all the temptations and discouragements we meet with 
 from the places where we dwell, and makes gracious allowances for them. 
 This people dwelt where Satan's seat was, where he kept his court. His 
 <I>circuit</I> is throughout the world, his <I>seat</I> is in some 
 places that are infamous for wickedness, error, and cruelty. Some think 
 that the Roman governor in this city was a most violent enemy to the 
 Christians; and the seat of persecution is Satan's seat.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He commends their stedfastness: <I>Thou holdest fast my name, and 
 hast not denied my faith.</I> These two expressions are much the same 
 in sense; the former may, however, signify the effect and the latter 
 the cause or means. 

 (1.) "<I>Thou holdest fast my name;</I> thou art not ashamed of thy 
 relation to me, but accountest it thine honour that my name is named on 
 thee, that, as the wife bears the name of the husband, so thou art 
 called by my name; this thou holdest fast, as thine honour and 
 privilege." 

 (2.) "That which has made thee thus faithful is the grace of faith: 
 <I>thou hast not denied</I> the great doctrines of the gospel, nor 
 departed from the Christian faith, and by that means thou hast been 
 kept faithful." Our faith will have a great influence upon our 
 faithfulness. Men who deny the faith of Christ may boast very much of 
 their sincerity, and faithfulness to God and conscience; but it has 
 been seldom known that those who let go the true faith retained their 
 fidelity; usually on that rock on which men make shipwreck of their 
 faith they make shipwreck of a good conscience too. And here our
 blessed Lord aggrandizes the fidelity of this church from the 
 circumstance of the times, as well as of the place where they lived: 
 they had been stedfast <I>even in those days wherein Antipas his 
 faithful martyr was slain among them.</I> Who this person was, and 
 whether there be anything mysterious in his name, we have no certain 
 account. He was a faithful disciple of Christ, he suffered martyrdom 
 for it, and sealed his faith and fidelity with his blood in the place 
 where Satan dwelt; and though the rest of the believers there knew 
 this, and saw it, yet they were not discouraged nor drawn away from 
 their stedfastness: this is mentioned as an addition to their 
 honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He reproves them for their sinful failures 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there those 
 that hold the doctrine of Balaam,</I> &c., and <I>those that hold the 
 doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</I> There were some 
 who taught that it was lawful to eat things sacrificed to idols, and 
 that simple fornication was no sin; they, by an impure worship, drew 
 men into impure practices, as Balaam did the Israelites. Observe, 

 (1.) The filthiness of the spirit and the filthiness of the flesh often 
 go together. Corrupt doctrines and a corrupt worship often lead to a 
 corrupt conversation. 

 (2.) It is very lawful to fix the name of the leaders of any heresy 
 upon those who follow them. It is the shortest way of telling whom we 
 mean. 

 (3.) To continue in communion with persons of corrupt principles and 
 practices is displeasing to God, draws a guilt and blemish upon the 
 whole society: they become <I>partakers of other men's sins.</I> Though 
 the church, as such, has no power to punish the persons of men, either 
 for heresy or immorality, with corporal penalties, yet it has power to 
 exclude them from its communion; and, if it do not so, Christ, the head 
 and lawgiver of the church, will be displeased with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He calls them to repentance: <I>Repent, or else I will come unto 
 thee quickly,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 (1.) Repentance is the duty of saints as well as sinners; it is a 
 gospel duty. 

 (2.) It is the duty of churches and communities as well as particular 
 persons; those who sin together should repent together. 

 (3.) It is the duty of Christian societies to repent of other men's 
 sins, as far as they have been accessory to them, though but so much as 
 by connivance.

 (4.) When God comes to punish the corrupt members of a church, he 
 rebukes that church itself for allowing such to continue in its 
 communion, and some drops of the storm fall upon the whole society.
 
 (5.) No sword cuts so deep, nor inflicts so mortal a wound, as the 
 sword of Christ's mouth. Let but the threatenings of the word be set
 home upon the conscience of a sinner, and he will soon be a terror to 
 himself; let these threatenings be executed, and the sinner is utterly 
 cut off. The word of God will take hold of sinners, sooner or later, 
 either for their conviction or their confusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have the conclusion of this epistle, where, after the usual 
 demand of universal attention, there is the promise of great favour to 
 those that overcome. They shall <I>eat of the hidden manna, and have 
 the new name, and the white stone, which no man knoweth, saving he that 
 receiveth it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 1. The hidden manna, the influences and comforts of the Spirit of 
 Christ in communion with him, coming down from heaven into the soul, 
 from time to time, for its support, to let it taste something how 
 saints and angels live in heaven. This is hidden from the rest of the 
 world--<I>a stranger intermeddles not with</I> this joy; and it is laid 
 up in Christ, the ark of the covenant, in the holy of holies. 

 2. The white stone, with a new name engraven upon it. This white stone
 is absolution from the guilt of sin, alluding to the ancient custom of 
 giving a white stone to those acquitted on trial and a black stone to 
 those condemned. The new name is the name of adoption: adopted persons 
 took the name of the family into which they were adopted. None can read 
 the evidence of a man's adoption but himself; he cannot always read it, 
 but if he persevere he shall have both the evidence of sonship and the 
 inheritance.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These
 things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame

 thy patience, and thy works; and the last <I>to be</I> more than the

 thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a
 prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit
 fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.
 &nbsp; 21  And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
 repented not.

 my Father.

 the churches.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The form of each epistle is very much the same; and in this, as the 
 rest, we have to consider the inscription, contents, and 
 conclusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The inscription, telling us, 

 1. To whom it is directed: <I>To the angel of the church of
 Thyatira,</I> a city of the proconsular Asia, bordering upon Mysia on 
 the north and Lydia on the south, a town of trade, whence came the 
 woman named <I>Lydia, a seller of purple,</I> who, being at Philippi in 
 Macedonia, probably about the business of her calling, <I>heard Paul 
 preach there,</I> and <I>God opened her heart, that she attended to the 
 things that were spoken, and believed, and was baptized,</I> and 
 entertained Paul and Silas there. Whether it was by her means that the 
 gospel was brought into her own city, Thyatira, is not certain; but 
 that it was there, and successful to the forming of a gospel church, 
 this epistle assures us. 

 2. By whom it was sent: by <I>the Son of God,</I> who is here described
 as having <I>eyes like a flame of fire, and feet like as fine 
 brass.</I> His general title is here, <I>the Son of God,</I> that is, 
 the eternal and only-begotten Son of God, which denotes that he has the 
 same nature with the Father, but with a distinct and subordinate manner 
 of subsistence. The description we have here of him is in two 
 characters:--

 (1.) That his eyes are like a flame of fire, signifying his piercing,
 penetrating, perfect knowledge, a thorough insight into all persons and 
 all things, one <I>who searches the hearts and tries the reins of the 
 children of men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and will make all the churches to know he does so. 

 (2.) That his feet are like fine brass, that the outgoings of his 
 providence are steady, awful, and all pure and holy. As he judges with 
 perfect wisdom, so he acts with perfect strength and steadiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The contents or subject-matter of this epistle, which, as the rest, 
 includes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The honourable character and commendation Christ gives of this 
 church, ministry, and people; and this given by one who was no stranger 
 to them, but well acquainted with them and with the principles from 
 which they acted. Now in this church Christ makes honourable mention, 
 
 (1.) Of their <I>charity,</I> either more general, a disposition to do 
 good to all men, or more special, to the household of faith: there is 
 no religion where there is no charity. 

 (2.) Their <I>service,</I> their ministration; this respects chiefly 
 the officers of the church, who had laboured in the word and doctrine. 
 
 (3.) Their <I>faith,</I> which was the grace that actuated all the 
 rest, both their charity and their service. 

 (4.) Their <I>patience;</I> for those that are most charitable to 
 others, most diligent in their places, and most faithful, must yet 
 expect to meet with that which will exercise their patience. 

 (5.) Their growing fruitfulness: their last works were better than the 
 first. This is an excellent character; when others had <I>left their 
 first love,</I> and <I>lost their first zeal,</I> these were growing 
 wiser and better. It should be the ambition and earnest desire of all 
 Christians that their last works may be their best works, that they may 
 be better and better every day, and best at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A faithful reproof for what was amiss. This is not so directly 
 charged upon the church itself as upon some wicked seducers who were 
 among them; the church's fault was that she connived too much at 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) These wicked seducers were compared to Jezebel, and called by her 
 name. Jezebel was a persecutor of the prophets of the Lord, and a great 
 patroness of idolaters and false prophets. The sin of these seducers 
 was that they attempted to draw the servants of God into fornication, 
 and to offer sacrifices to idols; they called themselves prophets, and 
 so would claim a superior authority and regard to the ministers of the 
 church. Two things aggravated the sin of these seducers, who, being one 
 in their spirit and design, are spoken of as one person:--

 [1.] They made use of the name of God to oppose the truth of his
 doctrine and worship; this very much aggravated their sin. 

 [2.] They abused the patience of God to harden themselves in their 
 wickedness. God gave them space for repentance, but they repented not.
 Observe, <I>First,</I> Repentance is necessary to prevent a sinner's 
 ruin. <I>Secondly,</I> Repentance requires time, a course of time, and
 time convenient; it is a great work, and a work of time.
 <I>Thirdly,</I> Where God gives space for repentance, he expects fruits 
 meet for repentance. <I>Fourthly,</I> Where the space for repentance is 
 lost, the sinner perishes with a double destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Now why should the wickedness of this Jezebel be charged upon the 
 church of Thyatira? Because that church suffered her to seduce the 
 people of that city. But how could the church help it? They had not, as 
 a church, civil power to banish or imprison her; but they had 
 ministerial power to censure and to excommunicate her: and it is 
 probable that neglecting to use the power they had made them sharers in 
 her sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The punishment of this seducer, this Jezebel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>,

 in which is couched a prediction of the fall of Babylon.

 (1.) <I>I will cast her into a bed,</I> into a bed of pain, not of 
 pleasure, into a bed of flames; and those who have sinned with her 
 shall suffer with her; but this may yet be prevented by their 
 repentance. 

 (2.) <I>I will kill her children with death;</I> that is, the second 
 death, which does the work effectually, and leaves no hope of future 
 life, no resurrection for those that are killed by the second death, 
 but only to shame and everlasting contempt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The design of Christ in the destruction of these wicked seducers, 
 and this was the instruction of others, especially of his churches: 
 <I>All the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins 
 and the hearts; and I will give to every one of you according to your 
 works.</I> God is known by <I>the judgments that he executes;</I> and, 
 by this revenge taken upon seducers, he would make known, 

 (1.) His infallible knowledge of the hearts of men, of their 
 principles, designs, frame, and temper, their formality, their 
 indifference, their secret inclinations to symbolize with idolaters. 
 
 (2.) His impartial justice, in <I>giving every one according to his 
 work,</I> that the name of Christians should be no protection, their 
 churches should be no sanctuaries for sin and sinners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The encouragement given to those who keep themselves pure and 
 undefiled: <I>But to you I say, and unto the rest,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 (1.) What these seducers called their doctrines--<I>depths,</I>
 profound mysteries, amusing the people, and endeavouring to persuade 
 them that they had a deeper insight into religion than their own 
 ministers had attained to. 

 (2.) What Christ called them--<I>depths of Satan,</I> Satanical 
 delusions and devices, diabolical mysteries; for there is a <I>mystery 
 of iniquity,</I> as well and <I>the great mystery of godliness.</I> It 
 is a dangerous thing to despise the mystery of God, and it is as 
 dangerous to receive the mysteries of Satan. 

 (3.) How tender Christ is of his faithful servants: "<I>I will lay upon 
 you no other burden; but that which you have already hold fast till I 
 come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 I will not overburden your faith with any new mysteries, nor your 
 consciences with any new laws. I only require your attention to what 
 you have received. <I>Hold that fast till I come,</I> and I desire no 
 more." Christ is coming to put an end to all the temptations of his 
 people; and, if they hold fast faith and a good conscience till he 
 come, all the difficulty and danger will be over.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We now come to the conclusion of this message, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:26-29"><I>v.</I> 26-29</A>.

 Here we have, 

 1. The promise of an ample reward to the persevering victorious 
 believer, in two parts:--

 (1.) Very great power and dominion over the rest of the world: <I>Power
 over the nations,</I> which may refer either to the time when the 
 empire should turn Christian, and the world be under the government of 
 the Christian emperor, as in Constantine's time; or to the other world, 
 when believers shall sit down with Christ on his throne of judgment, 
 and join with him in trying, and condemning, and consigning over to 
 punishment the enemies of Christ and the church. <I>The upright shall
 have dominion in the morning.</I> 

 (2.) Knowledge and wisdom, suitable to such power and dominion: <I>I 
 will give him the morning-star.</I> Christ is the morning-star. He 
 brings day with him into the soul, the light of grace and of glory; and 
 he will give his people that perfection of light and wisdom which is 
 requisite to the state of dignity and dominion that they shall have in 
 the morning of the resurrection. 

 2. This epistle ends with the usual demand of attention: <I>He that
 hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</I> 
 In the foregoing epistles, this demand of attention comes before the 
 concluding promise; but in this, and all that follow, it comes after, 
 and tells us that we should all attend to the promises as well as to 
 the precepts that Christ delivers to the churches.</P>
