 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to
 Corinth;
 &nbsp; 2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately
 come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius
 had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.
 &nbsp; 3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
 wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
 &nbsp; 4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded
 the Jews and the Greeks.
 &nbsp; 5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul
 was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews <I>that</I> Jesus
 <I>was</I> Christ.
 &nbsp; 6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook
 <I>his</I> raiment, and said unto them, Your blood <I>be</I> upon your own
 heads; I <I>am</I> clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We do not find that Paul was much persecuted at Athens, nor that he was 
 driven thence by any ill usage, as he was from those places where the 
 Jews had or could make any interest; but this reception at Athens being 
 cold, and little prospect of doing good there, he departed from Athens, 
 leaving the care of those there who believed with Dionysius; and thence 
 he came to Corinth, where he was now instrumental in planting a church 
 that became on many accounts considerable. Corinth was the chief city 
 of Achaia, now a province of the empire, a rich and splendid city. 
 <I>Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum--It is not permitted
 every man to see Corinth.</I> The country thereabouts at this day is 
 called <I>the Morea.</I> Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Paul working for his living, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 1. Though he was bred a scholar, yet he was master of a handicraft 
 trade. He was a tent-maker, an upholsterer; he made tents for the use 
 of soldiers and shepherds, of cloth or stuff, or (as some say tents 
 were then generally made) of leather or skins, as the outer covering of 
 the tabernacle. Hence to live in tents was to live <I>sub 
 pellibus--under skins.</I> Dr. Lightfoot shows that it was the custom
 of the Jews to bring up their children to some trade, yea, though they 
 gave them learning or estates. Rabbi Judah says, "He that teaches not
 his son a trade is as if he taught him to be a thief." And another 
 says, "He that has a trade in his hand is as a vineyard that is 
 fenced." An honest trade, by which a man may get his bread, is not to 
 be looked upon by any with contempt. Paul, though a Pharisee, and bred
 up at the feet of Gamaliel, yet, having in his youth learned to make 
 tents, did not by disuse lose the art. 

 2. Though he was entitled to a maintenance from the churches he had
 planted, and from the people to whom he preached, yet he worked at his 
 calling to get bread, which is more to his praise who did not ask for 
 supplies than to theirs who did not supply him unasked, knowing what 
 straits he was reduced to. See how humble Paul was, and wonder that so
 great a man could stoop so low; but he had learned condescension of his 
 Master, who came not to be ministered to, but to minister. See how 
 industrious he was, and how willing to take pains. He that had so much 
 excellent work to do with his mind, yet, when there was occasion, did 
 not think it below him to work with his hands. Even those that are 
 redeemed from the curse of the law are not exempt from that sentence, 
 <I>In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread.</I> See how careful 
 Paul was to recommend his ministry, and to prevent prejudices against 
 it, even the most unjust and unreasonable; he therefore maintained 
 himself with his own labour that he might not make the gospel of Christ 
 <I>burdensome,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:7,2Th+3:8,9">2 Cor. xi. 7,
 &c.; 2 Thess. iii. 8, 9</A>.
 
 3. Though we may suppose he was master of his trade, yet he did not 
 disdain to work at journey-work: He <I>wrought with Aquila and 
 Priscilla,</I> who <I>were of that calling,</I> so that he got no more 
 than day-wages, a bare subsistence. Poor tradesmen must be thankful if 
 their callings bring them in a maintenance for themselves and their 
 families, though they cannot do as the rich merchants that raise 
 estates by their callings. 

 4. Though he was himself a great apostle, yet he chose to work with
 Aquila and Priscilla, because he found them to be very intelligent in 
 the things of God, as appears afterwards

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and he owns that they had been his <I>helpers in Christ Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:3">Rom. xvi. 3</A>.

 This is an example to those who are going to service to seek for those
 services in which they may have the best help for their souls. Choose
 to work with those that are likely to be helpers in Christ Jesus. It is 
 good to be in company and to have conversation with those that will 
 further us in the knowledge of Christ, and to put ourselves under the 
 influence of such as are resolved that they will serve the Lord. 
 Concerning this Aquila we are here told,

 (1.) That he was a Jew, but born in Pontus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Many of the Jews of the dispersion were seated in that country, as 
 appears

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1">1 Pet. i. 1</A>.

 (2.) That he was lately come from Italy to Corinth. It seems he often
 changed his habitation; this is not the world we can propose ourselves 
 a settlement in. 

 (3.) That the reason of his leaving Italy was because by a late edict 
 of the emperor Claudius C&aelig;sar all Jews were banished from Rome; 
 for the Jews were generally hated, and every occasion was taken to put 
 hardship and disgrace upon them. God's heritage was as a <I>speckled 
 bird, the birds round about were against her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:9">Jer. xii. 9</A>.

 Aquila, though a Christian, was banished because he had been a Jew; and
 the Gentiles had such confused notions of the thing that they could not 
 distinguish between a Jew and a Christian. Suetonius, in the life of
 Claudius, speaks of this decree in the ninth year of his reign, and 
 says, The reason was because the Jews were <I>a turbulent 
 people--assiduo tumultuantes;</I> and that it was <I>impulsore
 Christo--upon the account of Christ;</I> some zealous for him, others
 bitter against him, which occasioned great heats, such as gave umbrage 
 to the government, and provoked the emperor, who was a timorous jealous 
 man, to order them all to be gone. If Jews persecute Christians, it is 
 not strange if heathens persecute them both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have here Paul preaching to the Jews, and dealing with them to 
 bring them to the faith of Christ, both the native <I>Jews and the 
 Greeks,</I> that is, those that were more or less proselyted to the 
 Jewish religion, and frequented their meetings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He <I>reasoned with them in the synagogue</I> publicly <I>every 
 sabbath.</I> See in what way the apostles propagated the gospel, not by 
 force and violence, by fire and sword, not by demanding an implicit 
 consent, but by fair arguing; they drew with the cords of a man, gave a 
 reason for what they said, and gave a liberty to object against it, 
 having satisfactory answers ready. God invites us to come and reason 
 with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:18">Isa. i. 18</A>),

 and challenges sinners to <I>produce their cause,</I> and <I>bring 
 forth their strong reasons,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:21">Isa. xli. 21</A>.

 Paul was a rational as well as a scriptural preacher.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>He persuaded them</I>--<B><I>epeithe</I></B>. It denotes,

 (1.) The urgency of his preaching. He did not only dispute 
 argumentatively with them, but he followed his arguments with 
 affectionate persuasions, begging of them for God's sake, for their own 
 soul's sake, for their children's sake, not to refuse the offer of 
 salvation made to them. Or, 

 (2.) The good effect of his preaching. He persuaded them, that is, he 
 prevailed with them; so some understand it. <I>In sententiam suam
 adducebat--He brought them over to his own opinion.</I> Some of them
 were convinced by his reasonings, and yielded to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He was yet more earnest in this matter when his fellow-labourers, 
 his seconds, came up with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>When Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia,</I> and had brought 
 him good tidings from the churches there, and were ready to assist him 
 here, and strengthened his hands, then Paul was more than before 
 <I>pressed in spirit,</I> which made him more than ever pressing in his 
 preaching. He was grieved for the obstinacy and infidelity of his 
 countrymen the Jews, was more intent than ever upon their conversion, 
 and the <I>love of Christ constrained him</I> to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:14">2 Cor. v. 14</A>):

 it is the word that is used here, it <I>pressed him in spirit</I> to 
 it. And, being thus pressed, he <I>testified to the Jews</I> with all 
 possible solemnity and seriousness, as that which he was perfectly well 
 assured of himself, and attested to them as a <I>faithful saying, and 
 worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus is the Christ,</I> the Messiah 
 promised to the fathers and expected by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have him here abandoning the unbelieving Jews, and turning from 
 them to the Gentiles, as he had done in other places, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Many of the Jews, and indeed the most of them, persisted in their 
 contradiction to the gospel of Christ, and would not yield to the 
 strongest reasonings nor the most winning persuasions; they <I>opposed 
 themselves</I> and <I>blasphemed;</I> they <I>set themselves in battle 
 array</I> (so the word signifies) against the gospel; they joined hand 
 in hand to stop the progress of it. They resolved they would not 
 believe it themselves, and would do all they could to keep others from 
 believing it. They could not argue against it, but what was wanting in 
 reason they made up in ill language: they <I>blasphemed,</I> spoke 
 reproachfully of Christ, and in him of God himself, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:5,6">Rev. xiii. 5, 6</A>.

 To justify their infidelity, they broke out into downright 
 blasphemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Paul hereupon declared himself discharged from them, and left them 
 to perish in their unbelief. He that was <I>pressed in spirit</I> to 
 <I>testify to them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 when they opposed that testimony, and persisted in their opposition, 
 was pressed in spirit to testify against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and his zeal herein also he showed by a sign: he <I>shook his 
 raiment,</I> shaking off the dust from it (as before they <I>shook off 
 the dust from their feet,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:51"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 51</A>),

 for a testimony against them. thus he cleared himself from them, but
 threatened the judgments of God against them. As Pilate by washing his 
 hands signified the devolving of the guilt of Christ's blood from 
 himself upon the Jews, so Paul by shaking his raiment signified what he 
 said, if possible to affect them with it. 

 (1.) He had done his part, and was clean from the blood of their souls; 
 he had, like a faithful watchman, given them warning, and thereby had 
 <I>delivered his soul,</I> though he could not prevail to deliver 
 theirs. He had tried all methods to work upon them, but all in vain, so 
 that if they perish in their unbelief their blood is not to be required 
 at his hands; here, and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:26"><I>ch.</I> xx. 26</A>,

 he plainly refers to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:8,9">Ezek. xxxiii. 8, 9</A>.

 It is very comfortable to a minister to have the testimony of his
 conscience for him, that he has faithfully discharged his trust by 
 warning sinners. 

 (2.) They would certainly perish if they persisted in their unbelief, 
 and the blame would lie wholly upon themselves: "Your <I>blood be upon 
 your own heads,</I> you will be your own destroyers, your nation will 
 be ruined in this world, and particular persons will be ruined in the 
 other world, and <I>you alone shall bear it.</I>" If any thing would 
 frighten them at last into a compliance with the gospel, surely this 
 would.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Having given them over, yet he does not give over his work. Though 
 Israel be not gathered, Christ and his gospel shall be glorious: 
 <I>Henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles;</I> and the Jews cannot 
 complain, for they had the first offer, and a fair one, made to them. 
 The guests that were first invited will not come, and the provision 
 must not be lost; guests must be had therefore <I>from the highways and 
 the hedges.</I> "We <I>would have gathered</I> the Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>),
 
 would have <I>healed them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:9">Jer. li. 9</A>),

 and they would not; but Christ must not be a head without a body, nor a 
 foundation without a building, and therefore, if they will not, we must 
 try whether others will." Thus the fall and diminishing of the Jews 
 became the riches of the Gentiles; and Paul said this to their faces, 
 not only because it was what he could justify, but to <I>provoke them 
 to jealousy,</I>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain <I>man's</I>
 house, named Justus, <I>one</I> that worshipped God, whose house
 joined hard to the synagogue.
 &nbsp; 8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on
 the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing
 believed, and were baptized.
 &nbsp; 9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
 afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:
 &nbsp; 10 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt
 thee: for I have much people in this city.
 &nbsp; 11 And he continued <I>there</I> a year and six months, teaching the
 word of God among them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That Paul changed his quarters. Christ directed his disciples, when 
 he sent them forth, not to <I>go from house to house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:7">Luke x. 7</A>),
 
 but there might be occasion to do it, as Paul did here. He departed out 
 of the synagogue, being driven out by the perverseness of the 
 unbelieving Jews, and he <I>entered into a certain man's house, named 
 Justus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It should seem, he went to this man's house, not to lodge, for he 
 continued with Aquila and Priscilla, but to preach. When the Jews would 
 not let him go on peaceably with his work in their meeting, this honest 
 man opened his doors to him, and told him he should be welcome to 
 preach there; and Paul accepted the proposal. It was not the first time 
 that God's ark had taken up its lodging in a private house. When Paul 
 could not have liberty to preach in the synagogue, he preached in a 
 house, without any disparagement to his doctrine. But observe the 
 account of this man and his house. 

 1. The man was next door to a Jew; he was one that <I>worshipped
 God;</I> he was not an idolater, though he was a Gentile, but was a 
 worshipper of the God of Israel, and him only, as Cornelius. That Paul 
 might give the less offence to the Jews, though he had abandoned them, 
 he set up his meeting in this man's house. Even when he was under a 
 necessity of breaking off from them to turn to the Gentiles, yet he 
 would study to oblige them.

 2. The house was next door to the synagogue, it <I>joined close to 
 it,</I> which some perhaps might interpret as done with design to draw 
 people from the synagogue to the meeting; but I rather think it was 
 done in charity, to show that he would come as near to them as he 
 could, and was ready to return to them if they were but willing to 
 receive his message, and would not contradict and blaspheme as they had 
 done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That Paul presently saw the good fruit of his labours, both among
 Jews and Gentiles.

 1. <I>Crispus</I> a Jew, an eminent one, the <I>chief ruler of the
 synagogue, believed on the Lord Jesus, with all his house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It was for the honour of the gospel that there were some rulers, and
 persons of the first rank both in church and state, that embraced it. 
 This would leave the Jews inexcusable, that the ruler of their 
 synagogue, who may be supposed to have excelled the rest in knowledge 
 of the scriptures and zeal for their religion, believed the gospel, and 
 yet they opposed and blasphemed it. Not only he, but his house, 
 believed, and, probably, were baptized with him by Paul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:14">1 Cor. i. 14</A>.

 2. Many of the Corinthians, who were Gentiles (and some of them persons
 of bad character, as appears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11">1 Cor. vi. 11</A>,

 <I>such were some of you), hearing, believed, and were baptized.</I>
 First, they heard, for <I>faith comes by hearing.</I> Some perhaps came
 to hear Paul under some convictions of conscience that the way they 
 were in was not right; but it is probable that the most came only for 
 curiosity, because it was a new doctrine that was preached; but, 
 hearing, <I>they believed,</I> by the power of God working upon them; 
 and, <I>believing,</I> they were <I>baptized,</I> and so fixed for 
 Christ, took upon them the profession of Christianity, and became
 entitled to the privileges of Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That Paul was encouraged by a vision to go on with his work at 
 Corinth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>The Lord Jesus spoke to Paul in the night by a vision;</I> when he 
 was musing on his work, <I>communing with his own heart upon his 
 bed,</I> and considering whether he should continue here or no, what 
 method he should take here, and what probability there was of doing 
 good, then Christ appeared very seasonably to him, and <I>in the 
 multitude of his thoughts within him</I> delighted his soul with divine 
 consolations.

 1. He renewed his commission and charge to preach the gospel: "<I>Be
 not afraid of the Jews;</I> though they are very outrageous, and 
 perhaps the more enraged by the conversion of the chief ruler of their 
 synagogue. Be not afraid of the magistrates of the city, for they have 
 no power against thee but what is given them from above. It is the
 cause of heaven thou art pleading, do it boldly. <I>Be not afraid of 
 their words, nor dismayed at their looks;</I> but <I>speak, and hold 
 not thy peace;</I> let slip no opportunity of speaking to them; <I>cry 
 aloud, spare not.</I> Do not hold thy peace from speaking for fear of 
 them, nor hold thy peace in speaking" (if I may so say); "do not speak 
 shyly and with caution, but plainly and fully and with courage. Speak 
 out; use all the liberty of spirit that becomes an ambassador for 
 Christ." 

 2. He assured him of his presence with him, which was sufficient to
 animate him, and put life and spirit into him: "<I>Be not afraid, for I 
 am with thee,</I> to protect thee, and bear thee out, and to deliver 
 thee from all thy fears; <I>speak, and hold not thy peace, for I am 
 with thee,</I> to own what thou sayest, to work with thee, and to 
 confirm the word by signs following." The same promise that ratified 
 the general commission

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:19,20">Matt. xxviii. 19, 20</A>),

 <I>Lo I am with you always,</I> is here repeated. Those that have 
 Christ with them need not to fear, and ought not to shrink. 

 3. He gave him a warrant of protection to save him harmless: "<I>No man 
 shall set on thee to hurt thee;</I> thou shalt be delivered out of the 
 hands of wicked and unreasonable men and shalt not be driven hence, as 
 thou wast from other places, by persecution." He does not promise that 
 no man should set on him (for the next news we hear is that he is set
 upon, and <I>brought to the judgment-seat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 but, "<I>No man shall set on thee to hurt thee;</I> the remainder of
 their wrath shall be restrained; thou shalt not be beaten and
 imprisoned here, as thou wast at Philippi." Paul met with coarser
 treatment at first than he did afterwards, and was now <I>comforted
 according to the time wherein he had been afflicted.</I> Trials shall
 not last always, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:10-12">Ps. lxvi. 10-12</A>.

 Or we may take it more generally: "<I>No man shall set on thee,</I>
 <B><I>tou kakosai se</I></B>--to <I>do evil</I> to thee; whatever
 trouble they may give thee, there is no real evil in it. They may kill
 thee, but they cannot hurt thee; for <I>I am with thee,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:4,Isa+41:10">Ps. xxiii. 4; Isa. xli. 10</A>.

 4. He gave him a prospect of success: "<I>For I have much people in 
 this city.</I> Therefore no man shall prevail to obstruct thy work, 
 therefore I will be with thee to own thy work, and therefore do thou go 
 on vigorously and cheerfully in it; for there are many in this city 
 that are to be effectually called by thy ministry, in whom thou shalt 
 <I>see of the travail of thy soul.</I>" <B><I>Laos esti moi 
 polys</I></B>--<I>There is to me a great people here.</I> The Lord
 knows those that are his, yea, and those that shall be his; for it is 
 by his work upon them that they become his, and <I>known unto him are 
 all his works.</I> "I have them, though they yet know me not, though 
 yet they are let captive by Satan at his will; for the Father has given 
 them to me, to be a seed to serve me; I have them written in the book 
 of life; I have their names down, and of all that were given me I will 
 lose none; I have them, for I am sure to have them;" <I>whom he did 
 predestinate, those he called. In this city,</I> though it be a very 
 profane wicked city, full of impurity, and the more so for a temple of 
 Venus there, to which there was a great resort, yet in this heap, that 
 seems to be all chaff, there is wheat; in this ore, that seems to be 
 all dross, there is gold. Let us not despair concerning any place, when 
 even in Corinth Christ had <I>much people.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That upon this encouragement he made a long stay there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 He <I>continued at Corinth a year and six months,</I> not to take his 
 ease, but to follow his work, <I>teaching the word of God among 
 them;</I> and, it being a city flocked to from all parts, he had 
 opportunity there of preaching the gospel to strangers, and sending 
 notice of it thence to other countries. He staid so long, 

 1. For the bringing in of those that were without. Christ had many
 people there, and by the power of his grace he could have had them all 
 converted in one month or week, as at the first preaching of the 
 gospel, when thousands were enclosed at one cast of the net; but God 
 works variously. The people Christ has at Corinth must be called in by 
 degrees, some by one sermon, others by another; <I>we see not yet all 
 things put under Christ.</I> Let Christ's ministers go on in their 
 duty, though their work be not done all at once; nay, though it be done 
 but a little at a time. 

 2. For the building up of those that were within. Those that are
 converted have still need to be <I>taught the word of God,</I> and 
 particular need at Corinth to be taught it by Paul himself; for no 
 sooner was the good seed sown in that field than the enemy came and 
 sowed tares, the false apostles, those deceitful workers, of whom Paul 
 in his epistles to the Corinthians complains so much. When the hands of 
 Jewish persecutors were tied, who were professed enemies to the gospel, 
 Paul had a more vexatious trouble created him, and the church more 
 mischievous damage done it, by the tongue of judaizing preachers, who, 
 under colour of the Christian name, undermined the very foundations of 
 Christianity. Soon after Paul came to Corinth, it is supposed, he wrote 
 the first epistle to the Thessalonians, which in order of time was the 
 first of all the epistles he wrote by divine inspiration; and the 
 second epistle to the same church was written not long after. Ministers 
 may be serving Christ, and promoting the great ends of their ministry, 
 by writing good letters, as well as by preaching good sermons.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of some disturbance given to Paul and his 
 friends at Corinth, but no great harm done, nor much hindrance given to 
 the work of Christ there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Paul is accused by the Jews before the Roman governor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 The governor was <I>Gallio, deputy of Achaia,</I> that is, proconsul; 
 for Achaia was a consular province of the empire. This Gallio was elder 
 brother to the famous Seneca; in his youth he was called Novatus, but 
 took the name of Gallio upon his being adopted into the family of 
 Julius Gallio; he is described by Seneca, his brother, to be a man of 
 great ingenuous and great probity, and a man of wonderful good temper; 
 he was called <I>Dulcis Gallio--Sweet Gallio,</I> for his sweet
 disposition; and is said to have been universally beloved. Now observe, 
 
 1. How rudely Paul is apprehended, and brought before Gallio; <I>The
 Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul.</I> They were the 
 ringleaders of all the mischief against Paul, and they entered into a 
 confederacy to do him a mischief. They were unanimous in it: they came 
 upon him <I>with one accord;</I> hand joined in hand to do this 
 wickedness. They did it with violence and fury: <I>They made an 
 insurrection</I> to the disturbance of the public peace, and hurried 
 Paul away <I>to the judgment-seat,</I> and, for aught that appears, 
 allowed him no time to prepare for his trial. 

 2. How falsely Paul is accused before Gallio

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</I>
 They could not charge him with persuading men not to worship God at 
 all, or to worship other gods 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:2">Deut. xiii. 2</A>):

 but only to worship God in a way contrary to the law. The Romans 
 allowed the Jews in their provinces the observance of their own law; 
 and what then? Must those therefore be prosecuted as criminals who 
 worship God in any other way? Does their toleration include a power of 
 imposition? But the charge was unjust; for their own law had in it a 
 promise of a prophet whom God would raise up to them, and him they 
 should hear. Now Paul persuaded them to believe in this prophet, who 
 was come, and to hear him, which was according to the law; for he came 
 not <I>to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.</I> The law relating to 
 the temple-service those Jews at Corinth could not observe, because of 
 their distance from Jerusalem, and there was no part of their 
 synagogue-worship which Paul contradicted. Thus when people are taught 
 to worship God in Christ, and to worship him in the Spirit, they are 
 ready to quarrel, as if they were taught to worship him contrary to the 
 law; whereas this is indeed perfective of the law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Gallio, upon the first hearing, or rather without any hearing at 
 all, dismisses the cause, and will not take any cognizance of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 Paul was going about to make his defence, and to show that he did not 
 teach men to worship God contrary to the law; but the judge, being 
 resolved not to pass any sentence upon this cause, would not give 
 himself the trouble of examining it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He shows himself very ready to do the part of a judge in any matter 
 that it was proper for him to take cognizance of. He <I>said to the 
 Jews,</I> that were the prosecutors, "<I>If it were a matter of wrong, 
 or wicked lewdness,</I>--if you could charge the prisoner with theft or
 fraud, with murder or rapine, or any act of immorality,--I should think
 myself bound <I>to bear with you</I> in your complaints, though they 
 were clamorous and noisy;" for the rudeness of the petitioners was no 
 good reason, if their cause was just, why they should not have justice 
 done them. It is the duty of magistrates to right the injured, and to 
 animadvert upon the injurious; and, if the complaint be not made with 
 all the decorum that might be, yet they should hear it out. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He will by no means allow them to make a complaint to him of a thing 
 that was not within his jurisdiction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>If it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look you 
 to it:</I> end it among yourselves as you can, but <I>I will be no 
 judge of such matters;</I> you shall neither burden my patience with 
 the hearing of it, nor burden my conscience with giving judgment upon 
 it;" and therefore, when they were urgent and pressing to be heard, 
 <I>he drove them from the judgment-seat</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and ordered another cause to be called. Now, 

 (1.) Here was something right in Gallio's conduct, and 
 praise-worthy--that he would not pretend to judge of things he did not
 understand; that he left the Jews to themselves in matters relating to 
 their own religion, but yet would not let them, under pretence of that, 
 run down Paul, and abuse him; or, at least, would not himself be the 
 tool of their malice, to give judgment against him. He looked upon the 
 matter to be not within his jurisdiction, and therefore would not 
 meddle in it. But, 

 (2.) It was certainly wrong to speak so slightly of a law and religion 
 which he might have known to be of God, and with which he ought to have 
 acquainted himself. In what way God is to be worshipped, whether Jesus 
 be the Messiah, whether the gospel be a divine revelation, were not 
 <I>questions of words and names,</I> as he scornfully and profanely 
 called them. They are questions of vast importance, and in which, if he 
 had understood them himself aright, he would have seen himself nearly 
 concerned. He speaks as if he boasted of his ignorance of the 
 scriptures, and took a pride in it; as if it were below him to take 
 notice of the law of God, or make any enquiries concerning it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The abuse done to Sosthenes, and Gallio's unconcernedness in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 1. The parties put a great contempt upon the court, when <I>they took 
 Sosthenes and beat him before the judgment-seat.</I> Many conjectures 
 there are concerning this matter, because it is uncertain who this 
 Sosthenes was, and who the Greeks were that abused him. It seems most 
 probable that Sosthenes was a Christian, and Paul's particular friend, 
 that appeared for him on this occasion, and probably had taken care of 
 his safety, and conveyed him away, when Gallio dismissed the cause; so 
 that, when they could not light on Paul, they fell foul on him who 
 protected him. It is certain that there was one Sosthenes that was a 
 friend of Paul, and well known at Corinth; it is likely he was a 
 minister, for Paul calls him his brother, and joins him with himself in 
 his first epistle to the church at Corinth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:1">1 Cor. i. 1</A>),
 
 as he does Timothy in his second, and it is probable that this was he; 
 he is said to be a <I>ruler of the synagogue,</I> either joint-ruler 
 with Crispus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 or a ruler of one synagogue, as Crispus was of another. As for the 
 Greeks that abused him, it is very probable that they were either 
 Hellenist Jews, or Jewish Greeks, those that joined with the Jews in 
 opposing the gospel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:4,6"><I>v.</I> 4, 6</A>),

 and that the native Jews put them on to do it, thinking it would in 
 them be less offensive. They were so enraged against Paul that they
 beat Sosthenes; and so enraged against Gallio, because he would not 
 countenance the prosecution, that they beat him before the 
 judgment-seat, whereby they did, in effect, tell him that they cared 
 not for him; if he would not be their executioner, they would be their 
 own judges. 

 2. The court put no less a contempt upon the cause, and the persons
 too. But <I>Gallio cared for none of these things.</I> If by this be 
 meant that he cared not for the affronts of bad men, it was 
 commendable. While he steadily adhered to the laws and rules of equity, 
 he might despise their contempts; but, if it be meant (as I think it 
 is) that he concerned not himself for the abuses done to good men, it 
 carries his indifference too far, and gives us but an ill character of 
 him. Here is <I>wickedness</I> done <I>in the place of judgment</I> 
 (which Solomon complains of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16">Eccl. iii. 16</A>),

 and nothing done to discountenance and suppress it. Gallio, as a judge, 
 ought to have protected Sosthenes, and restrained and punished the 
 Greeks that assaulted him. For a man to be mobbed in the street or in 
 the market, perhaps, may not be easily helped; but to be so in his 
 court, the judgment-seat, the court sitting and not concerned at it, is 
 an evidence that <I>truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot 
 enter;</I> for <I>he that departeth from evil maketh himself a 
 prey,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:14,15">Isa. lix. 14, 15</A>.

 Those that see and hear of the sufferings of God's people, and have no
 sympathy with them, nor concern for them, do not pity and pray for the, 
 it being all one to them whether the interests of religion sink or 
 swim, are of the spirit of Gallio here, who, when a good man was abused 
 before his face, <I>cared for none of these things;</I> like those that 
 were <I>at ease in Zion,</I> and <I>were not grieved for the affliction 
 of Joseph</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:6">Amos vi. 6</A>),

 like <I>the king and Haman, that sat down to drink when the city
 Shushan was perplexed,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18 And Paul <I>after this</I> tarried <I>there</I> yet a good while, and
 then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into
 Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn <I>his</I> head

 entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

 consented not;

 this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto
 you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.

 strengthening all the disciples.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Paul in motion, as we have had him at Corinth for some 
 time at rest, but in both busy, very busy, in the service of Christ; if 
 he sat still, if he went about, still it was to do good. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Paul's departure from Corinth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 1. He did not go away till some time after the trouble he met with 
 there; from other places he had departed when the storm arose, but not 
 from Corinth, because there it had no sooner risen than it fell again.
 Some tell us that Gallio did privately countenance Paul, and took him 
 into his favour, and that this occasioned a correspondence between Paul 
 and Seneca, Gallio's brother, which some of the ancients speak of. 
 <I>After this he tarried there yet a good while,</I> some think, beyond 
 <I>the year and a half</I> mentioned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 While he found he laboured not in vain, he continued labouring. 

 2. When he went, he took leave of the brethren solemnly, and with much 
 affection, with suitable comforts and counsels, and prayers at parting, 
 commending what was good, reproving what was otherwise, and giving them 
 necessary cautions against the wiles of the false apostles; and his 
 farewell sermon would leave impressions upon them.

 3. He took <I>with him Priscilla and Aquila,</I> because they had a 
 mind to accompany him; for they seemed disposed to remove, and not 
 inclined to stay long at a place, a disposition which may arise from a 
 good principle, and have good effects, and therefore ought not to be 
 condemned in others, though it ought to be suspected in ourselves.
 There was a great friendship contracted between them and Paul, and 
 therefore, when he went, they begged to go along with him.

 4. At Cenchrea, which was hard by Corinth, the port where those that
 went to sea from Corinth took ship, either Paul or Aquila (for the 
 original does not determine which) had his head shaved, to discharge 
 himself from the vow of a Nazarite: <I>Having shorn his head at 
 Cenchrea; for he had a vow.</I> Those that lived in Judea were, in such 
 a case, bound to do it at the temple: but those who lived in other 
 countries might do it in other places. The Nazarite's head was to be 
 shaved when either his consecration was accidentally polluted, in which 
 case he must begin again, or <I>when the days of his separation were 
 fulfilled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:9,13:18">Num. vi. 9; xiii. 18</A>),

 which, we suppose, was the case here. Some throw it upon Aquila, who
 was a Jew 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and retained perhaps more of his Judaism than was convenient; but I see 
 no harm in admitting it concerning Paul, for concerning him we must 
 admit the same thing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:24,26"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 24, 26</A>),

 not only in compliance for a time with the Jews, to whom he <I>became
 as a Jew</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:20">1 Cor. ix. 20</A>),

 <I>that he might win upon them,</I> but because the vow of the
 Nazarites, though ceremonial, and as such ready to vanish away, had yet 
 a great deal of moral and very pious significance, and therefore was 
 fit to die the last of all the Jewish ceremonies. The Nazarites are 
 joined with the prophets 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:11">Amos ii. 11</A>),

 and were very much <I>the glory of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:7">Lam. iv. 7</A>),

 and therefore it is not strange if Paul bound himself for some time 
 with the vow of a Nazarite from wine and strong drink, and from being 
 trimmed, to recommend himself to the Jews; and from this he now 
 discharged himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Paul's calling <I>at Ephesus,</I> which was the metropolis of the 
 Lesser Asia, and a sea-port. 

 1. <I>There he left Aquila and Priscilla;</I> not only because they
 would be but burdensome to him in his journey, but because they might 
 be serviceable to the interests of the gospel at Ephesus. Paul intended 
 shortly to settle there for some time, and he left Aquila and Priscilla 
 there in the mean time, for the same end as Christ sent his disciple 
 before to every place where he himself would come, to prepare his way. 
 Aquila and Priscilla might, by private conversation, being very 
 intelligent judicious Christians, dispose the minds of many to give 
 Paul, when he should come among them, a favourable reception, and to 
 understand his preaching; therefore he calls them his <I>helpers in 
 Christ Jesus,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:3">Rom. xvi. 3</A>.

 2. There he preached <I>to the Jews in their synagogue;</I> though he 
 did but call there in his journey, yet he would not go without giving 
 them a sermon. <I>He entered into the synagogue,</I> not as a hearer,
 but as a preacher, for <I>there he reasoned with the Jews.</I> Though 
 he had abandoned the Jews at Corinth, who opposed themselves, and 
 blasphemed, yet he did not, for their sakes, decline the synagogues of 
 the Jews in other places, but still made the first offer of the gospel 
 to them. We must not condemn a whole body or denomination of men, for 
 the sake of some that conduct themselves ill.

 3. The Jews at Ephesus were so far from driving Paul away that they
 courted his stay with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>They desired him to tarry longer with them,</I> to instruct them, in
 the gospel of Christ. These were more noble, and better bred, than 
 those Jews at Corinth, and other places, and it was a sign that God had 
 not quite cast away his people, but had a remnant among them. 

 4. Paul would not stay with them now: <I>He consented not; but bade
 them farewell.</I> He had further to go; he <I>must by all means keep 
 this feast at Jerusalem;</I> not that he thought himself bound in duty 
 to it (he knew the laws of the feasts were no longer binding), but he 
 had business t Jerusalem (whatever it was) which would be best done at 
 the time of the feast, when there was a general rendezvous of all the 
 Jews from all parts; which of the feasts it was we are not told, 
 probably it was the passover, which was the most eminent. 

 5. He intimated his purpose, after this journey, to come and spend some
 time at Ephesus, being encouraged by their kind invitation to hope that 
 he should do good among them. It is good to have opportunities in 
 reserve, when one good work is over to have another to apply ourselves 
 to: <I>I will return again to you,</I> but he inserts that necessary 
 proviso, <I>if God will.</I> Our times are in God's hand; we purpose, 
 but he disposes; and therefore we must make all our promises with 
 submission to the will of God. <I>If the Lord will, we shall live, and 
 do this or that. I will return again to you, if the Spirit suffer 
 me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:7"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 7</A>);

 this was included in Paul's case; not only if providence permit, but if
 God do not otherwise direct my motions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Paul's visit to Jerusalem; a short visit it was, but it served as 
 a token of respect to that truly mother-church. 

 1. He came by sea to the port that lay next to Jerusalem. <I>He sailed
 from Ephesus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>and landed at C&aelig;sarea,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 He chose to go by sea, for expedition and for safety, and that he might
 <I>see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.</I> Joppa 
 had been the port for Jerusalem, but Herod having improved 
 C&aelig;sarea, and the port at Joppa being dangerous, that was 
 generally made use of. 

 2. He went <I>up, and saluted the church,</I> by which, I think, is
 plainly meant the church at Jerusalem, which is emphatically called 
 <I>the church,</I> because there the Christian church began,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:4"><I>ch.</I> xv. 4</A>.

 Paul thought it requisite to show himself among them, that they might
 not think his success among them, that they might not think his success 
 among the Gentiles had made him think himself either above them or 
 estranged from them, or that the honour God had put upon him made him 
 unmindful of the honour he owed to them. His going to salute the church 
 at Jerusalem intimates, 

 (1.) That it was a very friendly visit that he made them, in pure 
 kindness, to enquire into their state, and to testify his hearty 
 good-will to them. Note, The increase of our new friends should not
 make us forget our old ones, but it should be a pleasure to good men, 
 and good ministers, to revive former acquaintance. The ministers at 
 Jerusalem were constant residents, Paul was a constant itinerant; but 
 he took care to keep up a good correspondence with them, that they 
 might rejoice with him in his going out, and he might rejoice with them 
 in their tents, and they might both congratulate and wish well to one 
 another's comfort and success. 

 (2.) That it was but a short visit. He went <I>up, and saluted 
 them,</I> perhaps <I>with the holy kiss,</I> and made no stay among 
 them. It was designed but for a transient interview, and yet Paul 
 undertook this long journey for that. This is not the world we are to 
 be together in. God's people are <I>the salt of the earth,</I>
 dispersed and scattered; yet it is good to see one another sometimes, 
 if it be but to see one another, that we may confirm mutual love, may 
 the better keep up our spiritual communion with one another at a 
 distance, and may long the more for that heavenly Jerusalem in which we 
 hope to be together for ever.</P>

 IV. His return through those countries where he had formerly preached
 the gospel. 

 1. <I>He went and spent some time in Antioch,</I> among his old friends
 there, whence he was first sent out to preach among the Gentiles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:1"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 1</A>.

 He went down to Antioch, to refresh himself with the sight and
 conversation of the ministers there; and a very good refreshment it is
 to a faithful minister to have for awhile the society of his brethren;
 for, <I>as iron sharpeneth iron, so doth a man the countenance of his
 friend.</I> Paul's coming to Antioch would bring to remembrance the
 former days, which would furnish him with matter for fresh
 thanksgiving. 

 2. <I>Thence he went over the country of Galatia and Phrygia in 
 order,</I> where he had preached the gospel, and planted churches, 
 which, though very briefly mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:6"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 6</A>),

 was yet a glorious work, as appears by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:14,15">Gal. iv. 14, 15</A>,

 where Paul speaks of his preaching the gospel to the Galatians at the
 first, and their receiving him <I>as an angel of God.</I> These country 
 churches (for such they were 
 
 [<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:2">Gal. i. 2</A>],

 and we read not of any city in Galatia where a church was) Paul visited 
 <I>in order</I> as they lay, watering what he had been instrumental to 
 plant, and <I>strengthening all the disciples.</I> His very coming 
 among them, and owning them, were a great strengthening to them and 
 their ministers. Paul's countenancing them was encouraging them; but 
 that was not all: he preached that to them which strengthened them, 
 which confirmed their faith in Christ, their resolutions for Christ, 
 and their pious affections to him. Disciples need to be strengthened, 
 for they are compassed about with infirmity; ministers must do what 
 they can to strengthen them, to strengthen them all, by directing them 
 to Christ, and bringing them to live upon him, whose strength is 
 perfected in their weakness, and who is himself their strength and 
 song.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an
 eloquent man, <I>and</I> mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
 &nbsp; 25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
 fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things
 of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
 &nbsp; 26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when
 Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto <I>them,</I> and
 expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
 &nbsp; 27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren
 wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was
 come, helped them much which had believed through grace:
 &nbsp; 28 For he mightily convinced the Jews, <I>and that</I> publicly,
 showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The sacred history leaves Paul upon his travels, and goes here to meet 
 Apollos at Ephesus, and to give us some account of him, which was 
 necessary to our understanding some passages in Paul's epistles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is an account of his character, when he came to Ephesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was <I>a Jew, born at Alexandria</I> in Egypt, but of Jewish 
 parents; for there were abundance of Jews in that city, since the 
 dispersion of the people, as it was foretold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:68">Deut. xxviii. 68</A>):

 <I>The Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again.</I> His name was not 
 <I>Apollo,</I> the name of one of the heathen gods, but <I>Apollos,</I> 
 some think the same with <I>Apelles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:10">Rom. xvi. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was a man of excellent good parts, and well fitted for public 
 service. He was <I>an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures</I> of 
 the Old Testament, in the knowledge of which he was, as a Jew, brought 
 up. 

 (1.) He had a great command of language: he was <I>an eloquent man;</I> 
 he was <B><I>aner logios</I></B>--<I>a prudent man,</I> so some; <I>a
 learned man,</I> so others; <I>historiarum peritus--a good
 historian,</I> which is an excellent qualification for the ministry: he 
 was one that could speak well, so it properly signifies; he was <I>an 
 oracle of a man;</I> he was famous for speaking pertinently and 
 closely, fully and fluently, upon any subject. 

 (2.) He had a great command of scripture-language, and this was the 
 eloquence he was remarkable for. He <I>came to Ephesus,</I> being 
 <I>mighty in the scriptures,</I> so the words are placed; having an 
 excellent faculty of expounding scripture, he came to Ephesus, which 
 was a public place, to trade with that talent, for the honour of God 
 and the good of many. He was not only ready in the scriptures, able to 
 quote texts off-hand, and repeat them, and tell you where to find them 
 (many of the carnal Jews were so, who were therefore said to have the 
 <I>form of knowledge,</I> and <I>the letter of the law</I>); but he was 
 <I>mighty in the scriptures.</I> He understood the sense and meaning of 
 them, he knew how to make use of them and to apply them, how to reason 
 out of the scriptures, and to reason strongly; a convincing, 
 commanding, confirming power went along with all his expositions and 
 applications of the scripture. It is probable he had given proof of his 
 knowledge of the scriptures, and his abilities in them, in many 
 synagogues of the Jews.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He <I>was instructed in the way of the Lord;</I> that is, he had 
 some acquaintance with the doctrine of Christ, had obtained some 
 general notions of the gospel and the principles of Christianity, 
 <I>that Jesus is the Christ,</I> and <I>that prophet that should come 
 into the world;</I> the first notice of this would be readily embraced 
 by one that was so mighty in the scripture as Apollos was, and 
 therefore understood <I>the signs of the times.</I> He <I>was 
 instructed,</I> <B><I>katechemenos</I></B>--<I>he was catechised</I> (so
 the word is), either by his parents or by ministers; he was taught 
 something of Christ and the way of salvation by him. Those that are to 
 teach others must first be themselves taught the word of the Lord, not 
 only to talk of it, but to walk in it. It is not enough to have our 
 tongues tuned to the word of the Lord, but we must have our feet 
 directed into the way of the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Yet he <I>knew only the baptism of John;</I> he was instructed in 
 the gospel of Christ as far as John's ministry would carry him, and no 
 further; he knew <I>the preparing of the way of the Lord</I> by <I>that 
 voice crying in the wilderness,</I> rather than the way of the Lord 
 itself. We cannot but think he had heard of Christ's death and 
 resurrection, but he was not let into the mystery of them, had not had 
 opportunity of conversing with any of the apostles since the pouring 
 out of the Spirit; or he had himself been baptized <I>only with the 
 baptism of John,</I> but was not baptized with the Holy Ghost, as the 
 disciples were at the day of pentecost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have here the employment and improvement of his gifts at 
 Ephesus; he came thither, seeking opportunities of doing and getting 
 good, and he found both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He there made a very good use of his gifts in public. He came, 
 probably, recommended to the synagogue of the Jews as a fit man to be a 
 teacher there, and according to the light he had, and <I>the measure of 
 the gift given to him,</I> he was willing to be employed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):
 
 <I>Being fervent in the Spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the 
 things of the Lord.</I> Though he had not the miraculous gifts of the 
 Spirit, as the apostles had, he made use of the gifts he had; <I>for 
 the dispensation of the Spirit,</I> whatever the measure of it is, 
 <I>is given to every man to profit withal.</I> And our Savior, by a 
 parable, designed to teach his ministers that though they had but one 
 talent they must not bury that. We have seen how Apollos was qualified 
 with a good head and a good tongue: he was <I>an eloquent man, and 
 mighty in the scriptures;</I> he had laid in a good stock of useful 
 knowledge, and had an excellent faculty of communicating it. Let us now 
 see what he had further to recommend him as a preacher; and his example 
 is recommended to the intimation of all preachers. 

 (1.) He was a lively affectionate preacher; as he had a good head, so 
 he had a good heart; he was <I>fervent in Spirit.</I> He had in him a 
 great deal of divine fire as well as divine light, was burning as well 
 as shining. He was full of zeal for the glory of God, and the salvation 
 of precious souls. This appeared both in his forwardness to preach
 when he was called to it by <I>the rulers of the synagogue,</I> and in 
 his fervency in his preaching. He preached as one in earnest, and that 
 had his heart in his work. What a happy composition was here! Many are 
 fervent in spirit, but are weak in knowledge, in 
 scripture-knowledge--have far to seek for proper words and are full of
 improper ones; and, on the other hand, many are eloquent enough, and 
 mighty in the scriptures, and learned, and judicious, but they have no 
 life or fervency. Here was a complete <I>man of God, thoroughly 
 furnished for his work;</I> both eloquent and fervent, full both of 
 divine knowledge and of divine affections. 

 (2.) He was an industrious laborious preacher. <I>He spoke and taught 
 diligently.</I> He took pains in his preaching, what he delivered was 
 elaborate; and he did not offer that to God, or to the synagogue, that 
 either cost nothing or cost <I>him</I> nothing. He first worked it upon 
 his own heart, and then laboured to impress it on those he preached to: 
 <I>he taught diligently,</I> <B><I>akribos</I></B>--<I>accurately,
 exactly;</I> every thing he said was well-weighed. 

 (3.) He was an evangelical preacher. Though he knew only the baptism of 
 John, yet that was the beginning of the gospel of Christ, and to that 
 he kept close; for he taught the things of the Lord, of the Lord 
 Christ, the things that tended to make way for him, and to set him up. 
 The things pertaining to the kingdom of the Messiah were the subjects 
 he chose to insist upon; not the things of the ceremonial law, though 
 those would be pleasing to his Jewish auditors; not the things of the 
 Gentile philosophy, though he could have discoursed very well on those 
 things; but the things of the Lord. 

 (4.) He was a courageous preacher: <I>He began to speak boldly in the 
 synagogue,</I> as one who, having put confidence in God, did not fear 
 the face of man; he spoke as one that knew the truth of what he said, 
 and had no doubt of it, and that knew the worth of what he said and was 
 not afraid to suffer for it; <I>in the synagogue,</I> where the Jews 
 not only were present, but had power, there he preached the things of 
 God, which he knew they were prejudiced against.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He there made a good increase of his gifts in private, not so much 
 in study, as in conversation with <I>Aquila and Priscilla.</I> If Paul 
 or some other apostle or evangelist had been at Ephesus, he would have 
 instructed him; but, for want of better help, <I>Aquila and 
 Priscilla</I> (who were tent-makers) <I>expounded to him the way of God 
 more perfectly.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) Aquila and Priscilla heard him preach in the synagogue. Though in 
 knowledge he was much inferior to them, yet, having excellent gifts for 
 public service, they encouraged his ministry, by a diligent and 
 constant attendance upon it. Thus young ministers, that are hopeful, 
 should be countenanced by grown Christians, for it becomes them to 
 fulfil all righteousness. 

 (2.) Finding him defective in his knowledge of Christianity, <I>they 
 took him to them,</I> to lodge in the same house with them, and 
 <I>expounded to him the way of God,</I> the way of salvation by Jesus 
 Christ, <I>more perfectly.</I> They did not take occasion from what 
 they observed of his deficiency either to despise him themselves, or to 
 disparage him to others; did not call him a young raw preacher, not fit 
 to come into a pulpit, but considered the disadvantages he had laboured 
 under, as knowing only the baptism of John; and, having themselves got 
 great knowledge in the truths of the gospel by their long intimate 
 conversation with Paul, they communicated what they knew to him, and 
 gave him a clear, distinct, and methodical account of those things 
 which before he had but confused notions of.

 [1.] See here an instance of that which Christ has promised, that <I>to 
 him that hath shall be given;</I> he that has, and uses what he has, 
 shall have more. He that diligently traded with the talent he had 
 doubled it quickly. 

 [2.] See an instance of truly Christian charity in Aquila and 
 Priscilla; they did good according to their ability. Aquila, though a 
 man of great knowledge, yet did no undertake to speak in the synagogue, 
 because he had not such gifts for public work as Apollos had; but he 
 furnished Apollos with matter, and then left him to clothe it with 
 acceptable words. Instructing young Christians and young ministers 
 privately in conversation, who mean well, and perform well, as far as 
 they go, is a piece of very good service, both to them and to the 
 church.

 [3.] See an instance of great humility in Apollos. He was a very bright
 young man, of great parts and learning, newly come from the university, 
 a popular preacher, and one mightily cried up and followed; and yet, 
 finding that Aquila and Priscilla were judicious serious Christians, 
 that could speak intelligently and experimentally of the things of God, 
 though they were but mechanics, poor tent-makers, he was glad to 
 receive instructions from them, to be shown by them his defects and 
 mistakes, and to have his mistakes rectified by them, and his 
 deficiencies made up. Young scholars may gain a great deal by converse 
 with old Christians, as young students in the law may by old 
 practitioners. Apollos, though he <I>was instructed in the way of the
 Lord,</I> did not rest in the knowledge he had attained, nor thought he 
 understood Christianity as well as any man (which proud conceited young 
 men are apt to do), but was willing to have it expounded to him more 
 perfectly. Those that know much should covet to know more, and what
 they know to know it better, pressing forward towards perfection. 

 [4.] Here is an instance of a good woman, though not permitted to speak 
 in the church or in the synagogue, yet doing good with the knowledge 
 God had given her in private converse. Paul will have <I>the aged women 
 to be teachers of good things</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:3,4">Tit. ii. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is his preferment to the service of the church of Corinth, 
 which was a larger sphere of usefulness than Ephesus at present was. 
 Paul had set wheels a-going in Achaia and particularly at Corinth, the 
 county-town. Many were stirred up by his preaching to receive the 
 gospel, and they needed to be confirmed; and many were likewise 
 irritated to oppose the gospel, and they needed to be confuted. Paul 
 was gone, was called away to other work, and now there was a fair 
 occasion in this vacancy for Apollos to set in, who was fitted rather 
 to water than to plant, to build up those that were within than to 
 bring in those that were without. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His call to this service, not by a vision, as Paul was called to 
 Macedonia, no, nor so much as by the invitation of those he was to go 
 to; but, 

 (1.) He himself inclined to go: <I>He was disposed to pass into 
 Achaia;</I> having heard of the state of the churches there, he had a 
 mind to try what good he could do among them. Though there were those 
 there who were eminent for spiritual gifts, yet Apollos thought there 
 might be some work for him, and God disposed his mind that way.

 (2.) His friends encouraged him to go, and approved of his purpose; 
 and, he being a perfect stranger there, they gave him a testimonial or 
 letters of recommendation, exhorting the disciples in Achaia to 
 entertain him and employ him. In this way, among others, the communion 
 of churches is kept up, by the recommending of members and ministers to 
 each other, when ministers, as Apollos here, are disposed to remove.
 Though those at Ephesus had a great loss of his labours, they did not 
 grudge those in Achaia the benefit of them; but, on the contrary, used 
 their interest in them to introduce him; for the churches of Christ, 
 though they are many, yet they are one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His success in this service, which both ways answered his intention 
 and expectation; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Believers were greatly edified, and those that had received the 
 gospel were very much confirmed: <I>He helped those much who had 
 believed through grace.</I> Note, 

 [1.] Those who believe in Christ, it is through grace that they 
 believe; it is <I>not of themselves, it is God's gift to them;</I> it 
 is his work in them. 

 [2.] Those who through grace do believe, yet still have need of help; 
 as long as they are here in this world there are remainders of 
 unbelief, and something lacking in their faith to be perfected, and the 
 work of faith to be fulfilled.

 [3.] Faithful ministers are capable of being in many ways helpful to 
 those who through grace do believe, and it is their business to help 
 them, to help them much; and, when a divine power goes along with them, 
 they will be helpful to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Unbelievers were greatly mortified. Their objections were fully 
 answered, the folly and sophistry of their arguments were discovered, 
 so that they had nothing to say in defence of the opposition they made 
 to the gospel; their mouths were stopped, and their faces filled with 
 shame 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>He mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly,</I> before the 
 people; he did it, <B><I>eutonos</I></B>--<I>earnestly,</I> and with a
 great deal of vehemence; he took pains to do it; his heart was upon it, 
 as one that was truly desirous both to serve the cause of Christ and to 
 save the souls of men. He did it effectually and to universal 
 satisfaction. He did it <I>levi negotio--with facility.</I> The case
 was so plain, and the arguments were so strong on Christ's side, that 
 it was an easy matter to baffle all that the Jews could say against it. 
 Though they were so fierce, yet their cause was so weak that he made 
 nothing of their opposition. Now that which he aimed to convince them 
 of was <I>that Jesus is the Christ,</I> that he is <I>the Messiah 
 promised to the fathers, who should come,</I> and they were to look for 
 not other. If the Jews were but convinced of this--that Jesus is
 Christ, even their own law would teach them to hear him. Note, The 
 business of ministers is to preach Christ: <I>We preach not ourselves, 
 but Christ Jesus the Lord.</I> The way he took to convince them was 
 <I>by the scriptures;</I> thence he fetched his arguments; for the Jews 
 owned the scriptures to be of divine authority, and it was easy for 
 him, who was mighty in the scriptures, from them to show that Jesus is 
 the Christ. Note, Ministers must be able not only to preach the truth,
 but to prove it and defend it, and to convince gainsayers with meekness 
 and yet with power, instructing those that oppose themselves; and this 
 is real service to the church.</P>
