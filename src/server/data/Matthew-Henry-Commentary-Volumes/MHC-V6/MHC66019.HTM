 In this chapter we have, 

 I. A further account of the triumphant song of angels and saints for
 the fall of Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. The marriage between Christ and the church proclaimed and perfected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:5-10">ver. 5-10</A>.

 III. Another warlike expedition of the glorious head and husband of
 the church, with the success of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:10-21">ver. 10</A>,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And after these things I heard a great voice of much people
 in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour,
 and power, unto the Lord our God:
 &nbsp; 2  For true and righteous <I>are</I> his judgments: for he hath
 judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her
 fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her
 hand.
 &nbsp; 3  And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever
 and ever.
 &nbsp; 4  And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down
 and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen;
 Alleluia.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The fall of Babylon being fixed, finished, and declared to be 
 irrecoverable in the foregoing chapter, this begins with a holy triumph 
 over her, in pursuance of the order given forth: <I>Rejoice over her, 
 thou heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, </I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:20"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 20</A>.

 They now gladly answer the call; and here you have,

 1. The form of their thanksgiving, in that heavenly and most
 comprehensive word, <I>Alleluia, praise you the Lord:</I> with this
 they begin, with this they go on, and with this they end 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 their prayers are now turned into praises, their hosannas end in 
 halleluias.

 2. The matter of their thanksgiving: they praise him for the truth of
 his word, and the righteousness of his providential conduct, especially 
 in this great event--the ruin of Babylon, which had been a mother, 
 nurse, and nest of idolatry, lewdness, and cruelty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 for which signal example of divine justice they ascribe <I>salvation, 
 and glory, and honour, and power, unto our God.</I> 

 3. The effect of these their praises: when the angels and saints cried
 <I>Alleluia,</I> her fire burned more fiercely and <I>her smoke 
 ascended for ever and ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The surest way to have our deliverances continued and completed is to 
 give God the glory of what he has done for us. Praising God for what
 we have is praying in the most effectual manner for what is yet further 
 to be done for us; the praises of the saints blow up the fire of God's 
 wrath against the common enemy. 

 4. The blessed harmony between the angels and the saints in this
 triumphant song,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The churches and their ministers take the melodious sound from the 
 angels, and repeat it; falling down, and worshipping God, they cry, 
 <I>Amen, Alleluia.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God,
 all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.
 &nbsp; 6  And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as
 the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings,
 saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
 &nbsp; 7  Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the
 marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself
 ready.
 &nbsp; 8  And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine
 linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness
 of saints.
 &nbsp; 9  And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed <I>are</I> they which are
 called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto
 me, These are the true sayings of God.
 &nbsp; 10  And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,
 See <I>thou do it</I> not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren
 that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony
 of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The triumphant song being ended, and epithalamium, or marriage-song, 
 begins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The concert of heavenly music. The chorus was large and loud, <I>as 
 the voice of many waters and of mighty thunderings.</I> God is fearful 
 in praises. There is no discord in heaven; the morning stars sing 
 together; no jarring string, nor key untuned, but pure and perfect 
 melody.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The occasion of this song; and that is the reign and dominion of 
 that omnipotent God who has <I>redeemed his church by his own 
 blood,</I> and is now in a more public manner betrothing her to 
 himself: <I>The marriage of the Lamb has come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Some think this refers to the conversion of the Jews, which they 
 suppose will succeed the fall of Babylon; others, to the general 
 resurrection: the former seems more probable. Now, 

 1. You have here a description of the bride, how she appeared; not in
 the gay and gaudy dress of the mother of harlots, but <I>in fine linen, 
 clean and white,</I> which <I>is the righteousness of saints;</I> in 
 the robes of Christ's righteousness, both imputed for justification and 
 imparted for sanctification--the <I>stola,</I> the <I>white robe</I> of 
 absolution, adoption, and enfranchisement, and the white robe of purity 
 and universal holiness. She had <I>washed her robes and made them
 white in the blood of the Lamb;</I> and these her nuptial ornaments she 
 did not purchase by any price of her own, but received them as the gift 
 and grant of her blessed Lord. 

 2. The marriage-feast, which, though not particularly described (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:4">Matt. xxii. 4</A>),

 yet is declared to be such as would make all those happy who were
 called to it, so called as to accept the invitation, a feast made up of 
 the promises of the gospel, <I>the true sayings of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 These promises, opened, applied, sealed, and earnested by <I>the Spirit 
 of God,</I> in holy eucharistical ordinances, are the marriage-feast; 
 and the whole collective body of all those who partake of this feast is 
 the bride, <I>the Lamb's wife;</I> they eat into one body, and drink 
 into one Spirit, and are not mere spectators or guests, but coalesce 
 into the espoused party, the mystical body of Christ. 

 3. The transport of joy which the apostle felt in himself at this
 vision. <I>He fell down at the feet of the angel, to worship him,</I> 
 supposing him to be more than a creature, or having his thoughts at the 
 present overpowered by the vehemency of his affections. Here observe,

 (1.) What honour he offered to the angel: <I>He fell at his feet, to 
 worship him;</I> this prostration was a part of external worship, it 
 was a posture of proper adoration. 

 (2.) How the angel refused it, and this was with some resentment: 
 "<I>See thou do it not;</I> have a care what thou doest, thou art doing 
 a wrong thing." 

 (3.) He gave a very good reason for his refusal: "<I>I am thy 
 fellow-servant, and of thy brethren which have the testimony of 
 Jesus</I>--I am a creature, thine equal in office, though not in 
 nature; <I>I,</I> as an angel and messenger of God, <I>have the 
 testimony of Jesus,</I> a charge to be a witness for him and to testify 
 concerning him, and thou, as an apostle, having <I>the Spirit of 
 prophecy,</I> hast the same testimony to give in; and therefore we are 
 in this brethren and fellow-servants." 

 (4.) He directs him to the true and only object of religious worship; 
 namely, God: "<I>Worship God,</I> and him alone." This fully condemns 
 both the practice of the papists in worshipping the elements of bread 
 and wine, and saints, and angels, and the practice of those Socinians 
 and Arians who do not believe that Christ is truly and by nature God, 
 and yet pay him religious worship; and this shows what wretched 
 fig-leaves all their evasions and excuses are which they offer in their 
 own vindication: they stand hereby convicted of idolatry by a messenger 
 from heaven.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he
 that sat upon him <I>was</I> called Faithful and True, and in
 righteousness he doth judge and make war.
 &nbsp; 12  His eyes <I>were</I> as a flame of fire, and on his head <I>were</I>
 many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he
 himself.
 &nbsp; 13  And he <I>was</I> clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his
 name is called The Word of God.
 &nbsp; 14  And the armies <I>which were</I> in heaven followed him upon
 white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
 &nbsp; 15  And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he
 should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of
 iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath
 of Almighty God.
 &nbsp; 16  And he hath on <I>his</I> vesture and on his thigh a name
 written, 
 K<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ING OF KINGS, AND</B></FONT>
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD OF LORDS.</B></FONT>
 &nbsp; 17  And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a
 loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of
 heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of
 the great God;
 &nbsp; 18  That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of
 captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses,
 and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all <I>men, both</I>
 free and bond, both small and great.
 &nbsp; 19  And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their
 armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the
 horse, and against his army.
 &nbsp; 20  And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
 wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had
 received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his
 image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning
 with brimstone.
 &nbsp; 21  And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat
 upon the horse, which <I>sword</I> proceeded out of his mouth: and all
 the fowls were filled with their flesh.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 No sooner was the marriage solemnized between Christ and his church by 
 the conversion of the Jews than the glorious head and husband of the 
 church is called out to a new expedition, which seems to be the great 
 battle that was to be fought at Armageddon, foretold 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:16"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 16</A>.

 And here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The description of the great Commander, 

 1. By the seat of his empire; and that is <I>heaven;</I> his throne is
 there, and his power and authority are heavenly and divine. 

 2. His equipage: he is again described as sitting <I>on a white
 horse,</I> to show the equity of the cause, and certainty of success.
 
 3. His attributes: he is <I>faithful and true</I> to his covenant and
 promise, he is righteous in all his judicial and military proceedings, 
 he has a penetrating insight into all the strength and stratagems of 
 his enemies, he has a large and extensive dominion, many crowns, for he 
 is <I>King of kings, and Lord of lords.</I> 

 4. His armour; and that is <I>a vesture dipped in blood,</I> either his
 own blood, by which he purchased this mediatorial power, or the blood 
 of his enemies, over whom he has always prevailed.

 5. His name: <I>The Word of God,</I> a name that none fully knows but
 himself, only this we know, that this <I>Word was God manifest in the 
 flesh;</I> but his perfections are incomprehensible by any 
 creature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The army which he commands 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 a very large one, made up of many armies; angels and saints followed 
 his conduct, and resembled him in their equipage, and in their armour 
 of purity and righteousness--chosen, and called, and faithful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The weapons of his warfare--<I>A sharp sword</I> proceeding from
 <I>his mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 with which <I>he smites the nations,</I> either the threatenings of the 
 written word, which now he is going to execute, or rather his word of 
 command calling on his followers to take a just revenge on his and 
 their enemies, who are now put into the wine-press of the wrath of God, 
 to be trodden under foot by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The ensigns of his authority, his coat of arms--<I>a name written on
 his vesture and thigh, King of kings, and Lord of lords,</I> asserting 
 his authority and power, and the cause of the quarrel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. An invitation given <I>to the fowls of heaven,</I> that they should 
 come and see the battle, and share in the spoil and pillage of the 
 field 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>),

 intimating that this great decisive engagement should leave the enemies 
 of the church a feast for the birds of prey, and that all the world 
 should have cause to rejoice in the issue of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The battle joined. The enemy falls on with great fury, headed by 
 <I>the beast, and the kings of the earth;</I> the powers of earth and
 hell gathered, to make their utmost effort, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:19">v. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The victory gained by the great and glorious head of the church: 
 <I>The beast and the false prophet,</I> the leaders of the army, are 
 taken prisoners, both he who led them by power and he who led them by 
 policy and falsehood; these are taken and <I>cast into the burning 
 lake,</I> made incapable of molesting the church of God any more; and 
 their followers, whether officers or common soldiers, are given up to
 military execution, and made a feast for <I>the fowls of heaven.</I> 
 Though the divine vengeance will chiefly fall upon <I>the beast, and 
 the false prophet,</I> yet it will be no excuse to those who fight 
 under their banner that they only followed their leaders and obeyed 
 their command; since they would fight for them, they must fall and 
 perish with them. <I>Be wise now therefore, O you kings, be instructed, 
 you rulers of the earth; kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish 
 from the way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:10,12">Ps. ii. 10, 12</A>.</P>
