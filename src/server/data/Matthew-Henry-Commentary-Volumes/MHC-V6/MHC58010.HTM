 The apostle knew very well that the Hebrews, to whom he wrote, were 
 strangely fond of the Levitical dispensation, and therefore he fills 
 his mouth with arguments to wean them from it; and in order thereto 
 proceeds in this chapter, 

 I. To lay low the whole of that priesthood and sacrifice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. He raises and exalts the priesthood of Christ very high, that he
 might effectually recommend him and his gospel to them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:7-18">ver. 7-18</A>.

 III. He shows to believers the honours and dignities of their state,
 and calls them to suitable duties, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:19-39">ver. 19, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  For the law having a shadow of good things to come, <I>and</I> not
 the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices
 which they offered year by year continually make the comers
 thereunto perfect.
 &nbsp; 2  For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because
 that the worshippers once purged should have had no more
 conscience of sins.
 &nbsp; 3  But in those <I>sacrifices there is</I> a remembrance again <I>made</I>
 of sins every year.
 &nbsp; 4  For <I>it is</I> not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
 should take away sins.
 &nbsp; 5  Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
 and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:
 &nbsp; 6  In burnt offerings and <I>sacrifices</I> for sin thou hast had no
 pleasure.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle, by the direction of the Spirit of God, sets himself 
 to lay low the Levitical dispensation; for though it was of divine 
 appointment, and very excellent and useful in its time and place, yet, 
 when it was set up in competition with Christ, to whom it was only 
 designed to lead the people, it was very proper and necessary to show 
 the weakness and imperfection of it, which the apostle does 
 effectually, from several arguments. As,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the law had a shadow, and but a shadow, of good things to come; 
 and who would dote upon a shadow, though of good things, especially 
 when the substance has come? Observe, 

 1. The things of Christ and the gospel are good things; they are the
 best things; they are best in themselves, and the best for us: they are 
 realities of an excellent nature. 

 2. These good things were, under the Old Testament, good things to
 come, not clearly discovered, nor fully enjoyed. 

 3. That the Jews then had but the shadow of the good things of Christ,
 some adumbrations of them; we under the gospel have the substance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the law was not the very image of the good things to come. An 
 image is an exact draught of the thing represented thereby. The law did 
 not go so far, but was only a shadow, as the image of a person in a 
 looking-glass is a much more perfect representation than his shadow 
 upon the wall. The law was a very rough draught of the great design of 
 divine grace, and therefore not to be so much doted on.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The legal sacrifices, being offered year by year, could never make 
 the comers thereunto perfect; for then there would have been an end of 
 offering them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 Could they have satisfied the demands of justice, and made 
 reconciliation for iniquity,--could they have purified and pacified 
 conscience,--then they had ceased, as being no further necessary, since 
 the offerers would have had no more sin lying upon their consciences. 
 But this was not the case; after one day of atonement was over, the 
 sinner would fall again into one fault or another, and so there would 
 be need of another day of atonement, and of one every year, besides the 
 daily ministrations. Whereas now, under the gospel, the atonement is 
 perfect, and not to be repeated; and the sinner, once pardoned, is ever 
 pardoned as to his state, and only needs to renew his repentance and 
 faith, that he may have a comfortable sense of a continued pardon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. As the legal sacrifices did not of themselves take away sin, so it 
 was impossible they should, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 There was an essential defect in them.

 1. They were not of the same nature with us who sinned. 

 2. They were not of sufficient value to make satisfaction for the
 affronts offered to the justice and government of God. They were not of 
 the same nature that offended, and so could not be suitable. Much less 
 were they of the same nature that was offended; and nothing less than 
 the nature that was offended could make the sacrifice a full 
 satisfaction for the offence. 

 3. The beasts offered up under the law could not consent to put
 themselves in the sinner's room and place. The atoning sacrifice must 
 be one capable of consenting, and must voluntarily substitute himself 
 in the sinner's stead: Christ did so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. There was a time fixed and foretold by the great God, and that time 
 had now come, when these legal sacrifices would be no longer accepted 
 by him nor useful to men. God never did desire them for themselves, and 
 now he abrogated them; and therefore to adhere to them now would be 
 resisting God and rejecting him. This time of the repeal of the 
 Levitical laws was foretold by David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:6,7">Ps. xl. 6, 7</A>),

 and is recited here as now come. Thus industriously does the apostle 
 lay low the Mosaical dispensation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is
 written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
 &nbsp; 8  Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt
 offerings and <I>offering</I> for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst
 pleasure <I>therein;</I> which are offered by the law;
 &nbsp; 9  Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh
 away the first, that he may establish the second.
 &nbsp; 10  By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of
 the body of Jesus Christ once <I>for all.</I>
 &nbsp; 11  And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering
 oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
 &nbsp; 12  But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins
 for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
 &nbsp; 13  From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his
 footstool.
 &nbsp; 14  For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
 sanctified.
 &nbsp; 15  <I>Whereof</I> the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after
 that he had said before,
 &nbsp; 16  This <I>is</I> the covenant that I will make with them after
 those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts,
 and in their minds will I write them;
 &nbsp; 17  And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
 &nbsp; 18  Now where remission of these <I>is, there is</I> no more offering
 for sin.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle raises up and exalts the Lord Jesus Christ, as high as 
 he had laid the Levitical priesthood low. He recommends Christ to them 
 as the true high priest, the true atoning sacrifice, the antitype of 
 all the rest: and this he illustrates,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. From the purpose and promise of God concerning Christ, which are 
 frequently recorded in the volume of the book of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 God had not only decreed, but declared by Moses and the prophets, that 
 Christ should come and be the great high priest of the church, and 
 should offer up a perfect and a perfecting sacrifice. It was written of 
 Christ, in the beginning of the book of God, that <I>the seed of the 
 woman should break the serpent's head;</I> and the Old Testament 
 abounds with prophecies concerning Christ. Now since he is the person 
 so often promised, so much spoken of, so long expected by the people of 
 God, he ought to be received with great honour and gratitude.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. From what God had done in preparing a body for Christ (that is, a 
 human nature), that he might be qualified to be our Redeemer and 
 Advocate; uniting the two natures in his own person, he was a fit 
 Mediator to go between God and man; a days-man to lay his hand upon
 both, a peace-maker, to reconcile them, and an everlasting band of
 union between God and the creature--"<I>My ears hast thou opened;</I>
 thou has fully instructed me, furnished and fitted me for the work, and
 engaged me in it," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:6">Ps. xl. 6</A>.

 Now a Saviour thus provided, and prepared by God himself in so 
 extraordinary a manner, ought to be received with great affection and 
 gladness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. From the readiness and willingness that Christ discovered to 
 engage in this work, when no other sacrifice would be accepted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.
 
 When no less sacrifice would be a proper satisfaction to the justice of 
 God than that of Christ himself, then Christ voluntarily came into it: 
 "<I>Lo, I come! I delight to do thy will, O God!</I> Let thy curse fall 
 upon me, but let these go their way. Father, I delight to fulfil thy 
 counsels, and my covenant with thee for them; I delight to perform all 
 thy promises, to fulfil all the prophecies." This should endear Christ 
 and our Bibles to us, that in Christ we have the fulfilling of the 
 scriptures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. From the errand and design upon which Christ came; and this was to 
 do the will of God, not only as a prophet to reveal the will of God, 
 not only as a king to give forth divine laws, but as a priest to 
 satisfy the demands of justice, and to fulfil all righteousness. Christ 
 came to do the will of God in two instances. 

 1. In taking away the first priesthood, which God had no pleasure in;
 not only taking away the curse of the covenant of works, and canceling 
 the sentence denounced against us as sinners, but taking away the 
 insufficient typical priesthood, and blotting out the hand-writing of 
 ceremonial ordinances and nailing it to his cross. 

 2. In establishing the second, that is, his own priesthood and the
 everlasting gospel, the most pure and perfect dispensation of the 
 covenant of grace; this is the great design upon which the heart of God 
 was set from all eternity. The will of God centers and terminates in
 it; and it is not more agreeable to the will of God than it is 
 advantageous to the souls of men; for it is by this will that <I>we are 
 sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for 
 all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) What is the fountain of all that Christ has done for his 
 people--the sovereign will and grace of God. 

 (2.) How we come to partake of what Christ has done for us--by being 
 sanctified, converted, effectually called, wherein we are united to 
 Christ, and so partake of the benefits of his redemption; and this 
 sanctification is owing to the oblation he made of himself to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. From the perfect efficacy of the priesthood of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>By one offering he hath for ever perfected those that are 
 sanctified;</I> he has delivered and will perfectly deliver those that 
 are brought over to him, from all the guilt, power, and punishment of 
 sin, and will put them into the sure possession of perfect holiness and 
 felicity. This is what the Levitical priesthood could never do; and, if 
 we indeed are aiming at a perfect state, we must receive the Lord Jesus 
 as the only high priest that can bring us to that state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. From the place to which our Lord Jesus is now exalted, the honour 
 he has there, and the further honour he shall have: <I>This man, after 
 he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down at the right 
 hand of God, henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his 
 footstool,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 1. To what honour Christ, as man and Mediator, is exalted--to the right 
 hand of God, the seat of power, interest, and activity: the giving 
 hand; all the favours that God bestows on his people are handed to them 
 by Christ: the receiving hand; all the duties that God accepts from men 
 are presented by Christ: the working hand; all that pertains to the 
 kingdoms of providence and grace is administered by Christ; and 
 therefore this is the highest post of honour. 

 2. How Christ came to this honour--not merely by the purpose or
 donation of the Father, but by his own merit and purchase, as a reward 
 due to his sufferings; and, as he can never be deprived of an honour so 
 much his due, so he will never quit it, nor cease to employ it for his 
 people's good. 

 3. How he enjoys this honour--with the greatest satisfaction and rest;
 he is for ever sitting down there. The Father acquiesces and is 
 satisfied in him; he is satisfied in his Father's will and presence; 
 this is his rest for ever; here he will dwell, for he has both desired 
 and deserved it. 

 4. He has further expectations, which shall not be disappointed; for
 they are grounded upon the promise of the Father, who hath said unto 
 him, <I>Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy 
 footstool,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>.

 One would think such a person as Christ could have no enemies except in
 hell; but it is certain that he has enemies on earth, very many, and 
 very inveterate ones. Let not Christians then wonder that they have 
 enemies, though they desire to live peaceably with all men. But 
 Christ's enemies shall be made his footstool; some by conversion, 
 others by confusion; and, which way soever it be, Christ will be 
 honoured. Of this Christ is assured, this he is expecting, and his 
 people should rejoice in the expectation of it; for, when his enemies 
 shall be subdued, their enemies, that are so for his sake, shall be 
 subdued also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The apostle recommends Christ from the witness the Holy Ghost has 
 given in the scriptures concerning him; this relates chiefly to what 
 should be the happy fruit and consequence of his humiliation and 
 sufferings, which in general is that new and gracious covenant that is 
 founded upon his satisfaction, and sealed by his blood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 <I>Whereof the Holy Ghost is a witness.</I> The passage is cited from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:31">Jer. xxxi. 31</A>,

 in which covenant God promises, 

 1. That he will pour out his Spirit upon his people, so as to give them
 wisdom, will, and power, to obey his word; he will put his laws in 
 their hearts, and write them in their minds,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This will make their duty plain, easy, and pleasant. 

 2. Their sins and iniquities he will remember no more

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 which will alone show the riches of divine grace, and the sufficiency 
 of Christ's satisfaction, that it needs not be repeated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 For there shall be no more remembrance of sin against true believers, 
 either to shame them now or to condemn them hereafter. This was much 
 more than the Levitical priesthood and sacrifices could effect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And now we have gone through the doctrinal part of the epistle, in 
 which we have met with many things dark and difficult to be understood, 
 which we must impute to the weakness and dulness of our own minds. The 
 apostle now proceeds to apply this great doctrine, so as to influence 
 their affections, and direct their practice, setting before them the 
 dignities and duties of the gospel state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the
 holiest by the blood of Jesus,
 &nbsp; 20  By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us,
 through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
 &nbsp; 21  And <I>having</I> a high priest over the house of God;
 &nbsp; 22  Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of
 faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and
 our bodies washed with pure water.
 &nbsp; 23  Let us hold fast the profession of <I>our</I> faith without
 wavering; (for he <I>is</I> faithful that promised;)
 &nbsp; 24  And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to
 good works:
 &nbsp; 25  Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the
 manner of some <I>is;</I> but exhorting <I>one another:</I> and so much the
 more, as ye see the day approaching.
 &nbsp; 26  For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the
 knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for
 sins,
 &nbsp; 27  But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery
 indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
 &nbsp; 28  He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or
 three witnesses:
 &nbsp; 29  Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be
 thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and
 hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was
 sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the
 Spirit of grace?
 &nbsp; 30  For we know him that hath said, Vengeance <I>belongeth</I> unto
 me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall
 judge his people.
 &nbsp; 31  <I>It is</I> a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
 God.
 &nbsp; 32  But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye
 were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;
 &nbsp; 33  Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches
 and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them
 that were so used.
 &nbsp; 34  For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully
 the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in
 heaven a better and an enduring substance.
 &nbsp; 35  Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great
 recompence of reward.
 &nbsp; 36  For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the
 will of God, ye might receive the promise.
 &nbsp; 37  For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come,
 and will not tarry.
 &nbsp; 38  Now the just shall live by faith: but if <I>any man</I> draw
 back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
 &nbsp; 39  But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of
 them that believe to the saving of the soul.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here the apostle sets forth the dignities of the gospel state. It is 
 fit that believers should know the honours and privileges that Christ 
 has procured for them, that, while they take the comfort, they may give 
 him the glory of all. The privileges are, 

 1. Boldness to enter into the holiest. They have access to God, light
 to direct them, liberty of spirit and of speech to conform to the 
 direction; they have a right to the privilege and a readiness for it, 
 assistance to use and improve it and assurance of acceptance and 
 advantage. They may enter into the gracious presence of God in his holy 
 oracles, ordinances, providences, and covenant, and so into communion 
 with God, where they receive communications from him, till they are 
 prepared to enter into his glorious presence in heaven. 

 2. A high priest over the house of God, even this blessed Jesus, who
 presides over the church militant, and every member thereof on earth, 
 and over the church triumphant in heaven. God is willing to dwell with 
 men on earth, and to have them dwell with him in heaven; but fallen man 
 cannot dwell with God without a high priest, who is the Mediator of 
 reconciliation here and of fruition hereafter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle tells us the way and means by which Christians enjoy 
 such privileges, and, in general, declares it to be <I>by the blood of 
 Jesus,</I> by the merit of that blood which he offered up to God as an 
 atoning sacrifice: he has purchased for all who believe in him free 
 access to God in the ordinances of his grace here and in the kingdom of 
 his glory. This blood, being sprinkled on the conscience, chases away 
 slavish fear, and gives the believer assurance both of his safety and 
 his welcome into the divine presence. Now the apostle, having given 
 this general account of the way by which we have access to God, enters 
 further into the particulars of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 As, 

 1. It is the only way; there is no way left but this. The first way to 
 the tree of life is, and has been, long shut up. 

 2. It is a new way, both in opposition to the covenant of works and to
 the antiquated dispensation of the Old Testament; it is <I>via 
 novissima--the last way</I> that will ever be opened to men. Those who 
 will not enter in this way exclude themselves for ever. It is a way 
 that will always be effectual. 

 3. It is a living way. It would be death to attempt to come to God in
 the way of the covenant of works; but this way we may come to God, and
 live. It is by a living Saviour, who, though he was dead, is alive; and
 it is a way that gives life and lively hope to those who enter into it.
 
 4. It is a way that Christ has consecrated for us through the veil,
 that is, his flesh. The veil in the tabernacle and temple signified the 
 body of Christ; when he died, the veil of the temple was rent in 
 sunder, and this was at the time of the evening sacrifice, and gave the 
 people a surprising view into the holy of holies, which they never had 
 before. Our way to heaven is by a crucified Saviour; his death is to
 us the way of life. To those who believe this he will be precious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He proceeds to show the Hebrews the duties binding upon them on 
 account of these privileges, which were conferred in such an 
 extraordinary way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must draw near to God, and that in a right manner. They must 
 draw near to God. Since such a way of access and return to God is 
 opened, it would be the greatest ingratitude and contempt of God and 
 Christ still to keep at a distance from him. They must draw near by
 conversion, and by taking hold of his covenant. They must draw near in 
 all holy conversation, like Enoch walking with God. They must draw near 
 in humble adorations, worshipping at his footstool. They must draw near 
 in holy dependence, and in a strict observance of the divine conduct 
 towards them. They must draw near in conformity to God, and communion 
 with him, living under his blessed influence, still endeavouring to get 
 nearer and nearer, till they come to dwell in his presence; but they 
 must see to it that they make their approach to God after a right 
 manner. 

 (1.) With a true heart, without any allowed guile or hypocrisy. God is
 the searcher of hearts, and he requires truth in the inward parts. 
 Sincerity is our gospel perfection, though not our justifying 
 righteousness. 

 (2.) In full assurance of faith, with a faith grown up to a full 
 persuasion that when we come to God by Christ we shall have audience 
 and acceptance. We should lay aside all sinful distrust. Without faith
 it is impossible to please God; and the stronger our faith is the more 
 glory we give to God. And, 

 (3.) Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, by a 
 believing application of the blood of Christ to our souls. They may be 
 cleansed from guilt, from filth, from sinful fear and torment, from all 
 aversion to God and duty, from ignorance, and error, and superstition, 
 and whatever evils the consciences of men are subject to by reason of 
 sin. 

 (4.) Our bodies washed with pure water, that is, with the water of 
 baptism (by which we are recorded among the disciples of Christ, 
 members of his mystical body), or with the sanctifying virtue of the 
 Holy Spirit, reforming and regulating our outward conversation as well 
 as our inward frame, cleansing from the filthiness of the flesh as well 
 as of the spirit. The priests under the law were to wash, before they
 went into the presence of the Lord to offer before him. There must be a 
 due preparation for making our approaches to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The apostle exhorts believers to hold fast the profession of their 
 faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 Here observe,

 (1.) The duty itself--to hold fast the profession of our faith, to 
 embrace all the truths and ways of the gospel, to get fast hold of 
 them, and to keep that hold against all temptation and opposition. Our 
 spiritual enemies will do what they can to wrest our faith, and hope, 
 and holiness, and comfort, out of our hands, but we must hold fast our 
 religion as our best treasure. 

 (2.) The manner in which we must do this--without wavering, without 
 doubting, without disputing, without dallying with temptation to 
 apostasy. Having once settled these great things between God and our 
 souls, we must be stedfast and immovable. Those who begin to waver in
 matters of Christian faith and practice are in danger of falling away. 
 
 (3.) The motive or reason enforcing this duty: <I>He is faithful that 
 hath promised.</I> God has made great and precious promises to 
 believers, and he is a faithful God, true to his word; there is no 
 falseness nor fickleness with him, and there should be none with us. 
 His faithfulness should excite and encourage us to be faithful, and we 
 must depend more upon his promises to us than upon our promises to him, 
 and we must plead with him the promise of grace sufficient.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We have the means prescribed for preventing our apostasy, and 
 promoting our fidelity and perseverance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>,

 &c. He mentions several; as, 

 1. That we should <I>consider one another, to provoke to love and to 
 good works.</I> Christians ought to have a tender consideration and 
 concern for one another; they should affectionately consider what their 
 several wants, weaknesses, and temptations are; and they should do 
 this, not to reproach one another, to provoke one another not to anger, 
 but to love and good works, calling upon themselves and one another to 
 love God and Christ more, to love duty and holiness more, to love their 
 brethren in Christ more, and to do all the good offices of Christian 
 affection both to the bodies and the souls of each other. A good 
 example given to others is the best and most effectual provocation to 
 love and good works.

 2. <I>Not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 It is the will of Christ that his disciples should assemble together,
 sometimes more privately for conference and prayer, and in public for 
 hearing and joining in all the ordinances of gospel worship. There were 
 in the apostles' times, and should be in every age, Christian 
 assemblies for the worship of God, and for mutual edification. And it
 seems even in those times there were some who forsook these assemblies, 
 and so began to apostatize from religion itself. The communion of 
 saints is a great help and privilege, and a good means of steadiness 
 and perseverance; hereby their hearts and hands are mutually 
 strengthened. 

 3. To exhort one another, to exhort ourselves and each other, to warn
 ourselves and one another of the sin and danger of backsliding, to put 
 ourselves and our fellow-christians in mind of our duty, of our 
 failures and corruptions, to watch over one another, and be jealous of 
 ourselves and one another with a godly jealousy. This, managed with a 
 true gospel spirit, would be the best and most cordial friendship. 

 4. That we should observe the approaching of times of trial, and be
 thereby quickened to greater diligence: <I>So much the more, as you see 
 the day approaching.</I> Christians ought to observe the signs of the 
 times, such as God has foretold. There was a day approaching, a 
 terrible day to the Jewish nation, when their city should be destroyed, 
 and the body of the people rejected of God for rejecting Christ. This 
 would be a day of dispersion and temptation to the chosen remnant. Now 
 the apostle puts them upon observing what signs there were of the 
 approach of such a terrible day, and upon being the more constant in 
 meeting together and exhorting one another, that they might be the 
 better prepared for such a day. There is a trying day coming on us all, 
 the day of our death, and we should observe all the signs of its 
 approaching, and improve them to greater watchfulness and diligence in 
 duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Having mentioned these means of establishment, the apostle proceeds, 
 in the close of the chapter, to enforce his exhortations to 
 perseverance, and against apostasy, by many very weighty 
 considerations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. From the description he gives of the sin of apostasy. It is 
 <I>sinning wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the 
 truth,</I> sinning wilfully against that truth of which we have had 
 convincing evidence. This text has been the occasion of great distress 
 to some gracious souls; they have been ready to conclude that every 
 wilful sin, after conviction and against knowledge, is the unpardonable 
 sin: but this has been their infirmity and error. The sin here 
 mentioned is a total and final apostasy, when men with a full and fixed 
 will and resolution despise and reject Christ, the only 
 Saviour,--despise and resist the Spirit, the only sanctifier,--and
 despise and renounce the gospel, the only way of salvation, and the 
 words of eternal life; and all this after they have known, owned, and 
 professed, the Christian religion, and continue to do so obstinately 
 and maliciously. This is the great transgression: the apostle seems to 
 refer to the law concerning presumptuous sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+15:30,31">Num. xv. 30, 31</A>.

 They were to be cut off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. From the dreadful doom of such apostates. 

 (1.) There remains no more sacrifice for such sins, no other Christ to 
 come to save such sinners; they sin against the last resort and remedy. 
 There were some sins under the law for which no sacrifices were 
 provided; but yet if those who committed them did truly repent, though 
 they might not escape temporal death, they might escape eternal 
 destruction; for Christ would come, and make atonement. But now those 
 under the gospel who will not accept of Christ, that they may be saved 
 by him, have no other refuge left them. 

 (2.) There remains for them only a certain fearful looking for of 
 judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Some think this refers to the dreadful destruction of the Jewish church 
 and state; but certainly it refers also to the utter destruction that 
 awaits all obstinate apostates at death and judgment, when the Judge 
 will discover a fiery indignation against them, which will devour the 
 adversaries; they will be consigned to the devouring fire and to 
 everlasting burnings. Of this destruction God gives some notorious 
 sinners, while on earth, a fearful foreboding in their own consciences, 
 a dreadful looking for it, with a despair of ever being able either to 
 endure or escape it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. From the methods of divine justice with those who despised Moses's 
 law, that is, sinned presumptuously, despising his authority, his 
 threatenings and his power. These, when convicted by two or three 
 witnesses, were put to death; they died without mercy, a temporal 
 death. Observe, Wise governors should be careful to keep up the credit 
 of their government and the authority of the laws, by punishing 
 presumptuous offenders; but then in such cases there should be good 
 evidence of the fact. Thus God ordained in Moses's law; and hence the 
 apostle infers the heavy doom that will fall upon those that apostatize 
 from Christ. Here he refers to their own consciences, to judge how much 
 sorer punishment the despisers of Christ (after they have professed to 
 know him) are likely to undergo; and they may judge of the greatness of 
 the punishment by the greatness of the sin. 

 (1.) They have <I>trodden under foot the Son of God.</I> To trample 
 upon an ordinary person shows intolerable insolence; to treat a person 
 of honour in that vile manner is insufferable; but to deal thus with 
 the Son of God, who himself is God, must be the highest provocation--to 
 trample upon his person, denying him to be the Messiah--to trample upon 
 his authority, and undermine his kingdom--to trample upon his members 
 as the offscouring of all things, and not fit to live in the world; 
 what punishment can be too great for such men? 

 (2.) They have <I>counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was 
 sanctified, an unholy thing;</I> that is, the blood of Christ, with 
 which the covenant was purchased and sealed, and wherewith Christ 
 himself was consecrated, or wherewith the apostate was sanctified, that 
 is, baptized, visibly initiated into the new covenant by baptism, and 
 admitted to the Lord's supper. Observe, There is a kind of
 sanctification which persons may partake of and yet fall away: they may 
 be distinguished by common gifts and graces, by an outward profession, 
 by a form of godliness, a course of duties, and a set of privileges, 
 and yet fall away finally. Men who have seemed before to have the blood 
 of Christ in high esteem may come to account it an unholy thing, no 
 better than the blood of a malefactor, though it was the world's 
 ransom, and every drop of it of infinite value. 

 (3.) <I>Those have done despite unto the Spirit of grace,</I> the 
 Spirit that is graciously given to men, and that works grace wherever 
 it is,--the Spirit of grace, that should be regarded and attended to 
 with the greatest care,--this Spirit they have grieved, resisted, 
 quenched, yea, done despite to him, which is the highest act of 
 wickedness, and makes the case of the sinner desperate, refusing to 
 have the gospel salvation applied to him. Now he leaves it to the 
 consciences of all, appeals to universal reason and equity, whether 
 such aggravated crimes ought not to receive a suitable punishment, a 
 sorer punishment than those who had died without mercy? But what 
 punishment can be sorer than to die without mercy? I answer, To die by 
 mercy, by the mercy and grace which they have despised. How dreadful is 
 the case when not only the justice of God, but his abused grace and 
 mercy call for vengeance!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. From the description we have in the scripture of the nature of God's 
 vindictive justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 We know that he has said, <I>Vengeance is mine.</I> This is taken out 
 of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:1">Ps. xciv. 1</A>,

 <I>Vengeance belongs unto me.</I> The terrors of the Lord are known 
 both by revelation and reason. Vindictive justice is a glorious, though 
 terrible attribute of God; it belongs to him, and he will use and 
 execute it upon the heads of such sinners as despise his grace; he will 
 avenge himself, and his Son, and Spirit, and covenant, upon apostates. 
 And how dreadful then will their case be! The other quotation is from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36">Deut. xxxii. 36</A>,

 <I>The Lord will judge his people;</I> he will search and try his 
 visible church, and will discover and detect those who say they are 
 Jews, and are not, but are of the synagogue of Satan; and he will 
 separate the precious from the vile, and will punish the sinners in 
 Zion with the greatest severity. Now those who know him who hath said, 
 <I>Vengeance belongeth to me, I will recompense,</I> must needs 
 conclude, as the apostle does 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</I> 
 Those who know the joy that results from the favour of God can thereby 
 judge of the power and dread of his vindictive wrath. Observe here, 
 What will be the eternal misery of impenitent sinners and apostates: 
 they shall fall into the hands of the living God; their punishment 
 shall come from God's own hand. He takes them into the hand of his 
 justice; he will deal with them himself; their greatest misery will be 
 the immediate impressions of divine wrath on the soul. When he punishes 
 them by creatures, the instrument abates something of the force of the 
 blow; but, when he does it by his own hand, it is infinite misery. This 
 they shall have at God's hand, they shall lie down in sorrow; their 
 destruction shall come from his glorious powerful presence; when they 
 make their woeful bed in hell, they will find that God is there, and 
 his presence will be their greatest terror and torment. And he is a 
 living God; he lives for ever, and will punish for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He presses them to perseverance by putting them in mind of their 
 former sufferings for Christ: <I>But call to mind the former days, in 
 which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of 
 afflictions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 In the early days of the gospel there was a very hot persecution raised 
 up against the professors of the Christian religion, and the believing 
 Hebrews had their share of it: he would have them to remember,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) When they had suffered: <I>In former days, after</I> they were 
 <I>illuminated;</I> that is, as soon as God had breathed life into 
 their souls, and caused divine light to spring up in their minds, and 
 taken them into his favour and covenant; then earth and hell combined 
 all their force against them. Here observe, A natural state is a dark 
 state, and those who continue in that state meet with no disturbance 
 from Satan and the world; but a state of grace is a state of light, and 
 therefore the powers of darkness will violently oppose it. Those who 
 will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What they suffered: they <I>endured a great fight of 
 afflictions,</I> many and various afflictions united together against 
 them, and they had a great conflict with them. Many are the troubles of 
 the righteous. 

 [1.] They were afflicted in themselves. In their own persons; they were 
 made gazing-stocks, spectacles to the world, angels, and men,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:9">1 Cor. iv. 9</A>.

 In their names and reputations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 by many reproaches. Christians ought to value their reputation; and 
 they do so especially because the reputation of religion is concerned: 
 this makes reproach a great affliction. They were afflicted in their 
 estates, by the spoiling of their goods, by fines and forfeitures. 

 [2.] They were afflicted in the afflictions of their brethren: 
 <I>Partly while you became companions of those that were so used.</I> 
 The Christian spirit is a sympathizing spirit, not a selfish spirit, 
 but a compassionate spirit; it makes every Christian's suffering our 
 own, puts us upon pitying others, visiting them, helping them, and 
 pleading for them. Christians are one body, are animated by one
 spirit, have embarked in one common cause and interest, and are the 
 children of that God who is afflicted in all the afflictions of his 
 people. If one member of the body suffers, all the rest suffer with it. 
 The apostle takes particular notice how they had sympathized with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):
 
 <I>You had compassion on me in my bonds.</I> We must thankfully 
 acknowledge the compassions our Christian friends have shown for us 
 under our afflictions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) How they had suffered. They had been mightily supported under 
 their former sufferings; they took their sufferings patiently, and not 
 only so, but joyfully received it from God as a favour and honour 
 conferred upon them that they should be thought worthy to suffer 
 reproach for the name of Christ. God can strengthen his suffering 
 people with all might in the inner man, to all patience and 
 long-suffering, and that with joyfulness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:11">Col. i. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) What it was that enabled them thus to bear up under their 
 sufferings. They knew in themselves that they had in heaven a better 
 and a more enduring substance. Observe, 

 [1.] The happiness of the saints in heaven is substance, something of 
 real weight and worth. All things here are but shadows.

 [2.] It is a better substance than any thing they can have or lose 
 here.

 [3.] It is an enduring substance, it will out-live time and run 
 parallel with eternity; they can never spend it; their enemies can 
 never take it from them, as they did their earthly goods.

 [4.] This will make a rich amends for all they can lose and suffer 
 here. In heaven they shall have a better life, a better estate, better 
 liberty, better society, better hearts, better work, every thing 
 better.

 [5.] Christians should know this in themselves, they should get the 
 assurance of it in themselves (the Spirit of God witnessing with their 
 spirits), for the assured knowledge of this will help them to endure 
 any fight of afflictions they may be encountered with in this 
 world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He presses them to persevere, from that recompense of reward that 
 waited for all faithful Christians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense 
 of reward.</I> Here, 

 (1.) He exhorts them not to cast away their confidence, that is, their 
 holy courage and boldness, but to hold fast that profession for which 
 they had suffered so much before, and borne those sufferings so well. 
 
 (2.) He encourages them to this by assuring them that the reward of 
 their holy confidence would be very great. It carries a present reward 
 in it, in holy peace and joy, and much of God's presence and his power 
 resting upon them; and it shall have a great recompense of reward 
 hereafter.

 (3.) He shows them how necessary a grace the grace of patience is in 
 our present state 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>You have need of patience, that after you have done the will of God 
 you might receive the promise;</I> that is, this promised reward. 
 Observe, The greatest part of the saints' happiness is in promise. They 
 must first do the will of God before they receive the promise; and, 
 after they have done the will of God, they have need of patience to 
 wait for the time when the promise shall be fulfilled; they have need 
 of patience to live till God calls them away. It is a trial of the
 patience of Christians, to be content to live after their work is done, 
 and to stay for the reward till God's time to give it them is come. We 
 must be God's waiting servants when we can be no longer his working 
 servants. Those who have had and exercised much patience already must 
 have and exercise more till they die. 

 (4.) To help their patience, he assures them of the near approach of 
 Christ's coming to deliver and to reward them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will 
 not tarry.</I> He will soon come to them at death, and put an end to 
 all their sufferings, and give them a crown of life. He will soon come
 to judgment, and put an end to the sufferings of the whole church (all 
 his mystical body), and give them an ample and glorious reward in the 
 most public manner. There is an appointed time for both, and beyond 
 that time he will not tarry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:3">Hab. ii. 3</A>.

 The Christian's present conflict may be sharp, but it will be soon
 over.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. He presses them to perseverance, by telling them that this is their 
 distinguishing character and will be their happiness; whereas apostasy 
 is the reproach, and will be the ruin, of all who are guilty of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:38,39"><I>v.</I> 38, 39</A>):
 
 <I>Now the just shall live by faith,</I> &c.

 (1.) It is the honourable character of just men that in times of the
 greatest affliction they can live by faith; they can live upon the 
 assured persuasion they have of the truth of God's promises. Faith puts 
 life and vigour into them. They can trust God, and live upon him, and
 wait his time: and, as their faith maintains their spiritual life now, 
 it shall be crowned with eternal life hereafter. 

 (2.) Apostasy is the mark and the brand of those in whom God takes no 
 pleasure; and it is a cause of God's severe displeasure and anger. God 
 never was pleased with the formal profession and external duties and 
 services of such as do not persevere. He saw the hypocrisy of their 
 hearts then; and he is greatly provoked when their formality in 
 religion ends in an open apostasy from religion. He beholds them with 
 great displeasure; they are an offence to him. 

 (3.) The apostle concludes with declaring his good hope concerning 
 himself and these Hebrews, that they should not forfeit the character 
 and happiness of the just, and fall under the brand and misery of the 
 wicked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>But we are not,</I> &c.; as if he had said, "I hope we are not of 
 those who draw back. I hope that you and I, who have met with great 
 trials already, and have been supported under them by the grace of God 
 strengthening our faith, shall not be at any time left to ourselves to 
 draw back to perdition; but that God will still keep us by his mighty 
 power through faith unto salvation." Observe, 

 [1.] Professors may go a great way, and after all draw back; and this 
 drawing back from God is drawing on to perdition: the further we depart 
 from God the nearer we approach to ruin.

 [2.] Those who have been kept faithful in great trials for the time 
 past have reason to hope that the same grace will be sufficient to help 
 them still to live by faith, till they receive the end of their faith 
 and patience, even the salvation of their souls. If we live by faith,
 and die in faith, our souls will be safe for ever.</P>
