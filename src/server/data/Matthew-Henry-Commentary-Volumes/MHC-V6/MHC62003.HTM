 The apostle here magnifies the love of God in our adoption, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 He thereupon argues for holiness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:3">ver. 3</A>),

 and against sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:4-19">ver. 4-19</A>.

 He presses brotherly love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:11-18">ver. 11-18</A>.

 How to assure our hearts before God,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
 that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world
 knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
 &nbsp; 2  Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
 appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear,
 we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
 &nbsp; 3  And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,
 even as he is pure.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having shown the dignity of Christ's faithful followers, 
 that they are born of him and thereby nearly allied to God, now 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Breaks forth into the admiration of that grace that is the spring of 
 such a wonderful vouchsafement: <I>Behold</I> (see you, observe) 
 <I>what manner of love,</I> or how great love, <I>the Father hath 
 bestowed upon us, that we should be called,</I> effectually called (he 
 who calls things that are not makes them to be what they were not) 
 <I>the sons of God!</I> The Father adopts all the children of the Son. 
 The Son indeed calls them, and makes them his brethren; and thereby he 
 confers upon them the power and dignity of the sons of God. It is 
 wonderful condescending love of the eternal Father, that such as we 
 should be made and called his sons--we who by nature are heirs of sin,
 and guilt, and the curse of God--we who by practice are children of
 corruption, disobedience, and ingratitude! Strange, that the holy God 
 is not ashamed to be called our Father, and to call us his sons! Thence 
 the apostle,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Infers the honour of believers above the cognizance of the world. 
 Unbelievers know little of them. <I>Therefore</I> (or wherefore, upon 
 this score) <I>the world knoweth us not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Little does the world perceive the advancement and happiness of the 
 genuine followers of Christ. They are here exposed to the common 
 calamities of earth and time; all things fall alike to them as to 
 others, or rather they are subject to the greater sorrow, for they have 
 often reason to say, <I>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we 
 are of all men most miserable,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:19">1 Cor. xv. 19</A>.

 The unchristian world, therefore, that walks by sight, knows not their
 dignity, their privileges, the enjoyments they have in hand, nor what 
 they are entitled to. Little does the world think that these poor, 
 humble, contemned ones are the favourites of heaven, and will be 
 inhabitants there ere long. And they may bear their case the better 
 since their Lord was here unknown as well as they: <I>Because it knew 
 him not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Little did the world think how great a person was once sojourning here, 
 that the Maker of it was once an inhabitant of it. Little did the 
 Jewish world think that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, was one 
 of their blood, and dwelt in their land; he came to his own, and his 
 own received him not. He came to his own, and his own crucified him;
 but surely, <I>had they known him, they would not have crucified the 
 Lord of glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>.

 Let the followers of Christ be content with hard fare here, since they
 are in a land of strangers, among those who little know them, and their 
 Lord was so treated before them. Then the apostle,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Exalts these persevering disciples in the prospect of the certain 
 revelation of their state and dignity. Here, 

 1. Their present honourable relation is asserted: <I>Beloved</I> (you
 may well be our beloved, for you are beloved of God), <I>now are we the 
 sons of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 We have the nature of sons by regeneration: we have the title, and 
 spirit, and right to the inheritance of sons by adoption. <I>This
 honour have all the saints.</I> 

 2. The discovery of the bliss belonging and suitable to this relation
 is denied: <I>And it doth not yet appear what we shall be,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The glory pertaining to the sonship and adoption is adjourned and 
 reserved for another world. The discovery of it here would put a stop 
 to the current of affairs that must now proceed. The sons of God must 
 walk by faith, and live by hope.

 3. The time of the revelation of the sons of God in their proper state
 and glory is determined; and that is when their elder brother comes to 
 call and collect them all together: <I>But we know that when he shall 
 appear we shall be like him.</I> The particle, <B><I>ean,</I></B> 
 usually translated <I>if,</I> is here well rendered <I>when;</I> for 
 the Hebrew particle <B><I>am</I></B> (to which this is thought to 
 correspond) is observed so to signify, as Dr. Whitby has here noted;
 and not only is <B><I>ean</I></B> sometimes used for 
 <B><I>hotan,</I></B> but some copies even here read 
 <B><I>hotan,</I></B> <I>when.</I> And accordingly it seems proper so to 
 render it in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:3">John xiv. 3</A>,

 where we read it, <I>And if I go, and prepare a place;</I> but more
 naturally and properly, <I>When I shall have gone, and shall have
 prepared the place, I will come again, and receive you unto myself,</I>
 or <B><I>paralepsomai</I></B>--<I>I will take you along with myself,
 that where I am there you may be also.</I> When the head of the church,
 the only-begotten of the Father, shall appear, his members, the adopted
 of God, shall appear and be manifested together with him. They may then
 well wait in faith, hope, and earnest desire, for the revelation of the
 Lord Jesus; as even the creation itself waiteth for their perfection,
 <I>and the public manifestation of the sons of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:19">Rom. viii. 19</A>.

 The sons of God will be known and be made manifest by their likeness to
 their head: <I>They shall be like him</I>--like him in honour, and 
 power, and glory. Their vile bodies shall be made like his glorious 
 body; they shall be filled with life, light, and bliss from him.
 <I>When he, who is their life, shall appear, they also shall appear 
 with him in glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:4">Col. iii. 4</A>.
 
 Then, 

 4. Their likeness to him is argued from the sight they shall have of
 him: <I>We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</I> Their 
 likeness will be the cause of that sight which they shall have of him. 
 Indeed, all shall see him, but not as they do; not as <I>he is,</I> 
 namely, to those in heaven. The wicked shall see him in his frowns, in 
 the terror of his majesty, and the splendour of his avenging 
 perfections; but these shall see him in the smiles and beauty of his 
 face, in the correspondence and amiableness of his glory, in the 
 harmony and agreeableness of his beatific perfections. Their likeness 
 shall enable them to see him as the blessed do in heaven. Or the sight 
 of him shall be the cause of their likeness; it shall be a 
 transformative sight: they shall be transformed into the same image by 
 the beatific view that they shall have of him. Then the apostle,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Urges the engagement of these sons of God to the prosecution of 
 holiness: <I>And every man that hath this hope in him purifies himself 
 even as he is pure,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The sons of God know that their Lord is holy and pure; he is of purer 
 heart and eyes than to admit any pollution or impurity to dwell with 
 him. Those then who hope to live with him must study the utmost purity
 from the world, and flesh, and sin; they must grow in grace and 
 holiness. Not only does their Lord command them to do so, but their new 
 nature inclines them so to do; yea, their hope of heaven will dictate 
 and constrain them so to do. They know that their high priest is holy,
 harmless, and undefiled. They know that their God and Father is the high
 and holy one, that all the society is pure and holy, that their 
 inheritance is an inheritance of saints in light. It is a contradiction 
 to such hope to indulge sin and impurity. And therefore, as we are 
 sanctified by faith, we must be sanctified by hope. That we may be 
 saved by hope we must be purified by hope. It is the hope of 
 hypocrites, and not of the sons of God, that makes an allowance for the 
 gratification of impure desires and lusts.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin
 is the transgression of the law.
 &nbsp; 5  And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and
 in him is no sin.
 &nbsp; 6  Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath
 not seen him, neither known him.
 &nbsp; 7  Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth
 righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
 &nbsp; 8  He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth
 from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was
 manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
 &nbsp; 9  Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
 remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
 &nbsp; 10  In this the children of God are manifest, and the children
 of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,
 neither he that loveth not his brother.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having alleged the believer's obligation to purity from 
 his hope of heaven, and of communion with Christ in glory at the day of 
 his appearance, now proceeds to fill his own mouth and the believer's 
 mind with multiplied arguments against sin, and all communion with the 
 impure unfruitful works of darkness. And so he reasons and argues,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. From the nature of sin and the intrinsic evil of it. It is a 
 contrariety to the divine law: <I>Whosoever committeth sin 
 transgresseth also (or even) the law</I> (or, whosoever committeth sin
 even committeth enormity, or aberration from law, or from the law); 
 <I>for sin is the transgression of the law,</I> or is lawlessness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Sin is the destitution or privation of correspondence and agreement 
 with the divine law, that law which is the transcript of the divine 
 nature and purity, which contains his will for the government of the 
 world, which is suitable to the rational nature, and enacted for the 
 good of the world, which shows man the way of felicity and peace, and 
 conducts him to the author of his nature and of the law. The current 
 commission of sin now is the rejection of the divine law, and this is 
 the rejection of the divine authority, and consequently of God 
 himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. From the design and errand of the Lord Jesus in and to this world, 
 which was to remove sin: <I>And you know that he was manifested to take 
 away our sins, and in him is no sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The Son of God appeared, and was known, in our nature; and he came to 
 vindicate and exalt the divine law, and that by obedience to the 
 precept, and by subjection and suffering under the penal sanction, 
 under the curse of it. <I>He came therefore to take away our sins,</I> 
 to take away the guilt of them by the sacrifice of himself, to take 
 away the commission of them by implanting a new nature in us (for we 
 are sanctified by virtue of his death), and to dissuade and save from
 it by his own example, <I>and</I> (or <I>for) in him was no sin;</I> 
 or, he takes sin away, that he may conform us to himself, <I>and in him 
 is no sin.</I> Those that expect communion with Christ above should 
 study communion with him here in the utmost purity. And the Christian 
 world should know and consider the great end of the Son of God's coming 
 hither: it was to take away our sin: <I>And you know</I> (and this
 knowledge should be deep and effectual) <I>that he was manifested to 
 take away our sins.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. From the opposition between sin and a real union with or adhesion 
 to the Lord Christ: <I>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 To sin here is the same as to commit sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>),

 and to commit sin is to practise sin. He that abideth in Christ 
 continues not in the practice of sin. As vital union with the Lord 
 Jesus broke the power of sin in the heart and nature, so continuance 
 therein prevents the regency and prevalence thereof in the life and
 conduct. Or the negative expression here is put for the positive: <I>He
 sinneth not,</I> that is, he is obedient, <I>he keeps the
 commandments</I> (in sincerity, and in the ordinary course of life)
 <I>and does those things that are pleasing in his sight,</I> as is said

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Those that abide in Christ abide in their covenant with him, and 
 consequently watch against the sin that is contrary thereto. They abide 
 in the potent light and knowledge of him; and therefore it may be 
 concluded <I>that he that sinneth</I> (abideth in the predominant 
 practice of sin) <I>hath not seen him</I> (hath not his mind impressed 
 with a sound evangelical discerning of him), <I>neither known him,</I> 
 hath no experimental acquaintance with him. Practical renunciation of 
 sin is the great evidence of spiritual union with, continuance in, and 
 saving knowledge of, the Lord Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. From the connection between the practice of righteousness and a 
 state of righteousness, intimating withal that the practice of sin and 
 a justified state are inconsistent; and this is introduced with a 
 supposition that a surmise to the contrary is a gross deceit: 
 "<I>Little children,</I> dear children, and as much children as you 
 are, herein <I>let no man deceive you.</I> There will be those who will 
 magnify your new light and entertainment of Christianity, who will make 
 you believe that your knowledge, profession, and baptism, will excuse 
 you from the care and accuracy of the Christian life. But beware of 
 such self-deceit. <I>He that doeth righteousness in righteous.</I>" It 
 may appear that righteousness may in several places of scripture be 
 justly rendered <I>religion,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:10">Matt. v. 10</A>,

 <I>Blessed are those that are persecuted for righteousness' sake,</I>
 that is, for religion's sake;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:14">1 Pet. iii. 14</A>,

 <I>But if you suffer for righteousness' sake</I> (religion's sake)
 <I>happy are you;</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:16">2 Tim. iii. 16</A>,

 <I>All scripture,</I> or the whole scripture, <I>is given by
 inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine--and for instruction 
 in righteousness,</I> that is, in the nature and branches of religion. 
 To do righteousness then, especially being set in opposition to the 
 doing, committing, or practising, of sin, is to practise religion. Now 
 he who practiseth religion is righteous; he is the righteous person on 
 all accounts; he is sincere and upright before God. The practice of 
 religion cannot subsist without a principle of integrity and 
 conscience. He has that righteousness which consists in pardon of sin 
 and right to life, founded upon the imputation of the Mediator's 
 righteousness. He has a title <I>to the crown of righteousness, which 
 the righteous Judge will give,</I> according to his covenant and 
 promise, <I>to those that love his appearing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:8">2 Tim. iv. 8</A>.

 He has communion with Christ, in conformity to the divine law, being in
 some measure practically righteous as he; and he has communion with him 
 in the justified state, being now relatively righteous together with 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. From the relation between the sinner and the devil, and thereupon 
 from the design and office of the Lord Christ against the devil. 

 1. From the relation between the sinner and the devil. As elsewhere
 sinners and saints are distinguished (though even saints are sinners 
 largely so called), <I>so to commit sin</I> is here so to practise it 
 as sinners do, that are distinguished from saints, to live under the 
 power and dominion of it; and he who does so <I>is of the devil;</I> 
 his sinful nature is inspired by, and agreeable and pleasing to, the 
 devil; and he belongs to the party, and interest, and kingdom of the 
 devil. It is he that is the author and patron of sin, and has been a 
 practitioner of it, a tempter and instigator to it, even from the 
 beginning of the world. And thereupon we must see how he argues. 

 2. From the design and office of the Lord Christ against the devil:
 <I>For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might 
 destroy the works of the devil,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The devil has designed and endeavoured to ruin the work of God in this 
 world. The Son of God has undertaken the holy war against him. He came 
 into our world, and was manifested in our flesh, that he might conquer 
 him and dissolve his works. Sin will he loosen and dissolve more and 
 more, till he has quite destroyed it. Let not us serve or indulge what 
 the Son of God came to destroy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. From the connection between regeneration and the relinquishment of 
 sin: <I>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin.</I> To be born of 
 God is to be inwardly renewed, and restored to a holy integrity or 
 rectitude of nature by the power of the Spirit of God. <I>Such a one 
 committeth not sin,</I> does not work iniquity nor practise 
 disobedience, which is contrary to his new nature and the regenerate 
 complexion of his spirit; for, as the apostle adds, <I>his seed 
 remaineth in him,</I> either the word of God in its light and power 
 <I>remaineth in him</I> (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:23">1 Pet. i. 23</A>,

 <I>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by
 the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever</I>), or, <I>that 
 which is born of the Spirit is spirit;</I> the spiritual seminal 
 principle of holiness remaineth in him. Renewing grace is an abiding 
 principle. Religion, in the spring of it, is not an art, an acquired 
 dexterity and skill, but a new nature. And thereupon the consequence is 
 the regenerate person <I>cannot sin.</I> That he cannot commit an act 
 of sin, I suppose no judicious interpreter understands. This would be 
 contrary to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:9"><I>ch.</I> i. 9</A>,

 where it is made our duty to confess our sins, and supposed that our 
 privilege thereupon is to have our sins forgiven. <I>He therefore 
 cannot sin,</I> in the sense in which the apostle says, <I>he cannot 
 commit sin.</I> He cannot continue in the course and practice of sin. 
 He cannot so sin as to denominate him a sinner in opposition to a saint 
 or servant of God. Again, he cannot sin comparatively, as he did
 before he was born of God, and as others do that are not so. And the 
 reason is <I>because he is born of God,</I> which will amount to all 
 this inhibition and impediment. 

 1. There is a light in his mind which shows him the evil and malignity
 of sin. 

 2. There is that bias upon his heart which disposes him to loathe and
 hate sin. 

 3. There is the spiritual seminal principle or disposition, that breaks
 the force and fulness of the sinful acts. They proceed not from such 
 plenary power of corruption as they do in others, nor obtain that 
 plenitude of heart, spirit, and consent, which they do in others.
 <I>The spirit lusteth against the flesh.</I> And therefore in respect 
 to such sin it may be said, <I>It is no more I that do it, but sin that 
 dwelleth in me.</I> It is not reckoned the person's sin, in the gospel 
 account, where the bent and frame of the mind and spirit are against 
 it. Then, 

 4. There is a disposition for humiliation and repentance for sin, when
 it has been committed. <I>He that is born of God cannot sin.</I> Here 
 we may call to mind the usual distinction of natural and moral 
 impotency. The unregenerate person is morally unable for what is 
 religiously good. The regenerate person is happily disabled for sin.
 There is a restraint, an embargo (as we may say), laid upon his sinning 
 powers. It goes against him sedately and deliberately to sin. We 
 usually say of a person of known integrity, "He cannot lie, he cannot 
 cheat, and commit other enormities." <I>How can I commit this great 
 wickedness, and sin against God!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:9">Gen. xxxix. 9</A>.

 And so those who persist in a sinful life sufficiently demonstrate that
 they are not born of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. From the discrimination between the children of God and the 
 children of the devil. They have their distinct characters. <I>In this 
 the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 In the world (according to the old distinction) there are the seed of 
 God and the seed of the serpent. Now the seed of the serpent is known 
 by these two signatures:--

 1. By neglect of religion: <I>Whosoever doeth not righteously</I>
 (omits and disregards the rights and dues of God; for religion is but 
 our righteousness towards God, or giving him his due, and whosoever 
 does not conscientiously do this) <I>is not of God,</I> but, on the 
 contrary, of the devil. The devil is the father of unrighteous or 
 irreligious souls. And, 

 2. By hatred of fellow-christians: <I>Neither he that loveth not his
 brother,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 True Christians are to be loved for God's and Christ's sake. Those who 
 so love them not, but despise, and hate, and persecute them, have the 
 serpentine nature still abiding in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning,
 that we should love one another.
 &nbsp; 12  Not as Cain, <I>who</I> was of that wicked one, and slew his
 brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were
 evil, and his brother's righteous.
 &nbsp; 13  Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having intimated that one mark of the devil's children is 
 hatred of the brethren, takes occasion thence,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To recommend fraternal Christian love, and that from the excellence, 
 or antiquity, or primariness of the injunction relating thereto: <I>And 
 this is the message</I> (the errand or charge) <I>which you heard from 
 the beginning</I> (this came among the principal parts of practical 
 Christianity), <I>that we should love one another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 We should love the Lord Jesus, and value his love, and consequently 
 love all the objects of it, and thereupon all our brethren in 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To dissuade from what is contrary thereto, all ill-will towards the 
 brethren, and that by the example of Cain. His envy and malignity 
 should deter us from harbouring the like passion, and that upon these 
 accounts:--

 1. It showed that he was as the first-born of the serpent's seed; even
 he, the eldest son of the first man, was of <I>the wicked one.</I> He 
 imitated and resembled the first wicked one, the devil. 

 2. His ill-will had no restraint; it proceeded so far as to contrive
 and accomplish murder, and that of a near relation, and that in the 
 beginning of the world, when there were but few to replenish it. <I>He 
 slew his brother,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Sin, indulged, knows no bound. And, 

 3. It proceeded so far, and had in it so much of the devil, that he
 murdered his brother for religion's sake. He was vexed with the 
 superiority of Abel's service, and envied him the favour and acceptance 
 he had with God. And for these he martyred his brother. <I>And 
 wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his 
 brother's righteous,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Ill-will will teach us to hate and revenge what we should admire and 
 imitate. And then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. To infer that it is no wonder that good men are so served now: 
 <I>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The serpentine nature still continues in the world. The great serpent 
 himself reigns as the God of this world. Wonder not then that the 
 serpentine world hates and hisses at you who belong to that seed of the 
 woman that is to bruise the serpent's head.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we
 love the brethren. He that loveth not <I>his</I> brother abideth in
 death.
 &nbsp; 15  Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that
 no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
 &nbsp; 16  Hereby perceive we the love <I>of God,</I> because he laid down
 his life for us: and we ought to lay down <I>our</I> lives for the
 brethren.
 &nbsp; 17  But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have
 need, and shutteth up his bowels <I>of compassion</I> from him, how
 dwelleth the love of God in him?
 &nbsp; 18  My little children, let us not love in word, neither in
 tongue; but in deed and in truth.
 &nbsp; 19  And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall
 assure our hearts before him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The beloved apostle can scarcely touch upon the mention of sacred love, 
 but he must enlarge upon the enforcement of it, as here he does by 
 divers arguments and incentives thereto; as,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That it is a mark of our evangelical justification, of our 
 transition into a state of life: <I>We know that we have passed from 
 death to life, because we love the brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 We are by nature children of wrath and heirs of death. By the gospel 
 (the gospel-covenant or promise) our state towards another world is 
 altered and changed. We pass from death to life, from the guilt of 
 death to the right of life; and this transition is made upon our 
 believing in the Lord Jesus: <I>He that believeth on the Son hath 
 everlasting life,</I> and he that believeth not <I>hath the wrath of 
 God abiding on him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:36">John iii. 36</A>.

 Now this happy change of state we may come to be assured of: <I>We know
 that we have passed from death to life;</I> we may know it by the 
 evidences of our faith in Christ, of which this love to our brethren is 
 one, which leads us to characterize this love that is such a mark of 
 our justified state. It is not a zeal for a party in the common 
 religion, or an affection for, or an affectation of, those who are of 
 the same denomination and subordinate sentiments with ourselves. But
 this love,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Supposes a general love to mankind: the law of Christian love, in 
 the Christian community, is founded on the catholic law, in the society 
 of mankind, <I>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</I> Mankind 
 are to be loved principally on these two accounts:--

 (1.) As the excellent work of God, made by him, and made in wonderful
 resemblance of him. The reason that God assigns for the certain 
 punishment of a murderer is a reason against our hatred of any of the 
 brethren of mankind, and consequently a reason for our love to them: 
 <I>for in the image of God made he man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6">Gen. ix. 6</A>.

 (2.) As being, in some measure, beloved in Christ. The whole <I>race of
 mankind--the gens humana,</I> should be considered as being, in 
 distinction from fallen angels, a redeemed nation; as having a divine 
 Redeemer designed, prepared, and given for them. <I>So God loved the 
 world,</I> even this world, <I>that he gave his only-begotten Son, that 
 whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have everlasting 
 life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:16">John iii. 16</A>.

 A world so beloved of God should accordingly be loved by us. And this
 love will exert itself in earnest desires, and prayers, and attempts, 
 for the conversion and salvation of the yet uncalled blinded world.
 <I>My heart's desire and prayer for Israel are that they may be 
 saved.</I> And then this love will include all due love to enemies 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It includes a peculiar love to the Christian society, to the 
 catholic church, and that for the sake of her head, as being his body, 
 as being redeemed, justified, and sanctified in and by him; and this 
 love particularly acts and operates towards those of the catholic 
 church that we have opportunity of being personally acquainted with or 
 credibly informed of. They are not so much loved for their own sakes as 
 for the sake of God and Christ, who have loved them. And it is God and 
 Christ, or, if you will, the love of God and grace of Christ, that are 
 beloved and valued in them and towards them. And so this is the issue 
 of faith in Christ, and is thereupon a note of our passage from death 
 to life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The hatred of our brethren is, on the contrary, a sign of our 
 deadly state, of our continuance under the legal sentence of death: 
 <I>He that loveth not his brother</I> (his brother in Christ) 
 <I>abideth in death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He yet stands under the curse and condemnation of the law. This the 
 apostle argues by a clear syllogism: "You know that no murderer hath 
 eternal life abiding in him; but he who hates his brother is a 
 murderer; and therefore you cannot but know that he who hates his 
 brother hath not eternal life abiding in him," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Or, <I>he abideth in death,</I> as it is expressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 <I>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer;</I> for hatred of the 
 person is, so far as it prevails, a hatred of life and welfare, and 
 naturally tends to desire the extinction of it. Cain hated, and then 
 slew, his brother. Hatred will shut up the bowels of compassion from
 the poor brethren, and will thereby expose them to the sorrows of 
 death. And it has appeared that hatred of the brethren has in all ages 
 dressed them up in ill names, odious characters, and calumnies, and 
 exposed them to persecution and the sword. No wonder, then, that he who 
 has a considerable acquaintance with the heart of man, or is taught by 
 him who fully knows it, who knows the natural tendency and issue of 
 vile and violent passions, and knows withal the fulness of the divine 
 law, declares him who hates his brother to be <I>a murderer.</I> Now he 
 who by the frame and disposition of his heart is a murderer <I>cannot 
 have eternal life abiding in him;</I> for he who is such must needs be 
 carnally-minded, <I>and to be carnally-minded is death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:6">Rom. viii. 6</A>.
 
 The apostle, by the expression of <I>having eternal life abiding in
 us,</I> may seem to mean the possession of an internal principle of 
 endless life, according to that of the Saviour, <I>Whosoever drinketh 
 of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst,</I> shall never 
 be totally destitute thereof; <I>but the water that I shall give him 
 shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:14">John iv. 14</A>.

 And thereupon some may be apt to surmise that the passing from death to
 life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 does not signify the relative change made in our justification of life, 
 but the real change made in the regeneration to life; and accordingly 
 that the abiding in death mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>

 is continuance in spiritual death, as it is usually called, or abiding 
 in the corrupt deadly temper of nature. But as these passages more 
 naturally denote the state of the person, whether adjudged to life or 
 death, so the relative transition from death to life may well be proved 
 or disproved by the possession or non-possession of the inward 
 principle of eternal life, since washing from the guilt of sin is 
 inseparably united with washing from the filth and power of sin. <I>But 
 you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified, in the 
 name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11">1 Cor. vi. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The example of God and Christ should inflame our hearts with this 
 holy love: <I>Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down 
 his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the 
 brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The great God has given his Son to the death for us. But since this 
 apostle has declared that the <I>Word was God,</I> and that <I>he 
 became flesh for us,</I> I see not why we may not interpret this of God 
 the Word. Here is the love of God himself, of him who in his own person 
 is God, though not the Father, that he assumed a life, that he might 
 lay it down for us! Here is the condescension, the miracle, the mystery 
 of divine love, that God would redeem the church with his own blood! 
 Surely we should love those whom God hath loved, and so loved; and we 
 shall certainly do so if we have any love for God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The apostle, having proposed this flaming constraining example of 
 love, and motive to it, proceeds to show us what should be the temper 
 and effect of this our Christian love. And, 

 1. It must be, in the highest degree, so fervent as to make us willing
 to suffer even to death for the good of the church, for the safety and 
 salvation of the dear brethren: <I>And we ought to lay down our lives 
 for the brethren</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 either in our ministrations and services to them (<I>yea, and if I be
 offered upon the service and sacrifice of your faith, I joy and rejoice 
 with you all</I>--I shall congratulate your felicity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:17">Phil. ii. 17</A>),

 or in exposing ourselves to hazards, when called thereto, for the
 safety and preservation of those that are more serviceable to the glory 
 of God and the edification of the church than we can be. <I>Who have 
 for my life laid down their own necks; unto whom not only I give 
 thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:4">Rom. xvi. 4</A>.

 How mortified should the Christian be to this life! How prepared to
 part with it! And how well assured of a better!

 2. It must be, in the next degree, compassionate, liberal, and
 communicative to the necessities of the brethren: <I>For whoso hath 
 this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his 
 bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It pleases God that some of the Christian brethren should be poor, for 
 the exercise of the charity and love of those that are rich. And it 
 pleases the same God to give to some of the Christian brethren this 
 world's good, that they may exercise their grace in communicating to 
 the poor saints. And those who have this world's good must love a good 
 God more, and their good brethren more, and be ready to distribute it 
 for their sakes. It appears here that this love to the brethren is 
 founded upon love to God, in that it is here called so by the apostle: 
 <I>How dwelleth the love of God in him?</I> This love to the brethren 
 is love to God in them; and where there is none of this love to them 
 there is no true love to God at all. 

 3. I was going to intimate the third and lowest degree in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:18">next verse</A>;

 but the apostle has prevented me, by intimating that this last
 charitable communicative love, in persons of ability, is the lowest
 that can consist with the love of God. But there may be other fruits of 
 this love; and therefore the apostle desires that in all it should be 
 unfeigned and operative, as circumstances will allow: <I>My little 
 children</I> (my dear children in Christ), <I>let us not love in word, 
 neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Compliments and flatteries become not Christians; but the sincere 
 expressions of sacred affection, and the services or labours of love, 
 do. Then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. This love will evince our sincerity in religion, and give us hope 
 towards God: <I>And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall 
 assure our hearts before him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 It is a great happiness to be assured of our integrity in religion.
 Those that are so assured may have holy boldness or confidence towards 
 God; they may appeal to him from the censures and condemnation of the 
 world. The way to arrive at the knowledge of our own truth and 
 uprightness in Christianity, and to secure our inward peace, is to 
 abound in love and in the works of love towards the Christian 
 brethren.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart,
 and knoweth all things.
 &nbsp; 21  Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, <I>then</I> have we
 confidence toward God.
 &nbsp; 22  And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep
 his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his
 sight.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having intimated that there may be, even among us, such a 
 privilege as an assurance or sound persuasion of heart towards God, 
 proceeds here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To establish the court of conscience, and to assert the authority of 
 it: <I>For, if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and 
 knoweth all things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Our heart here is our self-reflecting judicial power, that noble 
 excellent ability whereby we can take cognizance of ourselves, of our 
 spirits, our dispositions, and actions, and accordingly pass a judgment 
 upon our state towards God; and so it is the same with conscience, or 
 the power of moral self-consciousness. This power can act as witness,
 judge, and executioner of judgment; it either accuses or excuses, 
 condemns or justifies; it is set and placed in this office by God 
 himself: <I>the spirit of man,</I> thus capacitated and empowered, 
 <I>is the candle of the Lord,</I> a luminary lighted and set up by the 
 Lord, <I>searching all the inward parts of the belly,</I> taking into 
 scrutiny and viewing the <I>penetralia--the private recesses</I> and 
 secret transactions of the inner man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:27">Prov. xx. 27</A>.

 Conscience is God's vicegerent, calls the court in his name, and acts
 for him. <I>The answer of a good conscience towards God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:21">1 Pet. iii. 21</A>.

 God is chief Judge of the court: <I>If our heart condemn us God is
 greater than our heart,</I> superior to our heart and conscience in 
 power and judgment; hence the act and judgment of the court are the act 
 and judgment of God; as, 

 1. If conscience condemn us, God does so too: <I>For, if our heart
 condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 God is a greater witness than our conscience, and knoweth more against 
 us than it does: <I>he knoweth all things;</I> he is a greater Judge 
 than conscience; for, as he is supreme, so his judgment shall stand, 
 and shall be fully and finally executed. This seems to be the design of 
 another apostle when he says, <I>For I know nothing by myself,</I> that 
 is, in the case wherein I am censured by some. "I am not conscious of 
 any guile, or allowed unfaithfulness, in my stewardship and ministry. 
 <I>Yet I am hereby justified;</I> it is not by my own conscience that I 
 must ultimately stand or fall; the justification or justifying sentence 
 of my conscience, or self-consciousness, will not determine the 
 controversy between you and me; as you do not appeal to its sentence, 
 so neither will you be determined by its decision; <I>but he that 
 judgeth me</I> (supremely and finally judgeth me), and by whose 
 judgment you and I must be determined, <I>is the Lord,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:4">1 Cor. iv. 4</A>.
 
 Or, 

 2. If conscience acquit us, God does so too: <I>Beloved, if our heart
 condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 then have we assurance that he accepts us now, and will acquit us in 
 the great day of account. But, possibly, some presumptuous soul may 
 here say, "I am glad of this; my heart does not condemn me, and 
 therefore I may conclude God does not." As, on the contrary, upon the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:20">foregoing verse</A>,

 some pious trembling soul will be ready to cry out, "God forbid! My
 heart or conscience condemns me, and must I then infallibly expect the 
 condemnation of God?" But let such know that the errors of the witness 
 are not here reckoned as the acts of the court; ignorance, error, 
 prejudice, partiality, and presumption, may be said to be faults of the 
 officers of the court, or of the attendants of the judge (as the mind, 
 the will, appetite, passion, sensual disposition, or disordered brain), 
 or of the jury, who give a false verdict, not of the judge itself; 
 <I>conscience</I>--<B><I>syneidesis,</I></B> is properly
 <I>self-consciousness.</I> Acts of ignorance and error are not acts of 
 self-consciousness, but of some mistaken power; and the court of 
 conscience is here described in its process, according to the original 
 constitution of it by God himself, according to which process what is 
 bound in conscience is bound in heaven; let conscience therefore be 
 heard, be well-informed, and diligently attended to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To indicate the privilege of those who have a good conscience 
 towards God. They have interest in heaven and in the court above; their 
 suits are heard there: <I>And whatsoever we ask we receive of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 It is supposed that the petitioners do not desire, or do not intend to 
 desire, any thing that is contrary to the honour and glory of the court 
 or to their own intended spiritual good, and then they may depend upon 
 receiving the good things they ask for; and this supposition may well 
 be made concerning the petitioners, or they may well be supposed to 
 receive the good things they ask for, considering their qualification 
 and practice: <I>Because we keep his commandments, and do those things 
 that are pleasing in his sight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Obedient souls are prepared for blessings, and they have promise of 
 audience; those who commit things displeasing to God cannot expect that 
 he should please them in hearing and answering their prayers,

 commandment.
 &nbsp; 24  And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he
 in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit
 which he hath given us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having mentioned keeping the commandments, and pleasing 
 God, as the qualification of effectual petitioners in and with Heaven, 
 here suitably proceeds,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To represent to us what those commandments primarily and summarily 
 are; they are comprehended in this double one: <I>And this is his 
 commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus 
 Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 To believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ is, 

 1. To discern what he is, according to his name, to have an
 intellectual view of his person and office, as the Son of God, and the 
 anointed Saviour of the world. <I>That every one that seeth the Son,
 and believeth on him, may have everlasting life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:40">John vi. 40</A>.

 2. To approve him in judgment and conscience, in conviction and
 consciousness of our case, as one wisely and wonderfully prepared and
 adapted for the whole work of eternal salvation. 

 3. To consent to him, and acquiesce in him, as our Redeemer and
 recoverer unto God.

 4. To trust to him, and rely upon him, for the full and final discharge
 of his saving office. <I>Those that know thy name will put their trust
 in thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:10">Ps. ix. 10</A>.

 <I>I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to
 keep that which I have committed unto him against that day,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:12">2 Tim. i. 12</A>.

 This faith is a needful requisite to those who would be prevalent
 petitioners with God, because it is by the Son that we must come to the
 Father; through his grace and righteousness our persons must be
 accepted or ingratiated with the Father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:6">Eph. i. 6</A>),

 through his purchase all our desired blessings must come, and through 
 his intercession our prayers must be heard and answered. This is the 
 first part of the commandment that must be observed by acceptable 
 worshippers; the second is that we <I>love one another, as he gave us 
 commandment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The command of Christ should be continually before our eyes. Christian
 love must possess our soul when we go to God in prayer. To this end we 
 must remember that our Lord obliges us,

 (1.) To forgive those who offend us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:14">Matt. vi. 14</A>),
 
 and, 

 (2.) To reconcile ourselves to those whom we have offended,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:23,24">Matt. v. 23, 24</A>.

 As good-will to men was proclaimed from heaven, so good-will to men,
 and particularly to the brethren, must be carried in the hearts of 
 those who go to God and heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To represent to us the blessedness of obedience to these commands. 
 The obedient enjoy communion with God: <I>And he that keepeth his 
 commandments,</I> and particularly those of faith and love, <I>dwelleth 
 in him, and he in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 We dwell in God by a happy relation to him, and spiritual union with 
 him, through his Son, and by a holy converse with him; and God dwells 
 in us by his word, and our faith fixed on him, and by the operations of 
 his Spirit. Then there occurs the trial of his divine inhabitation: 
 <I>And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he 
 hath given us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 by the sacred disposition and frame of soul that he hath conferred upon 
 us, which being a spirit of faith in God and Christ, and of love to God 
 and man, appears to be of God.</P>
