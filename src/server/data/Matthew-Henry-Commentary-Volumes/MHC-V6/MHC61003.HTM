 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle drawing towards the conclusion of his second epistle, 
 begins this last chapter with repeating the account of his design and 
 scope in writing a second time to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:1-2">ver. 1-2</A>.

 II. He proceeds to mention one thing that induced him to write this
 second epistle, namely, the coming of scoffers, whom he describes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:3-7">ver. 3-7</A>.

 III. He instructs and establishes them in the coming of our Lord Jesus
 Christ to judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 IV. He sets forth the use and improvement which Christians ought to 
 make of Christ's second coming, and that dissolution and renovation of 
 things which will accompany that solemn coming of our Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:11-18">ver. 11-18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in <I>both</I>
 which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
 &nbsp; 2  That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before
 by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles
 of the Lord and Saviour:
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 That the apostle might the better reach his end in writing this 
 epistle, which is to make them steady and constant in a fiducial and 
 practical remembrance of the doctrine of the gospel, he, 

 1. Expresses his special affection and tenderness for them, by calling
 them <I>beloved,</I> hereby evidencing that he <I>added to godliness 
 brotherly-kindness,</I> as he had

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:17"><I>ch.</I> i. 17</A>)

 exhorted them to do. Ministers must be examples of love and affection,
 as well as life and conversation.

 2. He evinces a sincere love to them, and hearty concern for them, by
 writing the same thing to them, though in other words. It being safe
 for them, it shall not be grievous to him to write upon the same
 subject, and pursue the same design, by those methods which are most
 likely to succeed.

 3. The better to recommend the matter, he tells them that what he would
 have them to remember are, 

 (1.) <I>The words spoken by the holy prophets,</I> who were divinely 
 inspired, both enlightened and sanctified by the Holy Ghost; and, 
 seeing these persons' minds were purified by the sanctifying operation 
 of the same Spirit, they were the better disposed to receive and retain 
 what came from God by the holy prophets. 

 (2.) <I>The commandments of the apostles of the Lord and Saviour;</I> 
 and therefore the disciples and servants of Christ ought to regard what 
 those who are sent by him have declared unto them to be the will of 
 their Lord. What God has spoken by the prophets of the Old Testament, 
 and Christ has commanded by the apostles of the New, cannot but demand 
 and deserve to be frequently remembered; and those who meditate on 
 these things will feel the quickening virtues thereof. It is by these 
 things the pure minds of Christians are to be stirred up, that they may 
 be active and lively in the work of holiness, and zealous and unwearied 
 in the way to heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days
 scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
 &nbsp; 4  And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the
 fathers fell asleep, all things continue as <I>they were</I> from the
 beginning of the creation.
 &nbsp; 5  For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of
 God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the
 water and in the water:
 &nbsp; 6  Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water,
 perished:
 &nbsp; 7  But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same
 word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of
 judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To quicken and excite us to a serious minding and firm adhering to what 
 God has revealed to us by the prophets and apostles, we are told that 
 there will be <I>scoffers,</I> men who will <I>make a mock of sin,</I> 
 and of salvation from it. God's way of saving sinners by Jesus Christ 
 is what men will scoff at, and that <I>in the last days,</I> under the 
 gospel. This indeed may seem very strange, that the New-Testament 
 dispensation of the covenant of grace, which is spiritual and therefore 
 more agreeable to the nature of God than the Old, should be ridiculed 
 and reproached; but the spirituality and simplicity of New-Testament 
 worship are directly contrary to the carnal mind of man, and this 
 accounts for what the apostle seems here to hint at, namely, that 
 scoffers shall be more numerous and more bold in the last days than 
 ever before. Though in all ages those who were born and walked after 
 the flesh persecuted, reviled, and reproached those who were born and 
 did walk after the Spirit, yet in the last days there will be a great 
 improvement in the art and impudence of bantering serious godliness, 
 and those who firmly adhere to the circumspection and self-denial which 
 the gospel prescribes. This is what is mentioned as a thing well known 
 to all Christians, and therefore they ought to reckon upon it, that 
 they may not be surprised and shaken, as if some strange thing happened 
 unto them. Now to prevent the true Christian's being overcome, when 
 attacked by these scoffers, we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What sort of persons they are: they <I>walk after their own 
 lusts,</I> they follow the devices and desires of their own hearts, and 
 carnal affections, not the dictates and directions of right reason and 
 an enlightened well-informed judgment. This they do in the course of 
 their conversation, they live as they list, and they speak as they 
 list; it is not only their inward minds that are evil and opposite to 
 God, as the mind of every unrenewed sinner is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:7">Rom. viii. 7</A>),

 alienated from God, ignorant of him, and averse to him; but they have 
 grown to such a height of wickedness that they proclaim openly what is 
 in the hearts of others who are yet carnal; they say, "Our tongues are 
 our own, and our strength, and time, and <I>who is lord over us?</I> 
 Who shall contradict or control us, or ever call us to an account for 
 what we say or do?" And, as they scorn to be confined by any laws of 
 God in their conversation, so neither will they bear that the 
 revelation of God should dictate and prescribe to them what they are to 
 believe; as they will walk in their own way, and talk their own 
 language, so will they also think their own thoughts, and form 
 principles which are altogether their own: here also <I>their own 
 lusts</I> alone shall be consulted by them. None but such accomplished 
 libertines as are here described can take a seat, at least they cannot 
 sit in the seat of the scornful. "By this you shall know them, that you 
 may the better be upon your guard against them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We also are forewarned how far they will proceed: they will attempt 
 to shake and unsettle us, even as to our belief of Christ's second 
 coming; they will scoffingly say, <I>Where is the promise of his 
 coming?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Without this, all the other articles of the Christian faith will 
 signify very little; this is that which fills up and gives the 
 finishing stroke to all the rest. The promised Messiah has come, he 
 <I>was made flesh, and dwelt among us;</I> he is altogether such a one 
 as in stated before, and has done all that for us which has been before 
 taken notice of. These principles the enemies of Christianity have all 
 along endeavoured to overturn; but as these all rest upon facts which 
 are already past, and of which this and the other apostles have given 
 us the most sure and satisfying evidence, it is probable that they will 
 at last grow weary of their opposition to them; and yet, while one very 
 principal article of our faith refers to what is still behind, and only 
 has a promise to rest upon, here they will still attack us, even to the 
 end of time. Till our Lord shall have come, they will not themselves 
 believe that he will come; nay, they will laugh at the very mention of 
 his second coming, and do what in them lies to put all out of 
 countenance who seriously believe and wait for it. Now therefore let us 
 see how this point stands, both on the believer's part and on the part 
 of these seducers: the believer not only desires that he may come, but, 
 having a promise that he will come, a promise that he himself has made 
 and often repeated, a promise received and reported by faithful 
 witnesses, and left upon sure record, he is also firmly and fully 
 persuaded that he will come: on the other hand, these seducers, because 
 they wish he never may, therefore do all that in them lies to cheat 
 themselves and others into a persuasion that he will never come. If 
 they cannot deny that there is a promise, yet they will laugh at that 
 very promise, which argues much higher degrees of infidelity and 
 contempt: <I>Where is the promise,</I> say they, <I>of his 
 coming?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are also forewarned of the method of their reasoning, for while 
 they laugh they will pretend to argue too. To this purpose they add 
 that <I>since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were 
 from the beginning of the creation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This is a subtle, though not a solid way of reasoning; it is apt to 
 make impressions upon weak minds, and especially upon wicked hearts. 
 <I>Because sentence against them is not speedily executed,</I> 
 therefore they flatter themselves that it never will, whereupon 
 <I>their hearts are fully set in them to do evil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:11">Eccl. viii. 11</A>);

 thus they act themselves, and thus they would persuade others to act; 
 so here, say they, "<I>The fathers have fallen asleep,</I> those are 
 all dead to whom <I>the promise was made,</I> and it was never made 
 good in their time, and there is no likelihood that it ever will be in 
 any time; why should we trouble ourselves about it? If there had been
 any truth or certainty in the promise you speak of, we should surely 
 have seen somewhat of it before this time, some signs of his coming, 
 some preparatory steps in order to it; whereas we find to this very day 
 <I>all things continue as they were,</I> without any change, even 
 <I>from the beginning of the creation.</I> Since the world has 
 undergone no changes in the course of so many thousand years, why 
 should we affright ourselves as if it were to have an end?" Thus do 
 these scoffers argue. <I>Because they see no changes, therefore they 
 fear not God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:19">Ps. lv. 19</A>.

 They neither fear him nor his judgments; what he never has done they
 would conclude he never can do or never will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is the falsehood of their argument detected. Whereas they 
 confidently had said there had not been any change <I>from the 
 beginning of the creation,</I> the apostle puts us in remembrance of a 
 change already past, which, in a manner, equals that which we are 
 called to expect and look for, which was the drowning of the world in 
 the days of Noah. This these scoffers had overlooked; they took no 
 notice of it. Though they might have known it, and ought to have known 
 it, yet <I>this they willingly are ignorant of</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 they choose to pass it over in silence, as if they had never heard or 
 known any thing of it; if they knew it, they did not like to retain it 
 in their knowledge; they did not receive this truth in the love of it, 
 neither did they care to own it. Note, It is hard to persuade men to 
 believe what they are not willing to find true; they are ignorant, in 
 many cases, because they are willing to be ignorant, and they do not 
 know because they do not care to know. But let not sinners think that 
 such ignorance as this will be admitted as an excuse for whatever sin 
 it may betray them into. Those who crucified Christ did not know who he 
 was; for <I>had they known they would not have crucified the Lord of 
 glory</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>);

 but, though ignorant, they were not therefore innocent; their ignorance
 itself was a sin, willing and wilful ignorance, and one sin can be no 
 excuse for another. So it is here; had these known of the dreadful 
 vengeance with which God swept away a whole world of ungodly wretches 
 at once, they would not surely have scoffed at his threatenings of any 
 after equally terrible judgment; but here <I>they were willingly 
 ignorant,</I> they did not know what God had done because they had no 
 mind to know it. Now therefore we shall proceed to consider the 
 representation which the apostle here lays down both of the destruction 
 of the old world by water and that which awaits this present world at 
 the final conflagration. He mentions the one as what God has done, to 
 convince and persuade us the rather to believe that the other both may 
 be and will be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We begin with the apostle's account of the destruction which has 
 once already come upon the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 <I>By the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing 
 out of the water and in the water, whereby the world that then was, 
 being overflowed with water, perished.</I> Originally the world was 
 otherwise situated, the waters were most wisely divided at the creation 
 and most beneficially for us; some of the waters had proper 
 repositories above the firmament, here called the heavens (as it is 
 also 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:8">Gen. i. 8</A>),

 and others, under the firmament, gathered together unto one place; 
 there were then both sea and dry land, commodious habitation for the 
 children of men. But now, at the time of the universal deluge, the case 
 is strangely altered; the waters which God had divided before, 
 assigning to each part its convenient receptacle, now does he, in 
 anger, throw together again in a heap. <I>He breaks up the fountain of 
 the great deep, and throws open the windows (that is, the clouds) of 
 heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:11">Gen. vii. 11</A>),

 till the whole earth is overflowed with water, and not a spot can be 
 found upon the highest mountains but what is <I>fifteen cubits under 
 water,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:20">Gen. vii. 20</A>.

 Thus he made known at once his terrible power and his fierce anger, and
 made an end of a whole world at once: <I>The world that then was, being
 overflowed with water, perished,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Is not here a change and a most awful change! And then it is to be 
 observed that all this was done by the word of God; it was by his 
 powerful word that the world was made at first, and made in so 
 commodious and beautiful a frame and order,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:3">Heb. xi. 3</A>,

 <B><I>Katertisthai</I></B>. <I>He said, Let there be a firmament,</I>
 &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:6,7">Gen. i. 6, 7</A>.

 <I>And let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one
 place,</I> &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 Thus he spoke, and it was done,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:9">Ps. xxxiii. 9</A>.

 Thus, says our apostle, <I>by the word of the Lord the heavens
 were,</I> as they were <I>of old</I> (that is, at first creation)
 <I>and the earth</I> (as it was at first a terraqueous globe)
 <I>standing out of the water and in the water.</I> Not is it only the
 first frame and order of the world that is here said to be <I>by the
 word of God,</I> but the after-confusion and ruin of the world, as well
 as the utter destruction of its inhabitants, were also by the same
 word; none but that God who <I>stretched out the heavens and laid the
 foundation of the earth</I> could destroy and overthrow such a vast
 fabric at once. This was done by the word of his power, and it was also
 done according to the word of his promise; God had said that he would
 destroy man, even all flesh, and that he would do it by bringing a
 flood of waters upon the earth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:7,13,17">Gen. vi. 7, 13, 17</A>.

 This was the change which God had before brought upon the world, and
 which these scoffers had overlooked; and now we are to consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the apostle says of the destructive change which is yet to come 
 upon it: <I>The heavens and the earth, which now are, by the same word 
 are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and 
 perdition of ungodly men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Here we have an awful account of the final dissolution of the world, 
 and which we are yet more nearly concerned in. The ruin that came upon 
 the world and its inhabitants by the flood, we read, and hear, and 
 think of, with concern, though those who were swept away by it were 
 such as we never knew; but the judgment here spoken of is yet to come, 
 and will surely come, though we know not when, nor upon what particular 
 age or generation of men; and therefore we are not, we cannot be, sure 
 that it may not happen in our own times: and this makes a very great 
 difference, though it should be admitted that they were equal in every 
 other respect, which yet must not be allowed, for there were some, 
 though very few, who escaped that deluge, but not one can escape in 
 this conflagration. Besides, we were not in reach of the one, but are 
 not sure that we shall not be included in the other calamity. Now 
 therefore to see the world to which we belong destroyed at once--not a 
 single person only, not a particular family only, nor yet a nation 
 (even that which we are most nearly interested in and concerned for), 
 but the whole world, I say, sinking at once, and no ark provided, no 
 possible way left of escaping for any one from the common ruin, this 
 makes a difference between the desolation that has been and what we yet 
 are to expect. The one is already past, and never to return upon us any 
 more (for God has said expressly <I>that there shall never any more be 
 a flood to destroy the earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:11-17">Gen. ix. 11-17</A>);

 the other is still behind, and is as certain to come as the truth and
 the power of God can make it: the one came gradually upon the world, 
 and was growing upon its inhabitants forty days, before it made an 
 utter end of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:12,17">Gen. vii. 12, 17</A>);

 this other will come upon them swiftly and all at once

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:1">2 Pet. ii. 1</A>):

 besides, there were in that overthrow (as we have said) a few who
 escaped, but the ruin which yet awaits this world, whenever it comes, 
 will be absolutely a universal one; there will not be any part but what 
 the devouring flames will seize upon, not a sanctuary left any where 
 for the inhabitants to flee to, not a single spot in all this world 
 where any one of them can be safe. Thus, whatever differences may be 
 assigned between that destruction of the world and this here spoken of, 
 they do indeed represent the approaching as the most terrible judgment; 
 yet that the world has once been destroyed by a universal deluge 
 renders it the more credible that it may be again ruined by a universal 
 conflagration. Let therefore the scoffers, who laugh at the coming of 
 our Lord to judgment, at least consider that it <I>may be.</I> There is 
 nothing said of it in the word of God but what is within reach of the 
 power of God, and, though they still should laugh, they shall not put 
 us out of countenance; we are well assured that it will be, because he 
 has said it, and we can depend upon his <I>promise.</I> They <I>err, 
 not knowing</I> (at least not believing) <I>the scriptures, nor the 
 power of God;</I> but we know, and we do or ought to depend upon, both. 
 Now that which he has said, and which he will certainly make good, is 
 that <I>the heavens and the earth which now are</I> (which we are now 
 related to, which still subsist in all the beauty and order in which we 
 see them, and which are so agreeable and useful to us, as we find they 
 are) <I>are kept in store,</I> not to be, what earthly minds would wish 
 to have them, treasures for us, but to be what God will have them, in 
 his treasury, securely lodged and kept safely for his purposes. It 
 follows, they are <I>reserved unto fire.</I> Observe, God's following 
 judgments are more terrible than those which went before; the old world 
 was destroyed by water, but this is reserved unto fire, which shall 
 burn up the wicked at the last day; and, though this seems to be 
 delayed, yet, as this wicked world is upheld by the word of God, so it 
 is only reserved for the vengeance of him to whom vengeance belongs, 
 who will at the day of judgment deal with an ungodly world according to 
 their deserts, for the day of judgment is the day of <I>the perdition 
 of ungodly men.</I> Those who now scoff at a future judgment shall find 
 it a day of vengeance and utter destruction. "Beware therefore of being 
 among these scoffers; never question but the day of the Lord will come; 
 give diligence therefore to be found in Christ, that that may be a time 
 of refreshment and day of redemption to you which will be a day of 
 indignation and wrath to the ungodly world."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day
 <I>is</I> with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as
 one day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle comes in these words to instruct and establish Christians 
 in the truth of the coming of the Lord, where we may clearly discern 
 the tenderness and affection wherewith he speaks to them, calling them 
 <I>beloved;</I> he had a compassionate concern and a love of good-will 
 for the ungodly wretches who refused to believe divine revelation, but 
 he has a peculiar respect for the true believers, and the remaining 
 ignorance and weakness that the apprehends to be in them make him 
 jealous, and put him on giving them a caution. Here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The truth which the apostle asserts--<I>that with the Lord one day is
 as a thousand years, and a thousand years are as one day.</I> Though, 
 in the account of men, there is a great deal of difference between a 
 day and a year, and a vast deal more between one day and a thousand 
 years, yet in the account of God, who inhabits eternity, in which there 
 is no succession, there is no difference; for all things past, present, 
 and future, are ever before him, and the delay of a thousand years 
 cannot be so much to him as the deferring of any thing for a day or an 
 hour is to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The importance of this truth: This is the <I>one thing</I> the 
 apostle would not have us ignorant of; a holy awe and reverential fear 
 of God are necessary in order to our worshiping and glorifying him, and 
 a belief of the inconceivable distance between him and us is very 
 proper to beget and maintain that religious fear of the Lord which is 
 the beginning of wisdom. This is a truth that belongs to our peace, and 
 therefore he endeavours that it may not be hidden from our eyes; as it 
 is in the original, <I>Let not this one thing be hidden from you.</I> 
 If men have no knowledge or belief of the eternal God, they will be 
 very apt to think him such a one as themselves. Yet how hard is it to 
 conceive of eternity! It is therefore not very easy to attain such a 
 knowledge of God as is absolutely necessary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men
 count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing
 that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
 &nbsp; 10  But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night;
 in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and
 the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the
 works that are therein shall be burned up.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told that <I>the Lord is not slack</I>--he does not delay
 beyond the appointed time; as God kept the time that he had appointed 
 for the delivering of Israel out of Egypt, to a day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:41">Exod. xii. 41</A>),

 so he will keep to the time appointed in coming to judge the world.
 What a difference is there between the account which God makes and that 
 which men make! Good men are apt to think God stays beyond the 
 appointed time, that is, the time which they have set for their own and 
 the church's deliverance; but they set one time and God sets another, 
 and he will not fail to keep the day which he has appointed. Ungodly 
 men dare charge a culpable slackness upon God, as if he had slipped the 
 time, and laid aside the thoughts of coming. But the apostle assures 
 us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That what men count slackness is truly <I>long-suffering,</I> and 
 that <I>to us-ward;</I> it is giving more time to his own people, 
 <I>whom he has chosen before the foundation of the world,</I> many of 
 whom are not as yet converted; and those who are in a state of grace 
 and favour with God are to advance in knowledge and holiness, and in 
 the exercise of faith and patience, to abound in good works, doing and 
 suffering what they are called to, that they may bring glory to God, 
 and improve in a meetness for heaven; for God is not willing that any 
 of these should perish, but that all of them should come to repentance. 
 Here observe, 

 1. Repentance is absolutely necessary in order to salvation. <I>Except
 we repent, we shall perish,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:3,5">Luke xiii. 3, 5</A>.

 2. God has no delight in the death of sinners: as the punishment of
 sinners is a torment to his creatures, a merciful God does not take 
 pleasure in it; and though the principal design of God in his 
 long-suffering is the blessedness of those <I>whom he has chosen to 
 salvation, through sanctification of the spirit, and belief of the 
 truth,</I> yet his goodness and forbearance do in their own nature 
 invite and call to repentance all those to whom they are exercised; 
 and, if men continue impenitent when God gives them space to repent, he 
 will deal more severely with them, though the great reason why he did 
 not hasten his coming was because he had not accomplished <I>the number 
 of his elect.</I> "Abuse not therefore the patience and long-suffering 
 of God, by abandoning yourselves to a course of ungodliness; presume 
 not to go on boldly in the way of sinners, nor to sit down securely in 
 an unconverted impenitent state, as he who said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:48">Matt. xxiv. 48</A>),

 <I>My Lord delayeth his coming,</I> lest he come and surprise you;"
 for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Here we may observe, 

 1. The certainty of the day of the Lord: though it is now above sixteen 
 hundred years since this epistle was written, and the day has not yet 
 come, it assuredly will come. God has <I>appointed a day wherein he 
 will judge the world in righteousness,</I> and he will keep his 
 appointment. <I>It is appointed to men once to die, and after this the 
 judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:27">Heb. ix. 27</A>.

 "Settle it therefore in your hearts that the day of the Lord will
 certainly come, and you shall certainly be called to give an account of 
 all things done in the body, whether good or evil; and let your exact 
 walking before God, and your frequent judging yourselves, evidence your 
 firm belief of a future judgment, when many live as if they were never 
 to give any account at all."

 2. The suddenness of this day: It <I>will come as a thief in the
 night,</I> at a time when men are sleeping and secure, and have no 
 manner of apprehension or expectation of the day of the Lord, any more 
 than men have of a thief when they are in a deep sleep, in the dark and 
 silent night. <I>At midnight there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom 
 comes,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:6">Matt. xxv. 6</A>),

 and at that time not only the foolish, but also the wise virgins
 slumbered and slept. <I>The Lord will come in a day when we look not 
 for him, and an hour when men are not aware.</I> The time which men 
 think to be the most improper and unlikely, and when therefore they are 
 most secure, will be the time of the Lord's coming. Let us then beware 
 how we in our thoughts and imaginations put that day far away from us; 
 but rather suppose it to be so much nearer in reality, by how much 
 further off it is in the opinion of the ungodly world. 

 3. The solemnity of this coming.

 (1.) <I>The heavens shall pass away with a great noise.</I> The visible 
 heavens, as unable to abide when the Lord shall come in his glory, 
 shall pass away; they shall undergo a mighty alteration, and this shall 
 be very sudden, and with such a noise as the breaking and tumbling down 
 of so great a fabric must necessarily occasion. 

 (2.) <I>The elements shall melt with fervent heat.</I> At this coming 
 of the Lord it shall not only be very <I>tempestuous round about 
 him,</I> so that the very heavens shall pass away as in a mighty 
 violent storm, but <I>a fire shall go before him, that shall melt the 
 elements</I> of which the creatures are composed.

 (3.) <I>The earth also, and all the works that are therein, shall be 
 burnt up.</I> The earth, and its inhabitants, and all the works that 
 are therein, shall be burnt up. The earth, and its inhabitants, and all 
 the works, whether of nature or art, shall be destroyed. The stately 
 palaces and gardens, and all the desirable things wherein 
 worldly-minded men seek and place their happiness, all of them shall be 
 burnt up; all sorts of creatures which God has made, and all the works 
 of men, must submit, all must pass through the fire, which shall be a 
 consuming fire to all that sin has brought into the world, though it 
 may be a refining fire to the works of God's hand, that the glass of 
 the creation being made much brighter the saints may much better 
 discern the glory of the Lord therein.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And now who can but observe what a difference there will be between the 
 first coming of Christ and the second! Yet that is called <I>the great 
 and dreadful day of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:5">Mal. iv. 5</A>.

 How much more dreadful must this coming to judgment be! May we be so
 wise as to prepare for it, that it may not be a day of vengeance and 
 destruction unto us. O! what will become of us, if we set our 
 affections on this earth, and make it our portion, seeing all these 
 things shall be burnt up? Look out therefore, and make sure of a 
 happiness beyond this visible world, which must all be melted down.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  <I>Seeing</I> then <I>that</I> all these things shall be dissolved,
 what manner <I>of persons</I> ought ye to be in <I>all</I> holy
 conversation and godliness,
 &nbsp; 12  Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God,
 wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the
 elements shall melt with fervent heat?
 &nbsp; 13  Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new
 heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
 &nbsp; 14  Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be
 diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and
 blameless.
 &nbsp; 15  And account <I>that</I> the longsuffering of our Lord <I>is</I>
 salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the
 wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
 &nbsp; 16  As also in all <I>his</I> epistles, speaking in them of these
 things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which
 they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as <I>they do</I> also the
 other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
 &nbsp; 17  Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know <I>these things</I> before,
 beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked,
 fall from your own stedfastness.
 &nbsp; 18  But grow in grace, and <I>in</I> the knowledge of our Lord and
 Saviour Jesus Christ. To him <I>be</I> glory both now and for ever.
 Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having instructed them in the doctrine of Christ's second 
 coming,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Takes occasion thence to exhort them to purity and godliness in 
 their whole conversation: all the truths which are revealed in 
 scripture should be improved for our advancement in practical 
 godliness: this is the effect that knowledge must produce, or we are 
 never the better for it. <I>If you know these things, happy are you if 
 you do them. Seeing all these things must be dissolved, how holy should 
 we be,</I> that are assured of it, departing from and dying to sin, 
 that has so corrupted and defiled all the visible creation that there 
 is an absolute need of its dissolution! All that was made for man's use 
 is subject to vanity by man's sin: and if the sin of man has brought 
 the visible heavens, and the elements and earth, under a curse, from 
 which they cannot be freed without being dissolved, what an abominable 
 evil is sin, and how much to be hated by us! And, inasmuch as this 
 dissolution is in order to their being restored to their primitive 
 beauty and excellency, how pure and holy should we be, in order to our 
 being fit for the <I>new heaven and new earth, wherein dwelleth 
 righteousness!</I> It is a very exact and universal holiness that he 
 exhorts to, not resting in any lower measure or degree, but labouring 
 to be eminent beyond what is commonly attained--holy in God's house and
 in our own, holy in our worshipping of God and in our conversing with 
 men. All our conversation, whether with high or low, rich or poor, good 
 or bad, friends or enemies, must be holy. We must <I>keep ourselves 
 unspotted from the world</I> in all our converses with it. We must be 
 <I>perfecting holiness in the fear of God,</I> and in the love of God 
 too. We must <I>exercise ourselves unto godliness</I> of all sorts, in 
 all its parts, trusting in God and delighting in God only, who 
 continues the same when the whole visible creation shall be dissolved, 
 devoting ourselves to the service of God, and designing the glorifying 
 and enjoyment of God, who endures for ever; whereas what worldly men 
 delight in and follow after must all be dissolved. Those things which 
 we now see must in a little while pass away, and be no more as they now 
 are: let us look therefore at what shall abide and continue, which, 
 though it be not present, is certain and not far off. This <I>looking 
 for the day of God</I> is one of the directions the apostle gives us, 
 in order to our being eminently <I>holy and godly in all manner of 
 conversation.</I> "Look for the day of God as what you firmly believe 
 shall come, and what you earnestly long for." <I>The coming of the day 
 of God</I> is what every Christian must hope for and earnestly expect; 
 for it is a day when Christ shall <I>appear in the glory of the 
 Father,</I> and evidence his divinity and Godhead even to those who 
 counted him a mere man. The first coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, when 
 he <I>appeared in the form of a servant,</I> was what the people of God 
 earnestly waited and looked for: that coming was for <I>the consolation 
 of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:25">Luke ii. 25</A>.

 How much more should they wait with expectation and earnestness for his
 second coming, which will be the day of their complete redemption, and 
 of his most glorious manifestation! Then he shall <I>come to be admired 
 in his saints, and glorified in all those that believe.</I> For though 
 it cannot but terrify and affright the ungodly to see the visible 
 heavens all in a flame, and the elements melting, yet the believer, 
 whose <I>faith is the evidence of things not seen,</I> can rejoice in 
 hope of more glorious heavens after these have been melted and refined 
 by that dreadful fire which shall burn up all the dross of this visible 
 creation. Here we must take notice, 

 1. What true Christians look for: <I>new heavens and a new earth,</I>
 in which a great deal more of the wisdom, power and goodness of our 
 great God and Saviour Jesus Christ will be clearly discerned than we 
 are able to discover in what we now see; for in these new heavens and 
 earth, freed from the vanity the former were subject to, and the sin 
 they were polluted with, only righteousness shall dwell; this is to be 
 the habitation of such righteous persons as do righteousness, and are 
 free from the power and pollution of sin; <I>all the wicked shall be 
 turned into hell;</I> those only who are clothed with a righteousness 
 of Christ, and sanctified by the Holy Ghost, shall be admitted to dwell 
 in this holy place.

 2. What is the ground and foundation of this expectation and
 hope--<I>the promise of God.</I> To look for any thing which God has 
 not promised is presumption; but if our expectations are according to 
 the promise, both as to the things we look for and the time and way of 
 their being brought about, we cannot meet with a disappointment; <I>for 
 he is faithful who has promised.</I> "See therefore that you raise and 
 regulate your expectations of all the great things that are to come 
 according to the word of God; and, as to <I>the new heaven and new 
 earth,</I> look for them as God has allowed and directed by the 
 passages we have in this portion of scripture how before you, and in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:17,66:22">Isa. lxv. 17; lxvi. 22</A>,

 to which the apostle may be thought to allude."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>

 he exhorts to holiness from the consideration that <I>the heavens and
 the earth shall be dissolved,</I> so in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>

 he resumes his exhortation from the consideration that they shall be 
 again renewed. "Seeing you expect the day of God, when our Lord Jesus
 Christ will appear in his glorious majesty, and these heavens and earth 
 shall be dissolved and melted down, and, being purified and refined, 
 shall be erected and rebuilt, prepare to meet him. It nearly concerns 
 you to see in what state you will be when the Judge of all the world 
 shall come to pass sentence upon men, and to determine how it shall be 
 with them to all eternity. This is the court of judicature whence there 
 lies no appeal; whatever sentence is here passed by this great Judge is 
 irreversible; therefore get ready to <I>appear before the judgment-seat 
 of Christ:</I> and see to it,"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. "That you be <I>found of him in peace,</I> in a state of peace and 
 reconciliation with God through Christ, in whom alone God is 
 <I>reconciling the world to himself.</I> All that are out of Christ are 
 in a state of enmity, and reject and oppose the Lord and his anointed, 
 and shall therefore <I>be punished with everlasting destruction from 
 the presence of the Lord, and the glory of his power.</I> Those whose 
 sins are pardoned and their peace made with God are the only safe and 
 happy people; therefore follow after peace, and that with all." 

 (1.) Peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. 

 (2.) Peace in our own consciences, through the Spirit of grace 
 witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God. 

 (3.) Peace with men, by having a calm and peaceable disposition wrought 
 in us, resembling that of our blessed Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That you be <I>found of Christ without spot, and blameless. Follow 
 after holiness</I> as well as peace: and even spotless and perfect; we 
 must not only take heed of all spots which are not the spots of God's 
 children (this only prevents our being found of men without spot), we 
 must be pressing towards spotless purity, absolute perfection. 
 Christians must be <I>perfecting holiness,</I> that they may be not 
 only blameless before men, but also in the sight of God; and all this 
 deserves and needs the greatest diligence; he who does this work 
 negligently can never do it successfully. "Never expect to be found at 
 that day of God in peace, if you are lazy and idle in this your day, in 
 which we must finish the work that is given us to do. It is only the 
 diligent Christian who will be the happy Christian in the day of the 
 Lord. Our Lord will suddenly come to us, or shortly call us to him; and 
 would you have him find you idle?" Remember there is a curse denounced 
 against him <I>who does the work of the Lord negligently,</I> Marg. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:10">Jer. xlviii. 10</A>.

 Heaven will be a sufficient recompence for all our diligence and
 industry; therefore let us labour and take pains in the work of the 
 Lord; he will certainly reward us if we be diligent in the work he has 
 allotted us; now, that you may be diligent, <I>account the 
 long-suffering of our Lord to be salvation.</I> "Does your Lord delay 
 his coming? Do not think this is to give more time to make provision 
 for your lusts, to gratify them; it is so much space to repent and work 
 out your salvation. It proceeds not from a want of concern or 
 compassion for his suffering servants, nor is it designed to give 
 countenance and encouragement to the world of the ungodly, but that men 
 may have time to prepare for eternity. Learn then to make a right use 
 of the patience of our Lord, who does as yet delay his coming. Follow 
 after peace and holiness, or else his coming will be dreadful to you." 
 And inasmuch as it is difficult to prevent men's abuse of God's 
 patience, and engage them in the right improvement thereof, our apostle 
 quotes St. Paul as directing men to make the same good use of the 
 divine forbearance, that in the mouth, or from the pen, of two apostles 
 the truth might be confirmed. And we may here observe with what esteem 
 and affection he speaks of him who had formerly publicly withstood and 
 sharply reproved Peter. If a righteous man smite one who is truly 
 religious, it shall be received as a kindness; and let him reprove, it 
 shall be as an excellent oil, which shall soften and sweeten the good 
 man that is reproved when he does amiss. What an honourable mention 
 does this apostle of the circumcision make of that very man who had 
 openly, <I>before all, reproved him,</I> as not walking uprightly 
 according to the truth of the gospel!

 (1.) He calls him <I>brother,</I> whereby he means not only that he is 
 a fellow-christian (in which sense the word brethren is used

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:27">1 Thess. v. 27</A>),

 or a fellow-preacher (in which sense Paul calls Timothy the evangelist
 a <I>brother,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:1">Col. i. 1</A>),

 but a fellow-apostle, one who had the same extraordinary commission,
 immediately from Christ himself, to preach the gospel in every place, 
 and to disciple all nations. Though many seducing teachers denied 
 Paul's apostleship, yet Peter owns him to be an apostle.

 (2.) He calls him <I>beloved;</I> and they being both alike 
 commissioned, and both united in the same service of the same Lord, it 
 would have been very unseemly if they had not been united in affection 
 to one another, for the strengthening of one another's hands, mutually 
 desirous of, and rejoicing in, one another's success. 

 (3.) He mentions Paul as one who had an uncommon measure of wisdom 
 given unto him. He was a person of eminent knowledge in the mysteries 
 of the gospel, and did neither in that nor any other qualification come 
 behind any of all the other apostles. How desirable is it that those 
 who preach the same gospel should treat one another according to the 
 pattern Peter here sets them! It is surely their duty to endeavour, by
 proper methods, to prevent or remove all prejudices that hinder 
 ministers' usefulness, and to beget and improve the esteem and respect 
 in the minds of people towards their ministers that may promote the 
 success of their labours. And let us also here observe,

 [1.] The excellent wisdom that was in Paul is said to be <I>given</I> 
 him. The understanding and knowledge that qualify men to preach the 
 gospel are the gift of God. We must seek for knowledge, and labour to 
 get understanding, in hopes that it shall be given us from above, while 
 we are diligent in using proper means to attain it.

 [2.] The apostle imparts to men according as he had received from God. 
 He endeavours to lead others as far as he himself was led into the 
 knowledge of the mysteries of the gospel. He is not an intruder into 
 the things he had not seen or been fully assured of, and yet he does 
 not fail to declare the whole counsel of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:27">Acts xx. 27</A>.

 [3.] The epistles which were written by the apostle of the Gentiles,
 and directed to those Gentiles who believed in Christ, are designed for 
 the instruction and edification of those who from among the Jews were 
 brought to believe in Christ; for it is generally thought that what is 
 here alluded to is contained in the epistle to the Romans

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:4"><I>ch.</I> ii. 4</A>),

 though in all his epistles there are some things that refer to one or
 other of the subjects treated of in this and the foregoing chapter; and 
 it cannot seem strange that those who were pursuing the same general 
 design should in their epistles insist upon the same things. But the 
 apostle Peter proceeds to tell us that in those things which are to be 
 met with in Paul's epistles there are some things hard to be 
 understood. Among the variety of subjects treated of in scripture, some 
 are not easy to be understood because of their own obscurity, such are 
 prophecies; others cannot be so easily understood because of their 
 excellency and sublimity, as the mysterious doctrines; and others are 
 with difficulty taken in because of the weakness of men's minds, such 
 are the things of the Spirit of God, mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:14">1 Cor. ii. 14</A>.

 And here the unlearned and unstable make wretched work; for they wrest
 and torture the scriptures, to make them speak what the Holy Ghost did 
 not intend. Those who are not well instructed and well established in
 the truth are in great danger of perverting the word of God. Those who 
 have heard and learned of the Father are best secured from 
 misunderstanding and misapplying any part of the word of God; and, 
 where there is a divine power to establish as well as to instruct men 
 in divine truth, persons are effectually secured from falling into 
 errors. How great a blessing this is we learn by observing what is the 
 pernicious consequence of the errors that ignorant and unstable men 
 fall into--even their own destruction. Errors in particular concerning 
 the holiness and justice of God are the utter ruin of multitudes of 
 men. Let us therefore earnestly pray for the Spirit of God to instruct 
 us in the truth, that we may know it as it is in Jesus, and have our 
 hearts established with grace, that we may stand firm and unshaken, 
 even in the most stormy times, when others are tossed to and fro with 
 every wind of doctrine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle gives them a word of caution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>,
 
 where,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He intimates that the knowledge we have of these things should make 
 us very wary and watchful, inasmuch as there is a twofold danger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 (1.) We are in great danger <I>of</I> being seduced, and turned away 
 from the truth. The unlearned and unstable, and they are very numerous, 
 do generally wrest the scripture. Many who have the scriptures and read 
 them do not understand what they read; and too many of those who have a 
 right understanding of the sense and meaning of the word are not 
 established in the belief of the truth, and all these are liable to 
 fall into error. Few attain to the knowledge and acknowledgment of 
 doctrinal Christianity; and fewer find, so as to keep in the way of 
 practical godliness, which is the narrow way, which only leadeth unto 
 life. There must be a great deal of self-denial and suspicion of 
 ourselves, and submitting to the authority of Christ Jesus our great 
 prophet, before we can heartily receive all the truths of the gospel, 
 and therefore we are in great danger of rejecting the truth.

 (2.) We are in great danger <I>by</I> being seduced; for, 

 [1.] So far as we are turned from the truth <I>so far are we turned out 
 of the way to true blessedness,</I> into the path which leads to 
 destruction. If men corrupt the word of God, it tends to their own 
 utter ruin.

 [2.] When men wrest the word of God, <I>they fall into the error of the 
 wicked,</I> men without law, who keep to no rules, set no bounds to 
 themselves, a sort of free-thinkers, which the psalmist detests.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:113">Ps. cxix. 113</A>,

 <I>I hate vain thoughts, but thy law do I love.</I> Whatever opinions
 and thoughts of men are not conformable to the law of God, and 
 warranted by it, the good man disclaims and abhors; they are the 
 conceits and counsels of the ungodly, who have forsaken God's law, and, 
 if we imbibe their opinions, we shall too soon imitate their practices.
 
 [3.] Those who are led away by error <I>fall from their own 
 stedfastness.</I> They are wholly unhinged and unsettled, and know not 
 where to rest, but are at the greatest uncertainty, like a wave of the 
 sea, driven with the wind and tossed. It nearly concerns us therefore 
 to be upon our guard, seeing the danger is so great.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That we may the better avoid being led away, the apostle directs us 
 what to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 And,

 (1.) We must <I>grow in grace.</I> He had in the beginning of the 
 epistle exhorted us to add one grace to another, and here he advises us 
 to grow in all grace, in faith, and virtue, and knowledge. By how much 
 the stronger grace is in us, by so much the more stedfast shall we be 
 in the truth. 

 (2.) We must grow <I>in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</I> 
 "Follow on to know the Lord. Labour to know him more clearly and more
 fully, to know more of Christ and to know him to better purpose, so as 
 to be more like him and to love him better." This is the knowledge of 
 Christ the apostle Paul reached after and desired to attain,

 Such a knowledge of Christ as conforms us more to him, and endears him
 more to us, must needs be of great use to us, to preserve us from 
 falling off in times of general apostasy; and those who experience this 
 effect of the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ will, upon 
 receiving such grace from him, give thanks and praise to him, and join 
 with our apostle in saying, <I>To him be glory both now and for ever.
 Amen.</I></P>
