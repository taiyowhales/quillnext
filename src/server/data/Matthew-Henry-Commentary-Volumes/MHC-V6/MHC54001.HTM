 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God
 our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, <I>which is</I> our hope;
 &nbsp; 2  Unto Timothy, <I>my</I> own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, <I>and</I>
 peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
 &nbsp; 3  As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went
 into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no
 other doctrine,
 &nbsp; 4  Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which
 minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith:
 <I>so do.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The inscription of the epistle, from whom it is sent: <I>Paul an 
 apostle of Jesus Christ,</I> constituted an apostle <I>by the 
 commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ.</I> His 
 credentials were unquestionable. He had not only a commission, but a 
 commandment, not only from God our Saviour, but from Jesus Christ: he 
 was a preacher of the gospel of Christ, and a minister of the kingdom
 of Christ. Observe, God is our Saviour.--<I>Jesus Christ, who is our
 hope.</I> Observe, Jesus Christ is a Christian's hope; our hope is in
 him, all our hope of eternal life is built upon him; Christ is in us
 the hope of glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:27">Col. i. 27</A>.

 He calls Timothy his own son, because he had been an instrument of his
 conversion, and because he had been a son that served him, served with
 him in the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:22">Phil. ii. 22</A>.

 Timothy had not been wanting in the duty of a son to Paul, and Paul was 
 not wanting in the care and tenderness of a father to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The benediction is, <I>grace, mercy, and peace, from God our 
 Father.</I> Some have observed that whereas in all the epistles to the 
 churches the apostolical benediction is <I>grace and peace,</I> in 
 these two epistles to Timothy and that to Titus it is <I>grace, mercy, 
 and peace:</I> as if ministers had more need of God's mercy than other 
 men. Ministers need more grace than others, to discharge their duty 
 faithfully; and they need more mercy than others, to pardon what is 
 amiss in them: and if Timothy, so eminent a minister, must be indebted 
 to the mercy of God, and needed the increase and continuance of it, how 
 much more do we ministers, in these times, who have so little of his 
 excellent spirit!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Paul tells Timothy what was the end of his appointing him to this 
 office: <I>I besought thee to abide at Ephesus.</I> Timothy had a mind 
 to go with Paul, was loth to go from under his wing, but Paul would 
 have it so; it was necessary for the public service: <I>I besought 
 thee,</I> says he. Though he might assume an authority to command him, 
 yet for love's sake he chose rather to beseech him. Now his business 
 was to take care to fix both the ministers and the people of that 
 church: <I>Charge them that they teach no other doctrine</I> than what 
 they have received, that they do not add to the Christian doctrine, 
 under pretence of improving it or making up the defects of it, that 
 they do no alter it, but cleave to it as it was delivered to them.
 Observe, 

 1. Ministers must not only be charged to preach the true doctrine of 
 the gospel, but charged to preach no other doctrine. <I>If an angel
 from heaven preach any other doctrine, let him be anathema,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:8">Gal. i. 8</A>.

 2. In the times of the apostles there were attempts made to corrupt
 Christianity (<I>we are not as many, who corrupt the word,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:17">2 Cor. ii. 17</A>),

 otherwise this charge to Timothy might have been spared. 

 3. He must not only see to it that he did not preach any other
 doctrine, but he must charge others that they might not add any thing
 of their own to the gospel, or take any thing from it, but that they
 preach it pure and uncorrupt. He must also take care to prevent their
 regarding <I>fables, and endless genealogies,</I> and strifes of words.
 This is often repeated in these two epistles (as
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:7,6:4;2Ti+2:23"><I>ch.</I> iv. 7; vi. 4; 2 Tim. ii. 23</A>),

 as well as in the epistle to Titus. As among the Jews there were some 
 who brought Judaism into Christianity; so among the Gentiles there were 
 some who brought paganism into Christianity. "Take heed of these," says 
 he, "watch against them, or they will be the corrupting and ruining of 
 religion among you, for <I>they minister questions rather than 
 edifying.</I>" That which ministers questions is not for edifying; that 
 which gives occasion for doubtful disputes pulls down the church rather 
 than builds it up. And I think, by a parity of reason, every thing else 
 that ministers questions rather than godly edifying should be 
 disclaimed and disregarded by us, such as an uninterrupted succession 
 in the ministry from the apostles down to these times, the absolute 
 necessity of episcopal ordination, and of the intention of the minister 
 to the efficacy and validity of the sacraments he ministers. These are
 as bad as Jewish fables and endless genealogies, for they involve us in 
 inextricable difficulties, and tend only to shake the foundations of a 
 Christian's hope and to fill his mind with perplexing doubts and fears.
 Godly edifying is the end ministers should aim at in all their 
 discourses, that Christians may be improving in godliness and growing 
 up to a greater likeness to the blessed God. Observe, further, Godly 
 edifying must be in faith: the gospel is the foundation on which we 
 build; it is by faith that we come to God at first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:6">Heb. xi. 6</A>),

 and it must be in the same way, and by the same principle of faith,
 that we must be edified. Again, Ministers should avoid, as much as may 
 be, what will occasion disputes; and would do well to insist on the 
 great and practical points of religion, about which there can be no 
 disputes; for even disputes about great and necessary truths draw off 
 the mind from the main design of Christianity, and eat out the vitals 
 of religion, which consist in practice and obedience as well as in 
 faith, that we may not hold the truth in unrighteousness, but may keep 
 the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure
 heart, and <I>of</I> a good conscience, and <I>of</I> faith unfeigned:
 &nbsp; 6  From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain
 jangling;
 &nbsp; 7  Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither
 what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
 &nbsp; 8  But we know that the law <I>is</I> good, if a man use it lawfully;
 &nbsp; 9  Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man,
 but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for
 sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and
 murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
 &nbsp; 10  For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with
 mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if
 there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
 &nbsp; 11  According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which
 was committed to my trust.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle instructs Timothy how to guard against the judaizing 
 teachers, or others who mingled fables and endless genealogies with the 
 gospel. He shows the use of the law, and the glory of the gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He shows the end and uses of the law: it is intended to promote 
 love, <I>for love is the fulfilling of the law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:10">Rom. xiii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>The end of the commandment is charity,</I> or love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:8">Rom. xiii. 8</A>.

 The main scope and drift of the divine law are to engage us to the love
 of God and one another; and whatever tends to weaken either our love to 
 God or love to the brethren tends to defeat the end of the commandment: 
 and surely the gospel, which obliges us to love our enemies, to do good 
 to those who hate us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:44">Matt. v. 44</A>)

 does not design to lay aside or supersede a commandment the end whereof
 is love; so far from it that, on the other hand, we are told that 
 though we had all advantages and wanted charity, we are but as sounding 
 brass and a tinkling cymbal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:1">1 Cor. xiii. 1</A>.

 <I>By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you love
 one another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:35">John xiii. 35</A>.

 Those therefore who boasted of their knowledge of the law, but used it
 only as a colour for the disturbance that they gave to the preaching of 
 the gospel (under pretence of zeal for the law, dividing the church and 
 distracting it), defeated that which was the very end of the 
 commandment, and that is love, love <I>out of a pure heart,</I> a heart 
 purified by faith, purified from corrupt affections. In order to the 
 keeping up of holy love our hearts must be cleansed from all sinful 
 love; our love must arise <I>out of a good conscience,</I> kept without 
 offence. Those answer the end of the commandment who are careful to 
 keep a good conscience, from a real belief of the truth of the word of 
 God which enjoins it, here called a <I>faith unfeigned.</I> Here we 
 have the concomitants of that excellency grace charity; they are 
 three:--

 (1.) A pure heart; there it must be seated, and thence it must take its
 rise.

 (2.) A good conscience, in which we must exercise ourselves daily, that
 we may not only get it, but that we may keep it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:16">Acts xxiv. 16</A>.

 (3.) Faith unfeigned must also accompany it, for it is love without 
 dissimulation: the faith that works by it must be of the like nature, 
 genuine and sincere. Now some who set up for teachers of the law 
 swerved from the very end of the commandment: they set up for 
 disputers, but their disputes proved vain jangling; they set up for 
 teachers, but they pretended to teach others what they themselves did 
 not understand. If the church be corrupted by such teachers, we must 
 not think it strange, for we see from the beginning it was so. Observe, 
 
 [1.] When persons, especially ministers, swerve from the great law of 
 charity--the end of the commandment, they will turn aside to vain
 jangling; when a man misses his end and scope, it is no wonder that 
 every step he takes is out of the way. 

 [2.] Jangling, especially in religion, is vain; it is unprofitable and 
 useless as to all that is good, and it is very pernicious and hurtful: 
 and yet many people's religion consists of little else but vain 
 jangling.

 [3.] Those who deal much in vain jangling are fond and ambitious to be 
 teachers of others; they desire (that is, they affect) the office of
 teaching.

 [4.] It is too common for men to intrude into the office of the 
 ministry when they are very ignorant of those things about which they 
 are ton speak: they understand neither what they say nor whereof they 
 affirm; and by such learned ignorance, no doubt, they edify their 
 hearers very much!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The use of the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>The law is good, if a man use it lawfully.</I> The Jews used it 
 unlawfully, as an engine to divide the church, a cover to the malicious 
 opposition they made to the gospel of Christ; they set it up for 
 justification, and so used it unlawfully. We must not therefore think 
 to set it aside, but use it lawfully, for the restraint of sin. The 
 abuse which some have made of the law does not take away the use of it; 
 but, when a divine appointment has been abused, call it back to its 
 right use and take away the abuses, for the law is still very useful as 
 a rule of life; though we are not under it as under a covenant of 
 works, yet it is good to teach us what is sin and what is duty. It is 
 not made for a righteous man, that is, it is not made for those who 
 observe it; for, if we could keep the law, righteousness would be by 
 the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:21">Gal. iii. 21</A>):

 but it is made for wicked persons, to restrain them, to check them, and 
 to put a stop to vice and profaneness. It is the grace of God that 
 changes men's hearts; but the terrors of the law may be of use to tie 
 their hands and restrain their tongues. A righteous man does not want 
 those restraints which are necessary for the wicked; or at least the 
 law is not made primarily and principally for the righteous, but for 
 sinners of all sorts, whether in a greater or less measure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 
 In this black roll of sinners, he particularly mentions breaches of the 
 second table, duties which we owe to our neighbour; against the fifth 
 and sixth commandments, <I>murderers of fathers and mothers, and 
 manslayers;</I> against the seventh, <I>whoremongers, and those that 
 defile themselves with mankind;</I> against the eighth, 
 <I>men-stealers;</I> against the ninth, <I>liars and perjured 
 persons;</I> and then he closes his account with this, <I>and if there 
 be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine.</I> Some 
 understand this as an institution of a power in the civil magistrate to 
 make laws against such notorious sinners as are specified, and to see 
 those laws put in execution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows the glory and grace of the gospel. Paul's epithets are 
 expressive and significant; and frequently every one is a sentence: as 
 here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God.</I> Let us 
 learn hence, 

 1. To call God blessed God, infinitely happy in the enjoyment of 
 himself and his own perfections. 

 2. To call the gospel the glorious gospel, for so it is: much of the 
 glory of God appears in the works of creation and providence, but much 
 more in the gospel, where it shines in the face of Jesus Christ. Paul 
 reckoned it a great honour put upon him, and a great favour done him, 
 that this glorious gospel was committed to his trust; that is, the 
 preaching of it, for the framing of it is not committed to any man or 
 company of men in the world. The settling of the terms of salvation in 
 the gospel of Christ is God's own work; but the publishing of it to the 
 world is committed to the apostles and ministers. Note here, 

 (1.) The ministry is a trust, for the gospel was committed unto this 
 apostle; it is an office of trust as well as of power, and the former 
 more than the latter; for this reason ministers are called stewards,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:1">1 Cor. iv. 1</A>.

 (2.) It is a glorious trust, because the gospel committed to them is a 
 glorious gospel; it is a trust of very great importance. God's glory is 
 very much concerned in it. Lord, what a trust is committed to us! How 
 much grace do we want, to be found faithful in this great trust!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for
 that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
 &nbsp; 13  Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and
 injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did <I>it</I> ignorantly in
 unbelief.
 &nbsp; 14  And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith
 and love which is in Christ Jesus.
 &nbsp; 15  This <I>is</I> a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
 that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I
 am chief.
 &nbsp; 16  Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first
 Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to
 them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
 &nbsp; 17  Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only
 wise God, <I>be</I> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle, 

 I. Returns thanks to Jesus Christ for putting him into the ministry. 
 Observe, 
 
 1. It is Christ's work to put men into the ministry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:16,17">Acts xxvi. 16, 17</A>.

 God condemned the false prophets among the Jews in these words, <I>I
 have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, 
 yet they prophesied,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:21">Jer. xxiii. 21</A>.

 Ministers, properly speaking, cannot make themselves ministers; for it
 is Christ's work, as king and head, prophet and teacher, of his church.
 
 2. Those whom he puts into the ministry he fits for it; whom he calls 
 he qualifies. Those ministers who are no way fit for their work, nor 
 have ability for it, are not of Christ's putting into the ministry, 
 though there are different qualifications as to gifts and graces. 

 3. Christ gives not only ability, but fidelity, to those whom he puts
 into the ministry: He <I>counted me faithful;</I> and none are counted
 faithful but those whom he makes so. Christ's ministers are trusty
 servants, and they ought to be so, having so great a trust committed to
 them. 

 4. A call to the ministry is a great favour, for which those who are so
 called ought to give thanks to Jesus Christ: <I>I thank Christ Jesus 
 our Lord, who hath put me into the ministry.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The more to magnify the grace of Christ in putting him into the 
 ministry, he gives an account of his conversion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he was before his conversion: <I>A blasphemer, a persecutor,
 and injurious.</I> Saul breathed out threatenings and slaughter against 
 the disciples of the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:1">Acts ix. 1</A>.
 
 He made havoc of the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:3">Acts viii. 3</A>.

 He was a blasphemer of God, a persecutor of the saints, and injurious
 to both. Frequently those who are designed for great and eminent 
 services are left to themselves before their conversion, to fall into 
 great wickedness, that the mercy of God may be the more glorified in 
 their remission, and the grace of God in their regeneration. The 
 greatness of sin is no bar to our acceptance with God, no, nor to our 
 being employed for him, if it be truly repented of. Observe here,

 (1.) Blasphemy, persecution, and injuriousness, are very great and 
 heinous sins, and those who are guilty of them are sinners before God 
 exceedingly. To blaspheme God is immediately and directly to strike at 
 God; to persecute his people is to endeavour to wound him through their 
 sides; and to be injurious is to be like Ishmael, whose hand was 
 against every one, and every one was against him; for such invade God's 
 prerogative, and encroach upon the liberties of their fellow-creatures. 
 
 (2.) True penitents, to serve a good purpose, will not be backward to 
 own their former condition before they were brought home to God: this 
 good apostle often confessed what his former life had been, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:4,26:10,11">Acts xxii. 4; xxvi. 10, 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The great favour of God to him: <I>But I obtained mercy.</I> This 
 was a blessed <I>but</I> indeed, a great favour, that so notorious a 
 rebel should find mercy with his prince.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) If Paul had persecuted the Christians wilfully, knowing them to be 
 the people of God, for aught I know he had been guilty of the 
 unpardonable sin; but, because he did it ignorantly and in unbelief, he 
 obtained mercy. Note, 

 [1.] What we do ignorantly is a less crime than what we do knowingly; 
 yet a sin of ignorance is a sin, for he that knew not his Master's 
 will, but did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few 
 stripes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:48">Luke xii. 48</A>.

 Ignorance in some cases will extenuate a crime, though it do not take 
 it away. 

 [2.] Unbelief is at the bottom of what sinners do ignorantly; they do 
 not believe God's threatenings, otherwise they could not do as they do.

 [3.] For these reasons Paul obtained mercy: <I>But I obtained mercy, 
 because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief.</I>

 [4.] Here was mercy for a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an injurious 
 person: "<I>But I obtained mercy,</I> I a blasphemer," &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here he takes notice of the abundant grace of Jesus Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 The conversion and salvation of great sinners are owing to the grace of 
 Christ, his exceedingly abundant grace, even that grace of Christ which 
 appears in his glorious gospel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>This is a faithful saying,</I> &c. Here we have the sum of the whole 
 gospel, <I>that Jesus Christ came into the world.</I> The Son of God 
 took upon him our nature, was made flesh, and dwelt among us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14">John i. 14</A>.
 
 He came into the world, <I>not to call the righteous but sinners to
 repentance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:13">Matt. ix. 13</A>.

 His errand into the world was to seek and find, and so save, <I>those
 that were lost,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:10">Luke xix. 10</A>.

 The ratification of this is <I>that it is a faithful saying, and worthy
 of all acceptation.</I> It is good news, worthy of all acceptation; and 
 yet not too good to be true, for it is a faithful saying. It is a 
 faithful saying, and therefore worthy to be embraced in the arms of 
 faith: it is worthy of all acceptation, and therefore to be received 
 with holy love, which refers to the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:14">foregoing verse</A>,

 where the grace of Christ is said to abound in faith and love. In the
 close of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:15">the verse</A>

 Paul applies it to himself: <I>Of whom I am chief.</I> Paul was a
 sinner of the first rank; so he acknowledges himself to have been, for 
 he breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the 
 Lord, &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:1,2">Acts ix. 1, 2</A>.

 Persecutors are some of the worst of sinners: such a one Paul had been.
 Or, <I>of whom I am chief,</I> that is, of pardoned sinners I am chief. 
 It is an expression of his great humility; he that elsewhere calls 
 himself the <I>least of all saints</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:8">Eph. iii. 8</A>)

 here calls himself the chief of sinners. Observe, 

 [1.] Christ Jesus has come into the world; the prophecies concerning 
 his coming are now fulfilled.

 [2.] He came to save sinners; he came to save those who could not save 
 and help themselves.

 [3.] Blasphemers and persecutors are the chief of sinners, so Paul 
 reckoned them.

 [4.] The chief of sinners may become the chief of saints; so this 
 apostle was, for he was not a whit behind the very chief apostles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:5">2 Cor. xi. 5</A>),

 for Christ came to save the chief of sinners. 

 [5.] This is a very great truth, it is a faithful saying; these are 
 true and faithful words, which may be depended on.

 [6.] It deserves to be received, to be believed by us all, for our 
 comfort and encouragement.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The mercy which Paul found with God, notwithstanding his great
 wickedness before his conversion, he speaks of,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] For the encouragement of others to repent and believe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 
 <I>For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might 
 show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to those who should 
 hereafter believe.</I> It was an instance of the long-suffering of 
 Christ that he would bear so much with one who had been so very 
 provoking; and it was designed for a pattern to all others, that the
 greatest sinners might not despair of mercy with God. Note here, 
 <I>First,</I> Our apostle was one of the first great sinners converted 
 to Christianity. <I>Secondly,</I> He was converted, and obtained mercy, 
 for the sake of others as well as of himself; he was a pattern to 
 others. <I>Thirdly,</I> The Lord Jesus Christ shows great 
 long-suffering in the conversion of great sinners. <I>Fourthly,</I> 
 Those who obtain mercy believe on the Lord Jesus Christ; for without 
 faith it is impossible to please God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:6">Heb. xi. 6</A>.

 <I>Fifthly,</I> Those who believe on Christ believe on him to life 
 everlasting; they believe to the saving of the soul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:39">Heb. x. 39</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He mentions it to the glory of God having spoken of the mercy he 
 had found with God, he could not go on with his letter without 
 inserting a thankful acknowledgment of God's goodness to him: <I>Now 
 unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be 
 honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</I> Observe, <I>First,</I> 
 That grace which we have the comfort of God must have the glory of. 
 Those who are sensible of their obligations to the mercy and grace of 
 God will have their hearts enlarged in his praise. Here is praise 
 ascribed to him, as <I>the King eternal, immortal, invisible.
 Secondly,</I> When we have found God good we must not forget to 
 pronounce him great; and his kind thoughts of us must not at all abate 
 our high thoughts of him, but rather increase them. God had taken 
 particular cognizance of Paul, and shown him mercy, and taken him into 
 communion with himself, and yet he calls him the King eternal, &c. 
 God's gracious dealings with us should fill us with admiration of his 
 glorious attributes. He is eternal, without beginning of days, or end 
 of life, or change of time. He is the Ancient of days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:9">Dan. vii. 9</A>.

 He is immortal, and the original of immortality; he only has
 immortality 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:16">1 Tim. vi. 16</A>),

 for he cannot die. He is invisible, for he cannot be seen with mortal 
 eyes, dwelling in the light to which no man can approach, whom no man 
 hath seen nor can see,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:16">1 Tim. vi. 16</A>.

 He is <I>the only wise God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:25">Jude 25</A>);

 he only is infinitely wise, and the fountain of all wisdom. "<I>To him
 be glory for ever and ever,</I>" or, "Let me be for ever employed in 
 giving honour and glory to him, as the thousands of thousands do,"

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to
 the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them
 mightest war a good warfare;
 &nbsp; 19  Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put
 away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
 &nbsp; 20  Of whom is Hymen&aelig;us and Alexander; whom I have delivered
 unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the charge he gives to Timothy to proceed in his work with 
 resolution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Observe here, The gospel is a charge committed to the ministers of it; 
 it is committed to their trust, to see that it be duly applied 
 according to the intent and meaning of it, and the design of its great 
 Author. It seems, there had been prophecies before concerning Timothy, 
 that he should be taken into the ministry, and should prove eminent in 
 the work of the ministry; this encouraged Paul to commit this charge to 
 him. Observe, 

 1. The ministry is a warfare, it is a good warfare against sin and 
 Satan: and under the banner of the Lord Jesus, who is the Captain of 
 our salvation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10">Heb. ii. 10</A>),

 and in his cause, and against his enemies, ministers are in a 
 particular manner engaged. 

 2. Ministers must war this good warfare, must execute their office
 diligently and courageously, notwithstanding oppositions and 
 discouragements. 

 3. The prophecies which went before concerning Timothy are here
 mentioned as a motive to stir him up to a vigorous and conscientious 
 discharge of his duty; so the good hopes that others have entertained 
 concerning us should excite us to our duty: <I>That thou by them 
 mightest war a good warfare.</I> 

 4. We must hold both faith and a good conscience: <I>Holding faith and
 a good conscience,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Those that put away a good conscience will soon make shipwreck of 
 faith. Let us live up to the directions of a renewed enlightened 
 conscience, and keep conscience void of offence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:16">Acts xxiv. 16</A>),

 a conscience not debauched by any vice or sin, and this will be a means 
 of preserving us sound in the faith; we must look to the one as well a 
 the other, for the mystery of the faith must be held in a pure 
 conscience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:9"><I>ch.</I> iii. 9</A>.

 As for those who had made shipwreck of the faith, he specifies two,
 <I>Hymeneus and Alexander,</I> who had made a profession of the 
 Christian religion, but had quitted that profession; and Paul had 
 delivered them to Satan, had declared them to belong to the kingdom of 
 Satan, and, as some think, had, by an extraordinary power, delivered 
 them to be terrified or tormented by Satan, <I>that they might learn 
 not to blaspheme</I> not to contradict or revile the doctrine of Christ 
 and the good ways of the Lord. Observe, The primary design of the 
 highest censure in the primitive church was to prevent further sin and 
 to reclaim the sinner. In this case it was for the destruction of the 
 flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:5">1 Cor. v. 5</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) Those who love the service and work of Satan are justly delivered
 over to the power of Satan: <I>Whom I have delivered over to Satan.</I> 
 
 (2.) God can, if he please, work by contraries: Hymeneus and Alexander 
 are delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme, when one 
 would rather think they would learn of Satan to blaspheme the more. 
 
 (3.) Those who have put away a good conscience, and made shipwreck of 
 faith, will not stick at any thing, blasphemy not excepted. 

 (4.) Therefore let us hold faith and a good conscience, if we would 
 keep clear of blasphemy; for, if we once let go our hold of these, we 
 do not know where we shall stop.</P>
