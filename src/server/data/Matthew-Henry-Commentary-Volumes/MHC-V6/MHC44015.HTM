 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hitherto we have, with a great deal of pleasure, attended the apostles 
 in their glorious travels for the propagating of the gospel in foreign 
 parts, have seen the bounds of the church enlarged by the accession 
 both of Jews and Gentiles to it; and thanks be to that God who always 
 caused them to triumph. We left them, in the close of the foregoing 
 chapter, reposing themselves at Antioch, and edifying the church there 
 with the rehearsal of their experiences, and it is a pity they should 
 ever be otherwise employed; but in this chapter we find other work (not 
 so pleasant) cut out for them. The Christians and ministers are engaged 
 in controversy, and those that should have been now busied in enlarging 
 the dominions of the church have as much as they can do to compose the 
 divisions of it; when they should have been making war upon the devil's 
 kingdom they have much ado to keep the peace in Christ's kingdom. Yet 
 this occurrence and the record of it are of great use to the church, 
 both for warning to us to expect such unhappy discords among 
 Christians, and direction to us what method to take for accommodating 
 them. Here is, 

 I. A controversy raised at Antioch by the judaizing teachers, who would 
 have the believing Gentiles brought under the yoke of circumcision and 
 the ceremonial law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. A consultation held with the church at Jerusalem about this matter,
 and the sending of delegates thither for that purpose, which occasioned 
 the starting of the same question there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 III. An account of what passed in the synod that was convened upon this 
 occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:6">ver. 6</A>.
 
 What Peter said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:7-11">ver. 7-11</A>.

 What Paul and Barnabas discoursed of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:12">ver. 12</A>.

 And, lastly, what James proposed for the settling of this matter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:13-21">ver. 13-21</A>.

 IV. The result of this debate, and the circular letter that was written 
 to the Gentile converts, directing them how to govern themselves with 
 respect to Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:22-29">ver. 22-29</A>.

 V. The delivering of this determination to the church at Antioch, and 
 the satisfaction it gave them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:30-35">ver. 30-35</A>.

 VI. A second expedition designed by Paul and Barnabas to preach to the 
 Gentiles, in which they quarrelled about their assistant, and separated 
 upon it, one steering one course and the other another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:36-41">ver. 36-41</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And certain men which came down from Jud&aelig;a taught the
 brethren, <I>and said,</I> Except ye be circumcised after the manner
 of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
 &nbsp; 2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
 disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas,
 and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the
 apostles and elders about this question.
 &nbsp; 3 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed
 through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the
 Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.
 &nbsp; 4 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of
 the church, and <I>of</I> the apostles and elders, and they declared
 all things that God had done with them.
 &nbsp; 5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which
 believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to
 command <I>them</I> to keep the law of Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Even when things go on very smoothly and pleasantly in a state or in a 
 church, it is folly to be secure, and to think the mountain stands 
 strong and cannot be moved; some uneasiness or other will arise, which 
 is not foreseen, cannot be prevented, but must be prepared for. If ever 
 there was a heaven upon earth, surely it was in the church at Antioch 
 at this time, when there were so many excellent ministers there, and 
 blessed Paul among them, building up that church in her most holy 
 faith. But here we have their peace disturbed, and differences arising. 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A new doctrine started among them, which occasioned this division, 
 obliging the Gentile converts to submit to circumcision and the 
 ceremonial law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Many that had been proselytes to the Jewish religion became Christians; 
 and they would have such as were proselyted to the Christian religion 
 to become Jews.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The persons that urged this were <I>certain men who came down from 
 Judea;</I> some think such as had been of the Pharisees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 or perhaps of those priests who were <I>obedient to the faith,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:7"><I>ch.</I> vi. 7</A>.

 They came from Judea, pretending perhaps to be sent by the apostles at
 Jerusalem, at least to be countenanced by them. Having a design to 
 spread their notions, they came to Antioch, because that was the 
 head-quarters of those that preached to the Gentiles, and the 
 rendezvous of the Gentile converts; and, if they could but make an 
 interest there, this leaven would soon be diffused to all the churches 
 of the Gentiles. They insinuated themselves into an acquaintance with 
 the brethren, pretended to be very glad that they had embraced the 
 Christian faith, and congratulated them on their conversion; but tell 
 them that <I>yet one thing they lack,</I> they must be circumcised.
 Note, Those that are ever so well taught have need to stand upon their 
 guard that they be not untaught again, or ill taught.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The position they laid down, the thesis they gave, was this, that 
 except the Gentiles who turned Christians were <I>circumcised after the 
 manner of Moses,</I> and thereby bound themselves to all the 
 observances of the ceremonial law, <I>they could not be saved.</I> As 
 to this, 

 (1.) Many of the Jews who embraced the faith of Christ, yet continued 
 very <I>zealous for the law,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:20"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 20</A>.

 They knew it was from God and its authority was sacred, valued it for
 its antiquity, had been bred up in the observance of it, and it is 
 probable had been often devoutly affected in their attendance on these 
 observances; they therefore kept them up after they were by baptism 
 admitted into the Christian church, kept up the distinction of meats, 
 and used the ceremonial purifyings from ceremonial pollutions, attend 
 the temple service, and celebrated the feasts of the Jews. Herein they 
 were connived at, because the prejudices of education are not to be 
 overcome all at once, and in a few years the mistake would be 
 effectually rectified by the destruction of the temple and the total 
 dissolution of the Jewish church, by which the observance of the Mosaic 
 ritual would become utterly impracticable. But it did not suffice them 
 that they were herein indulged themselves, they must have the Gentile 
 converts brought under the same obligations. Note, There is a strange 
 proneness in us to make our opinion and practice a rule and a law to 
 every body else, to judge of all about us by our standard, and to 
 conclude that because we do well all do wrong that do not just as we 
 do. 

 (2.) Those Jews who believed that Christ was the Messiah, as they could 
 not get clear of their affection to the law, so they could not get 
 clear of the notions they had of the Messiah, that he should set up a 
 temporal kingdom in favour of the Jewish nation, should make this 
 illustrious and victorious; it was a disappointment to them that there 
 was as yet nothing done towards this in the way they expected. But now 
 that they hear the doctrine of Christ is received among the Gentiles, 
 and his kingdom begins to be set up in the midst of them, if they can 
 but persuade those that embrace Christ to embrace the law of Moses too 
 they hope their point will be gained, the Jewish nation will be made as 
 considerable as they can wish, though in another way; and "Therefore by 
 all means let the brethren be pressed to be <I>circumcised and keep the 
 law,</I> and then with our religion our dominion will be extended, and 
 we shall in a little time be able to shake off the Roman yoke; and not 
 only so, but to put it on the necks of our neighbours, and so shall 
 have such a kingdom of the Messiah as we promised ourselves." Note, It 
 is no wonder if those who have wrong notions of the kingdom of Christ 
 take wrong measures for the advancement of it, and such as really tend 
 to the destruction of it, as these do. 

 (3.) The controversy about the circumcising of the Gentile proselytes 
 had been on foot among the Jews long before this. This is observed by 
 Dr. Whitby out of Josephus--<I>Antiq.</I> 20. 38-45: "That when Izates,
 the son of Helen queen of Adiabene, embraced the Jews' religion, 
 Ananias declared he might do it without circumcision; but Eleazar 
 maintained that it was a great impiety to remain uncircumcised." And 
 when two eminent Gentiles fled to Josephus (as he relates in the 
 history of his own life) "the zealots among the Jews were urgent for 
 their circumcision; but Josephus dissuaded them from insisting upon 
 it." Such has been the difference in all ages between bigotry and 
 moderation. 

 (4.) It is observable what a mighty stress they laid upon it; they do 
 not only say, "<I>You ought to be circumcised after the manner of 
 Moses,</I> and it will be good service to the kingdom of the Messiah if 
 you be; it will best accommodate matters between you and the Jewish 
 converts, and we shall take it very kindly if you will, and shall 
 converse the more familiarly with you;" but, "<I>Except you be 
 circumcised you cannot be saved.</I> If you be not herein of our mind 
 and way, you will never go to heaven, and therefore of course you must 
 go to hell." Note, it is common for proud impostors to enforce their 
 own inventions under pain of damnation; and to tell people that unless 
 they believe just as they would have them believe, and do just as they 
 would have them do, they cannot be saved, it is impossible they should; 
 not only their case is hazardous, but it is desperate. Thus the Jews 
 tell their brethren that except they be of their church, and come into 
 their communion, and conform to the ceremonies of their worship, though 
 otherwise good men and believers in Christ, yet they cannot be saved; 
 salvation itself cannot save them. None are in Christ but those that 
 are within their pale. We ought to see ourselves well warranted by the 
 word of God before we say, "Except you do so and so, you cannot be 
 saved."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The opposition which Paul and Barnabas gave to this schismatical 
 notion, which engrossed salvation to the Jews, now that Christ has 
 opened the door of salvation to the Gentiles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>They had no small dissension and disputation with them.</I> They 
 would by no means yield to this doctrine, but appeared and argued 
 publicly against it. 

 1. As faithful servants of Christ, they would not see his truths
 betrayed. They knew that Christ came to free us from the yoke of the
 ceremonial law, and to take down that wall of partition between Jews 
 and Gentiles and unite them both in himself; and therefore could not 
 bear to hear of circumcising the Gentile converts, when their 
 instructions were only to baptize them. The Jews would unite with the 
 Gentiles, that is, they would have them to conform in every thing to 
 their rites, and then, and not till then they will look upon them as 
 their brethren; and no thanks to them. But, this not being the way in 
 which Christ designed to unite them, it is not to be admitted. 

 2. As spiritual fathers to the Gentile converts, they would not see
 their liberties encroached upon. They had told the Gentiles that if 
 they believed in Jesus Christ they should be saved; and now to be told 
 that this was not enough to save them, except they were circumcised and 
 kept the law of Moses, this was such a discouragement to them at 
 setting out, and would be such a stumbling-block in their way, as might 
 almost tempt them to think of returning into Egypt again; and therefore 
 the apostles set themselves against it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The expedient pitched upon for preventing the mischief of this 
 dangerous notion, and silencing those that vented it, as well as 
 quieting the minds of the people with reference to it. They determined 
 that Paul and Barnabas, and some others of their number, should <I>go 
 to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders,</I> concerning this doubt. Not 
 that the church at Antioch had any doubt concerning it: they knew the 
 liberty wherewith Christ had made them free; but they sent the case to 
 Jerusalem, 

 1. Because those who taught this doctrine came from Jerusalem, and
 pretended to have directions from the apostles there to urge 
 circumcision upon the Gentile converts; it was therefore very proper to 
 send to Jerusalem about it, to know if they had any such direction from 
 the church there. And it was soon found to be all wrong, which yet 
 pretended to be of apostolical right. It was true that these <I>went 
 out from them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 but they never had any such orders from them.

 2. Because those who were taught this doctrine would be the better 
 confirmed in their opposition to it, and in the less danger of being 
 shocked and disturbed by it, if they were sure that <I>the apostles and 
 elders at Jerusalem</I> (which was the Christian church that of all 
 others retained the most affection to the law of Moses) were against 
 it; and, if they could but have this under their hands, it would be the 
 likeliest means to silence and shame these incendiaries, who had 
 pretended to have it from them. 

 3. Because the apostles at Jerusalem were fittest to be consulted in a
 point not yet fully settled; and being most eminent for an infallible 
 spirit, peculiar to them as apostles, their decision would be likely to 
 end the controversy. It was owing to the subtlety and malice of the 
 great enemy of the church's peace (as it appears by Paul's frequent 
 complaints of these <I>judaizing teachers,</I> these <I>false 
 apostles,</I> these <I>deceitful workers,</I> these <I>enemies of the 
 cross of Christ</I>), that it had not this effect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Their journey to Jerusalem upon this errand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Where we find,
 
 1. That they were honoured at parting: <I>They were brought on their 
 way by the church,</I> which was then much used as a token of respect 
 to useful men, and is directed to be done <I>after a godly sort,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:6">3 John 6</A>.

 Thus the church showed their favour to those who witnessed against
 these encroachments on the liberties of the Gentile converts, and stood 
 up for them.

 2. That they did good as they went along. They were men that would not
 lose time, and therefore visited the churches by the way; they passed 
 through Phenice and Samaria, and as they went <I>declared the 
 conversion of the Gentiles,</I> and what wonderful success the gospel 
 had had among them, which <I>caused great joy to all the brethren.</I> 
 Note, The progress of the gospel is and ought to be a matter of great 
 joy. <I>All the brethren,</I> the faithful brethren in Christ's family, 
 rejoice when more are born into the family; for the family will be 
 never the poorer for the multitude of its children. In Christ and 
 heaven there is portion enough, and inheritance enough for them 
 all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Their hearty welcome at Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 1. The good entertainment their friends gave them: They were 
 <I>received of the church, and of the apostles and elders,</I> were 
 embraced as brethren, and had audience as messengers of the church at 
 Antioch; they received them with all possible expressions of love and 
 friendship. 

 2. The good entertainment they gave their friends: They <I>declared all
 things that God had done with them,</I> gave them an account of the 
 success of their ministry among the Gentiles, not what they had done, 
 but <I>what God had done with them,</I> what he had by his grace in 
 them enabled them to do, and what he had by his grace in their hearers 
 enabled them to receive. As they went they had planted, as they came 
 back they had watered; but in both they were ready to own it was God 
 that gave the increase. Note, It is a great honour to be employed for 
 God, to be workers for him; for those that are so have him a worker 
 with them, and he must have all the glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The opposition they met with from the same party at Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 When Barnabas and Paul gave an account of the multitude of the 
 Gentiles, and of the great harvest of souls gathered in to Christ 
 there, and all about them congratulated them upon it, <I>there rose up 
 certain of the sect of the Pharisees,</I> who received the tidings very 
 coldly, and, though they believed in Christ, yet were not satisfied in 
 the admission of these converts, but thought it was needful to 
 circumcise them. Observe here, 

 1. That those who have been most prejudiced against the gospel yet have
 been captivated by it; so mighty has it been through God to the pulling 
 down of strong-holds. When Christ was here upon earth, few or none of 
 the rulers and of the Pharisees believed on him; but now there are 
 those of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, and many of them, we 
 hope, in sincerity. 

 2. That it is very hard for men suddenly to get clear of their
 prejudices: those that had been Pharisees, even after they became 
 Christians, retained some of the old leaven. All did not so, witness 
 Paul, but some did; and they had such a jealousy for the ceremonial 
 law, and such a dislike of the Gentiles, that they could not admit the 
 Gentiles into communion with them, unless they would be circumcised, 
 and thereby engage themselves to keep the law of Moses. This was, in
 their opinion, needful; and for their parts they would not converse 
 with them unless they submitted to it.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of
 this matter.
 &nbsp; 7 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and
 said unto them, Men <I>and</I> brethren, ye know how that a good while
 ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth
 should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
 &nbsp; 8 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving
 them the Holy Ghost, even as <I>he did</I> unto us;
 &nbsp; 9 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their
 hearts by faith.
 &nbsp; 10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck
 of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to
 bear?
 &nbsp; 11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus
 Christ we shall be saved, even as they.
 &nbsp; 12 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to
 Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had
 wrought among the Gentiles by them.
 &nbsp; 13 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying,
 Men <I>and</I> brethren, hearken unto me:
 &nbsp; 14 Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the
 Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
 &nbsp; 15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is
 written,
 &nbsp; 16 After this I will return, and will build again the
 tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again
 the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:
 &nbsp; 17 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all
 the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who
 doeth all these things.
 &nbsp; 18 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
 world.
 &nbsp; 19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which
 from among the Gentiles are turned to God:
 &nbsp; 20 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from
 pollutions of idols, and <I>from</I> fornication, and <I>from</I> things
 strangled, and <I>from</I> blood.
 &nbsp; 21 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach
 him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a council called, not by writ, but by consent, on this 
 occasion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The apostles and presbyters came together, to consider this 
 matter.</I> They did not give their judgment separately, but came 
 together to do it, that they might hear one another's sense in this 
 matter; for in the multitude of counsellors there is safety and 
 satisfaction. They did not give their judgment rashly, but considered 
 of this matter. Though they were clear concerning it in their own 
 minds, yet they would take time to consider of it, and to hear what 
 might be said by the adverse party. Nor did the apostles give their 
 judgment concerning it without the elders, the inferior ministers, to 
 whom they thus condescended, and on whom they thus put an honour. Those 
 that are most eminent in gifts and graces, and are in the most exalted 
 stations in the church, ought to show respect to their juniors and 
 inferiors; for, though <I>days should speak,</I> yet <I>there is a 
 spirit in man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:7,8">Job xxxii. 7, 8</A>.

 Here is a direction to the pastors of the churches, when difficulties
 arise, to come together in solemn meetings for mutual advice and 
 encouragement, that they may know one another's mind, and strengthen 
 one another's hands, and may act in concert. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Peter's speech in this synod. He did not in the least pretend to any 
 primacy or headship in this synod. He was not master of this assembly, 
 nor so much as chairman or moderator, <I>pro hac vice--on this
 occasion;</I> for we do not find that either he spoke first, to open 
 the synod (<I>there having been much disputing</I> before he <I>rose 
 up</I>), nor that he spoke last, to sum up the cause and collect the 
 suffrages; but he was a faithful, prudent zealous member of this 
 assembly, and offered that which was very much to the purpose, and 
 which would come better from him than from another, because he had 
 himself been the first that preached the gospel to the Gentiles. 
 <I>There had been much disputing, pro and con,</I> upon this question, 
 and liberty of speech allowed, as ought to be in such cases; those of 
 the sect of the Pharisees were some of them present, and allowed to say 
 what they could in defence of those of their opinion at Antioch, which 
 probably was answered by some of the elders; such questions ought to be 
 fairly disputed before they are decided. When both sides had been 
 heard, <I>Peter rose up,</I> and addressed himself to the assembly, 
 <I>Men and brethren,</I> as did James afterwards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 And here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He put them in mind of the call and commission he had some time ago 
 <I>to preach the gospel to the Gentiles;</I> he wondered there should 
 be any difficulty made of a matter already settled: <I>You know 
 that</I> <B><I>aph hemeron archaion</I></B>--<I>from the beginning of
 the days</I> of the gospel, many years ago, <I>God made choice</I> 
 among us apostles of one to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, and I 
 was the person chosen, <I>that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the 
 word, and believe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 You know I was questioned about it and cleared myself to the universal 
 satisfaction; every body rejoiced that <I>God had granted to the 
 Gentiles repentance unto life,</I> and nobody said a word of 
 circumcising them, nor was there any thought of such a thing. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:18"><I>ch.</I> xi. 18</A>.

 "Why should the Gentiles who hear the word of the gospel by Paul's
 mouth be compelled to submit to circumcision, any more than those that 
 heard it by my mouth? Or why should the terms of their admission now be 
 made harder than they were then?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He puts them in mind how remarkably God owned him in preaching to 
 the Gentiles, and gave testimony to their sincerity in embracing the 
 Christian faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>God, who knows the hearts,</I> and therefore is able to judge 
 infallibly of men, <I>bore them witness</I> that they were his indeed, 
 by <I>giving them the Holy Ghost;</I> not only the graces and comforts, 
 but the extraordinary miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost, <I>even as he 
 did unto us</I> apostles." See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:15-17"><I>ch.</I> xi. 15-17</A>.

 Note, <I>The Lord knows those that are his,</I> for he knows men's
 hearts; and we are as our hearts are. Those to whom God <I>gives the 
 Holy Ghost,</I> he thereby <I>bears witness</I> to that they are his; 
 hence we are said to be <I>sealed</I> with that Holy Spirit of 
 promise--<I>marked</I> for God. God had bidden the Gentiles welcome to
 the privilege of communion with him, without requiring them to be 
 circumcised and to keep the law; and therefore shall not we admit them
 into communion with us but upon those terms? "God has <I>put no 
 difference between us and them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 they, though Gentiles, are as welcome to the grace of Christ and the 
 throne of grace as we Jews are; why then should we set them at a 
 distance, as if we were holier than they?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:5">Isa. lxv. 5</A>.

 Note, We ought not to make any conditions of our brethren's acceptance 
 with us but such as God has made the conditions of their acceptance 
 with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:3">Rom. xiv. 3</A>.

 Now the Gentiles were fitted for communion with God, in <I>having their
 hearts purified by faith,</I> and that faith God's own work in them; 
 and therefore why should we think them unfit for communion with us, 
 unless they will submit to the ceremonial purifying enjoined by the law 
 to us? Note,

 (1.) <I>By faith the heart is purified;</I> we are not only justified,
 and conscience purified, but the work of sanctification is begun and 
 carried on. 

 (2.) Those that have their hearts purified by faith are therein made so 
 nearly to resemble one another, that, whatever difference there may be 
 between them, no account is to be made of it; for the faith of all the 
 saints is alike precious, and has like precious effects 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:1">2 Peter i. 1</A>),

 and those that by it are united to Christ are so to look upon 
 themselves as joined to one another as that all distinctions, even that 
 between Jew and Gentile, are merged and swallowed up in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He sharply reproves those teachers (some of whom, it is likely, were 
 present) who went about to bring the Gentiles under the obligation of 
 the law of Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The thing is so plain that he cannot forbear speaking of it with some 
 warmth: "<I>Now therefore,</I> since God has owned them for his, <I>why 
 tempt you God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples,</I> of the 
 believing Gentiles and their children" (for circumcision was a yoke 
 upon their infant seed, who are here reckoned among the disciples), 
 "<I>a yoke which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</I>" 
 Here he shows that in this attempt,

 (1.) They offered a very great affront to God: "You tempt him, by 
 calling that in question which he has already settled and determined by 
 no less an indication than that of the gift of the Holy Ghost; you do, 
 in effect, ask, 'Did he know what he did? Or was he in earnest in it? 
 Or will he abide by his own act?' Will you try whether God, who 
 designed the ceremonial law for the people of the Jews only, will now, 
 in its last ages, bring the Gentiles too under the obligation of it, to 
 gratify you?" Those tempt God who prescribe to him, and say that people 
 cannot be saved but upon such and such terms, which God never 
 appointed; as if the God of salvation must come into their measures. 
 
 (2.) They offered a very great wrong to the disciples: Christ came to 
 proclaim <I>liberty to the captives,</I> and they go about to enslave 
 those whom he has made free. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:8">Neh. v. 8</A>.

 The ceremonial law was a heavy yoke; they and their fathers found it
 difficult to be borne, so numerous, so various, so pompous, were the 
 institutions of it. The distinction of meats was a heavy yoke, not only 
 as it rendered conversation less pleasant, but as it embarrassed 
 conscience with endless scruples. The ado that was made about even 
 unavoidable touch of a grave or a dead body, the pollution contracted 
 by it, and the many rules about purifying from that pollution, were a 
 heavy burden. This yoke Christ came to ease us of, and called those 
 that were <I>weary and heavy laden</I> under it to come and take his 
 yoke upon them, his easy yoke. Now for these teachers to go about to 
 lay that yoke upon the neck of the Gentiles from which he came to free 
 even the Jews was the greatest injury imaginable to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Whereas the Jewish teachers had urged that circumcision was 
 necessary to salvation, Peter shows it was so far from being so that 
 both Jews and Gentiles were to be saved purely <I>through the grace of 
 our Lord Jesus Christ,</I> and in no other way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>We believe to be saved through that grace</I> only; <B><I>pisteuomen 
 sothenai</I></B>--<I>We hope to be saved;</I> or, <I>We believe unto
 salvation in the same manner as they</I>--<B><I>kath hontropon
 kakeinoi.</I></B> "We that are circumcised believe to salvation, and so 
 do those that are uncircumcised; and, as our circumcision will be no 
 advantage to us, so their uncircumcision will be no disadvantage to 
 them; for we must depend upon the grace of Christ for salvation, and 
 must apply that grace by faith, as well as they. There is not one way 
 of salvation for the Jews and another for the Gentiles; <I>neither 
 circumcision avails any thing nor uncircumcision</I> (that is neither 
 here nor there), <I>but faith which works by love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:6">Gal. v. 6</A>.

 Why should we burden them with the law of Moses, as necessary to their 
 salvation, when it is not that, but the gospel of Christ, that is 
 necessary both to our salvation and theirs?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account of what Barnabas and Paul said in this synod, which did 
 not need to be related, for they only gave in a narrative of what was 
 recorded in the foregoing chapters, <I>what miracles and wonders God 
 had wrought among the Gentiles by them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This they had given in to the church <I>at Antioch</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:27"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 27</A>),

 <I>to their brethren by the way</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:3"><I>ch.</I> xv. 3</A>),

 and now again to the synod; and it was very proper to be given in here.
 That which was contended for was that the Gentiles ought to submit to 
 the law of Moses; now, in opposition to this, Paul and Barnabas 
 undertake to show, by a plain relation of matters of fact, that God 
 owned the preaching of the pure gospel to them without the law, and 
 therefore to press the law upon them now was to undo what God had done. 
 Observe, 

 1. What account they gave; they declared, or opened in order, and with
 all the magnifying and affecting circumstances, what glorious miracles, 
 what signs and wonders, <I>God had wrought among the Gentiles by 
 them,</I> what confirmation he had given to their preaching by miracles 
 wrought in the kingdom of nature, and what success he had given to it 
 by miracles wrought in the kingdom of grace. Thus God had honoured 
 these apostles whom Jewish teachers condemned, and had thus honoured 
 the Gentiles whom they contemned. What need had they of any other 
 advocate when God himself pleaded their cause? The conversion of the 
 Gentiles was itself a wonder, all things considered, no less than a 
 miracle. Now if <I>they received the Holy Ghost by the hearing of 
 faith,</I> why should they be embarrassed with <I>the works of the 
 law?</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:2">Gal. iii. 2</A>.

 2. What attention was given to them: <I>All the multitude</I> (who,
 though they had not voted, yet came together to hear what was said) 
 <I>kept silence, and gave audience to Paul and Barnabas;</I> it should 
 seem they took more notice of their narrative than they did of all the 
 arguments that were offered. As in natural philosophy and medicine 
 nothing is so satisfactory as experiments, and in law nothing is so 
 satisfactory as cases adjudged, so in the things of God the best 
 explication of the word of grace is the accounts given of the 
 operations of the Spirit of grace; to these the multitude will with 
 silence give audience. Those that fear God will most readily hear those 
 that can tell them <I>what God has done for their souls,</I> or by 
 their means, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:16">Ps. lxvi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The speech which James made to the synod. He did not interrupt 
 Paul and Barnabas, though, it is likely, he had before heard their 
 narrative, but let them go on with it, for the edification of the 
 company, and that they might have it from the first and best hand; but, 
 <I>after they had held their peace,</I> then James stood up. <I>You may 
 all prophesy one by one,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:31">1 Cor. xiv. 31</A>.

 God is the God of order. He let Paul and Barnabas say what they had to
 say, and then he made the application of it. The hearing of variety of 
 ministers may be of use when one truth does not drive out, but clench, 
 another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He addresses himself respectfully to those present: "<I>Men and 
 brethren, hearken unto me.</I> You are men, and therefore, it is to be 
 hoped, will hear reason; you are my brethren, and therefore will hear 
 me with candour. We are all brethren, and equally concerned in this 
 cause that nothing be done to the dishonour of Christ and the 
 uneasiness of Christians."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He refers to what Peter had said concerning the conversion of the 
 Gentiles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>Simeon</I>" (that is, Simon Peter) "<I>hath declared,</I> and
 opened the matter to you--<I>how God at the first did visit the
 Gentiles,</I> in Cornelius and his friends, who were the first-fruits 
 of the Gentiles--how, when the gospel began first to spread, presently
 the Gentiles were invited to come and take the benefit of it;" and 
 James observes here, 

 (1.) That the <I>grace of God</I> was the origin of it; it was God 
 <I>that visited the Gentiles;</I> and it was a kind visit. Had they 
 been left to themselves, they would never have visited him, but the 
 acquaintance began on his part; he not only <I>visited and redeemed his 
 people,</I> but visited and redeemed those that were <I>lo ammi--not a
 people.</I> 

 (2.) that the glory of God was the end of it: it was <I>to take out of 
 them a people for his name,</I> who should glorify him, and in whom he 
 would be glorified. As of old he took the Jews, so now the Gentiles, 
 <I>to be to him for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:11">Jer. xiii. 11</A>.

 Let all the people of God remember that therefore they are thus
 dignified in God, that God may be glorified in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He confirms this with a quotation out of the Old Testament: he could 
 not prove the calling of the Gentiles by a vision, as Peter could, nor 
 by miracles wrought by his hand, as Paul and Barnabas could, but he 
 would prove that it was foretold in the Old Testament, and therefore it 
 must be fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>To this agree the words of the prophets;</I> most of the 
 Old-Testament prophets spoke more or less of the calling in of the 
 Gentiles, even Moses himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:19">Rom. x. 19</A>.

 It was the general expectation of the pious Jews that the Messiah
 should be <I>a light to enlighten the Gentiles</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:32">Luke ii. 32</A>):

 but James waives the more illustrious prophecies of this, and pitches 
 upon one that seemed more obscure: <I>It is written,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:11,12">Amos ix. 11, 12</A>,

 where is foretold, 
 
 (1.) The setting up of the kingdom of the Messiah
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I will raise up the tabernacle of David, that is fallen.</I> The 
 covenant was made with David and his seed; but the house and family of 
 David are here called his <I>tabernacle,</I> because David in his 
 beginning was a shepherd, and dwelt in tents, and his house, that had 
 been as a stately palace, had become a mean and despicable tabernacle, 
 reduced in a manner to its small beginning. This tabernacle was ruined 
 and <I>fallen down;</I> there had not been for many ages a king of the 
 house of David; <I>the sceptre had departed from Judah,</I> the royal 
 family was sunk and buried in obscurity, and, as it should seem, not 
 enquired after. But God <I>will return, and will build it again,</I> 
 raise it out of its ruins, a phoenix out of its ashes; and this was now 
 lately fulfilled, when our Lord Jesus was raised out of that family, 
 had <I>the throne of his father David given him,</I> with a promise 
 <I>that he should reign over the house of Jacob for ever,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32,33">Luke i. 32, 33</A>.

 And, when <I>the tabernacle of David</I> was thus rebuilt in Christ,
 all the rest of it was, not many years after, wholly extirpated and cut 
 off, as was also the nation of the Jews itself, and all their 
 genealogies were lost. The church of Christ may be called the
 tabernacle of David. This may sometimes be brought very low, and may 
 seem to be in ruins, but it shall be built again, its withering 
 interests shall revive; it is <I>cast down, but not destroyed:</I> even 
 dry bones are made to live.

 (2.) The bringing in of the Gentiles as the effect and consequence of 
 this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>That the residue of men might seek after the Lord;</I> not the Jews 
 only, who thought they had the monopoly of the tabernacle of David, but 
 <I>the residue of men,</I> such as had hitherto been left out of the 
 pale of the visible church; they must now, upon this re-edifying of the 
 tabernacle of David, be brought <I>to seek after the Lord,</I> and to 
 enquire how they may obtain his favour. When David's tabernacle is set 
 up, they <I>shall seek the Lord their God,</I> and <I>David their 
 king,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:5,Jer+30:9">Hos. iii. 5; Jer. xxx. 9</A>.

 <I>Then Israel shall possess the remnant of Edom</I> (so it is in the 
 Hebrew); but the Jews called all the Gentiles <I>Edomites,</I> and 
 therefore the Septuagint leave out the particular mention of Edom, and 
 read it just as it is here, <I>that the residue of men might seek</I> 
 (James here adds, <I>after the Lord), and all the Gentiles,</I> or 
 heathen, <I>upon whom my name is called.</I> The Jews were for many 
 ages so peculiarly favoured that the residue of men seemed neglected; 
 but now God will have an eye to them, and his name shall be called upon 
 by the Gentiles; his name shall be declared and published among them, 
 and they shall be brought both to know his name and to call upon it: 
 they shall call themselves the people of God, and he shall call them 
 so; and thus, by consent of both parties, <I>his name is called upon 
 them.</I> This promise we may depend upon the fulfilling of in its 
 season; and now it begins to be fulfilled, for it is added, <I>saith 
 the Lord, who doeth this; who doeth all these things</I> (so the 
 Seventy); and the apostle here: <I>he saith it who doeth it,</I> who 
 therefore said it because he was determined to do it; and who therefore 
 does it because he hath said it; for though with us saying and doing 
 are two things they are not so with God. The uniting of <I>Jews and 
 Gentiles in one body,</I> and all those things that were done in order 
 to it, which were here foretold, were, 

 [1.] What God did: <I>This was the Lord's doing,</I> whatever 
 instruments were employed in it: and, 

 [2.] It was what God delighted in, and was well pleased with; for he is 
 the God of the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, and it is his honour 
 <I>to be rich in mercy to all that call upon him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He resolves it into the purpose and counsel of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the 
 world.</I> He not only foretold the calling of the Gentiles many ages 
 ago by the prophets (and therefore it ought not to be a surprise or 
 stumbling-block to us), but he foresaw and foreordained it in his
 eternal counsels, which are unquestionably wise and unalterably firm. 
 It is an excellent maxim here laid down concerning all God's works, 
 both of providence and grace, in the natural and spiritual kingdom, 
 that they were all <I>known unto him from the beginning of the 
 world,</I> from the time he first began to work, which supposes his 
 knowing them (as other scriptures speak) <I>from before the foundation 
 of the world,</I> and therefore from all eternity. Note, Whatever God 
 does, he did before design and determine to do; for he works all, not 
 only according to his will, but <I>according to the counsel of his 
 will:</I> he not only <I>does whatever he determined</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:6">Ps. cxxxv. 6</A>),
 
 which is more than we can do (our purposes are frequently broken off,
 and our measures broken), but he <I>determined whatever he does.</I> 
 Whatever he may say, to prove us, <I>he himself knows what he will 
 do.</I> We know not our works beforehand, but must <I>do as occasion 
 shall serve,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:7">1 Sam. x. 7</A>.

 What we shall do in such or such a case we cannot tell till it comes to
 the setting to; but <I>known unto God are all his works;</I> in the
 volume of his book (called <I>the scriptures of truth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:21">Dan. x. 21</A>)

 they are all written in order, without any erasure or interlining 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:7">Ps. xl. 7</A>);

 and all God's works will, in the day of review, be found to agree 
 exactly with his counsels, without the least error or variation. We
 are poor short-sighted creatures; the wisest men can see but a little 
 way before them, and not at all with any certainty; but this is our 
 comfort, that, whatever uncertainty we are at, there is an infallible 
 certainty in the divine prescience: <I>known unto God are all his 
 works.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He gives his advice what was to be done in the present case, as the 
 matter now stood with reference <I>to the Gentiles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>My sentence is;</I> <B><I>ego krino</I></B>--<I>I give it as my
 opinion,</I> or judgment; not as having authority over the rest, but as 
 being an adviser with them. Now his advice is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That circumcision and the observance of the ceremonial law be by 
 no means imposed upon the Gentile converts; no, not so much as 
 recommended nor mentioned to them. "There are many from among the 
 Gentiles that are turned to God in Christ, and we hope there will be 
 many more. Now I am clearly for using them with all possible 
 tenderness, and putting no manner of hardship or discouragement upon 
 them," <B><I>me parenochlein</I></B>--"<I>not to give them any
 molestation nor disturbance,</I> nor suggest any thing to them that may 
 be disquieting, or raise scruples in their minds, or perplex them." 
 Note, Great care must be taken not to discourage nor disquiet young 
 converts with matters of <I>doubtful disputation.</I> Let the 
 essentials of religion, which an awakened conscience will readily 
 receive, be first impressed deeply upon them, and these will satisfy 
 them and make them easy; and let not things foreign and circumstantial 
 be urged upon them, which will but trouble them. <I>The kingdom of
 God,</I> in which they are to be trained up, <I>is not meat and 
 drink,</I> neither the opposition nor the imposition of indifferent 
 things, which will but trouble them; <I>but it is righteousness, and 
 peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost,</I> which we are sure will trouble 
 nobody.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That yet it would be well that in some things, which gave most 
 offence to the Jews, the Gentiles should comply with them. Because they 
 must not humour them so far as to be circumcised, and keep the whole 
 law, it does not therefore follow that they must act in a continual 
 contradiction to them, and study how to provoke them. It will please 
 the Jews (and, if a little thing will oblige them, better do so than 
 cross them) if the Gentile converts abstain, 

 [1.] <I>From pollutions of idols, and from fornication,</I> which are 
 two bad things, and always to be abstained from; but writing to them 
 particularly and expressly to abstain from them (because in these 
 things the Jews were jealous of the Gentile converts, lest they should 
 transgress) would very much gratify the Jews; not but that the 
 apostles, both in preaching and writing to the Gentiles that embraced 
 Christianity, were careful to warn against, <I>First, Pollutions of 
 idols,</I> that they should have no manner of fellowship with idolaters 
 in their idolatrous worships, and particularly not in the feasts they 
 held upon their sacrifices. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:14,2Co+6:14">1 Cor. x. 14, &c.; 2 Cor. vi. 14</A>,

 &c. <I>Secondly, Fornication, and all manner of uncleanness.</I> How
 large, how pressing, is Paul in his cautions against this sin!

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:9-15,Eph+5:3">1 Cor. vi. 9-15; Eph. v. 3</A>,

 &c. But the Jews, who were willing to think the worst of those they did
 not like, suggested that these were things in which the Gentiles, even 
 after conversion, allowed themselves, and the apostle of the Gentiles 
 connived at it. Now, to obviate this suggestion, and to leave no room 
 for this calumny, James advises that, besides the private admonitions 
 which were given them by their ministers, they should be publicly 
 warned <I>to abstain from pollutions of idols and from 
 fornication</I>--that herein they should be very circumspect, and
 should avoid all appearances of these two evils, which would be in so 
 particular a manner offensive to the Jews. 

 [2.] <I>From things strangled, and from blood,</I> which, though not 
 evil in themselves, as the other two, nor designed to be always 
 abstained from, as those were, had been forbidden by <I>the precepts of 
 Noah</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:4">Gen. ix. 4</A>),

 before the giving of the law of Moses; and the Jews had a great dislike 
 to them, and to all those that took a liberty to use them; and 
 therefore, to avoid giving offence, let the Gentile converts abridge 
 themselves of their liberty herein, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:9,13">1 Cor. viii. 9, 13</A>.

 Thus we must <I>become all things to all men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He gives a reason for his advice--that great respect ought to be
 shown to the Jews for they have been so long accustomed to the solemn 
 injunctions of the ceremonial law that they must be borne with, if they 
 cannot presently come off from them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>For Moses hath of old those that preach him in every city,</I> his 
 writings (a considerable part of which is the ceremonial law) <I>being 
 read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</I> "You cannot blame them if 
 they have a great veneration for the law of Moses; for besides that 
 they are very sure God spoke to Moses," 

 (1.) "Moses is continually preached to them, and they are called upon 
 <I>to remember the law of Moses,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:4">Mal. iv. 4</A>.

 Note, Even that word of God which is written to us should also be 
 preached: those that have the scriptures have still need of ministers 
 to help them to understand and apply the scriptures.

 (2.) "His writings are read in a solemn religious manner, <I>in their 
 synagogues,</I> and on <I>the sabbath day,</I> in the place and at the 
 time of their meetings for the worship of God; so that from their 
 childhood they have been trained up in a regard to the law of Moses; 
 the observance of it is a part of their religion." 

 (3.) "This has been done <I>of old time;</I> they have received from 
 their fathers an honour for Moses; they have antiquity for it." 

 (4.) "This had been done <I>in every city,</I> wherever there are any 
 Jews, so that none of them can be ignorant what stress that law laid 
 upon these things: and therefore, though the gospel has set us free 
 from these things, yet they cannot be blamed if they are loth to part 
 with them, and cannot of a sudden be persuaded to look upon those 
 things as needless and indifferent which they, and their fathers before 
 them, had been so long taught, and taught of God too, to place religion 
 in. We must therefore give them time, must meet them half-way; they 
 must be borne with awhile, and brought on gradually, and we must comply 
 with them as far as we can without betraying our gospel liberty." Thus 
 does this apostle show the spirit of a moderator, that is, a spirit of 
 moderation, being careful to give no offence either to Jew or Gentile, 
 and contriving, as much as may be, to please both sides and provoke 
 neither. Note, We are not to think it strange if people be wedded to 
 customs which they have had transmitted to them from their fathers, and 
 which they have been educated in an opinion of as sacred; and therefore 
 allowances must be made in such cases, and not rigour used.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole
 church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with
 Paul and Barnabas; <I>namely,</I> Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas,
 chief men among the brethren:
 &nbsp; 23 And they wrote <I>letters</I> by them after this manner; The
 apostles and elders and brethren <I>send</I> greeting unto the
 brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and
 Cilicia:
 &nbsp; 24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from
 us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying,
 <I>Ye must</I> be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no
 <I>such</I> commandment:
 &nbsp; 25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to
 send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
 &nbsp; 26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord
 Jesus Christ.
 &nbsp; 27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell
 <I>you</I> the same things by mouth.
 &nbsp; 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon
 you no greater burden than these necessary things;
 &nbsp; 29 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood,
 and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye
 keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
 &nbsp; 30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when
 they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the
 epistle:
 &nbsp; 31 <I>Which</I> when they had read, they rejoiced for the
 consolation.
 &nbsp; 32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves,
 exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 33 And after they had tarried <I>there</I> a space, they were let go
 in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.
 &nbsp; 34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
 &nbsp; 35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
 preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the result of the consultation that was held at Jerusalem 
 about the imposing of the ceremonial law upon the Gentiles. Much more, 
 it is likely, was said about it than is here recorded; but at length it 
 was brought to a head, and the advice which James gave was universally 
 approved and agreed to <I>nemine contradicente--unanimously;</I> and
 letters were accordingly sent by messengers of their own to the Gentile 
 converts, acquainting them with their sentiments in this matter, which 
 would be a great confirmation to them against the false teachers. Now 
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The choice of the delegates that were to be sent with Paul and 
 Barnabas on this errand; not as if they had any suspicion of the 
 fidelity of these great men, and could not trust them with their 
 letters, nor as if they thought that those to whom they sent them would 
 suspect them to have altered any thing in their letter; no, their 
 charity thought no such evil concerning men of such tried integrity; 
 but,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They thought fit <I>to send men of their own company to Antioch, 
 with Paul and Barnabas,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 This was agreed to by <I>the apostles and elders, with the whole 
 church,</I> who, it is likely, undertook to bear their charges,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:7">1 Cor. ix. 7</A>.
 
 They sent these messengers,

 (1.) To show their respect to the church at Antioch, as a
 sister-church, though a younger sister, and that they looked upon it as 
 upon the same level with them; as also that they were desirous further 
 to know their state.

 (2.) To encourage Paul and Barnabas, and to make their journey home the
 more pleasant (for it is likely they travelled on foot) by sending such 
 excellent men to bear them company; <I>amicus pro vehiculo--a friend
 instead of a carriage.</I> 

 (3.) To put a reputation upon the letters they carried, that it might 
 appear a solemn embassy, and so much the more regard might be paid to 
 the message, which was likely to meet with opposition from some. 

 (4.) To keep up <I>the communion of the saints,</I> and cultivate an 
 acquaintance between churches and ministers that were at a distance 
 from each other, and to show <I>that, though they were many, yet they 
 were one.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Those they sent were not inferior persons, who might serve to carry 
 the letters, and attest the receipt of them from the apostles; but 
 <I>they were chosen men, and chief men among the brethren,</I> men of 
 eminent gifts, graces, and usefulness; for these are the things which 
 denominate men chief among the brethren, and qualify them to be the 
 messengers of the churches. They are here named: <I>Judas,</I> who was 
 called <I>Barsabas</I> (probably the brother of that Joseph who was 
 called <I>Barsabas,</I> that was a candidate for the apostleship, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:23"><I>ch.</I> i. 23</A>),

 <I>and Silas.</I> The character which these men had in the church at
 Jerusalem would have some influence upon those that came from Judea, as 
 those false teachers did, and engage them to pay the more deference to 
 the message that was sent by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The drawing up of the letters, circular letters, that were to be 
 sent to the churches, to notify the sense of the synod in this 
 matter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is a very condescending obliging preamble to this decree, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 There is nothing in it haughty or assuming, but,

 (1.) That which intimates the humility of the apostles, that they join 
 <I>the elders and brethren</I> in commission with them, the ministers, 
 the ordinary Christians, whom they had advised with in this case, as 
 they used to do in other cases. Though never men were so qualified as 
 they were for a monarchical power and authority in the church, nor had 
 such a commission as they had, yet their decrees run not, "We, the 
 apostles, Christ's vicars upon earth, and pastors of all the pastors of 
 the churches" (as the pope styles himself), "and sole judges in all 
 matters of faith;" but <I>the apostles, and elders, and brethren,</I> 
 agree in their orders. Herein they remembered the instructions their 
 Master gave them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:8">Matt. xxiii. 8</A>):

 <I>Be not you called Rabbi; for you are all brethren.</I> 

 (2.) That which bespeaks their respect to the churches they wrote to; 
 they <I>send</I> to them <I>greeting,</I> wish them health and 
 happiness and joy, and call them <I>brethren of the Gentiles,</I> 
 thereby owning their admission into the church, and giving them the 
 right hand of fellowship: "You are our brethren, though Gentiles; for 
 we meet in Christ, <I>the first born among many brethren,</I> in God 
 our common Father." Now that <I>the Gentiles are fellow-heirs and of 
 the same body,</I> they are to be countenanced and encouraged, and 
 called brethren.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is a just and severe rebuke to the judaizing teachers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):
 
 "<I>We have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you 
 with words,</I> and we are very much concerned to hear it; now this is 
 to let them know that those who preached this doctrine were false 
 teachers, both as they produced a false commission and as they taught a 
 false doctrine." 

 (1.) They did a great deal of wrong to the apostles and ministers at 
 Jerusalem, in pretending that they had instructions from them to impose 
 the ceremonial law upon the Gentiles, when there was no colour for such 
 a pretension. "They <I>went out from us</I> indeed--they were such as
 belonged to our church, of which, when they had a mind to travel, we 
 gave them perhaps a testimonial; but, as for their urging the law of 
 Moses upon you, we <I>gave</I> them <I>no such commandment,</I> nor had 
 we ever thought of such a thing, nor given them the least occasion to 
 use our names in it." It is no new thing for apostolical authority to 
 be pleaded in defence of those doctrines and practices for which yet 
 the apostles gave neither command nor encouragement. 

 (2.) They did a great deal of wrong to the Gentile converts, in saying, 
 <I>You must be circumcised, and must keep the law.</I> 

 [1.] It perplexed them: "<I>They have troubled you with words,</I> have 
 occasioned disturbance and disquietment to you. You depended upon those 
 who told you, <I>If you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ you shall be 
 saved;</I> and now you are startled by those that tell you <I>you must 
 keep the law of Moses or you cannot be saved,</I> by which you see 
 yourselves drawn into a snare. They trouble you with words--words, and
 nothing else--mere words--sound, but no substance." How has the church
 been troubled with words, by the pride of men that loved to hear 
 themselves talk! 

 [2.] It endangered them; they <I>subverted</I> their souls, put them 
 into disorder, and pulled down that which had been built up. They took 
 them off from pursuing pure Christianity, and minding the business of 
 that, by filling their heads with the necessity of circumcision, and 
 the law of Moses, which were nothing to the purpose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here is an honourable testimony given of the messengers by whom 
 these letters were sent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Of Paul and Barnabas, whom these judaizing teachers had opposed
 and censured as having done their work by the halves, because they had 
 brought the Gentile converts to Christianity only, and not to Judaism. 
 Let them say what they will of these men, 

 [1.] "They are men that are dear to us; they are <I>our beloved 
 Barnabas and Paul</I>--men whom we have a value for, a kindness for, a
 concern for." Sometimes it is good for those that are of eminence to 
 express their esteem, not only for the despised truth of Christ, but 
 for the despised preachers and defenders of that truth, to encourage 
 them, and weaken the hands of their opposers. 

 [2.] "They are men that have signalized themselves in the service of 
 Christ, and therefore have deserved well of all the churches: they are 
 men <I>that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and therefore are worthy of double honour, and cannot be suspected of 
 having sought any secular advantage to themselves; for they have 
 ventured their all for Christ, have engaged in the most dangerous 
 services, as good soldiers of Christ, and not only in laborious 
 services." It is not likely that such faithful confessors should be 
 unfaithful preachers. Those that urged circumcision did it to avoid 
 persecution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:12,13">Gal. vi. 12, 13</A>);

 those that opposed it knew they thereby exposed themselves to 
 persecution; and which of these were most likely to be in the 
 right?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Of Judas and Silas: "<I>They are chosen men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 and they are men that have heard our debates, and are perfectly 
 apprized of the matter, and will <I>tell you the same things by 
 mouth,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 What is of use to us it is good to have both in writing and by word of 
 mouth, that we may have the advantage both of reading and of hearing 
 it. The apostles refer them to the bearers for a further account of 
 their judgment and their reasons, and the bearers will refer them to 
 their letters for the certainty of the determination.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Here is the direction given what to require from the Gentile 
 converts, where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The matter of the injunction, which is according to the advice 
 given by James, that, to avoid giving offence to the Jews, 

 [1.] They should never eat any thing that they knew had been offered in 
 sacrifice to an idol, but look upon it as, though clean in itself, yet 
 thereby polluted to them. This prohibition was afterwards in part taken 
 off, for they were allowed to eat whatever was sold in the shambles, or 
 set before them at their friend's table, though it had been offered to 
 idols, except when there was danger of giving offence by it, that is, 
 of giving occasion either to a weak Christian to think the worse of our 
 Christianity, or to a wicked heathen to think the better of his 
 idolatry; and in these cases it is <I>good to forbear,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:25">1 Cor. x. 25</A>,

 &c. This to us is an antiquated case. 

 [2.] <I>That they should not eat blood,</I> nor drink it; but avoid 
 every thing that looked cruel and barbarous in that ceremony which had 
 been of so long standing. 

 [3.] <I>That they should not eat any thing that was strangled,</I> or 
 died of itself, or had not the blood let out. 

 [4.] That they should be very strict in censuring those that <I>were 
 guilty of fornication,</I> or marrying within the degrees prohibited by 
 the Levitical law, which, some think, is principally intended here. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:1">1 Cor. v. 1</A>.

 Dr. Hammond states this matter thus: The judaizing teachers would have
 the Gentile converts submit to all that those submitted to whom they 
 called the proselytes of righteousness, <I>to be circumcised and keep 
 the whole law;</I> but the apostles required no more of them than what 
 was required of the proselytes of the gate, which was to observe <I>the 
 seven precepts of the sons of Noah,</I> which, he thinks, are here 
 referred to. But the only ground of this decree being in complaisance 
 to the rigid Jews that had embraced the Christian faith, and, except in 
 that one case of scandal, all meats being pronounced free and 
 indifferent to all Christians as soon as the reason of the decree 
 ceased, which, at furthest, was after the destruction of Jerusalem, the 
 obligation of it ceased likewise. "These things are in a particular
 manner offensive to the Jews, and therefore do not disoblige them 
 herein for the present; in a little time the Jews will incorporate with 
 the Gentiles, and then the danger is over."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The manner in which it is worded. 

 [1.] They express themselves with something of authority, that what 
 they wrote might be received with respect, and deference paid to it: 
 <I>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us,</I> that is, to us 
 under the guidance of the Holy Ghost, and by direction from him: not 
 only the apostles, but others, were endued with spiritual gifts 
 extraordinary, and knew more of the mind of God than any since those 
 gifts ceased can pretend to; their infallibility gave an incontestable 
 authority to their decrees, and they would not order any thing because 
 <I>it seemed good to them,</I> but that they knew it first <I>seemed 
 good to the Holy Ghost.</I> Or it refers to what the Holy Ghost had 
 determined in this matter formerly. When the Holy Ghost descended upon
 the apostles, he endued them with the gift of tongues, in order to 
 their preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, which was a plain 
 indication of God's purpose to call them in. When the Holy Ghost 
 descended upon Cornelius and his friends, upon Peter's preaching, it 
 was plain that Christ designed the taking down of the Jewish pale, 
 within which they fancied the spirit had been enclosed. 

 [2.] They express themselves with abundance of tenderness and fatherly 
 concern. <I>First,</I> They are afraid of burdening them: We will
 <I>lay upon you no greater burden.</I> So far were they from delighting 
 to impose upon them that they dreaded nothing so much as imposing too 
 far upon them, so as to discourage them at their setting out.
 <I>Secondly,</I> They impose upon them <I>no other than necessary 
 things.</I> "The avoiding of <I>fornication</I> is necessary to all 
 Christians at all times; the avoiding of <I>things strangled,</I> and 
 of <I>blood,</I> and of <I>things offered to idols,</I> is necessary at 
 this time, for the keeping up of a good understanding between you and 
 the Jews, and the preventing of offence;" and as long as it continues 
 necessary for that end, and no longer, it is enjoined. Note, 
 Church-rulers should impose only necessary things, things which Christ 
 has made our duty, which have a real tendency to the edification of the 
 church, and, as here, to the uniting of good Christians. If they impose 
 things only to show their own authority, and to try people's obedience, 
 they forget that they have not authority to make new laws, but only to 
 see that the laws of Christ be duly executed, and to enforce the 
 observance of them. <I>Thirdly,</I> They enforce their order with a
 commendation of those that shall comply with it, rather than with the 
 condemnation of those that shall transgress it. They do not conclude, 
 "From which if you do not keep yourselves, you shall be an anathema, 
 you shall be cast out of the church, and accursed," according to the 
 style of after-councils, and particularly that of Trent; but "<I>From 
 which if you keep yourselves,</I> as we do not question but you will, 
 <I>you will do well;</I> it will be for the glory of God, the 
 furtherance of the gospel, the strengthening of the hands of your 
 brethren, and your own credit and comfort." It is all sweetness and
 love and good humour, such as became the followers of him who, when he 
 called us to take his yoke upon us, assured us we should find him 
 <I>meek and lowly in heart.</I> The difference of the style of the true 
 apostles from that of the false is very observable. Those that were for 
 imposing the ceremonial laws were positive and imperious: <I>Except you 
 keep it, you cannot be saved</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 you are excommunicated <I>ipso facto--at once, and delivered to
 Satan.</I> The apostles of Christ, who only recommend necessary things, 
 are mild and gentle: "<I>From which if you keep yourselves, you will do 
 well,</I> and as becomes you. <I>Fare ye well;</I> we are hearty 
 well-wishers to your honour and peace."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The delivering of the letters, and how the messengers disposed of 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>When they were dismissed,</I> had had their audience of leave of 
 the apostles (it is probable that they were dismissed with prayer, and 
 a solemn blessing in the name of the Lord, and with instructions and 
 encouragements in their work), <I>They then came to Antioch;</I> they 
 staid no longer at Jerusalem than till their business was done, and 
 then came back, and perhaps were met at their return by those that 
 brought them on their way at their setting out; for those that have 
 taken pains in public service ought to be countenanced and 
 encouraged.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As soon as they came to Antioch, <I>they gathered the multitude 
 together, and delivered the epistle to them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>),

 that they might all know what it was that was forbidden them, and might 
 observe these orders, which would be no difficulty for them to do, most 
 of them having been, before their conversion to Christ, proselytes of 
 the gate, who had laid themselves under these restrictions already. But 
 this was not all; it was that they might know that <I>no more</I> than 
 this was forbidden them, that it was no longer a sin to eat swine's 
 flesh, no longer a pollution to touch a grave or a dead body.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The people were wonderfully pleased with the orders that came from 
 Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>They rejoiced for the consolation;</I> and a great consolation it 
 was to the multitude, 

 (1.) That they were confirmed in their freedom from the yoke of the 
 ceremonial law, and were not burdened with that, as those upstart 
 teachers would have had them to be. It was a comfort to them to hear 
 that the carnal ordinances were no longer imposed on them, which 
 perplexed the conscience, but could not purify nor pacify it. 

 (2.) That those who troubled their minds with an attempt to force 
 circumcision upon them were hereby for the present silenced and put to 
 confusion, the fraud of their pretensions to an apostolical warrant 
 being now discovered. 

 (3.) That the Gentiles were hereby encouraged to receive the gospel, 
 and those that had received it to adhere to it.

 (4.) That the peace of the church was hereby restored, and that removed 
 which threatened a division. All this was consolation which they 
 rejoiced in, and blessed God for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They got the strange ministers that came from Jerusalem to give them 
 each a sermon, and more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Judas and Silas, <I>being prophets also themselves,</I> endued with the 
 Holy Ghost, and called to the work, and being likewise entrusted by the 
 apostles to deliver some things relating to this matter by word of 
 mouth, <I>exhorted the brethren with many words,</I> and <I>confirmed 
 them.</I> Even those that had the constant preaching of Paul and 
 Barnabas, yet were glad of the help of Judas and Silas; the diversity 
 of the gifts of ministers is of use to the church. Observe what is the 
 work of ministers with those that are in Christ.

 (1.) To confirm them, by bringing them to see more reason both for 
 their faith in Christ and their obedience to him; to confirm their 
 choice of Christ and their resolutions for Christ. 

 (2.) To exhort them to perseverance, and to the particular duties 
 required of them: to quicken them to that which is good, and direct 
 them in it. They comforted the brethren (so it may be rendered), and 
 this would contribute to the confirming of them; for the joy of the 
 Lord will be our strength. They exhorted them with many words; they 
 used a very great copiousness and variety of expression. One word would 
 affect one, and another another; and therefore, though what they had to 
 say might have been summed up in a few words, yet it was for the 
 edification of the church that they used <I>many words,</I> <B><I>dia 
 logou pollou</I></B>--<I>with much speech, much reasoning; precept must
 be upon precept.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The dismission of the Jerusalem ministers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 When they had <I>spent some time among them</I> (so it might be read), 
 <B><I>poiesantes chronon</I></B>--<I>having made some stay,</I> and
 having made it to good purpose, not having trifled away time, but 
 having filled it up, they were let go in peace from the brethren at 
 Antioch, to the apostles at Jerusalem, with all possible expressions of 
 kindness and respect; they thanked them for their coming and pains, and 
 the good service they had done, wished them their health and a good 
 journey home, and committed them to the custody of the peace of 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The continuance of Silas, notwithstanding, together with Paul and 
 Barnabas, at Antioch. 

 (1.) Silas, when it came to the setting to, would not go back with
 Judas to Jerusalem, but let him go home by himself, and chose rather to 
 <I>abide still at Antioch,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 And we have no reason at all to blame him for it, though we know not 
 the reason that moved him to it. I am apt to think the congregations at 
 Antioch were both more large and more lively than those at Jerusalem, 
 and that this tempted him to stay there, and he did well: so did Judas, 
 who, notwithstanding this, returned to his post of service at 
 Jerusalem.

 (2.) Paul and Barnabas, though their work lay chiefly among the 
 Gentiles, yet continued for some time in Antioch, being pleased with 
 the society of the ministers and people there, which, it should seem by 
 divers passages, was more than ordinarily inviting. They continued 
 there, not to take their pleasure, but <I>teaching and preaching the 
 word of God.</I> Antioch, being the chief city of Syria, it is probable 
 there was a great resort of Gentiles thither from all parts upon one 
 account or other, as there was of Jews to Jerusalem; so that in 
 preaching there they did in effect preach to many nations, for they 
 preached to those who would carry the report of what they preached to 
 many nations, and thereby prepare them for the apostles' coming in 
 person to preach to them. And thus they were not only not idle at 
 Antioch, but were serving their main intention. 

 (3.) There were <I>many others also</I> there, labouring at the same 
 oar. The multitude of workmen in Christ's vineyard does not give us a 
 writ of ease. Even where there are many others labouring in the word 
 and doctrine, yet there may be opportunity for us; the zeal and 
 usefulness of others should excite us, not lay us asleep.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>36 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again
 and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the
 word of the Lord, <I>and see</I> how they do.
 &nbsp; 37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose
 surname was Mark.
 &nbsp; 38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who
 departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the
 work.
 &nbsp; 39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they
 departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark,
 and sailed unto Cyprus;
 &nbsp; 40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the
 brethren unto the grace of God.
 &nbsp; 41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the
 churches.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have seen one unhappy difference among the brethren, which was of a 
 public nature, brought to a good issue; but here we have a private 
 quarrel between two ministers, no less men than Paul and Barnabas, not 
 compromised indeed, yet ending well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a good proposal Paul made to Barnabas to go and review their 
 work among the Gentiles and renew it, to take a circuit among the 
 churches they had planted, and see what progress the gospel made among 
 them. Antioch was now a safe and quiet harbour for them: they had there 
 no adversary nor evil occurrent; but Paul remembered that they only put 
 in there to refit and refresh themselves, and therefore begins now to 
 think of putting to sea again; and, having been in winter quarters long 
 enough, he is for taking the field again, and making another campaign, 
 in a vigorous prosecution of this holy war against Satan's kingdom. 
 Paul remembered that the work appointed him was afar off among the 
 Gentiles, and therefore he is here meditating a second expedition among 
 them to do the same work, though to encounter the same difficulties; 
 and this <I>some days after,</I> for his active spirit could not bear 
 to be long out of work; no, nor his bold and daring spirit to be long 
 out of danger. Observe, 

 1. To whom he makes this proposal--to Barnabas, his old friend and
 fellow-labourer; he invites his company and help in this work. We have 
 need one of another, and may be in many ways serviceable one to 
 another; and therefore should be forward both to borrow and lend 
 assistance. Two are better than one. Every soldier has his comrade. 

 2. For whom the visit is designed: "Let us not presently begin new
 work, nor break up new ground; but let us take a view of the fields we 
 have sown. <I>Come, and let us get up early to the vineyards, let us 
 see if the vine flourish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:12">Cant. vii. 12</A>.

 <I>Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have
 preached the word of the Lord.</I>" Observe, He calls all the 
 Christians brethren, and not ministers only; for, <I>Have we not all 
 one Father?</I> He has a concern for them in <I>every city,</I> even 
 where the brethren were fewest and poorest, and most persecuted and 
 despised; yet let us visit them. Wherever we have <I>preached the word 
 of the Lord,</I> let us go and water the seed sown. Note, Those that 
 have preached the gospel should visit those to whom them have preached 
 it. As we must look after our praying, and hear what answer God gives 
 to that; so we must look after our preaching, and see what success that 
 has. Faithful ministers cannot but have a particular tender concern
 for those to whom they have preached the gospel, that they may not 
 bestow upon them labour in vain. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:5,6">1 Thess. iii. 5, 6</A>.
 
 3. What was intended in this visit: "Let us <I>see how they do,</I>"
 <B><I>pos echousi</I></B>--<I>how it is with them.</I> It was not
 merely a compliment that he designed, nor did he take such a journey 
 with a bare <I>How do you do?</I> No, he would visit them that he might 
 acquaint himself with their case, and impart unto them such spiritual 
 gifts as were suited to it; as the physician visits his recovering 
 patient, that he may prescribe what is proper for the perfecting of his 
 cure, and the preventing of a relapse. Let us see how they do, that is,

 (1.) What spirit they are of, how they stand affected, and how they
 behave themselves; it is probable that they frequently heard from them, 
 "But let us go and see them; let us go and see whether they hold fast 
 what we preached to them, and live up to it, that we may endeavour to 
 reduce them if we find them wandering, to confirm them if we find them 
 wavering, and to comfort them if we find them steady." 

 (2.) What state they are in, whether the churches have rest and 
 liberty, or whether they are not in trouble or distress, that we may 
 rejoice with them if they rejoice, and caution them against security, 
 and may weep with them if they weep, and comfort them under the cross, 
 and may know the better how to pray for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The disagreement between Paul and Barnabas about an assistant; it 
 was convenient to have a young man with them that should attend on them 
 and minister to them, and be a witness of their <I>doctrine, manner of 
 life, and patience,</I> and that should be fitted and trained up for 
 further service, by being occasionally employed in the present service. 
 Now, 

 1. Barnabas would have his nephew John, whose surname was Mark, to go
 along with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 He determined to take him, because he was his relation, and, it is 
 likely, was brought up under him, and he had a kindness for him, and 
 was solicitous for his welfare. We should suspect ourselves of 
 partiality, and guard against it in preferring our relations.

 2. Paul opposed it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>He thought not good to take him with them,</I> <B><I>ouk 
 exiou</I></B>--<I>he did not think him worthy</I> of the honour, nor
 fit for the service, who had <I>departed from them,</I> clandestinely 
 as it should seem, without their knowledge, or wilfully, without their 
 consent, from Pamphylia

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:13"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 13</A>),

 and <I>went not with them to the work,</I> because he was either lazy
 and would not take the pains that must be taken, or cowardly and would 
 not run the hazard. He run his colours just as they were going to 
 engage. It is probable that he promised very fair now that he would not 
 do so again. But Paul thought it was not fit he should be thus honoured 
 who had forfeited his reputation, nor thus employed who had betrayed 
 his trust; at least, not till he had been longer tried. If a man 
 deceive me once, it is his fault; but, if twice, it is my own, for 
 trusting him. Solomon saith, <I>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time 
 of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint,</I> which 
 will hardly be used again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:19">Prov. xxv. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The issue of this disagreement: it came to such a height that they 
 separated upon it. The contention, the <I>paroxysm</I> (so the word 
 is), the fit of passion which this threw them both into, was so sharp 
 that they <I>departed asunder one from the other.</I> Barnabas was 
 peremptory that he would not go with Paul unless they took John Mark 
 with them; Paul was as peremptory that he would not go if John did go 
 with them. Neither would yield, and therefore there is no remedy but 
 they must part. Now here is that which is very humbling, and just 
 matter of lamentation, and yet very instructive. For we see, 

 1. That the best of men are but men, <I>subject to like passions</I> as
 we are, as these two good men had expressly owned concerning themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:15"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 15</A>),

 and now it appeared too true. I doubt there was (as usually there is in
 such contentions) a <I>fault on both sides;</I> perhaps Paul was too 
 severe upon the young man, and did not allow his fault the extenuation 
 it was capable of, did not consider what a useful woman his mother was 
 in Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:12"><I>ch.</I> xii. 12</A>),

 nor make the allowances he might have made to Barnabas's natural
 affection. But it was Barnabas's fault that he took this into 
 consideration, in a case wherein the interest of Christ's kingdom was 
 concerned, and indulged it too much. And they were certainly both in 
 fault to be hot as to let the contention be sharp (it is to be feared 
 they gave one another some hard words), as also to be so stiff as each 
 to stick resolutely to his opinion, and neither to yield. It is a pity 
 that they did not refer the matter to a third person, or that some 
 friend did not interpose to prevent its coming to an open rupture. Is 
 there never a wise man among them to interpose his good offices, and to 
 accommodate the matter, and to put them in mind of the Canaanite and 
 the Perizzite that were <I>now in the land,</I> and that not only Jews 
 and heathens, but the false brethren among themselves, would warm their 
 hands at the flames of the contention between Paul and Barnabas? We 
 must own it was their infirmity, and is recorded for our admonition; 
 not that we must make use of it to excuse our own intemperate heats and 
 passions, or to rebate the edge of our sorrow and shame for them; we 
 must not say, "What if I was in a passion, were not Paul and Barnabas 
 so?" No; but it must check our censures of others, and moderate them. 
 If good men are soon put into a passion, we must make the best of it, 
 it was the infirmity once of two of the best men that ever the world 
 had. Repentance teaches us to be severe in reflections upon ourselves;
 but charity teaches us to be candid in our reflections upon others. It 
 is only Christ's example that is a copy without a blot. 

 2. That we are not to think it strange if there be differences among
 wise and good men; we were told before that such offences would come, 
 and here is an instance of it. Even those that are united to one and 
 the same Jesus, and sanctified by one and the same Spirit, have 
 different apprehensions, different opinions, different views, and 
 different sentiments in points of prudence. It will be so while we are 
 in this state of darkness and imperfection; we shall never be all of a 
 mind till we come to heaven, where light and love are perfect. That is 
 <I>charity</I> which <I>never fails.</I> 

 3. That these differences often prevail so far as to occasion
 separations. Paul and Barnabas, who were not separated by the
 persecutions of the unbelieving Jews, nor the impositions of the 
 believing Jews, were yet separated by an unhappy disagreement between 
 themselves. O the mischief that even the poor and weak remainders of 
 pride and passion, that are found even in good men, do in the world, do 
 in the church! Now wonder the consequences are so fatal where they 
 reign.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The good that was brought out of this evil-meat out of the eater, 
 and sweetness out of the strong. It was strange that even the 
 sufferings of the apostles (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:12">Phil. i. 12</A>),

 but much more strange that even the quarrels of the apostles, should 
 tend to the <I>furtherance of the gospel of Christ;</I> yet so it 
 proved here. God would not permit such things to be, if he knew not how 
 to make them to serve his own purposes. 

 1. More places are hereby visited. Barnabas went one way; he sailed to
 Cyprus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 that famous island where they began their work

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:4"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 4</A>),
 
 and which was <I>his own country,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:36"><I>ch.</I> iv. 36</A>.

 Paul went another way into Cilicia, which was <I>his own country,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:39"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 39</A>.

 Each seems to be influenced by his affection to his native soil, as
 usual (<I>Nescio qu&aacute; natale solum dulcedine cunctos ducit--There
 is something that attaches us all to our native soil</I>), and yet God 
 served his own purposes by it, for the diffusing of gospel light. 

 2. More hands are hereby employed in the ministry of the gospel among
 the Gentiles; for,

 (1.) John Mark, who had been an unfaithful hand, is not rejected, but
 is again made use of, against Paul's mind, and, for aught we know, 
 proves a very useful and successful hand, though many think it was not 
 the same with that Mark that wrote the gospel, and founded the church 
 at Alexandria, and whom Peter calls his son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:13">1 Pet. v. 13</A>.

 (2.) Silas who was a new hand, and never yet employed in that work, nor 
 intended to be, but to return to the service of the church at 
 Jerusalem, had not God changed his mind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>),

 he is brought in, and engaged in that noble work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. We may further observe, 

 1. That the church at Antioch seem to countenance Paul in what he did.
 Barnabas sailed with his nephew to Cyprus, and no notice was taken of 
 him, nor a <I>bene discessit--a recommendation</I> given him. Note,
 Those that in their service of the church are swayed by private 
 affections and regards forfeit public honours and respect. But, when 
 Paul departed, he was <I>recommended by the brethren to the grace of 
 God.</I> They thought he was in the right in refusing to make use of 
 John Mark, and could not but blame Barnabas for insisting upon it, 
 though he was one who had deserved well of the church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:22"><I>ch.</I> xi. 22</A>)

 before they knew Paul; and therefore they prayed publicly for Paul, and
 for the success of his ministry, encouraged him to go on in his work, 
 and, though they could do nothing themselves to further him, they 
 transferred the matter to the grace of God, leaving it to that grace 
 both to work upon him and to work with him. Note, Those are happy at 
 all times, and especially in times of disagreement and contention, who 
 are enabled so to carry themselves as not to forfeit their interest in 
 the love and prayers of good people. 

 2. That yet Paul afterwards seems to have had, though not upon second
 thoughts, yet upon further trial, a better opinion of John Mark than 
 now he had; for he writes to Timothy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:11">2 Tim. iv. 11</A>),

 <I>Take Mark and bring him with thee, for he is profitable to me for 
 the ministry;</I> and he writes to the Colossians concerning Marcus, 
 sister's son to Barnabas, that <I>if he came to them</I> they should 
 <I>receive him,</I> bid him welcome, and employ him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:10">Col. iv. 10</A>),

 which teaches us, 

 (1.) That even those whom we justly condemn we should condemn 
 moderately, and with a great deal of temper, because we know not but 
 afterwards we may see cause to think better of them, and both to make 
 use of them and make friendship with them, and we should so regulate 
 our resentments that if it should prove so we may not afterwards be 
 ashamed of them. 

 (2.) That even those whom we have justly condemned, if afterwards they 
 prove more faithful, we should cheerfully receive, forgive and forget, 
 and put a confidence in, and, as there is occasion, give a good word 
 to. 

 3. That Paul, though he wanted his old friend and companion in the 
 kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, yet went on cheerfully in his 
 work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 <I>He went through Syria and Cilicia,</I> countries which lay next to 
 Antioch, <I>confirming the churches.</I> Though we change our 
 colleagues, we do not change our principal president. And observe, 
 Ministers are well employed, and ought to think themselves so, and be 
 satisfied, when they are made use of confirming those that believe, as 
 well as in converting those that believe not.</P>
