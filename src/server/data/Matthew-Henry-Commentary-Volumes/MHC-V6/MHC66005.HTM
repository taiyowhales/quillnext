 In the foregoing chapter the prophetical scene was opened, in the sight 
 and hearing of the apostle, and he had a sight of God the Creator and 
 ruler of the world, and the great King of the church. He saw God on the 
 throne of glory and government, surrounded with his holy ones, and 
 receiving their adorations. Now the counsels and decrees of God are set 
 before the apostle, as in a book, which God held in his right hand; and 
 this book is represented, 
 
 I. As sealed in the hand of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. As taken into the hand of Christ the Redeemer, to be unsealed and
 opened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:6-14">ver. 6, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a
 book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
 &nbsp; 2  And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who
 is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
 &nbsp; 3  And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth,
 was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
 &nbsp; 4  And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and
 to read the book, neither to look thereon.
 &nbsp; 5  And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the
 Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to
 open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hitherto the apostle had seen only the great God, the governor of all
 things, now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He is favoured with a sight of the model and methods of his
 government, as they are all written down in a book which he holds in
 his hand; and this we are now to consider as shut up and sealed in the
 hand of God. Observe,

 1. The designs and methods of divine Providence towards the church and
 the world are stated and fixed; they are resolved upon and agreed to,
 as that which is written in a book. The great design is laid, every
 part adjusted, all determined, and every thing passed into decree and 
 made a matter of record. The original and first draught of this book is 
 the book of God's decrees, laid up in his own cabinet, in his eternal 
 mind: but there is a transcript of so much as was necessary to be known 
 in the book of the scriptures in general, in the prophetical part of 
 the scripture especially, and in this prophecy in particular. 

 2. God holds this book in his right hand, to declare the authority of 
 the book, and his readiness and resolution to execute all the contents 
 thereof, all the counsels and purposes therein recorded. 

 3. This book in the hand of God is shut up and sealed; it is known to
 none but himself, till he allows it to be opened. <I>Known unto 
 God,</I> and to him alone, <I>are all his works, from the beginning of 
 the world;</I> but it is his glory to conceal the matter as he pleases. 
 The times and seasons, and their great events, he hath kept in his own 
 hand and power. 

 4. It is <I>sealed with seven seals.</I> This tells us with what
 inscrutable secrecy the counsels of God are laid, how impenetrable by 
 the eye and intellect of the creature; and also points us to seven 
 several parts of this book of God's counsels. Each part seems to have 
 its particular seal, and, when opened, discovers its proper events; 
 these seven parts are not unsealed and opened at once, but 
 successively, one scene of Providence introducing another, and 
 explaining it, till the whole mystery of God's counsel and conduct be 
 finished in the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He heard a proclamation made concerning this sealed book. 

 1. The crier was <I>a strong angel;</I> not that there are any weak
 ones among the angels in heaven, though there are many among the angels 
 of the churches. This angel seems to come out, not only as a crier, but 
 as a champion, with a challenge to any or all the creatures to try the 
 strength of their wisdom in opening the counsels of God; and, as a 
 champion, he cried with a loud voice, that every creature might hear.

 2. The cry or challenge proclaimed was, "<I>Who is worthy to open the
 book, and to loose the seals thereof?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 If there by any creature who thinks himself sufficient either to
 explain or execute the counsels of God, let him stand forth, and make 
 the attempt." 

 3. None in heaven or earth could accept the challenge and undertake the
 task: none <I>in heaven,</I> none of the glorious holy angels, though 
 before the throne of God, and the ministers of his providence; they 
 with all their wisdom cannot dive into the decrees of God: none <I>on 
 earth,</I> no man, the wisest or the best of men, none of the magicians 
 and soothsayers, none of the prophets of God, any further than he 
 reveals his mind to them: <I>none under the earth,</I> none of the 
 fallen angels, none of the spirits of men departed, though they should 
 return to our world, can open this book. Satan himself, with all his 
 subtlety, cannot do it; the creatures cannot open it, nor look on it; 
 they cannot read it. God only can do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He felt a great concern in himself about this matter: the apostle 
 <I>wept much;</I> it was a great disappointment to him. By what he had 
 seen in him who sat upon the throne, he was very desirous to see and 
 know more of his mind and will: this desire, when not presently 
 gratified, filled him with sorrow, and fetched many tears from his 
 eyes. Here observe, 

 1. Those who have seen most of God in this world are most desirous to
 see more; and those who have seen his glory desire to know his will. 

 2. Good men may be too eager and to hasty to look into the mysteries
 of divine conduct. 

 3. Such desires, not presently answered, turn to grief and sorrow.
 <I>Hope deferred makes the heart sick.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The apostle was comforted and encouraged to hope this sealed book 
 would yet be opened. Here observe, 

 1. Who it was that gave John the hint: <I>One of the elders.</I> God
 had revealed it to his church. If angels do not refuse to learn from 
 the church, ministers should not disdain to do it. God can make his 
 people to instruct and inform their teachers when he pleases. 

 2. Who it was that would do the thing--the Lord Jesus Christ, called
 <I>the lion of the tribe of Judah,</I> according to his human nature, 
 alluding to Jacob's prophecy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>),

 and <I>the root of David</I> according to his divine nature, though a 
 branch of David according to the flesh. He who is a middle person, God 
 and man, and bears the office of Mediator between God and man, is fit 
 and worthy to open and execute all the counsels of God towards men. And 
 this he does in his mediatorial state and capacity, <I>as the root of 
 David and the offspring of Judah,</I> and as the King and head of the 
 Israel of God; and he will do it, to the consolation and joy of all his 
 people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the
 four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it
 had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the
 seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
 &nbsp; 7  And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him
 that sat upon the throne.
 &nbsp; 8  And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four
 <I>and</I> twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one
 of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the
 prayers of saints.
 &nbsp; 9  And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
 book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and
 hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and
 tongue, and people, and nation;
 &nbsp; 10  And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we
 shall reign on the earth.
 &nbsp; 11  And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round
 about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of
 them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of
 thousands;
 &nbsp; 12  Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
 to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and
 honour, and glory, and blessing.
 &nbsp; 13  And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
 under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in
 them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power,
 <I>be</I> unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for
 ever and ever.
 &nbsp; 14  And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four <I>and</I> twenty
 elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and
 ever.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, I. The apostle beholds this book taken into the hands of the Lord 
 Jesus Christ, in order to its being unsealed and opened by him. Here 
 Christ is described, 

 1. By his place and station: <I>In the midst of the throne, and of the
 four beasts, and of the elders.</I> He was on the same throne with the 
 Father; he was nearer to him than either the elders or ministers of the 
 churches. Christ, as man and Mediator, is subordinate to God the 
 Father, but is nearer to him than all the creatures; <I>for in him all 
 the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily.</I> The ministers stand 
 between God and the people. Christ stands as the Mediator between God 
 and both ministers and people. 

 2. The form in which he appeared. Before he is called <I>a lion;</I>
 here he appears <I>as a lamb slain.</I> He is a lion to conquer Satan, 
 a lamb to satisfy the justice of God. He appears with the marks of his 
 sufferings upon him, to show that he interceded in heaven in the virtue 
 of his satisfaction. He appears as a <I>lamb, having seven horns and 
 seven eyes,</I> perfect power to execute all the will of God and 
 perfect wisdom to understand it all and to do it in the most effectual 
 manner; <I>for he hath the seven Spirits of God,</I> he has received 
 the Holy Spirit without measure, in all perfection of light, and life, 
 and power, by which he is able to teach and rule all parts of the 
 earth. 

 3. He is described by his act and deed: <I>He came, and took the book
 out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 not by violence, nor by fraud, but he prevailed to do it (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 he prevailed by his merit and worthiness, he did it by authority and by 
 the Father's appointment. God very willingly and justly put the book of 
 his eternal counsels into the hand of Christ, and Christ as readily and 
 gladly took it into his hand; for he delights to reveal and to do the 
 will of his Father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle observes the universal joy and thanksgiving that filled 
 heaven and earth upon this transaction. No sooner had Christ received 
 this book out of the Father's hand than he received the applauses and 
 adorations of angels and men, yea, of <I>every creature.</I> And, 
 indeed, it is just matter of joy to all the world to see that God does 
 not deal with men in a way of absolute power and strict justice, but in 
 a way of grace and mercy through the Redeemer. He governs the world, 
 not merely as a Creator and Lawgiver, but as our God and Saviour. All 
 the world has reason to rejoice in this. The song of praise that was 
 offered up to the Lamb on this occasion consists of three parts, one 
 part sung by the church, another by the church and the angels, the 
 third by every creature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The church begins the doxology, as being more immediately concerned 
 in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 the four living creatures, and <I>the four-and-twenty elders,</I> the 
 Christian people, under their minister, lead up the chorus. Here 
 observe, 

 (1.) The object of their worship--<I>the Lamb,</I> the Lord Jesus 
 Christ; it is the declared will of God that all men <I>should honour 
 the Son as they honour the Father;</I> for he has the same nature. 

 (2.) Their posture: They <I>fell down before him,</I> gave him not an 
 inferior sort of worship, but the most profound adoration.

 (3.) The instruments used in their adorations--<I>harps and vials;</I> 
 the harps were the instruments of praise, the vials were full of odours 
 or incense, which signify <I>the prayers of the saints:</I> prayer and 
 praise should always go together. 

 (4.) The matter of their song: it was suited to the new state of the 
 church, the gospel-state introduced by the Son of God. In this new 
 song, 

 [1.] They acknowledge the infinite fitness and worthiness of the Lord 
 Jesus for this great work of opening and executing the counsel and 
 purposes of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof,</I> 
 every way sufficient for the work and deserving the honour. 

 [2.] They mention the grounds and reasons of this worthiness; and 
 though they do not exclude the dignity of his person as God, without 
 which he had not been sufficient for it, yet they chiefly insist upon 
 the merit of his sufferings, which he had endured for them; these more 
 sensibly struck their souls with thankfulness and joy. Here, 
 <I>First,</I> They mention his suffering: "<I>Thou wast slain,</I> 
 slain as a sacrifice, thy blood was shed." <I>Secondly,</I> The fruits 
 of his sufferings. 

 1. Redemption to God; Christ has redeemed his people from the bondage
 of sin, guilt, and Satan, redeemed them to God, set them at liberty to 
 serve him and to enjoy him. 

 2. High exaltation: Thou <I>hast made us to our God kings and priests,
 and we shall reign on the earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Every ransomed slave is not immediately preferred to honour; he thinks 
 it a great favour to be restored to liberty. But when the elect of God 
 were made slaves by sin and Satan, in every nation of the world, Christ 
 not only purchased their liberty for them, but the highest honour and 
 preferment, <I>made them kings and priests</I>--kings, to rule over 
 their own spirits, and to overcome the world, and the evil one; and he 
 has made them priests, given them access to himself, and liberty to 
 offer up spiritual sacrifices, and <I>they shall reign on the 
 earth;</I> they shall with him judge the world at the great day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The doxology, thus begun by the church, is carried on by the angels; 
 they take the second part, in conjunction with the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They are said to be <I>innumerable,</I> and to be the attendants on the 
 throne of God and guardians to the church; though they did not need a 
 Saviour themselves, yet they rejoice in the redemption and salvation of 
 sinners, and they agree with the church in acknowledging the infinite 
 merits of the Lord Jesus as dying for sinners, that he is <I>worthy to 
 receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and 
 glory, and blessing.</I>

 (1.) He is worthy of that office and that authority which require the 
 greatest power and wisdom, the greatest fund, all excellency, to 
 discharge them aright; and, 

 (2.) He is worthy of all honour, and glory, and blessing, because he is 
 sufficient for the office and faithful in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. This doxology, thus begun by the church, and carried on by the 
 angels, is resounded and echoed by the whole creation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Heaven and earth ring with the high praises of the Redeemer. The whole 
 creation fares the better for Christ. <I>By him all things consist;</I> 
 and all the creatures, had they sense and language, would adore that 
 great Redeemer who delivers the creature from that bondage under which 
 it groans, through the corruption of men, and the just curse denounced 
 by the great God upon the fall; that part which (by a prosopopoeia) is 
 made for the whole creation is a song of <I>blessing, and honour, and 
 glory, and power,</I>

 (1.) <I>To him that sits on the throne,</I> to God as God, or to God 
 the Father, as the first person in the Trinity and the first in the 
 economy of our salvation; and, 

 (2.) <I>To the Lamb,</I> as the second person in the Godhead and the 
 Mediator of the new covenant. Not that the worship paid to the Lamb is 
 of another nature, an inferior worship, for the very same honour and 
 glory are in the same words ascribed <I>to the Lamb and to him that 
 sits on the throne,</I> their essence being the same; but, their parts 
 in the work of our salvation being distinct they are distinctly adored. 
 We worship and glorify one and the same God for our creation and for 
 our redemption.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We see how the church that began the heavenly anthem, finding heaven 
 and earth join in the concert, closes all with their <I>Amen,</I> and 
 end as they began, with a low prostration before the eternal and
 everlasting God. Thus we have seen this sealed book passing with great 
 solemnity from the hand of the Creator into the hand of the 
 Redeemer.</P>
