 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle is very careful to hinder the spreading of an error into 
 which some among them had fallen concerning the coming of Christ, as 
 being very near, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 Then he proceeds to confute the error he cautioned them against, by
 telling them of two great events that were antecedent to the coming of 
 Christ--a general apostasy, and the revelation of antichrist, concerning
 whom the apostle tells them many remarkable things, about his name, his
 character, his rise, his fall, his reign, and the sin and ruin of his
 subjects, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:4-12">ver. 4-12</A>.

 He then comforts them against the terror of this apostasy, and exhorts
 them to stedfastness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.

 And concludes with a prayer for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
 Christ, and <I>by</I> our gathering together unto him,
 &nbsp; 2  That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither
 by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day
 of Christ is at hand.
 &nbsp; 3  Let no man deceive you by any means--
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From these words it appears that some among the Thessalonians had 
 mistaken the apostle's meaning, in what he had written in his former 
 epistle about the coming of Christ, by thinking that it was near at 
 hand,--that Christ was just ready to appear and come to judgment. Or, it
 may be, some among them pretended that they had the knowledge of this 
 by particular revelation from the Spirit, or from some words they had 
 heard from the apostle, when he was with them, or some letter he had 
 written or they pretended he had written to them or some other person: 
 and hereupon the apostle is careful to rectify this mistake, and to 
 prevent the spreading of this error. Observe, If errors and mistakes 
 arise among Christians, we should take the first opportunity to rectify 
 them, and hinder the spreading thereof; and good men will be especially 
 careful to suppress errors that may arise from a mistake of their words 
 and actions, though that which was spoken or done was ever so innocent 
 or well. We have a subtle adversary, who watches all opportunities to 
 do mischief, and will sometimes promote errors even by means of the 
 words of scripture. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How very earnest and solicitous this apostle was to prevent 
 mistakes: <I>We beseech you, brethren,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He entreats them as brethren who might have charged them as a father 
 charges his children: he shows great kindness and condescension, and 
 insinuates himself into their affections. And this is the best way to 
 deal with men when we would preserve or recover them from errors, to 
 deal gently and affectionately with them: rough and rigorous treatment 
 will but exasperate their spirits, and prejudice them against the 
 reasons we may offer. He obtests and even conjures them in the most 
 solemn manner: <I>By the coming of Christ,</I> &c. The words are in the 
 form of an oath; and his meaning is that if they believed Christ would 
 come, and if they desired he would come, and rejoiced in the hope of 
 his coming, they should be careful to avoid the error, and the evil 
 consequences of it, against which he was now cautioning them. From this 
 form of obtestation used by the apostle, we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is most certain that the Lord Jesus Christ will come to judge the 
 world, that he will come in all the pomp and power of the upper world 
 in the last day, to execute judgment upon all. Whatever uncertainty we 
 are at, or whatever mistakes may arise about the time of his coming, 
 his coming itself is certain. This has been the faith and hope of all 
 Christians in all ages of the church; nay, it was the faith and hope of 
 the Old-Testament saints, ever since Enoch the seventh from Adam, who 
 said, <I>Behold, the Lord cometh,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. At the second coming of Christ all the saints will be gathered 
 together to him; and this mention of the gathering of the saints 
 together unto Christ at his coming shows that the apostle speaks of 
 Christ's coming to judgment day, and not of his coming to destroy 
 Jerusalem. He speaks of a proper, and not a metaphorical advent: and, 
 as it will be part of Christ's honour in that day, so it will be the 
 completing of the happiness of his saints. 

 (1.) That they all shall be gathered together. There will then be a 
 general meeting of all the saints, and none but saints; all the 
 Old-Testament saints, who got acquaintance with Christ by the dark 
 shadows of the law, and saw this day at a distance; and all the 
 New-Testament saints, to whom life and immortality were brought to 
 light by the gospel; they will all be gathered together. There will 
 then come from the four winds of heaven all that are, or ever were, or 
 ever shall be, from the beginning to the end of time. All shall be 
 gathered together. 

 (2.) That they shall be gathered <I>together to Christ.</I> He will be 
 the great centre of their unity. They shall be gathered together to 
 him, to be attendants on him, to be assessors with him, to be presented 
 by him to the Father, to be with him for ever, and altogether happy in 
 his presence to all eternity. 

 (3.) The doctrine of Christ's coming and our gathering together to him 
 is of a great moment and importance to Christians; otherwise it would 
 not be the proper matter of the apostle's obtestation. We ought 
 therefore not only to believe these things, but highly to account of 
 them also, and look upon them as things we are greatly concerned in and 
 should be much affected with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The thing itself against which the apostle cautions the 
 Thessalonians is that they should not be deceived about the time of 
 Christ's coming, and so <I>be shaken in mind, or be troubled.</I> Note, 
 Errors in the mind tend greatly to weaken our faith, and cause us 
 trouble; and such as are weak in faith and of troubled minds are 
 oftentimes apt to be deceived, and fall a prey to seducers. 

 1. The apostle would not have them be deceived: <I>Let no man deceive
 you by any means,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 There are many who lie in wait to deceive, and they have many ways of 
 deceiving; we have reason therefore to be cautious and stand upon our 
 guard. Some deceivers will pretend new revelations, others misinterpret 
 scripture, and others will be guilty of gross forgeries; divers means 
 and artifices of deceit men will use; but we must be careful that no 
 man deceive us by any means. The particular matter in which the apostle 
 cautions them not to be deceived is about the near approach of Christ's 
 coming, as if it was to have been in the apostle's days; and harmless 
 as this error might seem to many, yet, because it was indeed an error, 
 it would have proved of bad consequences to many persons. Therefore, 

 2. He gives them warning, and would not have them be soon shaken in
 mind, nor be troubled.

 (1.) He would not have their faith weakened. We should firmly believe 
 the second coming of Christ, and be settled and established in the 
 faith of this; but there was danger lest the Thessalonians, if they 
 apprehended the coming of Christ was just at hand, upon finding that 
 they, or others whom they too much regarded, were mistaken as to the 
 time, should thereupon question the truth or certainty of the thing 
 itself; whereas they ought not to waver in their minds as to this great 
 thing, which is the faith and hope of all the saints. False doctrines 
 are like winds, that toss the water to and fro, and they are apt to 
 unsettle the minds of men, who are sometimes as unstable as water. 
 Then, 

 (2.) He would not have their comforts lessened, that they should not be 
 troubled nor affrighted with false alarms. It is probable that the 
 coming of Christ was represented in so much terror as to trouble many 
 serious Christians among them, though in itself it should be matter of 
 the believer's hope and joy; or else many might be troubled with the 
 thought how surprising this day would be, or with the fear of their 
 unpreparedness, or upon the reflection on their mistake about the time 
 of Christ's coming: we should always watch and pray, but must not be 
 discouraged nor uncomfortable at the thought of Christ's coming.</P>

 &nbsp; 4  Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
 God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the
 temple of God, showing himself that he is God.
 &nbsp; 5  Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you
 these things?

 &nbsp; 7  For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who

 brightness of his coming:
 &nbsp; 9  <I>Even him,</I> whose coming is after the working of Satan with
 all power and signs and lying wonders,
 &nbsp; 10  And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that

 they might be saved.
 &nbsp; 11  And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that
 they should believe a lie:
 &nbsp; 12  That they all might be damned who believed not the truth,
 but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words the apostle confutes the error against which he had 
 cautioned them, and gives the reasons why they should not expect the 
 coming of Christ as just at hand. There were several events previous to 
 the second coming of Christ; in particular, he tells them there would 
 be,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A general apostasy, <I>there would come a falling away first,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 By this apostasy we are not to understand a defection in the state, or 
 from civil government, but in spiritual or religious matters, from 
 sound doctrine, instituted worship and church government, and a holy 
 life. The apostle speaks of some very great apostasy, not only of some 
 converted Jews or Gentiles, but such as should be very general, though 
 gradual, and should give occasion to the revelation of rise of 
 <I>antichrist,</I> that <I>man of sin.</I> This, he says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 he had told them of when he was with them, with design, no doubt, that 
 they should not take offence nor be stumbled at it. And let us observe 
 that no sooner was Christianity planted and rooted in the world than 
 there began to be a defection in the Christian church. It was so in the 
 Old-Testament church; presently after any considerable advance made in 
 religion there followed a defection: soon after the promise there was 
 revolting; for example, soon after men began to call upon the name of 
 the Lord all flesh corrupted their way,--soon after the covenant with 
 Noah the Babel-builders bade defiance to heaven,--soon after the 
 covenant with Abraham his seed degenerated in Egypt,--soon after the 
 Israelites were planted in Canaan, when the first generation was worn 
 off, they forsook God and served Baal,--soon after God's covenant with 
 David his seed revolted, and served other gods,--soon after the return 
 out of captivity there was a general decay of piety, as appears by the 
 story of Ezra and Nehemiah; and therefore it was no strange thing that 
 after the planting of Christianity there should come a falling 
 away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A revelation of that man of sin, that is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 antichrist would take his rise from this general apostasy. The apostle 
 afterwards speaks of the revelation of that wicked one 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 intimating the discovery which should be made of his wickedness, in 
 order to his ruin: here he seems to speak of his rise, which should be 
 occasioned by the general apostasy he had mentioned, and to intimate 
 that all sorts of false doctrines and corruptions should centre in him. 
 Great disputes have been as to who or what is intended by this man of 
 sin and son of perdition: and, if it be not certain that the papal 
 power and tyranny are principally or only intended, yet this is plain, 
 What is here said does very exactly agree thereto. For observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The names of this person, or rather the state and power here spoken 
 of. He is called the man of sin, to denote his egregious wickedness; 
 not only is he addicted to, and practises, wickedness himself, but he 
 also promotes, countenances, and commands sin and wickedness in others; 
 and he is the son of perdition, because he himself is devoted to 
 certain destruction, and is the instrument of destroying many others 
 both in soul and body. These names may properly be applied, for these 
 reasons, to the papal state; and thereto agree also,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The characters here given, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 (1.) That he <I>opposes and exalts himself above all that is called 
 God, or is worshipped;</I> and thus have the bishops of Rome not only 
 opposed God's authority, and that of the civil magistrates, who are 
 called gods, but have exalted themselves above God and earthly 
 governors, in demanding greater regard to their commands than to the 
 commands of God or the magistrate. 

 (2.) <I>As God, he sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he 
 is God.</I> As God was in the temple of old, and worshipped there, and 
 is in and with his church now, so the antichrist here mentioned is some 
 usurper of God's authority in the Christian church, who claims divine 
 honours; and to whom can this better apply than to the bishops of Rome, 
 to whom the most blasphemous titles have been given, as <I>Dominus Deus 
 noster papa--Our Lord God the pope; Deus alter in terr&acirc;--Another 
 God on earth; Idem est dominium Dei et pap&aelig;--The dominion of God 
 and the pope is the same?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His rise is mentioned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 Concerning this we are to observe two things:--

 (1.) There was something that hindered or withheld, or <I>let, until it
 was taken away.</I> This is supposed to be the power of the Roman 
 empire, which the apostle did not think fit to mention more plainly at 
 that time; and it is notorious that, while this power continued, it 
 prevented the advances of the bishops of Rome to that height of tyranny 
 to which soon afterwards they arrived. 

 (2.) This mystery of iniquity was gradually to arrive at its height; 
 and so it was in effect that the universal corruption of doctrine and 
 worship in the Romish church came in by degrees, and the usurpation of 
 the bishops of Rome was gradual, not all at once; and thus the mystery 
 of iniquity did the more easily, and almost insensibly, prevail. The 
 apostle justly calls it a <I>mystery of iniquity,</I> because wicked 
 designs and actions were concealed under false shows and pretences, at 
 least they were concealed from the common view and observation. By 
 pretended devotion, superstition and idolatry were advanced; and, by a 
 pretended zeal for God and his glory, bigotry and persecution were 
 promoted. And he tells us that this mystery of iniquity did even then 
 begin, or did <I>already work.</I> While the apostles were yet living, 
 <I>the enemy came, and sowed tares;</I> there were then the <I>deeds of 
 the Nicolaitans,</I> persons who pretended zeal for Christ, but really 
 opposed him. Pride, ambition, and worldly interest of church-pastors 
 and church-rulers, as in Diotrephes and others, were the early working 
 of the mystery of iniquity, which, by degrees, came to that prodigious 
 height which has been visible in the church of Rome.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The fall or ruin of the antichristian state is declared, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The head of this antichristian kingdom is called <I>that wicked 
 one,</I> or that lawless person who sets up a human power in 
 competition with, and contradiction to, the divine dominion and power 
 of the Lord Jesus Christ; but, as he would thus manifest himself to be 
 the man of sin, so the revelation or discovery of this to the world 
 would be the sure presage and the means of his ruin. The apostle 
 assures the Thessalonians that the Lord would consume and destroy him; 
 the consuming of him precedes his final destruction, and that is by the 
 <I>Spirit of his mouth,</I> by his word of command; the pure word of 
 God, accompanied with the Spirit of God, will discover this mystery of 
 iniquity, and make the power of antichrist to consume and waste away; 
 and in due time it will be totally and finally destroyed, and this will 
 be by the brightness of Christ's coming. Note, The coming of Christ to 
 destroy the wicked will be with peculiar glory and eminent lustre and 
 brightness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The apostle further describes the reign and rule of this man of sin. 
 Here we are to observe, 

 (1.) The manner of his coming, or ruling, and working: in general, that 
 it is after the example of Satan, the grand enemy of souls, the great 
 adversary of God and man. He is the great patron of error and lies, the 
 sworn enemy of the truth as it is in Jesus and all the faithful 
 followers of Jesus. More particularly, it is with Satanical power and 
 deceit. A divine power is pretended for the support of this kingdom, 
 but it is only after the working of Satan. Signs and wonders, visions
 and miracles, are pretended; by these the papal kingdom was first set 
 up, and has all along been kept up, but they have false signs to 
 support false doctrines; and lying wonders, or only pretended miracles 
 that have served their cause, things false in fact, or fraudulently 
 managed, to impose upon the people: and the diabolical deceits with 
 which the antichristian state has been supported are notorious. The 
 apostle calls it <I>all deceivableness of unrighteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Others may call them pious frauds, but the apostle called them 
 unrighteous and wicked frauds; and, indeed, all fraud (which is 
 contrary to truth) is an impious thing. Many are the subtle artifices 
 the man of sin has used, and various are the plausible pretences by 
 which he had beguiled unwary and unstable souls to embrace false 
 doctrines, and submit to his usurped dominion. 

 (2.) The persons are described who are his willing subjects, or most 
 likely to become such, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They are such as <I>love not the truth that they may be saved.</I> They 
 heard the truth (it may be), but they did not love it; they could not 
 bear sound doctrine, and therefore easily imbibed false doctrines; they 
 had some notional knowledge of what was true, but they indulged some 
 powerful prejudices, and so became a prey to seducers. Had they loved
 the truth, they would have persevered in it, and been preserved by it; 
 but no wonder if they easily parted with what they never had any love 
 to. And of these persons it is said that they perish or are lost; they
 are in a lost condition, and in danger to be lost for ever. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. We have the <I>sin and ruin of the subjects</I> of antichrist's 
 kingdom declared, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 (1.) Their sin is this: <I>They believed not the truth, but had 
 pleasure in unrighteousness:</I> they did not love the truth, and 
 therefore they did not believe it; and, because they did not believe 
 the truth, therefore they had pleasure in unrighteousness, or in wicked 
 actions, and were pleased with false notions. Note, An erroneous mind 
 and vicious life often go together and help forward one another. 

 (2.) Their ruin is thus expressed: <I>God shall send them strong 
 delusions, to believe a lie.</I> Thus he will punish men for their 
 unbelief, and for their dislike of the truth and love to sin and 
 wickedness; not that God is the author of sin, but in righteousness he 
 sometimes withdraws his grace from such sinners as are here mentioned; 
 he gives them over to Satan, or leaves them to be deluded by his 
 instruments; he gives them up to their own hearts' lusts, and leaves 
 them to themselves, and then sin will follow of course, yea, the worst 
 of wickedness, that shall end at last in eternal damnation. God is just 
 when he inflicts spiritual judgments here, and eternal punishments 
 hereafter, upon those who have no love to the truths of the gospel, who 
 will not believe them, nor live suitably to them, but indulge false 
 doctrines in their minds, and wicked practices in their lives and 
 conversations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you,
 brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning
 chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and
 belief of the truth:
 &nbsp; 14  Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of
 the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 &nbsp; 15  Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions
 which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here observe, 

 I. The consolation the Thessalonians might take against the terrors of 
 this apostasy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 For they were chosen to salvation, and called to the obtaining of 
 glory. Note, When we hear of the apostasy of many, it is matter of 
 great comfort and joy that there is a remnant according to the election 
 of grace which does and shall persevere; and especially we should 
 rejoice if we have reason to hope that we are of that number. The
 apostle reckoned himself bound in duty to be thankful to God on this 
 account: <I>We are bound to give thanks to God always for you.</I> He 
 had often given thanks on their behalf, and he is still abounding in 
 thanksgiving for them; and there was good reason, because they were 
 beloved by the Lord, as appeared in this matter--their security from 
 apostatizing. This preservation of the saints is owing,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To the stability of the election of grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Therefore were they beloved of the Lord, because God had chosen them 
 from the beginning. He had loved them with an everlasting love. 
 Concerning this election of God we may observe,

 (1.) The eternal date of it--it is from the beginning; not the 
 beginning of the gospel, but the beginning of the world, before the 
 foundation of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:4">Eph. i. 4</A>.
 
 Then,

 (2.) The end to which they were chosen--salvation, complete and eternal
 salvation from sin and misery, and the full fruition of all good. 

 (3.) The means in order to obtaining this end--<I>sanctification of the 
 spirit and belief of the truth.</I> The decree of election therefore 
 connects the end and the means, and these must not be separated. We are 
 not the elected of God because we were holy, but that we might be holy.
 Being chosen of God, we must not live as we list; but, if we are chosen 
 to salvation as the end, we must be prepared for it by sanctification 
 as the necessary means to obtain that end, which sanctification is by 
 the operation of the Holy Spirit as the author and by faith on our 
 part. There must be the belief of the truth, without which there can
 be by true sanctification, nor perseverance in grace, nor obtaining of 
 salvation. Faith and holiness must be joined together, as well as
 holiness and happiness; therefore our Saviour prayed for Peter that his 
 faith might not fail

 and for his disciples

 2. To the efficacy of the gospel call, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 As they were chosen to salvation, so they were called thereunto by the
 gospel. Whom he did predestinate those he also called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:30">Rom. viii. 30</A>.

 The outward call of God is by the gospel; and this is rendered 
 effectual by the inward operation of the Spirit. Note, Wherever the 
 gospel comes it calls and invites men to the obtaining of glory; it is 
 a call to honour and happiness, even the <I>glory of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ,</I> the glory he has purchased, and the glory he is possessed 
 of, to be communicated unto those who believe in him and obey his 
 gospel; such shall be with Christ, to behold his glory, and they shall 
 be glorified with Christ and partake of his glory. Hereupon there 
 follows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An exhortation to stedfastness and perseverance: <I>Therefore, 
 brethren, stand fast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Observe, He does not say, "You are chosen to salvation, and therefore 
 you may be careless and secure;" but <I>therefore stand fast.</I> God's 
 grace in our election and vocation is so far from superseding our 
 diligent care and endeavour that it should quicken and engage us to the 
 greatest resolution and diligence. So the apostle John having told
 those to whom he wrote that they had received the anointing which 
 should abide in them, and that they should abide in him (in Christ), 
 subjoins this exhortation, <I>Now abide in him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27,28">
 1 John ii. 27, 28</A>.

 The Thessalonians are exhorted to stedfastness in their Christian 
 profession, to <I>hold fast the traditions which they had been 
 taught,</I> or the doctrine of the gospel, which had been delivered by 
 the apostle, by word or epistle. As yet the canon of scripture was not 
 complete, and therefore some things were delivered by the apostles in 
 their preaching, under the guidance of the infallible Spirit, which 
 Christians were bound to observe as coming from God; other things were 
 afterwards by them committed to writing, as the apostle had written a 
 former epistle to these Thessalonians; and these epistles were written 
 as the writers were moved by the Holy Ghost. Note, There is no
 argument hence for regarding oral traditions in our days, now that the 
 canon of scripture is complete, as of equal authority with the sacred 
 writings. Such doctrines and duties as were taught by the inspired 
 apostles we must stedfastly adhere to; but we have no certain evidence 
 of any thing delivered by them more than what we find contained in the 
 holy scriptures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,
 which hath loved us, and hath given <I>us</I> everlasting consolation
 and good hope through grace,
 &nbsp; 17  Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and
 work.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words we have the apostle's earnest prayer for them, in which 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To whom he prays: <I>Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even 
 our Father.</I> We may and should direct our prayers, not only to God 
 the Father, through the mediation of our Lord Jesus Christ, but also 
 <I>to our Lord Jesus Christ himself;</I> and should pray in his name 
 unto God, not only as his Father but as our Father in and through 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. From what he takes encouragement in his prayer--from the
 consideration of what God had already done for him and them: <I>Who 
 hath loved us, and given us everlasting consolation and good hope 
 through grace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 1. The love of God is the spring and fountain of all the good we have 
 or hope for; our election, vocation, justification, and salvation, are 
 all owing to the love of God in Christ Jesus. 

 2. From this fountain in particular all our consolation flows. And the
 consolation of the saints is an everlasting consolation. The comforts 
 of the saints are not dying things; they shall not die with them. The 
 spiritual consolations God gives none shall deprive them of; and God 
 will not take them away: because he love them with an everlasting love, 
 therefore they shall have everlasting consolation. 

 3. Their consolation is founded on the hope of eternal life. They
 rejoice in hope of the glory of God, and are not only patient, but 
 joyful, in tribulations; and there is good reason for these strong 
 consolations, because the saints have good hope: their hope is grounded 
 on the love of God, the promise of God, and the experience they have 
 had of the power, the goodness, and the faithfulness of God, and it is 
 good hope through grace; the free grace and mercy of God are what they 
 hope for, and what their hopes are founded on, and not on any worth or 
 merit of their own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What it is that he asks of God for them--that <I>he would comfort
 their hearts, and establish them in every good word and work,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 God had given them consolations, and he prayed that they might have 
 more abundant consolation. There was good hope, through grace, that 
 they would be preserved, and he prayed that they might be established: 
 it is observable how comfort and establishment are here joined 
 together. Note therefore, 

 1. Comfort is a means of establishment; for the more pleasure we take
 in the word, and work, and ways of God, the more likely we shall be to 
 persevere therein. And, 

 2. Our establishment in the ways of God is a likely means in order to
 comfort; whereas, if we are wavering in faith, and of a doubtful mind, 
 or if we are halting and faltering in our duty, no wonder if we are 
 strangers to the pleasures and joys of religion. What is it that lies
 at the bottom of all our uneasiness, but our unsteadiness in religion? 
 We must be established in every good word and work, in the word of 
 truth and the work of righteousness: Christ must be honoured by our 
 good works and good words; and those who are sincere will endeavour to 
 do both, and in so doing they may hope for comfort and establishment, 
 till at length their holiness and happiness be completed.</P>
