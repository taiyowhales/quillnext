 Here the apostle, 
 
 I. Directs Timothy how to reprove, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Adverts to widows, both elder and younger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:3-16">ver. 3-16</A>.

 III. To elders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:17-19">ver. 17-19</A>.

 IV. Treats of public reproof,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:20">ver. 20</A>.
 
 V. Gives a solemn charge concerning ordination, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:21,22">ver. 21, 22</A>.

 VI. Refers to his health

 and states men's sins to be very different in their effects,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Rebuke not an elder, but intreat <I>him</I> as a father; <I>and</I> the
 younger men as brethren;
 &nbsp; 2  The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all
 purity.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle gives rules to Timothy, and in him to other ministers, 
 in reproving. Ministers are reprovers by office; it is a part, though 
 the least pleasing part, of their office; they are to preach the word, 
 to reprove and rebuke, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:2">2 Tim. iv. 2</A>.

 A great difference is to be made in our reproofs, according to the age,
 quality, and other circumstances, of the persons rebuked; thus, and
 elder in age or office must be entreated as a father; <I>on some have
 compassion, making a difference,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:22">Jude 22</A>.

 Now the rule is, 

 1. To be very tender in rebuking elders--elders in age, elders by
 office. Respect must be had to the dignity of their years and place, 
 and therefore they must not be rebuked sharply nor magisterially; but 
 Timothy himself, though an evangelist, must entreat them as fathers, 
 for this would be the likeliest way to work upon them, and to win upon 
 them. 

 2. The younger must be rebuked as brethren, with love and tenderness;
 not as desirous, to spy faults or pick quarrels, but as being willing 
 to make the best of them. There is need of a great deal of meekness in 
 reproving those who deserve reproof. 

 3. The elder women must be reproved, when there is occasion, as
 mothers. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:2">Hos. ii. 2</A>,

 <I>Plead with your mother, plead.</I> 

 4. The younger women must be reproved, but reproved as <I>sisters, with
 all purity.</I> If Timothy, so mortified a man to this world and to the 
 flesh and lusts of it, had need of such a caution as this, much more 
 have we.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  Honour widows that are widows indeed.
 &nbsp; 4  But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn
 first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for
 that is good and acceptable before God.
 &nbsp; 5  Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in
 God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
 &nbsp; 6  But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
 &nbsp; 7  And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
 &nbsp; 8  But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those
 of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an
 infidel.
 &nbsp; 9  Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore
 years old, having been the wife of one man,
 &nbsp; 10  Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up
 children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the
 saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have
 diligently followed every good work.
 &nbsp; 11  But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to
 wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;
 &nbsp; 12  Having damnation, because they have cast off their first
 faith.
 &nbsp; 13  And withal they learn <I>to be</I> idle, wandering about from
 house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and
 busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
 &nbsp; 14  I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear
 children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to
 speak reproachfully.
 &nbsp; 15  For some are already turned aside after Satan.
 &nbsp; 16  If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them
 relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may
 relieve them that are widows indeed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Directions are here given concerning the taking of widows into the 
 number of those who were employed by the church and had maintenance 
 from the church: <I>Honour widows that are widows indeed.</I> Honour 
 them, that is, maintain them, admit them into office. There was in 
 those times an office in the church in which widows were employed, and 
 that was to tend the sick and the aged, to look to them by the 
 direction of the deacons. We read of the care taken of widows 
 immediately upon the first forming of the Christian church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:1">Acts vi. 1</A>),
 
 where the Grecians thought their widows were neglected in the daily 
 ministration and provision made for poor widows. The general rule is to 
 <I>honour widows that are widows indeed,</I> to maintain them, to 
 relieve them with respect and tenderness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is appointed that those widows only should be relieved by the 
 charity of the church who were pious and devout, and not wanton widows 
 that <I>lived in pleasure,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 She is to be reckoned a widow indeed, and it to be maintained at the 
 church's charge, who, being <I>desolate, trusteth in God.</I> Observe, 
 It is the duty and comfort of those who are desolate to trust in God. 
 <I>Therefore</I> God sometimes brings his people into such straits that 
 they have nothing else to trust to, that they may with more confidence 
 trust in him. Widowhood is a desolate estate; but <I>let the widows
 trust in me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:11">Jer. xlix. 11</A>),

 and rejoice that they have a God to trust to. Again, Those who trust in 
 God must <I>continue in prayer.</I> If by faith we confide in God, by 
 prayer we must give glory to God and commit ourselves to his guidance. 
 Anna was a widow indeed, who <I>departed not from the temple</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:37">Luke ii. 37</A>),

 <I>but served God with fasting and prayer night and day.</I> But she is 
 not a widow indeed <I>that lives in pleasure</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 or who lives licentiously. A jovial widow is not a widow indeed, not 
 fit to be taken under the care of the church. <I>She that lives in
 pleasure is dead while she lives,</I> is no living member of the 
 church, but as a carcase in it, or a mortified member. We may apply it 
 more generally; those who live in pleasure are dead while they live, 
 spiritually dead, <I>dead in trespasses and sins;</I> they are in the 
 world to no purpose, buried alive as to the great ends of living.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Another rule he gives is that the church should not be charged with 
 the maintenance of those widows who had relations of their own that 
 were able to maintain them. This is mentioned several times 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 <I>If any widow have children or nephews,</I> that is grandchildren or 
 near relations, let them maintain them, and let not the church be
 burdened. So 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 This is called showing <I>piety at home</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 or showing piety towards their own families. Observe, The respect of 
 children to their parents, with their care of them, is fitly called 
 piety. This is requiting their parents. Children can never sufficiently 
 requite their parents for the care they have taken of them, and the
 pains they have taken with them; but they must endeavour to do it. It
 is the indispensable duty of children, if their parents be in
 necessity, and they in ability to relieve them, to do it to the utmost
 of their power, <I>for this is good and acceptable before God.</I> The
 Pharisees taught that a gift to the altar was more acceptable to God
 than relieving a poor parent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:5">Matt. xv. 5</A>.

 But here we are told that this <I>is better than all burnt-offerings 
 and sacrifices; this is good and acceptable,</I> &c. He speaks of this 
 again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>If any provide not for his own,</I> &c. If any men or women do not 
 maintain their own poor relations who belong to them, they do in effect 
 <I>deny the faith;</I> for the design of Christ was to confirm the law 
 of Moses, and particularly the law of the fifth commandment, which is, 
 <I>Honour thy father and mother;</I> so that those deny the faith who 
 disobey that law, much more if they provide not for their wives and 
 children, who are parts of themselves; if they spend that upon their 
 lusts which should maintain their families, they have denied the faith 
 <I>and are worse than infidels.</I> One reason why this care must be 
 taken that those who are rich should maintain their poor relations, and 
 not burden the church with them is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 <I>that it may relieve those who are widows indeed.</I> Observe, 
 Charity misplaced is a great hindrance to true charity; there should be 
 prudence in the choice of the objects of charity, that it may not be 
 thrown away upon those who are not properly so, that there may be the 
 more for those who are real objects of charity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives directions concerning the characters of the widows that 
 were to be taken into the number to receive the church's charity: not 
 under sixty years old, nor any who have divorced their husbands or been 
 divorced from them and have married again; she must have been <I>the 
 wife of one man,</I> such as had been a housekeeper, had a good name 
 for hospitality and charity, <I>well reported of for good works.</I> 
 Observe, Particular care ought to be taken to relieve those, when they 
 fall into decay, who, when they had wherewithal, were ready to every 
 good work. Here are instances of such good works as are proper to be 
 done by good wives: <I>If she have brought up children:</I> he does not
 say, If she have borne children (<I>children are a heritage of the 
 Lord</I>), that depends on the will of God; but, if she had not 
 children of her own, yet if she had brought up children. <I>If she have 
 lodged strangers,</I> and <I>washed the saints' feet;</I> if she have 
 been ready to give entertainment to good Christians and good ministers, 
 when they were in their travels for the spreading of the gospel. 
 Washing of the feet o their friends was a part of their entertainments. 
 <I>If she have relieved the afflicted</I> when she had ability, let her 
 be relieved now. Observe, Those who would find mercy when they are in
 distress must show mercy when they are in prosperity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He cautions them to take heed of admitting into the number those 
 who are likely to be no credit to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The younger widows refuse:</I> they will be weary of their 
 employments in the church, and of living by rule, as they must do; so 
 they <I>will marry, and cast off their first faith.</I> You read of a 
 first love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:4">Rev. ii. 4</A>),

 and here of a first faith, that is, the engagements they gave to the 
 church to behave well, and as became the trust reposed in them: it does 
 not appear that by their first faith is meant their vow not to marry, 
 for the scripture is very silent on that head; besides the apostle here 
 advises the younger widows to marry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 which he would not if hereby they must have broken their vows. Dr.
 Whitby well observes, "If this faith referred to a promise made to the 
 church not to marry, it could not be called their first faith." 
 <I>Withal they learn to be idle, and not only idle, but tattlers,</I> 
 &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Observe, It is seldom that those who are idle are idle only, they learn 
 <I>to be tattlers and busy-bodies,</I> and to make mischief among 
 neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. Those who had not attained 
 to such a gravity of mind as was fit for the deaconesses (or the widows 
 who were taken among the church's poor), let them <I>marry, bear 
 children,</I> &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Observe, If housekeepers do not mind their business, but are tattlers,
 they give occasion to the adversaries of Christianity to reproach the 
 Christian name, which, it seems, there were some instances of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 We learn hence,

 1. In the primitive church there was care taken of poor widows, and
 provision made for them; and the churches of Christ in these days 
 should follow so good an example, as far as they are able.

 2. In the distribution of the church's charity, or alms, great care is
 to be taken that those share in the public bounty who most want it and 
 best deserve it. A widow was not to be taken into the primitive church 
 that had relations who were able to maintain her, or who was not well 
 reported of for good works, but lived in pleasure: <I>But the younger 
 widows refuse, for, when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, 
 they will marry.</I> 

 3. The credit of religion, and the reputation of Christian churches,
 are very much concerned in the character and behaviour of those that 
 are taken into any employment in the church, though of a lower nature 
 (such as the business of deaconesses), or that receive alms of the 
 church; if they do not behave well, but are tatlers and busy-bodies, 
 they will give occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. 

 4. Christianity obliges its professors to relieve their indigent
 friends, particularly poor widows, that the church may not be charged 
 with them, that it may relieve those that are widows indeed: rich 
 people should be ashamed to burden the church with their poor 
 relations, when it is with difficulty that those are supplied who have 
 no children or nephews, that is, grand-children, who are in a capacity 
 to relieve them.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are directions,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning the supporting of ministers. Care must be taken that they 
 be honourably maintained 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour</I> 
 (that is, of double maintenance, double to what they have had, or to 
 what others have), <I>especially those who labour in the word and 
 doctrine,</I> those who are more laborious than others. Observe, The 
 presbytery ruled, and the same that ruled were those <I>who laboured in 
 the word and doctrine:</I> they had not one to preach to them and 
 another to rule them, but the work was done by one and the same person. 
 Some have imagined that by the <I>elders that rule well</I> the apostle 
 means lay-elders, who were employed in ruling but not in teaching, who 
 were concerned in church-government, but did not meddle with the 
 administration of the word and sacraments; and I confess this is the 
 plainest text of scripture that can be found to countenance such an 
 opinion. But it seem a little strange that mere ruling elders should be 
 accounted worthy of double honour, when the apostle preferred preaching 
 to baptizing, and much more would he prefer it to ruling the church; 
 and it is more strange that the apostle should take no notice of them 
 when he treats of church-officers; but, as it is hinted before, they 
 had not, in the primitive church, one to preach to them and another to 
 rule them, but ruling and teaching were performed by the same persons, 
 only some might labour more in the word and doctrine than others. Here 
 we have, 

 1. The work of ministers; it consists principally in two things: ruling 
 well and labouring in the word and doctrine. This was the main business 
 of elders or presbyters in the days of the apostles.

 2. The honour due to those who were not idle, but laborious in this
 work; they were worthy of double honour, esteem, and maintenance. He
 quotes a scripture to confirm this command concerning the maintenance
 of ministers that we might think foreign; but it intimates what a
 significancy there was in many of the laws of Moses, and particularly
 in this, <I>Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:4">Deut. xxv. 4</A>.

 The beasts that were employed in treading out the corn (for that way
 they took instead of threshing it) were allowed to feed while they did 
 the work, so that the more work they did the more food they had; 
 therefore let the elders that labour in the word and doctrine be well 
 provided for; <I>for the labourer is worthy of his reward</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:10">Matt. x. 10</A>),

 and there is all the reason in the world that he should have it. We
 hence learn, 

 (1.) God, both under the law, and now under the gospel, has taken care 
 that his ministers be well provided for. Does God take care for oxen, 
 and will he not take care of his own servants? The ox only treads out
 the corn of which they make the bread that perishes; but ministers 
 break the bread of life which endures for ever.

 (2.) The comfortable subsistence of ministers, as it is God's 
 appointment that those who preach the gospel should live of the gospel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:14">1 Cor. ix. 14</A>),

 so it is their just due, as much as the reward of the labourer; and 
 those who would have ministers starved, or not comfortably provided 
 for, God will require it of them another day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning the accusation of ministers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three 
 witnesses.</I> Here is the scripture-method of proceeding against an 
 elder, when accused of any crime. Observe, 

 1. There must be an accusation; it must not be a flying uncertain
 report, but an accusation, containing a certain charge, must be drawn 
 up. Further, He is not to be proceeded against by way of enquiry; this 
 is according to the modern practice of the inquisition, which draws up 
 articles for men to purge themselves of such crimes, or else to accuse 
 themselves; but, according to the advice of Paul, there must be an 
 accusation brought against an elder. 

 2. This accusation is not to be received unless supported by two or
 three credible witnesses; and the accusation must be received before 
 them, that is, the accused must have the accusers face to face, because 
 the reputation of a minister is, in a particular manner, a tender 
 thing; and therefore, before any thing be done in the least to blemish 
 that reputation, great care should be taken that the thing alleged 
 against him be well proved, that he be not reproached upon an uncertain 
 surmise; "but

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 <I>those that sin rebuke before all;</I> that is, thou needest not be 
 so tender of other people, but rebuke them publicly." Or "those that 
 sin before all rebuke before all, that the plaster may be as wide as 
 the wound, and that those who are in danger of sinning by the example 
 of their fall may take warning by the rebuke given them for it, <I>that 
 others also may fear.</I>" Observe, 

 (1.) Public scandalous sinners must be rebuked publicly: as their sin 
 has been public, and committed before many, or at least come to the 
 hearing of all, so their reproof must be public, and before all. 

 (2.) Public rebuke is designed for the good of others, that they may 
 fear, as well as for the good of the party rebuked; hence it was 
 ordered under the law that public offenders should receive public 
 punishment, that <I>all Israel</I> might <I>hear, and fear, and do no 
 more wickedly.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Concerning the ordination of ministers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Lay hands suddenly on no man;</I> it seems to be meant of the 
 ordaining of men to the office of the ministry, which ought not to be 
 done rashly and inconsiderately, and before due trial made of their 
 gifts and graces, their abilities and qualifications for it. Some 
 understand it of absolution: "Be not too hasty in laying hands on any; 
 remit not the censure of the church to any, till time be first taken 
 for the proof of their sincerity in their repentance, <I>neither be 
 partakers of other men's sins,</I> implying that those who are too easy 
 in remitting the censures of the church encourage others in the sins 
 which are thus connived at, and make themselves thereby guilty." 
 Observe, We have great need to watch over ourselves at all times, that 
 we do not make ourselves partakers of other men's sins. "Keep thyself 
 pure, not only from doing the like thyself, but from countenancing it, 
 or being any way accessary to it, in others." Here is, 

 1. A caution against the rash ordination of ministers, or absolution of 
 those who have been under church-censures: <I>Lay hands suddenly on no 
 man.</I>

 2. Those who are rash, either in the one case or the other, will make
 themselves partakers in other men's sins. 

 3. We must keep ourselves pure, if we will be pure; the grace of God
 makes and keeps us pure, but it is by our own endeavours.</P>

 IV. Concerning absolution, to which 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>,

 seem to refer: <I>Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to 
 judgment, and some follow after,</I> &c. Observe, Ministers have need 
 of a great deal of wisdom, to know how to accommodate themselves to the 
 variety of offences and offenders that they have occasion to deal with. 
 Some men's sins are so plain and obvious, and not found by secret 
 search, that there is no dispute concerning the bringing of them under 
 the censures of the church; they <I>go before to judgment,</I> to lead 
 them to censure.--<I>Others they follow after;</I> that is, their 
 wickedness does not presently appear, nor till after a due search has 
 been made concerning it. Or, as some understand it, some men's sins 
 continue after they are censured; they are not reformed by the censure, 
 and in that case there must be no absolution. So, also, as to the 
 evidences of repentance: <I>The good works of some are manifest 
 beforehand. And those that are otherwise,</I> whose good works do not 
 appear, their wickedness <I>cannot be hid,</I> and so it will be easy 
 to discern who are to be absolved, and who are not. Observe, 

 1. There are secret, and there are open sins; some men's sins are open
 beforehand, and going unto judgment, and some they follow after.

 2. Sinners must be differently dealt with by the church.

 3. The effects of church-censures are very different; some are thereby
 humbled and brought to repentance, so that their good works are 
 manifest beforehand, while it is quite otherwise with others. 

 4. The incorrigible cannot be hid; for God will bring to light the
 hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of all 
 hearts.</P>

 V. Concerning Timothy himself. 

 1. Here is a charge to him to be careful of his office; and a solemn
 charge it is: <I>I charge thee before God, as thou wilt answer it to 
 God before the holy and elect angels, observe these things without 
 partiality,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Observe, It ill becomes ministers to be partial, and to have respect of 
 persons, and to prefer one before another upon any secular account. He 
 charges him, by all that is dear, <I>before God, and the Lord Jesus 
 Christ, and the elect angels,</I> to guard against partiality. 
 Ministers must give an account to God and the Lord Jesus Christ, 
 whether, and how, they have observed all things given them in charge: 
 and woe to them if they have been partial in their ministrations, out 
 of an worldly politic view. 

 2. He charges him to take care of his health: <I>Drink no longer
 water,</I> &c. It seems Timothy was a mortified man to the pleasures of 
 sense; he drank water, and he was a man of no strong constitution of 
 body, and for this reason Paul advises him to use wine for the helping 
 of his stomach and the recruiting of his nature. Observe, It is a 
 little wine, for ministers must not be given to much wine; so much as 
 may be for the health of the body, not so as to distemper it, for God 
 has made wine to rejoice man's heart. Note,

 (1.) It is the will of God that people should take all due care of 
 their bodies. As we are not to make them our masters, so neither our 
 slaves; but to use them so that they may be most fit and helpful to us 
 in the service of God.

 (2.) Wine is most proper for sickly and weak people, whose stomachs are 
 often out of order, and who labour under infirmities. <I>Give strong 
 drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that are of 
 heavy hearts,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:6">Prov. xxxi. 6</A>.

 (3.) Wine should be used as a help, and not a hindrance, to our work
 and usefulness.</P>
