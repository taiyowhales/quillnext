 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
 Timotheus <I>our</I> brother,
 &nbsp; 2  To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at
 Colosse: Grace <I>be</I> unto you, and peace, from God our Father and
 the Lord Jesus Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The inscription of this epistle is much the same with the rest; only
 it is observable that,

 1. He calls himself an <I>apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of 
 God.</I> An apostle is a prime-minister in the kingdom of Christ, 
 immediately called by Christ, and extraordinarily qualified; his work 
 was peculiarly to plant the Christian church, and confirm the Christian 
 doctrine. He attributes this not to his own merit, strength, or 
 sufficiency; but to the free grace and good-will of God. He thought 
 himself engaged to do his utmost, as an apostle, because he was made so 
 by the will of God.

 2. He joins Timothy in commission with himself, which is another
 instance of his humility; and, though he elsewhere calls him his son 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:1">2 Tim. ii. 1</A>),

 yet here he calls him his brother, which is an example to the elder and 
 more eminent ministers to look upon the younger and more obscure as 
 their brethren, and to treat them accordingly with kindness and 
 respect.

 3. He calls the Christians at Colosse <I>saints, and faithful brethren
 in Christ.</I> As all good ministers, so all good Christians, are 
 brethren one to another, who stand in a near relation and owe a mutual 
 love. Towards God they must be saints, consecrated to his honour and
 sanctified by his grace, bearing his image and aiming at his glory. And 
 in both these, as saints to God and as brethren to one another, they 
 must be faithful. Faithfulness runs through every character and 
 relation of the Christian life, and is the crown and glory of them 
 all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostolical benediction is the same as usual: <I>Grace be unto 
 you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</I> He 
 wishes them <I>grace and peace,</I> the free favour of God and all the 
 blessed fruits of it; every kind of spiritual blessings, and that 
 <I>from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ;</I> jointly from 
 both, and distinctly from each; as in the former epistle.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus
 Christ, praying always for you,
 &nbsp; 4  Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
 <I>which ye have</I> to all the saints,
 &nbsp; 5  For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye
 heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;
 &nbsp; 6  Which is come unto you, as <I>it is</I> in all the world; and
 bringeth forth fruit, as <I>it doth</I> also in you, since the day ye
 heard <I>of it,</I> and knew the grace of God in truth:
 &nbsp; 7  As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is
 for you a faithful minister of Christ;
 &nbsp; 8  Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here he proceeds to the body of the epistle, and begins with 
 thanksgiving to God for what he had heard concerning them, though he 
 had no personal acquaintance with them, and knew their state and 
 character only by the reports of others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gave thanks to God for them, that they had embraced the gospel of 
 Christ, and given proofs of their fidelity to him. Observe, In his 
 prayers for them he gave thanks for them. Thanksgiving ought to be a 
 part of every prayer; and whatever is the matter of our rejoicing ought 
 to be the matter of our thanksgiving. Observe, 

 1. Whom he gives thanks to: <I>To God, even the Father of our Lord 
 Jesus Christ.</I> In our thanksgiving we must have an eye to God as God 
 (he is the object of thanksgiving as well as prayer), and is the Father 
 of our Lord Jesus Christ, in and through whom all good comes to us. He 
 is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ as well as our Father; and it is 
 a matter of encouragement, in all our addresses to God, that we can 
 look to him as Christ's Father and our Father, as his God and our God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17">John xx. 17</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 2. What he gives thanks to God for--for the graces of God in them, which
 were evidences of the grace of God towards them: <I>Since we heard of
 your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love you have to all the saints;
 for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian
 life, and proper matter of our prayer and thanksgiving. 

 (1.) He gives thanks for their faith in Christ Jesus, that they were 
 brought to believe in him, and take upon them the profession of his 
 religion, and venture their souls upon his undertaking. 

 (2.) For their love. Besides the general love which is due to all men,
 there is a particular love owing to the saints, or those who are of the 
 Christian <I>brotherhood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:17">1 Pet. ii. 17</A>.

 We must love all the saints, bear an extensive kindness and good-will
 to good men, notwithstanding smaller points of difference, and many 
 real weaknesses. Some understand it of their charity to the saints in 
 necessity, which is one branch and evidence of Christian love. 

 (3.) For their hope: <I>The hope which is laid up for you in 
 heaven,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 The happiness of heaven is called their hope, because it is the 
 <I>thing hoped for, looking for the blessed hope,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:13">Tit. ii. 13</A>.

 What is laid out upon believers in this world is much; but what is laid
 up for them in heaven is much more. And we have reason to give thanks 
 to God for the hope of heaven which good Christians have, or their 
 well-grounded expectation of the future glory. Their faith in Christ, 
 and love to the saints, had an eye to the <I>hope laid up for them in 
 heaven.</I> The more we fix our hopes on the recompence of reward in 
 the other world, the more free and liberal shall we be of our earthly 
 treasure upon all occasions of doing good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Having blessed God for these graces, he blesses God for the means 
 of grace which they enjoyed: <I>Wherein you heard before in the word of 
 the truth of the gospel.</I> They had heard in the word of the truth of 
 the gospel concerning this <I>hope laid up for them in heaven.</I> 
 Observe, 

 1. The gospel is the word of truth, and what we may safely venture our 
 immortal souls upon: it proceeds from the God of truth and the Spirit 
 of truth, and is a faithful saying. He calls it <I>the grace of God in 
 truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 2. It is a great mercy to hear this word of truth; for the great thing 
 we learn from it is the happiness of heaven. Eternal life is brought
 to light by the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:10">2 Tim. i. 10</A>.

 They heard of the hope laid up in heaven in the word of the truth of 
 the gospel. "<I>Which has come unto you, as it hath to all the world,
 and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 This gospel is preached and brings forth fruit in other nations; it has
 come to you, <I>as it hath to all the world,</I> according to the 
 commission, <I>Go preach the gospel in all the nations,</I> and to 
 <I>every creature.</I>" Observe, 

 (1.) All who hear the word of the gospel ought to bring forth the fruit 
 of the gospel, that is, be obedient to it, and have their principles 
 and lives formed according to it. This was the doctrine first preached:
 <I>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:8">Matt. iii. 8</A>.

 And our Lord says, <I>If you know these things, happy are you if you do 
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:17">John xiii. 17</A>.

 Observe,

 (2.) Wherever the gospel comes, it will bring forth fruit to the honour
 and glory of God: <I>It bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in 
 you.</I> We mistake, if we think to monopolize the comforts and 
 benefits of the gospel to ourselves. Does the gospel bring forth fruit 
 in us? So it does in others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He takes this occasion to mention the minister by whom they 
 believed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):

 <I>As you also learned of Epaphras, our dear fellow-servant, who is for 
 you a faithful minister of Christ.</I> He mentions him with great 
 respect, to engage their love to him.

 1. He calls him his fellow-servant, to signify not only that they 
 served the same Master, but that they were engaged in the same work. 
 They were fellow-labourers in the work of the Lord, though one was an 
 apostle and the other an ordinary minister. 

 2. He calls him his dear fellow-servant: all the servants of Christ 
 ought to love one another, and it is an endearing consideration that 
 they are engaged in the same service. 

 3. He represents him as one who was a faithful minister of Christ to
 them, who discharged his trust and fulfilled his ministry among them. 
 Observe, Christ is our proper Master, and we are his ministers. He does 
 not say who is your minister; but <I>who is the minister of Christ for 
 you.</I> It is by his authority and appointment, though for the 
 people's service. 

 4. He represents him as one who gave them a good word: <I>Who also 
 declared unto us your love in the Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He recommends him to their affection, from the good report he made of 
 their sincere love to Christ and all his members, which was wrought in 
 them by the Spirit, and is agreeable to the spirit of the gospel.
 Faithful ministers are glad to be able to speak well of their 
 people.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  For this cause we also, since the day we heard <I>it,</I> do not
 cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with
 the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
 understanding;
 &nbsp; 10  That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing,
 being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the
 knowledge of God;
 &nbsp; 11  Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious
 power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle proceeds in these verses to pray for them. He heard that 
 they were good, and he prayed that they might be better. He was 
 constant in this prayer: <I>We do not cease to pray for you.</I> It may 
 be he could hear of them but seldom, but he constantly prayed for 
 them.--<I>And desire that you may be filled with the knowledge,</I> &c.
 Observe what it is that he begs of God for them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That they might be knowing intelligent Christians: <I>filled with 
 the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual 
 understanding.</I> Observe, 

 1. The knowledge of our duty is the best knowledge. A mere empty notion 
 of the greatest truths is insignificant. Our knowledge of the will of
 God must be always practical: we must know it, in order to do it. 

 2. Our knowledge is then a blessing indeed when it is in wisdom, when
 we know how to apply our general knowledge to our particular occasions, 
 and to suit it to all emergencies. 

 3. Christians should endeavour to be filled with knowledge; not only to
 know the will of God, but to know more of it, and to <I>increase in the 
 knowledge of God</I> (as it is 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and to <I>grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and 
 Saviour,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:18">2 Pet. iii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That their conversation might be good. Good knowledge without a 
 good life will not profit. Our understanding is then a spiritual 
 understanding when we exemplify it in our way of living: <I>That you 
 may walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 that is, as becomes the relation we stand in to him and the profession 
 we make of him. The agreeableness of our conversation to our religion 
 is pleasing to God as well as to good men. We walk unto all 
 well-pleasing when we walk in all things according to the will of God. 
 <I>Being fruitful in every good work.</I> This is what we should aim 
 at. Good words will not do without good works. We must abound in good 
 works, and in every good work: not in some only, which are more easy, 
 and suitable, and safe, but in all, and every instance of them. There 
 must be a regular uniform regard to all the will of God. And the more 
 fruitful we are in good works the more we shall <I>increase in the 
 knowledge of God. He who doeth his will shall know of the doctrine 
 whether it be of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That they might be strengthened: <I>Strengthened with all might 
 according to his glorious power</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 fortified against the temptations of Satan and furnished for all their 
 duty. It is a great comfort to us that he who undertakes to give 
 strength to his people is a God of power and of glorious power. Where 
 there is spiritual life there is still need of spiritual strength, 
 strength for all the actions of the spiritual life. To be strengthened 
 is to be furnished by the grace of God for every good work, and 
 fortified by that grace against every evil one: it is to be enabled to 
 do our duty, and still to hold fast our integrity. The blessed Spirit 
 is the author of this strength; for we are <I>strengthened with might 
 by his Spirit in the inward man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:16">Eph. iii. 16</A>.

 The word of God is the means of it, by which he conveys it; and it must
 be fetched in by prayer. It was in answer to earnest prayer that the 
 apostle obtained sufficient grace. In praying for spiritual strength we 
 are not straitened in the promises, and therefore should not be 
 straitened in our own hopes and desires. Observe,

 1. He prayed that they might be strengthened with might: this seems a 
 tautology; but he means, that they might be mightily strengthened, or 
 strengthened with might derived from another. 

 2. It is with all might. It seems unreasonable that a creature should
 be strengthened with all might, for that is to make him 
 <I>almighty;</I> but he means, with all that might which we have 
 occasion for, to enable us to discharge our duty or preserve our 
 innocence, that grace which is sufficient for us in all the trials of 
 life and able to help us in time of need. 

 3. It is <I>according to his glorious power.</I> He means, according to
 the grace of God: but the grace of God in the hearts of believers is
 the power of God; and there is a glory in this power; it is an
 excellent and sufficient power. And the communications of strength are
 not according to our weakness, to whom the strength is communicated,
 but according to his power, from whom it is received. When God gives
 he gives like himself, and when he strengthens he strengthens like
 himself. 

 4. The special use of this strength was for suffering work: <I>That you 
 may be strengthened unto all patience and long-suffering with 
 joyfulness.</I> He prays not only that they may be <I>supported</I> 
 under their troubles, but <I>strengthened</I> for them: the reason is 
 there is work to be done even when we are suffering. And those who are 
 strengthened <I>according to his glorious power</I> are strengthened, 
 
 (1.) To all patience. When patience <I>hath its perfect work</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:4">Jam. i. 4</A>)

 then we are strengthened to all patience--when we not only bear our 
 troubles patiently, but receive them as gifts from God, and are 
 thankful for them. To you <I>it is given to suffer,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:29">Phil. i. 29</A>.

 When we bear our troubles well, though ever so many, and the 
 circumstances of them ever so aggravating, then we bear them with all 
 patience. And the same reason for bearing one trouble will hold for 
 bearing another, if it be a good reason. All patience includes all the 
 kinds of it; not only bearing patience, but waiting patience. 

 (2.) This is even unto long-suffering, that is, drawn out to a great 
 length: not only to bear trouble awhile, but to bear it as long as God 
 pleases to continue it.

 (3.) It is with joyfulness, to rejoice in tribulation, to take joyfully 
 the spoiling of our goods, and rejoice that we are counted worthy to 
 suffer for his name, to have joy as well as patience in the troubles of 
 life. This we could never do by any strength of our own, but as we are 
 strengthened by the grace of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
 partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
 &nbsp; 13  Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
 translated <I>us</I> into the kingdom of his dear Son:
 &nbsp; 14  In whom we have redemption through his blood, <I>even</I> the
 forgiveness of sins:
 &nbsp; 15  Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of
 every creature:
 &nbsp; 16  For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and
 that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether <I>they be</I>
 thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things
 were created by him, and for him:
 &nbsp; 17  And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
 &nbsp; 18  And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the
 beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all <I>things</I> he
 might have the preeminence.
 &nbsp; 19  For it pleased <I>the Father</I> that in him should all fulness
 dwell;
 &nbsp; 20  And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by
 him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, <I>I say,</I>
 whether <I>they be</I> things in earth, or things in heaven.
 &nbsp; 21  And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in <I>your</I>
 mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
 &nbsp; 22  In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy
 and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:
 &nbsp; 23  If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and <I>be</I>
 not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard,
 <I>and</I> which was preached to every creature which is under heaven;
 whereof I Paul am made a minister;
 &nbsp; 24  Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that
 which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his
 body's sake, which is the church:
 &nbsp; 25  Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation
 of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;
 &nbsp; 26  <I>Even</I> the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from
 generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:
 &nbsp; 27  To whom God would make known what <I>is</I> the riches of the
 glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you,
 the hope of glory:
 &nbsp; 28  Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in
 all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ
 Jesus:
 &nbsp; 29  Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working,
 which worketh in me mightily.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a summary of the doctrine of the gospel concerning the great 
 work of our redemption by Christ. It comes in here not as the matter of 
 a sermon, but as the matter of a thanksgiving; for our salvation by 
 Christ furnishes us with abundant matter of thanksgiving in every view 
 of it: <I>Giving thanks unto the Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He does not discourse of the work of redemption in the natural order of 
 it; for then he would speak of the purchase of it first, and afterwards 
 of the application of it. But here he inverts the order, because, in 
 our sense and feeling of it, the application goes before the purchase. 
 We first find the benefits of redemption in our hearts, and then are 
 led by those streams to the original and fountain-head. The order and 
 connection of the apostle's discourse may be considered in the 
 following manner:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He speaks concerning the operations of the Spirit of grace upon us.
 We must give thanks for them, because by these we are qualified for an
 interest in the mediation of the Son: <I>Giving thanks to the
 Father,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 It is spoken of as the work of the Father, because the Spirit of grace
 is the Spirit of the Father, and the Father works in us by his Spirit. 
 Those in whom the work of grace is wrought must give thanks unto the 
 Father. If we have the comfort of it, he must have the glory of it. Now 
 what is it which is wrought for us in the application of redemption?

 1. "He hath <I>delivered us from the power of darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He has rescued us from the state of heathenish darkness and wickedness. 
 He hath saved us from the dominion of sin, which is darkness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:6">1 John i. 6</A>),
 
 from the dominion of Satan, who is the <I>prince of darkness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:12">Eph. vi. 12</A>),

 and from the damnation of hell, which is <I>utter darkness,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:30">Matt. xxv. 30</A>.
 
 They are <I>called out of darkness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:9">1 Pet. ii. 9</A>.

 2. "He hath <I>translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son,</I> 
 brought us into the gospel-state, and made us members of the church of 
 Christ, which is a state of light and purity." <I>You were once 
 darkness, but now are you light in the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:8">Eph. v. 8</A>.

 <I>Who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:9">1 Pet. ii. 9</A>.

 Those were made willing subjects of Christ who were the slaves of
 Satan. The conversion of a sinner is the translation of a soul into the 
 kingdom of Christ out of the kingdom of the devil. The power of sin is
 shaken off, and the power of Christ submitted to. The law of the
 Spirit of life in Christ Jesus makes them free from the law of sin and 
 death; and it is the kingdom of his dear Son, or the Son of his 
 peculiar love, his beloved Son

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:17">Matt. iii. 17</A>),
 
 and eminently the beloved,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:6">Eph. i. 6</A>.

 3. "He hath not only done this, but hath <I>made us meet to partake of
 the inheritance of the saints in light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He hath prepared us for the eternal happiness of heaven, as the 
 Israelites divided the promised land by lot; and has given us the 
 earnest and assurance of it." This he mentions first because it is the 
 first indication of the future blessedness, that by the grace of God we 
 find ourselves in some measure prepared for it. God gives <I>grace and 
 glory,</I> and we are here told what they both are.

 (1.) What that glory is. It is the <I>inheritance of the saints in 
 light.</I> It is an inheritance, and belongs to them as children, which 
 is the best security and the sweetest tenure: <I>If children, then 
 heirs,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:17">Rom. viii. 17</A>.

 And it is an inheritance of the saints-proper to sanctified souls.
 Those who are not saints on earth will never be saints in heaven. And 
 it is an inheritance in light; the perfection of knowledge, holiness, 
 and joy, by communion with God, who is light, and the Father of lights,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:17,Joh+1:5">Jam. i. 17; John i. 5</A>.

 (2.) What this grace is. It is a meetness for the inheritance: "<I>He
 hath made us meet to be partakers,</I> that is, suited and fitted us 
 for the heavenly state by a proper temper and habit of soul; and he 
 makes us meet by the powerful influence of his Spirit." It is the 
 effect of the divine power to change the heart, and make it heavenly. 
 Observe, All who are designed for heaven hereafter are prepared for 
 heaven now. As those who live and die unsanctified go out of the world 
 with their hell about them, so those who are sanctified and renewed go 
 out of the world with their heaven about them. Those who have the 
 inheritance of sons have the education of sons and the disposition of 
 sons: they <I>have the Spirit of adoption, whereby they cry, Abba, 
 Father.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:15">Rom. viii. 15</A>.

 <I>And, because you are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son 
 into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:6">Gal. iv. 6</A>.

 This meetness for heaven is the earnest of the Spirit in our heart, 
 which is part of payment, and assures the full payment. Those who are 
 sanctified shall be glorified

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:30">Rom. viii. 30</A>),

 and will be for ever indebted to the grace of God, which hath 
 sanctified them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning the person of the Redeemer. Glorious things are here 
 said of him; for blessed Paul was full of Christ, and took all 
 occasions to speak honourably of him. He speaks of him distinctly as 
 God, and as Mediator. 

 1. As God he speaks of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.

 (1.) He is the <I>image of the invisible God.</I> Not as man was made 
 <I>in the image of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:27">Gen. i. 27</A>),

 in his natural faculties and dominion over the creatures: no, he is the 
 <I>express image of his person,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:3">Heb. i. 3</A>.

 He is so the image of God as the son is the image of his father, who 
 has a natural likeness to him; so that he who has seen him has <I>seen 
 the Father,</I> and his <I>glory was the glory of the only-begotten of 
 the Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14,14:9">John i. 14; xiv. 9</A>.

 (2.) He is the <I>first-born of every creature.</I> Not that he is
 himself a creature; for it is <B><I>prototokos pases 
 ktiseos</I></B>--<I>born</I> or <I>begotten before all the 
 creation,</I> or before any creature was made, which is the 
 scripture-way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of 
 God is represented to us: <I>I was set up from everlasting, from the 
 beginning, or ever the earth was; when there was no depth, before the 
 mountains were settled, while as yet he had not made the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:23-26">Prov. viii. 23-26</A>.

 It signifies his dominion over all things, as the first-born in a 
 family is heir and lord of all, so he is the <I>heir of all things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:2">Heb. i. 2</A>.

 The word, with only the change of the accent, <B><I>prototokos,</I></B>
 signifies actively the first begetter or producer of all things, and so 
 it well agrees with the following clause. <I>Vid. Isidor. Peleus. 
 epist.</I> 30 <I>lib.</I> 3.

 (3.) He is so far from beginning himself a creature that he is the
 Creator: <I>For by him were all things created, which are in heaven and 
 earth, visible and invisible,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He made all things out of nothing, the highest angel in heaven, as well 
 as men upon earth. He made the world, the upper and lower world, with 
 all the inhabitants of both. <I>All things were made by him, and
 without him was not any thing made which was made,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:3">John i. 3</A>.

 He speaks here as if there were several orders of angels: <I>Whether
 thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers,</I> which must
 signify either different degrees of excellence or different offices and
 employments. <I>Angels, authorities, and powers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:22">1 Pet. iii. 22</A>.

 Christ is the eternal wisdom of the Father, and the world was made in
 wisdom. He is the eternal Word, and the world was made by the word of
 God. He is the <I>arm of the Lord,</I> and the world was made by that 
 arm. <I>All things are created by him and for him;</I> <B><I>di autou
 kai eis auton.</I></B> Being created by him, they were created for him; 
 being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure and 
 for his praise. He is the end, as well as the cause of all things.
 <I>To him are all things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:36">Rom. xi. 36</A>;

 <B><I>eis auton ta panta.</I></B> 

 (4.) He <I>was before all things.</I> He had a being before the world 
 was made, before the beginning of time, and therefore from all 
 eternity. Wisdom was with the Father, and possessed by him in the 
 beginning of his ways, before his works of old, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:22">Prov. viii. 22</A>.

 And in the beginning the Word was with God and was God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1">John i. 1</A>.

 He not only had a being before he was born of the virgin, but he had a 
 being before all time.

 (5.) <I>By him all things consist.</I> They not only subsist in their
 beings, but consist in their order and dependences. He not only created 
 them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are 
 still upheld, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:3">Heb. i. 3</A>.

 The whole creation is kept together by the power of the Son of God, and
 made to consist in its proper frame. It is preserved from disbanding
 and running into confusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The apostle next shows what he is as Mediator, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 (1.) He is the <I>head of the body the church:</I> not only a head of 
 government and direction, as the king is the head of the state and has 
 right to prescribe laws, but a head of vital influence, as the head in 
 the natural body: for all grace and strength are derived from him: and
 the church is his body, <I>the fulness of him who filleth all in 
 all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:22,23">Eph. i. 22, 23</A>.

 (2.) He is the <I>beginning, the first-born from the dead,</I>
 <B><I>arche, prototokos</I></B>--the principle, the first-born from the
 dead; the principle of our resurrection, as well as the first-born 
 himself. All our hopes and joys take their rise from him who is the 
 author of our salvation. Not that he was the first who ever rose from 
 the dead, but the first and only one who rose by his own power, and was 
 <I>declared to be the Son of God, and Lord of all things.</I> And he is 
 the head of the resurrection, and has given us an example and evidence 
 of our resurrection from the dead. He rose as the first-fruits,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:20">1 Cor. xv. 20</A>.

 (3.) He hath in <I>all things the pre-eminence.</I> It was the will of
 the Father that he should have <I>all power in heaven and earth,</I> 
 that he might be preferred above angels and all the powers in heaven 
 (he has <I>obtained a more excellent name than they,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:4">Heb. i. 4</A>),

 and that in all the affairs of the kingdom of God among men he should
 have the pre-eminence. He has the pre-eminence in the hearts of his
 people above the world and the flesh; and by giving him the 
 pre-eminence we comply with the Father's will, That <I>all men should 
 honour the Son even as they honour the Father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:23">John v. 23</A>.

 (4.) All fulness dwells in him, and it pleased the Father it should do
 so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 not only a fulness of abundance for himself, but redundance for us, a 
 fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace. As the head 
 is the seat and source of the animal spirits, so is Christ of all 
 graces to his people. <I>It pleased the Father</I> that all fulness 
 should dwell in him; and we may have free resort to him for all that 
 grace for which we have occasion. He not only intercedes for it, but is 
 the trustee in whose hands it is lodged to dispense to us: <I>Of his 
 fulness we receive, and grace for grace,</I> grace in us answering to 
 that grace which is in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16">John i. 16</A>),
 
 and <I>he fills all in all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:23">Eph. i. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Concerning the work of redemption. He speaks of the nature of it, 
 or wherein it consists; and of the means of it, by which it was 
 procured.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Wherein it consists. It is made to lie in two things:--

 (1.) In the remission of sin: <I>In whom we have redemption, even the
 forgiveness of sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It was sin which sold us, sin which enslaved us: if we are redeemed, we 
 must be redeemed from sin; and this is by forgiveness, or remitting the 
 obligation to punishment. So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:7">Eph. i. 7</A>,

 <I>In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins, according to 
 the riches of his grace.</I>

 (2.) In reconciliation to God. God by him <I>reconciled all things to
 himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He is the Mediator of reconciliation, who procures peace as well as 
 pardon for sinners, who brings them into a state of friendship and 
 favour at present, and will bring all holy creatures, angels as well as 
 men, into one glorious and blessed society at last: <I>things in earth, 
 or things in heaven.</I> So

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:10">Eph. i. 10</A>,

 <I>He will gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are 
 in heaven and which are on earth.</I> The word is 
 <B><I>anakephalaiosasthai</I></B>--<I>he will bring them all under one
 head.</I> The Gentiles, who were alienated, and <I>enemies in their 
 minds by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Here see what was their condition by nature, and in their Gentile 
 state--estranged from God, and at enmity with God: and yet this 
 <I>enmity is slain,</I> and, notwithstanding this distance, we are now 
 reconciled. Christ has laid the foundation for our reconciliation; for 
 he has paid the price of it, has purchased the proffer and promise of 
 it, proclaims it as a prophet, applies it as a king. Observe, The 
 greatest enemies to God, who have stood at the greatest distance and 
 bidden him defiance, may be reconciled, if it by not their own 
 fault.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How the redemption is procured: <I>it is through his blood</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);
 
 he has <I>made peace through the blood of his cross</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),
 
 and it is <I>in the body of his flesh through death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 It was the <I>blood which made an atonement, for the blood is the life; 
 and without the shedding of blood there is no remission,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:22">Heb. ix. 22</A>.
 
 There was such a value in the blood of Christ that, on account of 
 Christ's shedding it, God was willing to deal with men upon new terms 
 to bring them under a covenant of grace, and <I>for his sake,</I> and 
 in consideration of his death upon the cross, to pardon and accept to 
 favour all who comply with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Concerning the preaching of this redemption. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To whom it was preached: <I>To every creature under heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 that is, it was ordered to be preached to every creature,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:15">Mark xvi. 15</A>.

 It may be preached to every creature; for the gospel excludes none who
 do not exclude themselves. More or less it has been or will be preached 
 to every nation, though many have sinned away the light of it and 
 perhaps some have never yet enjoyed it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By whom it was preached: <I>Whereof I Paul am made a minister.</I> 
 Paul was a great apostle; but he looks upon it as the highest of his 
 titles of honour to be a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Paul 
 takes all occasions to speak of his office; for he <I>magnified his
 office,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:13">Rom. xi. 13</A>.
 
 And again in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>,

 <I>Whereof I am made a minister.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Whence Paul had his ministry: it was <I>according to the 
 dispensation of God which was given to him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 the economy or wise disposition of things in the house of God. He was 
 steward and master-builder, and this was given to him: he did not usurp 
 it, nor take it to himself; and he could not challenge it as a debt. He 
 received it from God as a gift, and took it as a favour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) For whose sake he had his ministry: "<I>It is for you,</I> for 
 your benefit: <I>ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:5">2 Cor. iv. 5</A>.

 We are Christ's ministers for the good of his people, to <I>fulfil the 
 word of God</I> (that is, fully to preach it), of which you will have 
 the greater advantage. The more we fulfil our ministry, or fill up all 
 the parts of it, the greater will be the benefit of the people; they 
 will be the more filled with knowledge, and furnished for service."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What kind of preacher Paul was. This is particularly 
 represented.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He was a suffering preacher: <I>Who now rejoice in my sufferings 
 for you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He suffered in the cause of Christ, and for the good of the church. He 
 suffered for preaching the gospel to them. And, while he suffered in so 
 good a cause, he could rejoice in his sufferings, <I>rejoice that he 
 was counted worthy to suffer,</I> and esteem it an honour to him. 
 <I>And fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my 
 flesh.</I> Not that the afflictions of Paul, or any other, were 
 expiations for sin, as the sufferings of Christ were. There was nothing 
 wanting in them, nothing which needed to <I>be filled up.</I> They were 
 perfectly sufficient to answer the intention of them, the satisfaction 
 of God's justice, in order to the salvation of his people. But the 
 sufferings of Paul and other good ministers made them conformable to 
 Christ; and they followed him in his suffering state: so they are said 
 to fill up what was behind of the sufferings of Christ, as the wax 
 fills up the vacuities of the seal, when it receives the impression of 
 it. Or it may be meant not of Christ's sufferings, but of his suffering 
 for Christ. He <I>filled that which was behind.</I> He had a certain 
 rate and measure of suffering for Christ assigned him; and, as his 
 sufferings were agreeable to that appointment, so he was still filling 
 up more and more what was behind, or remained of them to his share.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He was a close preacher: he preached not only in public, but 
 <I>from house to house,</I> from person to person. <I>Whom we preach, 
 warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.
 
 Every man has need to be warned and taught, and therefore let every man 
 have his share. Observe, <I>First,</I> When we warn people of what they 
 do amiss, we must teach them to do better: warning and teaching must go 
 together. <I>Secondly,</I> Men must be warned and taught in all wisdom. 
 We must choose the fittest seasons, and use the likeliest means, and 
 accommodate ourselves to the different circumstances and capacities of 
 those we have to do with, and teach them as they are able to bear. That 
 which he aimed at was to <I>present every man perfect in Christ 
 Jesus,</I> <B><I>teleios,</I></B> either perfect in the knowledge of
 the Christian doctrine (<I>Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be
 thus minded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:15,2Ti+3:17">Phil. iii. 15; 2 Tim. iii. 17</A>),

 or else crowned with a glorious reward hereafter, when he will
 <I>present to himself a glorious church</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:27">Eph. v. 27</A>),

 and bring them to the <I>spirits of just men made perfect,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:23">Heb. xii. 23</A>.

 Observe, Ministers ought to aim at the improvement and salvation of
 every particular person who hears them. <I>Thirdly,</I> He was a 
 laborious preacher, and one who took pains: he was no loiter, and did 
 not do his work negligently 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which 
 worketh in me mightily.</I> He laboured and strove, used great 
 diligence and contended with many difficulties, according to the 
 measure of grace afforded to him and the extraordinary presence of 
 Christ which was with him. Observe, As Paul laid out himself to do much 
 good, so he had this favour, that the power of God wrought in him the 
 more effectually. The more we labour in the work of the Lord the 
 greater measures of help we may expect from him in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:7">Eph. iii. 7</A>):
 
 <I>According to the gift of the grace of God given unto me, by the 
 effectual working of his power.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The gospel which was preached. We have an account of this: <I>Even 
 the mystery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, but is 
 now made manifest to his saints,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) The mystery of the gospel was long hidden: it was concealed from 
 ages and generations, the several ages of the church under the 
 Old-Testament dispensation. They were in a state of minority, and 
 training up for a more perfect state of things, and could not look to 
 the end of those things which were ordained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13">2 Cor. iii. 13</A>.

 (2.) This mystery now, in the fulness of time, is made manifest to the 
 saints, or clearly revealed and made apparent. The veil which was over 
 Moses's face is done away in Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:14">2 Cor. iii. 14</A>.

 The meanest saint under the gospel understands more than the greatest 
 prophets under the law. He who is least in the kingdom of heaven is 
 greater than they. The <I>mystery of Christ, which in other ages was 
 not made known unto the sons of men, is now revealed unto his holy 
 apostles and prophets by the Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:4,5">Eph. iii. 4, 5</A>.

 And what is this mystery? It is the riches of God's glory among the
 Gentiles. The peculiar doctrine of the gospel was a mystery which was
 before hidden, and is now made manifest and made known. But the great
 mystery here referred to is the breaking down of the partition-wall
 between the Jew and Gentile, and preaching the gospel to the Gentile
 world, and making those partakers of the privileges of the gospel state
 who before lay in ignorance and idolatry: <I>That the Gentiles should
 be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers together of his
 promise in Christ by the gospel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:6">Eph. iii. 6</A>.

 This mystery, thus made known, <I>is Christ in you</I> (or among you)
 <I>the hope of glory.</I> Observe, Christ is the hope of glory. The
 ground of our hope is Christ in the word, or the gospel revelation, 
 declaring the nature and methods of obtaining it. The evidence of our 
 hope is Christ in the heart, or the sanctification of the soul, and its 
 preparation for the heavenly glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The duty of those who are interested in this redemption: <I>If you 
 continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and be not moved away from 
 the hope of the gospel which you have heard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 We must continue in the faith grounded and settled, and not be moved 
 away from the hope of the gospel; that is, we must be so well fixed in 
 our minds as not to be moved from it by any temptations. We must be 
 stedfast and immovable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:58">1 Cor. xv. 58</A>)

 and <I>hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:23">Heb. x. 23</A>.

 Observe, We can expect the happy end of our faith only when we continue
 in the faith, and are so far grounded and settled in it as not to be
 moved from it. We must not <I>draw back unto perdition,</I> but
 <I>believe unto the saving of the soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:39">Heb. x. 39</A>.

 We must be faithful to death, through all trials, that we may receive
 the <I>crown of life, and receive the end of our faith, the salvation
 of our souls,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:9">1 Pet. i. 9</A>.</P>
