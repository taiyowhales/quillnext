 In this chapter we have the story, 

 I. Of the martyrdom of James the apostle, and the imprisonment of Peter
 by Herod Agrippa, who now reigned as king in Judea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. The miraculous deliverance of Peter out of prison by the ministry
 of an angel, in answer to the prayers of the church for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:6-19">ver. 6-19</A>.

 III. The cutting off of Herod in the height of his pride by the stroke
 of an angel, the minister of God's justice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:20-23">ver. 20-23</A>);

 and this was done while Barnabas and Saul were at Jerusalem, upon the
 errand that the church of Antioch sent them on, to carry their charity;
 and therefore in the close we have an account of their return to 
 Antioch,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth <I>his</I>
 hands to vex certain of the church.
 &nbsp; 2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
 &nbsp; 3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further
 to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
 &nbsp; 4 And when he had apprehended him, he put <I>him</I> in prison, and
 delivered <I>him</I> to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him;
 intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Ever since the conversion of Paul, we have heard no more of the agency 
 of the priests in persecuting the saints at Jerusalem; perhaps that 
 wonderful change wrought upon him, and the disappointment it gave to 
 their design upon the Christians at Damascus, had somewhat mollified 
 them, and brought them under the check of Gamaliel's advice--to <I>let
 those men alone,</I> and see what would be the issue; but here the 
 storm arises from another point. The civil power, not now, as usual 
 (for aught that appears) stirred up by the ecclesiastics, acts by 
 itself in the persecution. But Herod, though originally of an Edomite 
 family, yet seems to have been a proselyte to the Jewish religion; for 
 Josephus says he was zealous for the Mosaic rites, a bigot for the 
 ceremonies. He was not only (as Herod Antipas was) tetrarch of Galilee, 
 but had also the government of Judea committed to him by Claudius the 
 emperor, and resided most at Jerusalem, where he was at this time. 
 Three things we are here told he did--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He <I>stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 His stretching forth his hands to it intimates that his hands had been 
 tied up by the restraints which perhaps his own conscience held him 
 under in this matter; but now he broke through them, and stretched 
 forth his hands deliberately, and of malice prepense. <I>Herod laid 
 hands upon some of the church to afflict them,</I> so some read it; he 
 employed his officers to seize them, and take them into custody, in 
 order to their being prosecuted. See how he advances gradually. 

 1. He began with some of the members of the church, certain of them
 that were of less note and figure; played first at small game, but 
 afterwards flew at the apostles themselves. His spite was at the 
 church, and, with regard to those he gave trouble to, it was not upon 
 any other account, but because they belonged to the church, and so 
 belonged to Christ. 

 2. He began with vexing them only, or afflicting them, imprisoning
 them, fining them, spoiling their houses and goods, and other ways 
 molesting them; but afterwards he proceeded to greater instances of 
 cruelty. Christ's suffering servants are thus trained up by less
 troubles for greater, <I>that tribulation may work patience, and 
 patience experience.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>He killed James the brother of John with the sword,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 We are here to consider, 

 1. Who the martyr was: it was <I>James the brother of John;</I> so 
 called to distinguish him from the other James the brother of Joses. 
 This was called <I>Jacobus major--James the greater;</I> that,
 <I>minor--the less.</I> This who was here crowned with martyrdom was one
 of the first three of Christ's disciples, one of those that were <I>the 
 witnesses of his transfiguration and agony,</I> whereby he was prepared 
 for martyrdom; he was one of those whom Christ called 
 <I>Boanerges--Sons of thunder;</I> and perhaps by his powerful
 awakening preaching he had provoked Herod, or those about him, as John 
 Baptist did the other Herod, and that was the occasion of his coming 
 into this trouble. He was one of those sons of Zebedee whom Christ told 
 <I>that they should drink of the cup that he was to drink of, and be 
 baptized with the baptism that he was to be baptized with,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:23">Matt. xx. 23</A>.

 And now those words of Christ were made good in him; but it was in
 order to his sitting at Christ's right hand; for <I>if we suffer with 
 him, we shall reign with him.</I> He was one of the twelve who were 
 commissioned <I>to disciple all nations;</I> and to take him off now, 
 before he had removed from Jerusalem, was like Cain's killing Abel when 
 the world was to be peopled, and one man was then more than many at 
 another time. To kill an apostle now was killing he knew not how many. 
 But why would God permit it? If <I>the blood of his saints,</I> much 
 more the blood of apostles, <I>is precious in his eyes,</I> and 
 therefore, we may be sure, is not shed but upon a valuable 
 consideration. Perhaps God intended hereby to awaken the rest of the 
 apostles to disperse themselves among the nations, and not to nestle 
 any longer at Jerusalem. Or it was to show that though the apostles 
 were appointed <I>to plant the gospel in the world,</I> yet if they 
 were taken off God could do his work without them, and would do it. The 
 apostle died a martyr, to show the rest of them what they must expect, 
 that they might prepare accordingly. The tradition that they have in 
 the Romish church, that this James had been before this in Spain, and 
 had planted the gospel there, is altogether groundless; nor is there 
 any certainty of it, or good authority for it.

 2. What kind of death he suffered: He was slain <I>with the sword,</I>
 that is, his head was <I>cut off with a sword,</I> which was looked 
 upon by the Romans to be a more disgraceful way of being beheaded than 
 with an axe; so Lorinus. Beheading was not ordinarily used among the
 Jews; but, when kings gave verbal orders for private and sudden 
 executions, this manner of death was used, as most expeditious; and it 
 is probable that this Herod killed James, as the other Herod killed 
 John Baptist, privately <I>in the prison.</I> It is strange that we 
 have not a more full and particular account of the martyrdom of this 
 great apostle, as we had of Stephen. But even this short mention of the 
 thing is sufficient to let us know that the first preachers of the 
 gospel were so well assured of the truth of it that they sealed it with 
 their blood, and thereby have encouraged us, if at any time we are 
 called to it, <I>to resist unto blood too.</I> The Old-Testament 
 martyrs were <I>slain with the sword</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:37">Heb. xi. 37</A>),

 and Christ <I>came not to send peace, but a sword</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:34">Matt. x. 34</A>),

 in preparation for which we must arm ourselves <I>with the sword of the 
 Spirit,</I> which is the word of God, and then we need not fear 
 <I>what</I> the sword of <I>men can do unto us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He imprisoned Peter, of whom he had heard most, as making the 
 greatest figure among the apostles and whom therefore he would be proud 
 of the honour of taking off. Observe here, 

 1. When he had beheaded James, <I>he proceeded further,</I> he added,
 <I>to take Peter also.</I> Note, Blood to the blood-thirsty does but 
 make them more so, and the way of persecution, as of other sins, is 
 downhill; when men are in it, they cannot easily stop themselves; when 
 they are in they find they must on. <I>Male facta male factis tegere ne 
 perpluant--One evil deed is covered with another, so that there is no
 passage through them.</I> Those that take one bold step in a sinful way 
 give Satan advantage against them to tempt them to take another, and 
 provoke God to leave them to themselves, to go from bad to worse. It is 
 therefore our wisdom to take heed of the beginnings of sin. 

 2. He did this <I>because he saw it pleased the Jews.</I> Observe, The
 Jews made themselves guilty of the blood of James by showing themselves 
 well pleased with it afterwards, though they had not excited Herod to 
 it. There are accessaries <I>ex post facto--after the fact;</I> and
 those will be reckoned with as persecutors who take pleasure in others' 
 persecuting, who delight to see good men ill used, and cry, <I>Aha, so 
 would we have it,</I> or at least secretly approve of it. For bloody 
 persecutors, when they perceive themselves applauded for that which 
 every one ought to cry shame upon them for, are encouraged to go on, 
 and have their hands strengthened and their hearts hardened, and the 
 checks of their own consciences smothered; nay, it is as strong a 
 temptation to them to do the like as it was here to Herod, <I>because 
 he saw it pleased the Jews.</I> Though he had no reason to fear 
 displeasing them if he did not, as Pilate condemned Christ, yet he 
 hoped to please them by doing it, and so to make an interest among 
 them, and make amends for displeasing them in something else. Note, 
 Those make themselves an easy prey to Satan who make it their business 
 to please men. 

 3. Notice is taken of the time when Herod laid hold on Peter: <I>Then
 were the days of unleavened bread.</I> It was at the feast of the 
 passover, when their celebrating the memorial of their typical 
 deliverance should have led them to the acceptance of their spiritual 
 deliverance; instead of this, they, under pretence of zeal for the law, 
 were most violently fighting against it, and, in <I>the days of 
 unleavened bread,</I> were most soured and embittered <I>with the old 
 leaven of malice and wickedness.</I> At the passover, when <I>the Jews 
 came from all parts to Jerusalem to keep the feast,</I> they irritated 
 one another against the Christians and Christianity, and were then more 
 violent than at other times. 

 4. Here is an account of Peter's imprisonment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>When he</I> had laid hands on him, and, it is likely, examined him, 
 <I>he put him in prison,</I> into the inner prison; some say, into the 
 same prison into which he and the other apostles were cast some years 
 before, and were rescued out of it by an angel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:18"><I>ch.</I> v. 18</A>.

 He was <I>delivered to four quaternions of soldiers,</I> that is, to
 sixteen, who were to be a guard upon him, four at a time, that he 
 should not make his escape, nor be rescued by his friends. Thus they 
 thought they had him fast. 

 5. Herod's design was, <I>after Easter, to bring him forth unto the 
 people.</I>

 (1.) He would make a spectacle of him. Probably he had put James to
 death privately, which the people had complained of, not because it was 
 an unjust thing to put a man to death without giving him a public 
 hearing, but because it deprived them of the satisfaction of seeing him 
 executed; and therefore Herod, now he knows their minds, will gratify 
 them with the sight of Peter in bonds, of Peter upon the block, that 
 they may feed their eyes with such a pleasing spectacle. And very 
 ambitious surely he was to please the people who was willing thus to 
 please them! 

 (2.) He would do this <I>after Easter,</I> <B><I>meta to 
 pascha</I></B>--<I>after the passover,</I> certainly so it ought to be
 read, for it is the same word that is always so rendered; and to 
 insinuate the introducing of a gospel-feast, instead of the passover, 
 when we have nothing in the New Testament of such a thing, is to mingle 
 Judaism with our Christianity. Herod would not condemn him till the
 passover was over, some think, for fear lest he should have such an 
 interest among the people that they should demand the release of him, 
 according to the custom of the feast: or, after the hurry of the feast 
 was over, and the town was empty, he would entertain them with Peter's 
 public trial and execution. Thus was the plot laid, and both Herod and 
 the people long to have the feast over, that they may gratify 
 themselves with this barbarous entertainment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made
 without ceasing of the church unto God for him.
 &nbsp; 6 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night
 Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains:
 and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
 &nbsp; 7 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon <I>him,</I> and a
 light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and
 raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off
 from <I>his</I> hands.
 &nbsp; 8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
 sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment
 about thee, and follow me.
 &nbsp; 9 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was
 true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
 &nbsp; 10 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came
 unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to
 them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through
 one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.
 &nbsp; 11 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a
 surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me
 out of the hand of Herod, and <I>from</I> all the expectation of the
 people of the Jews.
 &nbsp; 12 And when he had considered <I>the thing,</I> he came to the house
 of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many
 were gathered together praying.
 &nbsp; 13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came
 to hearken, named Rhoda.
 &nbsp; 14 And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for
 gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.
 &nbsp; 15 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly
 affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.
 &nbsp; 16 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened <I>the
 door,</I> and saw him, they were astonished.
 &nbsp; 17 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their
 peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the
 prison. And he said, Go show these things unto James, and to the
 brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.
 &nbsp; 18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
 soldiers, what was become of Peter.
 &nbsp; 19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he
 examined the keepers, and commanded that <I>they</I> should be put to
 death. And he went down from Jud&aelig;a to C&aelig;sarea, and <I>there</I>
 abode.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of Peter's deliverance out of prison, by which 
 the design of Herod against him was defeated, and his life preserved 
 for further service, and a stop given to this bloody torrent. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. One thing that magnified his deliverance was that it was a signal 
 answer to prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Peter was kept in prison</I> with a great deal of care, so that it 
 was altogether impossible, either by force or by stealth, to get him 
 out. <I>But prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for 
 him,</I> for prayers and tears are the church's arms; therewith she 
 fights, not only against her enemies, but for her friends: and to these 
 means they have recourse. 

 1. The delay of Peter's trial gave them time for prayer. It is probable
 that James was hurried off so suddenly and so privately that they had 
 not time to pray for him, God so ordering it that they should not have 
 space to pray, when he designed they should not have the thing they 
 prayed for. James must be offered upon the sacrifice and service of
 their faith, and therefore prayer for him is restrained and prevented; 
 but Peter must be continued to them, and therefore prayer for him is 
 stirred up, and time is given them for it, by Herod's putting off the 
 prosecution. <I>Howbeit, he meant not so, neither did his heart think 
 so.</I> 

 2. They were very particular in their prayers for him, that it would
 please God, some way or other, to defeat Herod's purpose, and to snatch 
 the lamb out of the jaws of the lion. The death of James alarmed them 
 to a greater fervency in their prayer for Peter; for, if they be broken 
 thus with breach upon breach, they fear that the enemy will make a full 
 end. Stephen is not, and James is not, and will they take Peter also? 
 All these things are against them; this will be sorrow upon sorrow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:27">Phil. ii. 27</A>.

 Note, Though the death and sufferings of Christ's ministers may be made
 greatly to serve the interests of Christ's kingdom, yet it is the duty 
 and concern of the church earnestly to pray for their life, liberty, 
 and tranquillity; and sometimes Providence orders it that they are 
 brought into imminent danger, to stir up prayer for them.

 3. <I>Prayer was made without ceasing;</I> it was, <B><I>proseuche
 ektenes</I></B>--<I>fervent prayer.</I> It is the word that is used
 concerning Christ's praying in his agony <I>more earnestly;</I> it is 
 <I>the fervent prayer of the righteous man, that</I> is effectual, and 
 <I>availeth much.</I> Some think it denotes the constancy and 
 continuance of their prayers; so we take it: <I>They prayed without 
 ceasing.</I> It was an extended prayer; they prayed for his release in 
 their public assemblies (private ones, perhaps, <I>for fear of the 
 Jews</I>); then they went home, and prayed for it in their families; 
 then retired into their closets, and prayed for it there; so <I>they 
 prayed without ceasing:</I> or first one knot of them, and then 
 another, and then a third, kept a day of prayer, or rather a night of 
 prayer, for him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, Times of public distress and danger should be praying times with 
 the church; we must pray always, but then especially.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Another thing that magnified his deliverance was that <I>when the 
 king's commandment and decree drew near to be put in execution,</I> 
 then his deliverance was wrought, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:1,2">Esth. ix. 1, 2</A>.

 Let us observe when his deliverance came.

 1. It was the very night before Herod designed to bring him forth,
 which made it to be so much the greater consolation to his friends and 
 confusion to his enemies. It is probable some who had an interest in 
 Herod, or those about him, had been improving it to get a discharge for 
 Peter, but in vain; Herod resolves he shall die. And now they despair 
 of prevailing in this way, for to-morrow is <I>the day set for the 
 bringing of him forth;</I> and, it is likely, they will make as quick 
 work with him as with his Master; and now God opened a door of escape 
 for him. Note, God's time to help is when things are brought to the 
 last extremity, when there is none shut up nor left

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36">Deut. xxxii. 36</A>),

 and for this reason it has been said, "The worse the better." When 
 Isaac is bound upon the altar, and the knife in the hand, and the hand 
 stretched out to slay him, then <I>Jehovah--jireh, the Lord will
 provide.</I> 

 2. It was when he was <I>fast bound with two chains, between two
 soldiers;</I> so that if he offer to stir he wakes them; and, besides 
 this, though the prison-doors, no doubt, were locked and bolted, yet, 
 to make sure work, <I>the keepers before the door kept the prison,</I> 
 that no one might so much as attempt to rescue him. Never could the art 
 of man do more to secure a prisoner. Herod, no doubt, said, as Pilate

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:65">Matt. xxvii. 65</A>),

 <I>make it as sure as you can.</I> When men will think to be too hard 
 for God, God will make it appear that he is too hard for them. 

 3. It was when he was <I>sleeping between the soldiers,</I> fast 
 asleep;

 (1.) Not terrified with his danger, though it was very imminent, and
 there was no visible way for his escape. There was but a step between
 him and death, and yet he could lay himself down in peace, and 
 sleep--sleep in the midst of his enemies--sleep when, it may be, they
 were awake, having a good cause that he suffered for, and a good 
 conscience that he suffered with, and being assured that God would 
 issue his trial that way that should be most for his glory. Having 
 <I>committed his cause to him that judgeth righteously, his soul dwells 
 at ease;</I> and even in prison, between two soldiers, God gives him 
 sleep, as he doth to his beloved. 

 (2.) Not expecting his deliverance. He did not keep awake, looking to
 the right hand, or to the left, for relief, but lay asleep, and was 
 perfectly surprised with his deliverance. Thus the church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:1">Ps. cxxvi. 1</A>):
 
 <I>We were like those that dream.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It also magnified his deliverance very much that an <I>angel was 
 sent from heaven</I> on purpose to rescue him, which made his escape 
 both practicable and warrantable. This angel brought him a legal 
 discharge, and enabled him to make use of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>The angel of the Lord came upon him;</I> 
 <B><I>epeste</I></B>--<I>stood over him.</I> He seemed as one abandoned
 by men, yet not forgotten of his God; <I>The Lord thinketh upon 
 him.</I> Gates and guards kept all his friends from him, but could not 
 keep the angels of God from him: and <I>they invisibly encamp round 
 about those that fear God, to deliver them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:7">Ps. xxxiv. 7</A>),

 <I>and therefore they need not fear, though a host of enemies encamp 
 against them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:3">Ps. xxvii. 3</A>.

 Wherever the people of God are, and however surrounded, they have a way 
 open heavenward, nor can any thing intercept their intercourse with 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>A light shone in the prison.</I> Though it is a dark place, and 
 in the night, Peter shall see his way clear. Some observe that we do 
 not find in the Old Testament that where angels appeared <I>the light 
 shone round about them;</I> for that was a dark dispensation, and the 
 glory of angels was then veiled. But in the New Testament, when mention 
 is made of the appearing of the angels, notice is taken of the light 
 that they appeared in; for it is by the gospel that the upper world is 
 brought to light. The soldiers to whom Peter was chained were either 
 struck into a deep sleep for the present (as Saul and his soldiers were 
 when David carried off his spear and cruise of water), or, if they were 
 awake, the appearance of the angel made them to <I>shake, and to become 
 as dead men,</I> as it was with the guard set on Christ's 
 sepulchre.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The angel awoke Peter, by giving him <I>a blow on his side,</I> a 
 gentle touch, enough to rouse him out of his sleep, though so fast 
 asleep that the light that shone upon him did not awaken him. When good 
 people slumber in a time of danger, and are not awakened by the light 
 of the word, and the discoveries it gives them, let them expect to be 
 smitten on the side by some sharp affliction; better be raised up so 
 than left asleep. The language of this stroke was, <I>Arise up 
 quickly;</I> not as if the angel feared coming short by his delay, but 
 Peter must not be indulged in it. When David hears <I>the sound of the 
 going on the tops of the mulberry trees, then he must rise up quickly, 
 and bestir himself.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. <I>His chains fell off from his hands.</I> It seems they had 
 handcuffed him, to make him sure, but <I>God loosed his bands;</I> and, 
 if they fall off from his hands, it is as well as if he had the 
 strength of Samson to break them like threads of tow. Tradition makes a 
 mighty rout about these chains, and tells a formal story that one of 
 the soldiers kept them for a sacred relic, and they were long after 
 presented to Eudoxia the empress, and I know not what miracles are said 
 to have been wrought by them; and the Romish church keeps a feast on 
 the first of August yearly in remembrance of Peter's chains, <I>festum 
 vinculorum Petri--The feast of Peter's chains;</I> whereas this was at
 the passover. Surely they are thus fond of Peter's chains in hope with 
 them to enslave the world!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He was ordered to dress himself immediately, and follow the angel; 
 and he did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 When Peter was awake he knew not what to do but as the angel directed 
 him.

 (1.) He must <I>gird himself;</I> for those that slept in their clothes 
 ungirded themselves, so that they had nothing to do, when they got up, 
 but to fasten their girdles. 

 (2.) He <I>must bind on his sandals,</I> that he might be fit to walk. 
 Those whose bonds are loosed by the power of divine grace must have 
 <I>their feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.</I> 
 
 (3.) He must <I>cast his garments about him,</I> and come away as he 
 was, and follow the angel; and he might go with a great deal of courage 
 and cheerfulness who had a messenger from heaven for his guide and 
 guard. He <I>went out, and followed him.</I> Those who are delivered
 out of a spiritual imprisonment must follow their deliverer, as Israel 
 when they went out of the house of bondage did; they <I>went out, not 
 knowing whither they went,</I> but whom they followed. Now it is said, 
 when Peter went out after the angel, <I>he knew not that it was true 
 which was done by the angel,</I> that it was really a matter of fact, 
 <I>but thought he saw a vision;</I> and, if he did, it was not the 
 first he had seen: but by this it appears that a heavenly vision was so 
 plain, and carried so much of its own evidence along with it, that it 
 was difficult to distinguish between what was done in fact and what was 
 done in vision. <I>When the Lord brought back the captivity of his 
 people we were like those that dream,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:1">Ps. cxxvi. 1</A>.

 Peter was so; he thought the news was too good to be true.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He was led safely by the angel out of danger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Guards were kept at one pass and at another, which they were to make 
 their way through when they were out of the prison, and they did so 
 without any opposition; nay, for aught that appears, without any 
 discovery: either their eyes were closed; or their hands were tied, or 
 their hearts failed them; so it was that the angel and Peter safely 
 <I>passed the first and second ward.</I> Those watchmen represented the 
 watchmen of the Jewish church, on whom God had <I>poured out a spirit 
 of slumber, eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not 
 hear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8">Rom. xi. 8</A>.

 His <I>watchmen are blind, sleeping, lying down, and loving to
 slumber.</I> But still there is an iron gate, after all, that will stop 
 them, and, if the guards can but recover themselves, there they may 
 recover their prisoner, as Pharaoh hoped to retake Israel at the Red 
 Sea. However, up to that gate they march, and, like the Red Sea before 
 Israel, it <I>opened to them.</I> They did not so much as put a hand to 
 it, but it opened <I>of its own accord,</I> by an invisible power; and 
 thus was fulfilled in the letter what was figuratively promised to 
 Cyrus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:1,2">Isa. xlv. 1, 2</A>):

 <I>I will open before him the two-leaved gates, will break in pieces 
 the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron.</I> And 
 probably the iron gate shut again of itself, that none of the guards 
 might pursue Peter. Note, When God will work salvation for his people, 
 no difficulties in their way are insuperable; but even gates of iron 
 are made to open of their own accord. This iron gate led him into the 
 city out of the castle or tower; whether within the gates of the city 
 or without is not certain, so that, when they were through this, they 
 were got into the street. This deliverance of Peter represents to us
 our redemption by Christ, which is often spoken of as the setting of 
 prisoners free, not only the proclaiming of liberty to the captives, 
 but the <I>bringing of them out of the prison-house.</I> The 
 application of the redemption in the conversion of souls is the 
 <I>sending forth of the prisoners, by the blood of the covenant, out of 
 the pit wherein is no water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:11">Zech. ix. 11</A>.

 The grace of God, like this angel of the Lord, brings light first into
 the prison, by the opening of the understanding, smites the sleeping 
 sinner on the side by the awakening of the conscience, causes the 
 chains to fall off from the hands by the renewing of the will, and then 
 gives the word of command, <I>Gird thyself, and follow me.</I> 
 Difficulties are to be passed through, and the opposition of Satan and 
 his instruments, a first and second ward, an untoward generation, from 
 which we are concerned to save ourselves; and we shall be saved by the 
 grace of God, if we put ourselves under the divine conduct. And at 
 length the iron gate shall be opened to us, to enter into the New 
 Jerusalem, where we shall be perfectly freed from all the marks of our 
 captivity, and brought into the <I>glorious liberty of the children of 
 God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. When this was done, <I>the angel departed from him,</I> and left him 
 to himself. He was out of danger from his enemies, and needed no guard. 
 He knew where he was, and how to find out his friends, and needed no 
 guide, and therefore his heavenly guard and guide bids him farewell. 
 Note, Miracles are not to be expected when ordinary means are to be 
 used. When Peter has now no more wards to pass, nor iron gates to get 
 through, he needs only the ordinary invisible ministration of the 
 angels, who encamp round about those that fear God, and deliver 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Having seen how his deliverance was magnified, we are next to see 
 how it was manifested both to himself and others, and how, being made 
 great, it was made known. We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How Peter came to himself, and so came himself to the knowledge of 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 So many strange and surprising things coming together upon a man just 
 awoke out of sleep put him for the present into some confusion; so that 
 he knew not where he was, nor what he did, nor whether it was fancy or 
 fact; but at length Peter <I>came to himself,</I> was thoroughly awake, 
 and found that it was not a dream, but a real thing: "<I>Now I know of 
 a surety,</I> now I know <B><I>alethos</I></B>--<I>truly,</I> now I
 know that it is truth, and not an illusion of the fancy. Now I am well 
 satisfied concerning it <I>that the Lord Jesus hath sent his angel,</I> 
 for angels are subject to him and go on his errands, and by him <I>hath 
 delivered me out of the hands of Herod,</I> who thought he had me fast, 
 and so hath disappointed <I>all the expectation of the people of the 
 Jews,</I> who doubted not to see Peter cut off the next day, and hoped 
 it was the one neck of Christianity, in which it would all be struck 
 off at one blow." For this reason it was a cause of great expectation, 
 among not only the common people, but the great people of the Jews. 
 Peter, when he recollected himself, <I>perceived of a truth</I> what 
 great things God had done for him, which at first he could not believe 
 for joy. Thus souls who are delivered out of a spiritual bondage are 
 not at first aware what God has wrought in them. Many have the truth of 
 grace that want the evidence of it. They are questioning whether there 
 be indeed this change wrought in them, or whether they have not been 
 all this while in a dream. But <I>when the Comforter comes, whom the 
 Father will send</I> sooner or later, he will let them know of a surety 
 what a blessed change is wrought in them, and what a happy state they 
 are brought into.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How Peter came to his friends, and brought the knowledge of it to 
 them. Here is a particular account of this, and it is very 
 interesting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He <I>considered the thing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 considered how imminent his danger was, how great his deliverance; and 
 now what has he to do? What improvement must he make of this
 deliverance? What must he do next? God's providence leaves room for the 
 use of our prudence; and, though he has undertaken to perform and 
 perfect what he has begun, yet he expects we should consider the 
 thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He went directly to a friend's house, which, it is likely, lay 
 near to the place where he was; it was the house of Mary, a sister of 
 Barnabas, and mother of John Mark, whose house, it should seem, was 
 frequently made use of for the private meeting of the disciples, either 
 because it lay obscure, or because she was more forward than others 
 were to open her doors to them; and, no doubt, it was, like the house 
 of Obededom, blessed for the ark's sake. A church in the house makes it 
 a little sanctuary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) There he found <I>many</I> that were <I>gathered together 
 praying,</I> at the dead time of the night, praying for Peter, who was 
 the next day to come upon his trial, that God would find out some way 
 or other for his deliverance. Observe, 

 [1.] They continued in prayer, in token of their importunity; they did 
 not think it enough once to have presented his case to God, but they 
 did it again and again. Thus <I>men ought always to pray, and not to 
 faint.</I> As long as we are kept waiting for a mercy we must continue 
 praying for it. 

 [2.] It should seem that now when the affair came near to a crisis, and 
 the very next day was fixed for the determining of it, they were more 
 fervent in prayer than before; and it was a good sign that God intended 
 to deliver Peter when he thus stirred up a spirit of prayer for his 
 deliverance, for he never <I>said to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye my face 
 in vain.</I> 

 [3.] They gathered together for prayer on this occasion; though this 
 would made them obnoxious to the government if they were discovered, 
 yet they know what an encouragement Christ gave to joint-prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:19,20">Matt. xviii. 19, 20</A>.

 And it was always the practice of God's praying people to unite their 
 forces in prayer, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:4,Es+4:16">2 Chron. xx. 4; Esth. iv. 16</A>.

 [4.] They were many that were got together for this work, as many 
 perhaps as the room would hold; and first one prayed, and then another, 
 of those who gave themselves to the word and prayer, the rest joining 
 with them; or, if they had not ministers among them, no doubt but there 
 were many private Christians that knew how to pray, and to pray 
 pertinently, and to continue long in prayer when the affections of 
 those who joined were so stirred as to keep pace with them upon such an 
 occasion. This was in the night, when others were asleep, which was an 
 instance both of their prudence and of their zeal. Note, It is good for 
 Christians to have private meetings for prayer, especially in times of 
 distress, and not to let fall nor forsake such assemblies. 

 [5.] Peter came to them when they were thus employed, which was an 
 immediate present answer to their prayer. It was as if God should say, 
 "You are praying that Peter may be restored to you; now here he is." 
 <I>While they are yet speaking, I will hear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:24">Isa. lxv. 24</A>.

 Thus the angel was sent with an answer of peace to Daniel's prayer,
 <I>while he was praying,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:20,21">Dan. ix. 20, 21</A>.

 <I>Ask, and it shall be given.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He knocked at the gate, and had much ado to get them to let him in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:13-16"><I>v.</I> 13-16</A>):

 <I>Peter knocked at the door of the gate,</I> designing by it to awaken 
 them out of their sleep, and, for aught that appears, not knowing that 
 he disturbed them in their devotions. Yet, if his friends were 
 permitted to speak with him in private in the prison, it is possible he 
 might know of this appointment, and it was this which he recollected 
 and considered when he determined to go to that house, where he knew he 
 should find many of his friends together. Now when he knocked there, 
 
 [1.] A <I>damsel came to hearken;</I> not to open the door till she 
 knew who was there, a friend or a foe, and what their business was, 
 fearing informers. Whether this damsel was one of the family or one of 
 the church, whether a servant or a daughter, does not appear; it should 
 seem, by her being named, that she was of note among the Christians, 
 and more zealously affected to the better part than most of her age. 
 
 [2.] She knew Peter's voice, having often heard him pray, and preach, 
 and discourse, with a great deal of pleasure. But, instead of letting 
 him in immediately out of the cold, <I>she opened not the gate for 
 gladness.</I> Thus sometimes, in a transport of affection to our 
 friends, we do that which is unkind. In an ecstasy of joy she forgets 
 herself, and <I>opened not the gate.</I> 

 [3.] She ran in, and probably went up to an upper room where they were 
 together, and told them that Peter was certainly at the gate, though 
 she had not courage enough to open the gate, for fear she should be 
 deceived, and it should be the enemy. But, when she spoke of Peter's 
 being there, they said, "<I>Thou art mad;</I> it is impossible it 
 should be he, for he is in prison." Sometimes that which we most 
 earnestly wish for we are most backward to believe, because we are 
 afraid of imposing upon ourselves, as the disciples, who, when Christ 
 had risen, <I>believed not for joy.</I> However, she stood to it that 
 it was he. Then said they, <I>It is his angel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>First,</I> "It is a <I>messenger</I> from him, that makes use of his 
 name;" so some take it; <B><I>angelos</I></B> often signifies no more 
 than <I>a messenger.</I> It is used of John's messengers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:24,27">Luke vii. 24, 27</A>),
 
 of Christ's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:52">Luke ix. 52</A>.

 When the damsel was confident it was Peter, because she knew his voice, 
 they thought it was because he that stood at the door had called 
 himself Peter, and therefore offer this solution of the difficulty, "It 
 is one that comes with an errand from him, and thou didst mistake as if 
 it had been he himself." Dr. Hammond thinks this the easiest way of 
 understanding it. <I>Secondly,</I> "It is his <I>guardian angel,</I>
 or some other angel that has assumed his shape and voice, and stands at 
 the gate in his resemblance." Some think that they supposed his angel 
 to appear as a presage of his death approaching; and this agrees with a 
 notion which the vulgar have, that sometimes before persons have died 
 <I>their ward has been seen,</I> that is, some spirit exactly in their 
 likeness for countenance and dress, when they themselves have been at 
 the same time in some other place; they call it their <I>ward,</I> that 
 is, their angel, who is their guard. If so, they concluded this an ill 
 omen, that their prayers were denied, and that the language of the 
 apparition was, "Let it suffice you, Peter must die, say no more of 
 that matter." And, if we understand it so, it only proves that they had 
 then such an opinion of a man's <I>ward</I> being seen a little before 
 his death, but does not prove that there is such a thing. Others think 
 they took this to be an angel from heaven, sent to bring them a grant 
 to their prayers. But why should they imagine that angel to assume the 
 voice and shape of Peter, when we find not any thing like it in the 
 appearance of angels? Perhaps they herein spoke the language of the 
 Jews, who had a fond conceit that every good man has a particular 
 tutelar angel, that has the charge of him, and sometimes personates 
 him. The heathen called it a <I>good genius,</I> that attended a man;
 but, since no other scripture speaks of such a thing, this alone is too 
 weak to bear the weight of such a doctrine. We are sure that the angels 
 are <I>ministering spirits</I> for the good of <I>the heirs of 
 salvation,</I> that they have a <I>charge concerning them,</I> and 
 <I>pitch their tents round about them;</I> and we need not be 
 solicitous that every particular saint should have his guardian angel, 
 when we are assured he has a guard of angels.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) At length they let him in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>He continued knocking</I> though they delayed to open to him, and at 
 last they admitted him. The iron gate which opposed his enlargement 
 opened of itself, without so much as once knocking at it; but the door 
 of his friend's house that was to welcome him does not open of its own 
 accord, but must be knocked at, long knocked at; lest Peter should be 
 puffed up by the honours which the angel did him, he meets with this 
 mortification, by a seeming slight which his friends put upon him. But, 
 <I>when they saw him, they were astonished,</I> were filled with wonder 
 and joy in him, as much as they were but just now with sorrow and fear 
 concerning him. It was both surprising and pleasing to them in the 
 highest degree.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Peter gave them an account of his deliverance. When he came to the 
 company that were gathered together with so much zeal to pray for him, 
 they gathered about him with no less zeal to congratulate him on his 
 deliverance; and herein they were so noisy that when Peter himself 
 begged them to consider what peril he was yet in, if they should be 
 overheard, he could not make them hear him, but was forced to <I>beckon 
 to them with the hand to hold their peace,</I> and had much ado thereby 
 to command silence, while <I>he declared unto them how the Lord Jesus 
 had</I> by an angel <I>brought him out of prison;</I> and it is very 
 likely, having found them praying for his deliverance, he did not part 
 with them till he and they had together solemnly given thanks to God 
 for his enlargement; or, if he could not stay to do it, it is probable 
 they staid together to do it; for what is won by prayer must be worn 
 with praise; and God must always have the glory of that which we have 
 the comfort of. When David declares <I>what God had done for his 
 soul,</I> he blesses God who had not turned away his prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:16,20">Ps. lxvi. 16, 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) Peter sent the account to others of his friends: <I>Go, show these 
 things to James, and to the brethren with him,</I> who perhaps were met 
 together in another place at the same time, upon the same errand to the 
 throne of grace, which is one way of keeping up the communion of saints 
 and wrestling with God in prayer--acting in concert, though at a
 distance, like Esther and Mordecai. He would have James and his company 
 to know of his deliverance, not only that they might be eased of their 
 pain and delivered from their fears concerning Peter, but that they 
 might return thanks to God with him and for him. Observe, Though Herod 
 had slain one James with the sword, yet here was another James, and 
 that in Jerusalem too, that stood up in his room to preside among the 
 brethren there; for, when God has work to do, he will never want 
 instruments to do it with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (8.) Peter had nothing more to do for the present than to shift for his 
 own safety, which he did accordingly: He <I>departed, and went into 
 another place more obscure,</I> and therefore more safe. He knew the 
 town very well, and knew where to find a place that would be a shelter 
 to him. Note, Even the Christian law of self-denial and suffering for
 Christ has not abrogated and repealed the natural law of 
 self-preservation, and care for our own safety, as far as God gives an
 opportunity of providing for it by lawful means.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Having seen the triumph of Peter's friends in his deliverance, let 
 us next observe the confusion of his enemies thereupon, which was so 
 much the greater because people's expectation was so much raised of the 
 putting of him to death. 

 1. The guards were in the utmost consternation upon it, for they knew
 how highly penal it was to them to let a prisoner escape that they had 
 charge of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>As soon as it was day,</I> and they found the prisoner gone, there 
 was <I>no small stir or strife,</I> as some read it, <I>among the 
 soldiers, what had become of Peter;</I> he is gone, and nobody knows 
 how or which way. They thought themselves as sure as could be of him 
 but last night; yet now the bird is flown, and they can hear no tale 
 nor tidings of him. This set them together by the ears; one says, "It
 was your fault;" the other, "Nay, but it was yours;" having no other 
 way to clear themselves, but by accusing one another. With us, if but a 
 prisoner for debt escape, the sheriff must answer for the debt. Thus
 have the persecutors of the gospel of Christ been often filled with 
 vexation to see its cause conquering, notwithstanding the opposition 
 they have given to it. 

 2. Houses were searched in vain for the rescued prisoner

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Herod sought for him, and found him not.</I> Who can find whom God 
 hath hidden? Baruch and Jeremiah are safe, though searched for, because 
 <I>the Lord has hidden them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:26">Jer. xxxvi. 26</A>.

 In times of public danger, all believers have God for <I>their
 hiding-place,</I> which is such a secret, that there the ignorant world 
 cannot find them; such a strength, that the impotent world cannot reach 
 them.

 3. The keepers were reckoned with for a permissive escape: <I>Herod
 examined the keepers,</I> and finding that they could give no
 satisfactory account how Peter got away, <I>he commanded that they
 should be put to death,</I> according to the Roman law, and that 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:39">1 Kings xx. 39</A>,

 <I>If by any means he be missing, then shall thy life go for his
 life.</I> It is probable that these keepers had been more severe with 
 Peter than they needed to be (as the jailor,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:24"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 24</A>),

 and had been abusive to him, and to others that had been their
 prisoners upon the like account; and now justly are they put to death 
 for that which was not their fault, and by him too that had set them to 
 work to <I>vex the church.</I> When the wicked are thus snared in the 
 work of their own hands, the Lord is known by the judgments which he 
 executes. Or, if they had not thus made themselves obnoxious to the 
 justice of God, and it be thought hard that innocent men should suffer 
 thus for that which was purely the act of God, we may easily admit the 
 conjectures of some, that though they were <I>commanded to be put to 
 death,</I> to please the Jews, who were sadly disappointed by Peter's 
 escape, yet they were not executed; but Herod's death, immediately 
 after, prevented it. 

 4. Herod himself retired upon it: <I>He went down from Judea to
 Cesarea, and there abode.</I> He was vexed to the heart, as a lion 
 disappointed of his prey; and the more because he had so much raised 
 the <I>expectation of the people of the Jews</I> concerning Peter, had 
 told them how he would very shortly gratify them with the sight of 
 Peter's head in a charger, which would oblige them as much as John 
 Baptist's did Herodias; it made him ashamed to be robbed of this 
 boasting, and to see himself, notwithstanding his confidence, disabled 
 to make his words good. This is such a mortification to his proud 
 spirit that he cannot bear to stay in Judea, but away he goes to 
 Cesarea. Josephus mentions this coming of Herod to Cesarea, at the end 
 of the third year of his reign over all Judea (<I>Antiq.</I> 19. 343), 
 and says, he came thither to solemnize the plays that were kept there, 
 by a vast concourse of the nobility and gentry of the kingdom, for the 
 health of C&aelig;sar, and in honour of him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon:
 but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus
 the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their
 country was nourished by the king's <I>country.</I>

 god, and not of a man.
 &nbsp; 23 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he
 gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up
 the ghost.
 &nbsp; 24 But the word of God grew and multiplied.
 &nbsp; 25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
 fulfilled <I>their</I> ministry, and took with them John, whose
 surname was Mark.

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The death of Herod. God reckoned with him, not only for his putting 
 James to death, but for his design and endeavour to put Peter to death; 
 for sinners will be called to an account, not only for the wickedness 
 of their deeds, but for the wickedness of their endeavours 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:4">Ps. xxviii. 4</A>),
 
 for the mischief they have done and the mischief they would have done. 
 It was but a little while that Herod lived after this. Some sinners God 
 makes quick work with. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How the measure of his iniquity was filled up: it was <I>pride</I> 
 that did it; it is this that commonly goes more immediately <I>before 
 destruction,</I> and a <I>haughty spirit before a fall.</I> 
 Nebuchadnezzar had been a very bloody man, and a great persecutor; but 
 the word that was in the king's mouth when the judgments of God fell 
 upon him was a proud word: <I>Is not this great Babylon that I have 
 built?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:30,31">Dan. iv. 30, 31</A>.

 It is the glory of God to <I>look on every one that is proud, and bring
 him low,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:12">Job xl. 12</A>.

 The instance of it here is very remarkable, and shows how God
 <I>resists the proud.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The men of Tyre and Sidon had, it seems, offended Herod. Those 
 cities were now under the Roman yoke, and they had been guilty of some 
 misdemeanours which Herod highly resented, and was resolved they should 
 feel his resentment. Some very small matter would serve such a proud 
 imperious man as Herod was for a provocation, where he was disposed to 
 pick a quarrel. He was highly displeased with this people, and they 
 must be made to know that his wrath was as the <I>roaring of a lion, as 
 messengers of death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The offenders truckled, being convinced, if not that they had done 
 amiss, yet that it was in vain to contend with such a potent adversary, 
 who, right or wrong, would be too hard for them; they submitted and 
 were willing upon any terms to <I>make peace with him.</I> Observe, 
 
 [1.] The reason why they were desirous to have the matter accommodated: 
 <I>Because their country was nourished by the king's country.</I> Tyre 
 and Sidon were trading cities, and had little land belonging to them, 
 but were always supplied with corn from the land of Canaan; <I>Judah 
 and Israel traded in their market, with wheat, and honey, and oil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:17">Ezek. xxvii. 17</A>.

 Now if Herod should make a law to prohibit the exportation of corn to 
 Tyre and Sidon (which they knew not but a man so revengeful as he might 
 soon do, not caring how many were famished by it), their country would 
 be undone; so that it was their interest to keep in with him. And is it 
 not then our wisdom to make our peace with God, and humble ourselves 
 before him, who have a much more constant and necessary dependence upon 
 him than one country can have upon another? for <I>in him we live, and
 move, and have our being.</I> 

 [2.] The method they took to prevent a rupture: <I>They made Blastus 
 the king's chamberlain their friend,</I> probably with bribes and good 
 presents; that is usually the way for men to make courtiers their 
 friends. And it is the hard fate of princes that they must have not 
 only their affairs, but their affections too, governed by such 
 mercenary tools; yet such men as Herod, that will not be governed by 
 reason, had better be so governed than by pride and passion. Blastus 
 had Herod's ear, and has the art of mollifying his resentments; and a 
 time is fixed for the ambassadors of Tyre and Sidon to come and make a 
 public submission, to beg his majesty's pardon, throw themselves upon 
 his clemency, and promise never again to offend in the like manner; and 
 that which will thus feed his pride shall serve to cool his 
 passion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Herod appeared in all the pomp and grandeur he had: He was 
 <I>arrayed in his royal apparel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>and sat upon his throne.</I> Josephus gives an account of this 
 splendid appearance which Herod made upon this occasion--<I>Antiq.</I>
 19. 344. He says that Herod at this time wore a robe of cloth of
 silver, so richly woven, and framed with such art, that when the sun 
 shone it reflected the light with such a lustre as dazzled the eyes of 
 the spectators, and struck an awe upon them. Foolish people value men 
 by their outward appearance; and no better are those who value 
 themselves by the esteem of such, who court it, and recommend 
 themselves to it as Herod did, who thought to make up the want of a 
 royal heart with his <I>royal apparel; and sat upon his throne,</I> as 
 if that gave him a privilege to trample upon all about him as his 
 footstool.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He made a speech to the men of Tyre and Sidon, a fine oration, in 
 which, probably, after he had aggravated their fault, and commended 
 their submission, he concluded with an assurance that he would pass by 
 their offence and receive them into his favour again--proud enough that
 he had it in his power <I>whom he would to keep alive,</I> as well as 
 <I>whom he would to slay;</I> and probably he kept them in suspense as 
 to what their doom should be, till he made this oration to them, that 
 the act of grace might come to them with the more pleasing 
 surprise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The people applauded him, the people that had a dependence upon 
 him, and had benefit by his favour, they <I>gave a shout;</I> and this 
 was what they shouted, <I>It is the voice of a god, and not of a 
 man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 God is great and good, and they thought such was Herod's greatness in 
 his apparel and throne, and such his goodness in forgiving them, that 
 he was worthy to be called no less than a god; and perhaps his speech 
 was delivered with such an air of majesty, and a mixture of clemency 
 with it, as affected the auditors thus. Or, it may be, it was not from 
 any real impression made upon their minds, or any high or good thoughts 
 they had indeed conceived of him; but, how meanly soever they thought 
 of him, they were resolved thus to curry favour with him, and 
 strengthen the new-made peace between him and them. Thus great men are 
 made an easy prey to flatterers if they lend an ear to them, and 
 encourage them. Grotius here observes that, though magistrates are 
 called <I>gods</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:1">Ps. lxxxii. 1</A>),

 yet <I>kings or monarchs, that is, single persons, are not, lest 
 countenance should thereby be given to the Gentiles, who gave divine 
 honours to their kings alive and dead, as here; but they are a college 
 of senators, or a bench of judges, that are called gods--In collegio
 toto senatorum non idem erat periculi; itaque eos, non autem reges, 
 invenimus dictos elohim.</I> Those that live by sense vilify God, as if 
 he were <I>altogether such a one as themselves,</I> and deify men, as 
 if they were gods; having <I>their persons in admiration, because of 
 advantage.</I> This is not only a great affront to God, giving that 
 glory to others which is due to him alone, but a great injury to those 
 who are thus flattered, as it makes them forget themselves, and so 
 puffs them up with pride that they are in the utmost danger possible of 
 falling into the condemnation of the devil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) These undue praises he took to himself, pleased himself with them, 
 and prided himself in them; and this was his sin. We do not find that 
 he had given any private orders to his confidants to begin such a 
 shout, or to put those words into the mouths of the people, nor that he 
 returned them thanks for the compliment and undertook to answer their 
 opinion of him. But his fault was that he said nothing, did not rebuke 
 their flattery, nor disown the title they had given him, nor <I>give 
 God the glory</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 but he took it to himself, was very willing it should terminate in 
 himself, and that he should be thought a god and have divine honours 
 paid him. <I>Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur--if the people will be
 deceived, let them.</I> And it was worse in him who was a Jew, and 
 professed to believe in one God only, than it was in the heathen 
 emperors, who had gods many and lords many.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How his iniquity was punished: <I>Immediately</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 <I>the angel of the Lord smote him</I> (by the order of Christ, for to
 him all judgment is committed), <I>because he gave not God the 
 glory</I> (for God is jealous for his own honour, and will be glorified 
 upon those whom he is not glorified by); and <I>he was eaten of 
 worms</I> above ground, <I>and gave up the ghost.</I> Now he was 
 reckoned with for vexing the church of Christ, killing James, 
 imprisoning Peter, and all the other mischiefs he had done. Observe in 
 the destruction of Herod,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It was no less than an angel that was the agent--<I>the angel of
 the Lord,</I> that angel that was ordered and commissioned to do it, or 
 that angel that used to be employed in works of this nature, the 
 destroying angel: or <I>the angel,</I> that is, that angel that 
 delivered Peter in the former part of the chapter--that angel smote
 Herod. For those ministering spirits are the ministers either of divine 
 justice or of divine mercy, as God is pleased to employ them. The angel 
 smote him with a sore disease just at that instant when he was 
 strutting at the applauses of the people, and adoring his own shadow. 
 Thus the king of Tyre said in his pride, <I>I am a god, I sit in the 
 seat of God; and set his heart as the heart of God;</I> but he shall be 
 <I>a man, and no God,</I> a weak mortal man, <I>in the hand of him that 
 slayeth him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:2-9">Ezek. xxviii. 2-9</A>),

 so Herod here. Potent princes must know, not only that God is 
 omnipotent, but that angels also are greater in power and might than 
 they. The angel <I>smote him, because he gave not the glory to God;</I> 
 angels are jealous for God's honour, and as soon as ever they have 
 commission are ready to smite those that usurp his prerogatives, and 
 rob God of his honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was no more than a worm that was the instrument of Herod's 
 destruction: He was <I>eaten of worms,</I> <B><I>genomenos 
 skolekobrotos</I></B>--<I>he became worm-eaten,</I> so it must be read;
 rotten he was, and he became like a piece of rotten wood. The body in 
 the grave is destroyed by worms, but Herod's body putrefied while he 
 was yet alive, and bred the worms which began to feed upon it betimes; 
 so Antiochum, that great persecutor, died. See here, 

 [1.] What vile bodies those are which we carry about with us; they 
 carry about with them the seeds of their own dissolution, by which they 
 will soon be destroyed whenever God does but speak the word. Surprising 
 discoveries have of late been made by microscopes of the multitude of 
 worms that there are in human bodies, and how much they contribute to 
 the diseases of them, which is a good reason why we should not be proud 
 of our bodies, or of any of their accomplishments, and why we should 
 not pamper our bodies, for this is but feeding the worms, and feeding 
 them for the worms. 

 [2.] See what weak and contemptible creatures God can make the 
 instruments of his justice, when he pleases. Pharaoh is plagued with 
 lice and flies, Ephraim consumed as with a moth, and Herod eaten with 
 worms. 

 [3.] See how God delights not only to bring down proud men, but to 
 bring them down in such a way as is most mortifying, and pours most 
 contempt upon them. Herod is not only destroyed, but destroyed by 
 worms, that the pride of his glory may be effectually stained. This 
 story of the death of Herod is particularly related by Josephus, a Jew, 
 <I>Antiq.</I> 19. 343-350: "That Herod came down to Cesarea, to
 celebrate a festival in honour of C&aelig;sar; that the second day of 
 the festival he went in the morning to the theatre, clothed with that 
 splendid robe mentioned before; that his flatterers saluted him as a 
 god, begged that he would be propitious to them; that hitherto they had 
 reverenced him as a man, but now they would confess to be in him 
 something more excellent than a mortal nature. That he did not refuse 
 nor correct this impious flattery (so the historian expresses it); But, 
 presently after, looking up, he saw an owl perched over his head, and 
 was at the same instant seized with a most violent pain in his bowels, 
 and gripes in his belly, which were exquisite from the very first; that 
 he turned his eyes upon his friends, and said to this purpose: 'Now I, 
 whom you called a god, and therefore immortal, must be proved a man, 
 and mortal.' That his torture continued without intermission, or the 
 least abatement, and then he died in the fifty-fourth year of his age, 
 when he had been king seven years."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The progress of the gospel after this. 

 1. <I>The word of God grew and multiplied,</I> as seed sown, which
 comes up with a great increase, thirty, sixty, a hundred fold; wherever 
 the gospel was preached, multitudes embraced it, and were added to the 
 church by it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 After the death of James, the word of God grew; for the church, the 
 more it was afflicted, the more it multiplied, like Israel in Egypt. 
 The courage and comfort of the martyrs, and God's owning them, did more 
 to invite people to Christianity, than their sufferings did to deter 
 them from it. After the death of Herod the word of God gained ground. 
 When such a persecutor was taken off by a dreadful judgment, many were 
 thereby convinced that the cause of Christianity was doubtless the 
 cause of Christ, and therefore embraced it. 

 2. Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch as soon as they had despatched
 the business they were sent upon: <I>When they had fulfilled their 
 ministry,</I> had paid in their money to the proper persons, and taken 
 care about the due distribution of it to those for whom it was 
 collected, they <I>returned from Jerusalem.</I> Though they had a great 
 many friends there, yet at present their work lay at Antioch; and where 
 our business is there we should be, and no longer from it than is 
 requisite. When a minister is called abroad upon any service, when he 
 has fulfilled that ministry, he ought to remember that he has work to 
 do at home, which wants him there and calls him thither. Barnabas and 
 Saul, when they went to <I>Antioch, took with them John, whose surname 
 was Mark,</I> at whose mother's house they had that meeting for prayer 
 which we read of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 She was sister to Barnabas. It is probable that Barnabas lodged there, 
 and perhaps Paul with him, while they were at Jerusalem, and it was 
 that that occasioned the meeting there at that time (for wherever Paul 
 was he would have some good work doing), and their intimacy in that 
 family while they were at Jerusalem occasioned their taking a son of 
 that family with them when they returned, to be trained up under them, 
 and employed by them, in the service of the gospel. Educating young men 
 for the ministry, and entering them into it, is a very good work for 
 elder ministers to take care of, and of good service to the rising 
 generation.</P>
