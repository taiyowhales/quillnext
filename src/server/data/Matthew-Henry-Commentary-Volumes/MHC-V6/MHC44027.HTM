 This whole chapter is taken up with an account of Paul's voyage towards 
 Rome, when he was sent thither a prisoner by Festus the governor, upon 
 his appeal to C&aelig;sar.

 I. The beginning of the voyage was well enough, it was calm and 
 prosperous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. Paul gave them notice of a storm coming, but could not prevail with
 them to lie by, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>.

 III. As they pursued their voyage, they met with a great deal of
 tempestuous weather, which reduced them to such extremity that they 
 counted upon nothing but being cast away, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:12-20">ver. 12-20</A>.

 IV. Paul assured them that though they would not be advised by him to
 prevent their coming into this danger, yet, by the good providence of 
 God, they should be brought safely through it, and none of them should 
 be lost, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:21-26">ver. 21-26</A>.

 V. At length they were at midnight thrown upon an island, which proved
 to be Malta, and then they were in the utmost danger imaginable, but 
 were assisted by Paul's counsel to keep the mariners in the ship, and 
 encouraged by his comforts to eat their meat, and have a good heart on 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:27-36">ver. 27-36</A>.

 VI. Their narrow escape with their lives, when they came to shore, when
 the ship was wrecked, but all the persons wonderfully preserved,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy,
 they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto <I>one</I> named
 Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.
 &nbsp; 2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning
 to sail by the coasts of Asia; <I>one</I> Aristarchus, a Macedonian of
 Thessalonica, being with us.
 &nbsp; 3 And the next <I>day</I> we touched at Sidon. And Julius
 courteously entreated Paul, and gave <I>him</I> liberty to go unto his
 friends to refresh himself.
 &nbsp; 4 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,
 because the winds were contrary.
 &nbsp; 5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia,
 we came to Myra, <I>a city</I> of Lycia.
 &nbsp; 6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing
 into Italy; and he put us therein.
 &nbsp; 7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come
 over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under
 Crete, over against Salmone;
 &nbsp; 8 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The
 fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city <I>of</I> Lasea.
 &nbsp; 9 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now
 dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished
 <I>them,</I>
 &nbsp; 10 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will
 be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship,
 but also of our lives.
 &nbsp; 11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner
 of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It does not appear how long it was after Paul's conference with Agrippa 
 that he was sent away for Rome, pursuant to his appeal to C&aelig;sar; but
 it is likely they took the first convenience they could hear of to do 
 it; in the mean time Paul is in the midst of his friends at 
 C&aelig;sarea--they comforts to him, and he a blessing to them. But here we
 are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How Paul was shipped off for Italy: a long voyage, but there is no 
 remedy. He has appealed to C&aelig;sar, and to C&aelig;sar he must go: <I>It was
 determined that we should sail into Italy,</I> for to Rome they must go 
 by sea; it would have been a vast way about to go by land. Hence, when 
 the Roman conquest of the Jewish nation is foretold, it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:24">Num. xxiv. 24</A>),

 <I>Ships shall come from Chittim,</I> that is, <I>Italy, and shall
 afflict Eber,</I> that is, the Hebrews. It was determined by the
 counsel of God, before it was determined by the counsel of Festus, that
 Paul should go to Rome; for, whatever man intended, God had work for
 him to do there. Now here we are told,

 1. Whose custody he was committed to--to <I>one named Julius, a
 centurion of Augustus's band,</I> as Cornelius was of the Italian band,
 or legion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:1"><I>ch.</I> x. 1</A>.

 He had soldiers under him, who were a guard upon Paul, that he might
 not make his escape, and likewise to protect him, that he might have no 
 mischief done him. 

 2. What bottom he embarked in: they went on board a ship of Adramyttium

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 a sea-port of Africa, whence this ship brought African goods, and, as
 it should seem, made a coasting voyage for Syria, where those goods 
 came to a good market. 

 3. What company he had in this voyage, there were some prisoners who
 were committed to the custody of the same centurion, and who probably 
 had appealed to C&aelig;sar too, or were upon some other account 
 removed to Rome, to be tried there, or to be examined as witnesses 
 against some prisoners there; perhaps some notorious offenders, like 
 Barabbas, who were therefore ordered to be brought before the emperor 
 himself. Paul was linked with these, as Christ with the thieves that 
 were crucified with him, and was obliged to take his lot with them in
 this voyage; and we find in this chapter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>)

 that for their sakes he had like to have been killed, but for his sake 
 they were preserved. Note, It is no new thing for the innocent to be 
 numbered among the transgressors. But he had also some of his friends 
 with him, Luke particularly, the penman of this book, for he puts 
 himself in all along, <I>We</I> sailed into Italy, and, <I>We</I> 
 launched, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Aristarchus a Thessalonian is particularly named, as being now in his 
 company. Dr. Lightfoot thinks that Trophimus the Ephesian went off with 
 him, but that he left him sick at Miletum

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:20">2 Tim. iv. 20</A>),

 when he passed by those coasts of Asia mentioned here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and that there likewise he left Timothy. It was a comfort to Paul to 
 have the society of some of his friends in this tedious voyage, with 
 whom he might converse freely, though he had so much loose profane 
 company about him. Those that go long voyages at sea are commonly 
 necessitated to sojourn, as it were, in Mesech and Kedar, and have need 
 of wisdom, that they may do good to the bad company they are in, may 
 make them better, or at lest be made never the worse by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What course they steered, and what places they touched at, which 
 are particularly recorded for the confirming of the truth of the 
 history to those who lived at that time, and could by their own 
 knowledge tell of their being at such and such a place. 

 1. They touched at Sidon, not far off from where they went on board;
 thither they came <I>the next day.</I> And that which is observable 
 here is, that <I>Julius the centurion</I> was extraordinarily civil to 
 Paul. It is probable that he knew his case, and was one of the <I>chief 
 captains, or principal men,</I> that heard him plead his own cause 
 before Agrippa

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:23"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 23</A>),

 and was convinced of his innocency, and the injury done him; and
 therefore, though Paul was committed to him as a prisoner, he treated 
 him as a friend, as a scholar, as a gentleman, and as a man that had an 
 interest in heaven: He <I>gave him liberty,</I> while the business of 
 the ship detained it at Sidon, <I>to go among his friends</I> there, to 
 <I>refresh himself;</I> and it would be a great refreshment to him. 
 Julius herein gives an example to those in power to be respectful to 
 those whom they find worthy of their respect, and in using their power 
 to make a difference. A Joseph, a Paul, are not to be used as common 
 prisoners. God herein encourages those that suffer for him to trust in 
 him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to befriend them from 
 whom they least expect it--can cause them to be pitied, nay, can cause 
 them to be prized and valued, even in the eyes of those that carry them 
 captive, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:46">Ps. cvi. 46</A>.

 And it is likewise an instance of Paul's fidelity. He did not go about
 to make his escape, which he might have easily done; but, being out 
 upon his parole of honour, he faithfully returns to his imprisonment. 
 If the centurion is so civil as to take his word, he is so just and 
 honest as to keep his word. 
 
 2. They thence <I>sailed under Cyprus,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 If the wind had been fair, they had gone forward by direct sailing, and
 had left Cyprus on the right hand; but, the wind not favouring them, 
 they were driven to oblique sailing with a side wind, and so compassed 
 the island, in a manner, and left it on the left hand. Sailors must do 
 as they can, when they cannot do as they would, and make the best of 
 their wind, whatever point it is in; so must we all in our passage over 
 the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary yet we must be 
 getting forward as well as we can. 

 3. At a port called Myra they changed their ship; that which they were
 in, it is probable, having business no further, they went on board a 
 vessel of Alexandria bound for Italy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Alexandria was now the chief city of Egypt, and great trading there was 
 between that city and Italy; from Alexandria they carried corn to Rome, 
 and the East-India goods and Persian which they imported at the Red Sea 
 they exported again to all parts of the Mediterranean, and especially 
 to Italy. And it was a particular favour shown to the Alexandrian ships 
 in the ports of Italy that they were not obliged to strike sail, as 
 other ships were, when they came into port.

 4. With much ado they made <I>The Fair Havens,</I> a port of the island
 of Crete,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 They <I>sailed slowly many days,</I> being becalmed, or having the wind 
 against them. It was a great while before they made the point of 
 Cnidus, a port of Caria, and were forced to sail under Crete, as before 
 under Cyprus; much difficulty they met with in passing by Salmone, a 
 promontory on the eastern shore of the island of Crete. Though the
 voyage hitherto was not tempestuous, yet it was very tedious. They many 
 that are not driven backward in their affairs by cross providences, yet 
 sail slowly, and do not get forward by favourable providences. And many 
 good Christians make this complaint in the concerns of their souls, 
 that they do not rid ground in their way of heaven, but have much ado 
 to keep their ground; they move with many stops and pauses, and lie a 
 great while wind-bound. Observe, The place they came to was called 
 <I>The Fair Havens.</I> Travellers say that it is known to this day by 
 the same name, and that it answers the name from the pleasantness of 
 its situation and prospect. And yet,

 (1.) It was not the harbour they were bound for; it was a fair haven, 
 but it was not their haven. Whatever agreeable circumstances we may be
 in in this world, we must remember we are not at home, and therefore we 
 must arise and depart; for, though it be a fair haven, it is not the 
 desired haven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:30">Ps. cvii. 30</A>.

 (2.) It was not a <I>commodious haven to winter in,</I> so it is said,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It had a fine prospect, but it lay exposed to the weather. Note, Every
 fair haven is not a safe haven; nay, there may be most danger where 
 there is most pleasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What advice Paul gave them with reference to that part of their 
 voyage they had before them--it was to be content to winter where they
 were, and not to think of stirring till a better season of the year. 

 1. It was now a bad time for sailing; they had lost a deal of time
 while they were struggling with contrary winds. Sailing was now 
 dangerous, because <I>the fast was already past,</I> that is, the 
 famous yearly fast of the Jews, the day of atonement, which was on the 
 tenth day of the seventh month, <I>a day to afflict the soul</I> with 
 fasting; it was about the 20th of our September. That yearly fast was 
 very religiously observed; but (which is strange) we never have any 
 mention made in all the scripture history of the observance of it, 
 unless it be meant here, where it serves only to describe the season of 
 the year. Michaelmas is reckoned by mariners as a bad time of the year
 to be at sea as any other; they complain of their Michaelmas-blasts; it 
 was that time now with these distressed voyagers. <I>The harvest was
 past, the summer was ended;</I> they had not only lost time, but lost 
 the opportunity.

 2. Paul put them in mind of it, and gave them notice of their danger

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>I perceive</I>" (either by notice from God, or by observing their
 wilful resolution to prosecute the voyage notwithstanding the peril of 
 the season) "that <I>this voyage will be with hurt and damage;</I> you 
 that have effects on board are likely to lose them, and it will be a 
 miracle of mercy if our lives be given us for a prey." There were some 
 good men in the ship, and many more bad men: but in things of this 
 nature <I>all things come alike to all,</I> and <I>there is one event 
 to the righteous and to the wicked.</I> If both be in the same ship,
 they both are in the same danger. 

 3. They would not be advised by Paul in this matter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They thought him impertinent in interposing in an affair of this
 nature, who did not understand navigation; and the centurion to whom it 
 was referred to determine it, though himself a passenger, yet, being a 
 man in authority, takes upon him to overrule, though he had not been 
 oftener at sea perhaps than Paul, nor was better acquainted with these 
 seas, for Paul had planted the gospel in Crete

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:5">Tit. i. 5</A>),

 and knew the several parts of the island well enough. But the centurion 
 gave more regard to the opinion of the master and owner of the ship 
 than to Paul's; for every man is to be credited in his own profession 
 ordinarily: but such a man as Paul, who was so intimate with Heaven, 
 was rather to be regarded in seafaring matters than the most celebrated 
 sailors. Note, Those know not what dangers they run themselves into who 
 will be governed more by human prudence than by divine revelation. The 
 centurion was very civil to Paul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and yet would not be governed by his advice. Note, Many will show 
 respect to good ministers that will not take their advice,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the
 more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they
 might attain to Phenice, <I>and there</I> to winter; <I>which is</I> an
 haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.
 &nbsp; 13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
 obtained <I>their</I> purpose, loosing <I>thence,</I> they sailed close by
 Crete.
 &nbsp; 14 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous
 wind, called Euroclydon.
 &nbsp; 15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
 wind, we let <I>her</I> drive.
 &nbsp; 16 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda,
 we had much work to come by the boat:
 &nbsp; 17 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding
 the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands,
 strake sail, and so were driven.
 &nbsp; 18 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next
 <I>day</I> they lightened the ship;
 &nbsp; 19 And the third <I>day</I> we cast out with our own hands the
 tackling of the ship.
 &nbsp; 20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no
 small tempest lay on <I>us,</I> all hope that we should be saved was
 then taken away.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The ship putting to sea again, and pursuing her voyage at first with 
 a promising gale. Observe, 

 1. What induced them to leave the fair havens: it was because they
 thought the harbour not <I>commodious to winter in;</I> it was pleasant 
 enough in summer but in the winter they lay bleak. Or perhaps it was 
 upon some other account incommodious; provisions perhaps were scarce 
 and dear there; and they ran upon a mischief to avoid an inconvenience, 
 as we often do. Some of the ship's crew, or of the council that was 
 called to advise in this matter, were for staying there, rather than 
 venturing to sea now that the weather was so uncertain: it is better to 
 be safe in an incommodious harbour than to be lost in a tempestuous 
 sea. But they were outvoted when it was put to the question, and the 
 <I>greater part advised to depart thence also;</I> yet they aimed not 
 to go far, but only to another port of the same island, here called 
 <I>Phenice,</I> and some think it was so called because the Phenicians 
 frequented it much, the merchants of Tyre and Sidon. It is here 
 described to lie towards the south-west and north-west. Probably the 
 haven was between the two promontories or juttings-out of land into the 
 sea, one of which pointed to the north-west and the other to the 
 south-west, by which it was guarded against the east winds. Thus hath 
 the wisdom of the Creator provided for the relief and safety of those 
 who <I>go down to the sea in ships, and do business in great 
 waters.</I> In vain had nature provided for us the waters to sail on, 
 if it had not likewise provided for us natural harbours to take shelter 
 in.

 2. What encouragement they had at first to pursue their voyage. They
 set out with a fair wind

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 the <I>south wind blew softly,</I> upon which they should gain their
 point, and so they sailed close by the coast of Crete and were not 
 afraid of running upon the rocks or quicksands, because the wind blew 
 so gently. Those who put to sea with ever so fair a gale know not what
 storms they may yet meet with, and therefore must not be secure, nor 
 take it for granted that they have obtained their purpose, when so many 
 accidents may happen to cross their purpose. <I>Let not him that 
 girdeth on the harness boast as though he had put it off.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ship in a storm presently, a dreadful storm. They looked at 
 second causes, and took their measures from the favourable hints they 
 gave, and imagined that because the south wind now blew softly it would 
 always blow so; in confidence of this, they ventured to sea, but were 
 soon made sensible of their folly in giving more credit to a smiling 
 wind than to the word of God in Paul's mouth, by which they had fair 
 warning given them of a storm. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What their danger and distress was, 

 (1.) There <I>arose against them a tempestuous wind,</I> which was not 
 only contrary to them, and directly in their teeth, so that they could 
 not get forward, but a violent wind, which raised the waves, like that 
 which was sent forth in pursuit of Jonah, though Paul was following 
 God, and going on in his duty, and not as Jonah running away from God 
 and his duty. This wind the sailors called <I>Euroclydon,</I> a 
 north-east wind, which upon those seas perhaps was observed to be in a 
 particular manner troublesome and dangerous. It was a sort of 
 whirlwind, for the ship is said to be caught by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It was God that commanded this wind to rise, designing to bring glory 
 to himself, and reputation to Paul, out of it; stormy winds being 
 brought <I>out of his treasuries</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:7">Ps. cxxxv. 7</A>),
 
 they <I>fulfil his word,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:8">Ps. cxlviii. 8</A>.

 (2.) The ship was <I>exceedingly tossed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 it was kicked like a football from wave to wave; its passengers (as it 
 is elegantly described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:26,27">Ps. cvii. 26, 27</A>)

 <I>mount up to the heavens, go down again to the depths, reel to and 
 fro, stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.</I> The 
 ship could not possibly <I>bear up into the wind,</I> could not make 
 her way in opposition to the wind; and therefore they folded up their 
 sails, which in such a storm would endanger them rather than to them 
 any service, and so <I>let the ship drive, Not whither it would, but 
 whither it was impelled by the impetuous waves--Non quo voluit, sed quo 
 rapit impetus und&aelig;.</I> Ovid. Trist. It is probable that they 
 were very near the heaven of Phenice when this tempest arose, and 
 thought they should presently be in a quiet haven, and were pleasing 
 themselves with the thought of it, and wintering there, and lo, of a 
 sudden, they are in this distress. Let us therefore always rejoice
 with trembling, and never expect a perfect security, nor a perpetual 
 security, till we come to heaven.

 (3.) They saw neither sun nor stars for many days. This made the 
 tempest the more terrible, that they were all in the dark; and the use 
 of the loadstone for the direction of sailors not being then found out 
 (so that they had no guide at all, when they could see neither sun nor 
 stars) made the case the more hazardous. Thus melancholy sometimes is 
 the condition of the people of God upon a spiritual account. They 
 <I>walk in darkness and have no light.</I> Neither sun nor stars 
 appear; they cannot dwell, nay, they cannot fasten, upon any thing 
 comfortable or encouraging; thus it may be with them, and yet light is 
 sown for them. 

 (4.) They had abundance of winter-weather: <I>No small 
 tempest</I>--<B><I>cheimon ouk oligos,</I></B> cold rain, and snow, and 
 all the rigours of that season of the year, so that they were ready to 
 perish for cold; and all this continued many days. See what hardships 
 those often undergo who are much at sea, besides the hazards of life 
 they run; and yet to get gain there are still those who make nothing of 
 all this; and it is an instance of divine Providence that it disposes 
 some to this employment, notwithstanding the difficulties that attend 
 it, for the keeping up of commerce among the nations, and the isles of 
 the Gentiles particularly; and Zebulun can as heartily rejoice in his 
 going out as Issachar in his tents. Perhaps Christ therefore chose 
 ministers from among seafaring men, because they had been used to 
 endure hardness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What means they used for their own relief: they betook themselves to 
 all the poor shifts (for I can call them no better) that sailors in 
 distress have recourse to. 

 (1.) When they could not make head against the wind, they let the ship 
 run adrift, finding it was to no purpose to ply either the oar or the 
 sail. When it is fruitless to struggle, it is wisdom to yield. 

 (2.) They nevertheless did what they could to avoid the present danger; 
 there was a little island called Clauda, and when they were near that, 
 though they could not pursue their voyage, they took care to prevent 
 their shipwreck, and therefore so ordered their matters that they did 
 not run against the island, but quietly ran under it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 (3.) When they were afraid they should scarcely save the ship, they
 were busy to save the boat, which they did with much ado. They had
 <I>much work to come by the boat</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 but at last they took it up,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 This might be of use in any exigence, and therefore they made hard 
 shift to get it into the ship to them. 

 (4.) They used means which were proper enough in those times, when the 
 art of navigation was far short of the perfection it is now come to; 
 they <I>undergirded the ship,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 They bound the ship under the bottom of it with strong cables, to keep 
 it from bulging in the extremity of the tempest.

 (5.) For fear of falling <I>into the quicksands</I> they <I>struck 
 sail,</I> and then let the ship go as it would. It is strange how a 
 ship will live at sea (so they express it), even in very stormy 
 weather, if it have but sea-room; and, when the sailors cannot make the 
 shore, it is their interest to keep as far off it as they can. 

 (6.) The next day they lightened the ship of its cargo, threw the goods 
 and the merchandises overboard (as Jonah's mariners did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>),

 being willing rather to be poor without them than to perish with them.
 <I>Skin for skin, and all that a man has, will he give for his 
 life.</I> See what the wealth of this world is; how much soever it is 
 courted as a blessing, the time may come when it will be a burden, not 
 only too heavy to be carried safe of itself, but heavy enough to sink 
 him that has it. Riches are often <I>kept by the owners thereof to 
 their hurt</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:13">Eccl. v. 13</A>);

 and parted with to their good. But see the folly of the children of
 this world, they can be thus prodigal of their goods when it is for the 
 saving of their lives, and yet how sparing of them in works of piety 
 and charity, and in suffering for Christ, though they are told by 
 eternal Truth itself that those shall be recompensed more than a 
 thousand fold <I>in the resurrection of the just.</I> Those went upon a 
 principle of faith who <I>took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, 
 knowing in themselves that they had in heaven a better and a more 
 enduring substance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:34">Heb. x. 34</A>.

 Any man will rather make shipwreck of his goods than of his life; but 
 many will rather make <I>shipwreck of faith and a good conscience</I> 
 than of their goods.

 (7.) The third day they <I>cast out the tacklings of the ship</I>--the
 utensils of it, <I>Armamenta</I> (so some render it), as if it were a 
 ship of force. With us it is common to heave the guns over-board in
 the extremity of a storm; but what heavy artillery they had then which 
 it was necessary to lighten the ship of I do not know; and I question 
 whether it was not then a vulgar error among seamen thus to throw every 
 thing into the sea, even that which would be of great use in a storm, 
 and no great weight.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The despair which at last they were brought to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>All hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</I> The storm 
 continued, and they saw no symptoms of its abatement; we have known 
 very blustering weather to continue for some weeks. The means they had
 used were ineffectual, so that they were at their wits' end; and such 
 was the consternation that this melancholy prospect put them into that 
 they had no heart either to eat or drink. They had provision enough on 
 board 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 but such bondage were they under, through fear of death, that they 
 could not admit the supports of life. Why did not Paul, by the power of 
 Christ, and in his name, lay this storm? Why did he not say to the 
 winds and waves, <I>Peace, be still,</I> as his Master had done?
 Surely it was because the apostles wrought miracles for the 
 confirmation of their doctrine, not for the serving of a turn for 
 themselves or their friends.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of
 them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not
 have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
 &nbsp; 22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be
 no loss of <I>any man's</I> life among you, but of the ship.
 &nbsp; 23 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I
 am, and whom I serve,
 &nbsp; 24 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before C&aelig;sar:
 and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
 &nbsp; 25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that
 it shall be even as it was told me.
 &nbsp; 26 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
 &nbsp; 27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up
 and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they
 drew near to some country;
 &nbsp; 28 And sounded, and found <I>it</I> twenty fathoms: and when they
 had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found <I>it</I>
 fifteen fathoms.
 &nbsp; 29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they
 cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
 &nbsp; 30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when
 they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though
 they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
 &nbsp; 31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these
 abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
 &nbsp; 32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her
 fall off.
 &nbsp; 33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought <I>them</I> all to
 take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have
 tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
 &nbsp; 34 Wherefore I pray you to take <I>some</I> meat: for this is for
 your health: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of
 any of you.
 &nbsp; 35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks
 to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken <I>it,</I> he
 began to eat.
 &nbsp; 36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took <I>some</I>
 meat.
 &nbsp; 37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
 sixteen souls.
 &nbsp; 38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and
 cast out the wheat into the sea.
 &nbsp; 39 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they
 discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were
 minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
 &nbsp; 40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed
 <I>themselves</I> unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and
 hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.
 &nbsp; 41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the
 ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained
 unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of
 the waves.
 &nbsp; 42 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest
 any of them should swim out, and escape.
 &nbsp; 43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from
 <I>their</I> purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should
 cast <I>themselves</I> first <I>into the sea,</I> and get to land:
 &nbsp; 44 And the rest, some on boards, and some on <I>broken pieces</I> of
 the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to
 land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the issue of the distress of Paul and his 
 fellow-travellers; they escaped with their lives and that was all, and
 that was for Paul's sake. We are here told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>)

 what number there were on board--mariners, merchants, soldiers, 
 prisoners, and other passengers, in all two hundred and seventy-six 
 souls; this is taken notice of to make us the more concerned for them 
 in reading the story, that they were such a considerable number, whose 
 lives were now in the utmost jeopardy, and one Paul among them worth 
 more than all the rest. We left them in despair, giving up themselves
 for gone. Whether they <I>called every man on his God,</I> as Jonah's 
 mariners did, we are not told; it is well if this laudable practice in 
 a storm was not gone out of fashion and made a jest of. However, Paul 
 among these seamen was not, like Jonah among his, the cause of the 
 storm, but the comforter in the storm, and as much a credit to the 
 profession of an apostle as Jonah was a blemish to the character of a 
 prophet. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The encouragement Paul gave them, by assuring them, in the name of 
 God, that their lives should all be saved, even when, in human 
 appearance, all hope that they should be saved was taken away. Paul 
 rescued them from their despair first, that they might not die of that, 
 and starve themselves in that, and then they were in a fair way to be 
 rescued from their distress. <I>After long abstinence,</I> as if they 
 were resolved not to eat till they knew whether they should live or 
 die, <I>Paul stood forth in the midst of them.</I> During the distress 
 hitherto Paul hid himself among them, was one of the crowd, helped with 
 the rest to <I>throw out the tackling</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 but now he distinguished himself, and, though a prisoner, undertook to 
 be their counsellor and comforter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He reproves them for not taking his advice, which was to stay where 
 they were, in the road of Lasea 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>You should have hearkened to me and not have loosed from Crete,</I> 
 where we might have made a shift to winter well enough, and then we 
 should not have <I>gained this harm and loss,</I> that is, we should 
 have escaped them." Harm and loss in the world, if sanctified to us, 
 may be truly said to be gain; for if they wean us from present things, 
 and awaken us to think of a future state, we are truly gainers by them. 
 Observe, They did not hearken to Paul when he warned them of their 
 danger, and yet if they will but acknowledge their folly, and repent of 
 it, he will speak comfort and relief to them now that they are in 
 danger, so compassionate is God to those that are in misery, though 
 they bring themselves into it by their own incogitancy, nay, by their 
 own wilfulness, and contempt of admonition. Paul, before administering 
 comfort, will first make them sensible of their sin in not hearkening 
 to him, by upbraiding them with their rashness, and probably, when he 
 tells them of their gaining harm and loss, he reflects upon what they 
 promised themselves by proceeding on their voyage, that they should 
 gain so much time, gain this and the other point: "But," says he, "you 
 have gained nothing but harm and loss; how will you answer it?" That 
 which they are blamed for is their loosing from Crete, where they were 
 safe. Note, Most people bring themselves into inconvenience, because 
 they do not know when they are well off, but gain harm and loss by 
 aiming against advice to better themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He assures them that though they should lose the ship yet they 
 should none of them lose their lives: "You see your folly in not being 
 ruled by me:" he does not say, "Now therefore expect to fare 
 accordingly, you may thank yourselves if you be all lost, those that 
 will not be counselled cannot be helped." No, "Yet now there is hope in 
 Israel concerning this thing; your case is sad, but it is not 
 desperate, now, <I>I exhort you to be of good cheer.</I>" Thus we say 
 to sinners that are convinced of their sin and folly, and begin to see 
 and bewail their error, "<I>You should have hearkened unto us,</I> and 
 should have had nothing to do with sin; yet now we <I>exhort you to be 
 of good cheer:</I> though you would not take our advice when we said, 
 <I>Do not presume,</I> yet take it now when we say, <I>Do not 
 despair.</I>" They had given up the cause, and would use no further 
 means, because <I>all hope that they should be saved was taken 
 away.</I> Now Paul quickens them to bestir themselves yet in working 
 for their own safety, by telling them that it they would resume their 
 vigour they should secure their lives. He gives them this assurance 
 when they were brought to the last extremity, for now it would be 
 doubly welcome to them to be told that not a life should be lost when 
 they were ready to conclude they must inevitably be all lost. He tells 
 them, 

 (1.) That they must count upon the loss of the ship. Those who were 
 interested in that and the goods were probably those greater part that 
 were for pushing forward the voyage and running the venture, 
 notwithstanding Paul's admonition, and they are made to pay for their 
 rashness. Their ship shall be wrecked. Many a stately, strong, rich, 
 gallant ship is lost in the mighty waters in a little time; <I>for 
 vanity of vanities, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</I> But, 

 (2.) <I>Not a life shall be lost.</I> This would be good news to those 
 that were ready to die for fear of dying, and whose guilty consciences 
 made death look very terrible to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He tells them what ground he had for this assurance, that it is not 
 a banter upon them, to put them into humour, nor a human conjecture, he 
 has a divine revelation for it, and is as confident of it as that God 
 is true, being fully satisfied that he has his word for it. An angel of 
 the Lord appeared to him in the night, and told him that for his sake 
 they should all be preserved 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:23-25"><I>v.</I> 23-25</A>),

 which would double the mercy of their preservation, that they should
 have it not only by providence, but by promise, and as a particular 
 favour to Paul. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The solemn profession Paul makes of relation to God, the God from 
 whom he had this favourable intelligence: It is he <I>whose I am, and 
 whom I serve.</I> He looks upon God, 

 [1.] As his rightful owner, who has a sovereign incontestable title to 
 him, and dominion over him: <I>Who I am.</I> Because God made us and 
 not we ourselves, therefore we are not our own but his. His we are by 
 creation, for he made us; by preservation, for he maintains us; by 
 redemption, for he bought us. We are more his than our own. 

 [2.] As his sovereign ruler and master, who, having given him being, 
 has right to give him law: <I>Whom I serve.</I> Because his we are, 
 therefore we are bound to serve him, to devote ourselves to his honour 
 and employ ourselves in his work. It is Christ that Paul here has an 
 eye to; he is God, and the angels are his and go on his errands. Paul 
 often calls himself a <I>servant of Jesus Christ;</I> he is his, and 
 him he serves, both as a Christian and as an apostle; he does not say, 
 "Whose <I>we</I> are, and whom we serve," for most that were present 
 were strangers to him, but, "Whose <I>I am,</I> and whom <I>I 
 serve,</I> whatever others do; nay, whom I am now in the actual service 
 of, going to Rome, not as you are, upon worldly business, but to appear 
 as a witness for Christ." Now this he tells the company, that, seeing 
 their relief coming from his God whose he was and whom he served, they 
 might thereby be drawn in to take him for their God, and to serve him 
 likewise; for the same reason Jonah said to his mariners, <I>I fear the 
 Lord, the God of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:9">Jonah i. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The account he gives of the vision he had: <I>There stood by me 
 this night an angel of God,</I> a divine messenger who used formerly to 
 bring him messages from heaven; he <I>stood by him,</I> visibly 
 appeared to him, probably when he was awake upon his bed. Though he was 
 <I>afar off upon the sea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:5">Ps. lxvi. 5</A>),

 <I>on the uttermost parts of the sea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:9">Ps. cxxxix. 9</A>),

 yet this could not intercept his communion with God, nor deprive him of 
 the benefit of divine visits. Thence he can direct a prayer to God, and 
 thither God can direct an angel to him. He knows not where he is
 himself, yet God's angel knows where to find him out. The <I>ship is 
 tossed</I> with winds and waves, hurried to and fro with the utmost 
 violence, and yet the angel finds a way into it. No storms nor tempests 
 can hinder the communications of God's favour to his people, for he is 
 a very present help, a help at hand, even when the <I>sea roars and is 
 troubled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:1,3">Ps. xlvi. 1, 3</A>.

 We may suppose that Paul, being a prisoner, had not a cabin of his own
 in the ship, much less a bed in the captain's cabin, but was put down 
 into the hold (any dark or dirty place was thought good enough for him 
 in common with the rest of the prisoners), and yet there the angel of 
 God stood by him. Meanness and poverty set none at a distance from God
 and his favour. Jacob, when he has no pillow but a stone, no curtains
 but the clouds, yet has a vision of angels. Paul had this vision but 
 <I>this last night.</I> He had himself been assured by a former vision 
 that he should go to Rome

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:11"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 11</A>),

 from which he might infer that he himself should be safe; but he has
 this fresh vision to assure him of the safety of those with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The encouragements that were given him in the vision, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 [1.] He is forbidden to fear. Though all about him are at their wits' 
 end, and lost in despair, yet, <I>Fear not, Paul;</I> fear not <I>their 
 fear, nor be afraid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:12">Isa. viii. 12</A>.

 Let the <I>sinners in Zion be afraid,</I> but let not the saints be
 afraid, no, not at sea, in a storm; for <I>the Lord of hosts is with 
 them,</I> and their <I>place of defence shall be the munitions of 
 rocks,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:14-16">Isa. xxxiii. 14-16</A>.

 [2.] He is assured that for his part he shall come safely to Rome:
 <I>Thou must be brought before C&aelig;sar.</I> As the rage of the most
 potent enemies, so the rage of the most stormy sea, cannot prevail 
 against God's witnesses till they have finished their testimony. Paul 
 must be preserved in this danger, for he is reserved for further 
 service. This is comfortable for the faithful servants of God in 
 straits and difficulties, that as long as God has any work for them to 
 do their lives shall be prolonged. 

 [3.] That for his sake all that were in the ship with him should be 
 delivered too from perishing in this storm: <I>God hath given thee all 
 those that sail with thee.</I> The angel that was ordered to bring him 
 this message could have singled him out from this wretched crew, and 
 those that were his friends too, and have carried them safely to shore, 
 and have left the rest to perish, because they would not take Paul's 
 counsel. But God chooses rather, by preserving them all for his sake, 
 to show what great blessings good men are to the world, than by 
 delivering him only to show how good men are distinguished from the 
 world. <I>God has given thee all those that sail with thee,</I> that 
 is, spares them in answer to thy prayers, or for thy sake. Sometimes 
 good men deliver <I>neither sons nor daughters, but their own souls 
 only,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:18">Ezek. xiv. 18</A>.

 But Paul here delivers a whole ship's crew, almost three hundred souls.
 Note, God often spares wicked people for the sake of the godly; as Zoar 
 for Lot's sake, and as Sodom might have been, if there had been ten 
 righteous persons in it. The good people are hated and persecuted in 
 the world as if they were not worthy to live in it, yet really it is 
 for their sakes that the world stands. If Paul had thrust himself 
 needlessly into bad company, he might justly have been cast away with 
 them, but, God calling him into it, they are preserved with him. And it 
 is intimated that it was a great favour to Paul, and he looked upon it 
 to be so, that others were saved for his sake: <I>They are given 
 thee.</I> There is no greater satisfaction to a good man than to know 
 that he is a public blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He comforts them with the same comforts wherewith he himself was 
 comforted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>Wherefore, Sirs, be of good cheer,</I> you shall see even this will 
 end well; <I>for I believe God,</I> and depend upon his word, <I>that 
 it shall be even as it was told me.</I>" He would not require them to 
 give credit to that to which he did not himself give credit; and 
 therefore solemnly professes that he believes it himself, and the 
 belief of it makes him easy: "I doubt not but it shall be as it was 
 told me." Thus he <I>staggers not at the promise of God through 
 unbelief. Hath God spoken, and shall he not make it good?</I> No doubt 
 he can, no doubt he will; for <I>he is not a man that he should 
 lie.</I> And shall it be as God hath said? Then be of good cheer, be of 
 good courage. God is ever faithful, and therefore let all that have an 
 interest in his promise be ever cheerful. If with God saying and doing
 are not two things, then with us believing and enjoying should not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He gives them a sign, telling them particularly what this 
 tempestuous voyage would issue in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>We must be cast upon a certain island,</I> and that will both break 
 the ship and save the passengers; and so the prediction in both 
 respects will be fulfilled." The pilot had quitted his post, the ship 
 was left to run at random, they knew not what latitude they were in, 
 much less how to steer their course; and yet Providence undertakes to 
 bring them to an island that shall be a refuge for them. When the
 church of God, like this ship, is <I>tossed with tempests, and not 
 comforted,</I> when <I>there is none to guide her of all her sons,</I> 
 yet God can bring her safely to shore, and will do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their coming at length to an anchor upon an unknown shore, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:27-29"><I>v.</I> 27-29</A>.

 1. They had been a full fortnight in the storm, continually expecting
 death: <I>The fourteenth night,</I> and not sooner, <I>they came near 
 land;</I> they were <I>that night driven up and down in Adria,</I> not 
 in the Adriatic Gulf on which Venice stands, but in the Adriatic Sea, a 
 part of the Mediterranean, containing both the Sicilian and Ionian 
 seas, and extending to the African shore; in this sea they were tossed, 
 and knew not whereabouts they were. 

 2. <I>About midnight the mariners apprehended that they drew near to
 some shore,</I> which confirmed what Paul had told them, that they must 
 be driven upon some island. To try whether it was so or no, <I>they 
 sounded,</I> in order to their finding the depth of the water, for the 
 water would be shallower as they drew nearer to shore; by the first 
 experiment <I>they found they drew twenty fathoms deep of water,</I> 
 and by <I>the next fifteen fathoms,</I> which was a demonstration that 
 they were near some shore; God has wisely ordered such a natural notice 
 to sailors in the dark, that they may be cautious. 

 3. They took the hint, and, fearing rocks near the shore, <I>they cast
 anchor, and wished for the day;</I> they durst not go forward for fear 
 of rocks, and yet would not go back in hope of shelter, but they would 
 wait for the morning, and heartily wished for it; who can blame them 
 when the affair came to a crisis? When they had light, there was no
 land to be seen; now that there was land near them, they had no light 
 to see it by; no marvel then they wished for day. When those that fear
 God <I>walk in darkness, and have no light,</I> yet let them not say, 
 <I>The Lord has forsaken us,</I> or, <I>Our God has forgotten us;</I> 
 but let them do as these mariners did, cast anchor, and wish for the 
 day, and be assured that the day will dawn. <I>Hope is an anchor of
 the soul, sure and stedfast, entering into that within the veil.</I> 
 Hold fast by that, think not of putting to sea again, but abide by 
 Christ, and wait till the day break, and the shadows flee away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The defeating of the sailors' attempt to quit the ship; here was a 
 new danger added to their distress, which they narrowly escaped. 
 Observe, 

 1. The treacherous design of the seamen, and that was to leave the
 sinking ship, which, though a piece of wisdom in others, yet in those 
 that were entrusted with the care of it was the basest fraud that could 
 be

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>They were about to flee out of the ship,</I> concluding no other 
 than that when it ran ashore it must be broken all to pieces; having 
 the command of the boat, the project was to get all of them into that, 
 and so save themselves, and leave all the rest to perish. To cover this 
 vile design, they pretended they would <I>cast anchors out of the 
 fore-ship,</I> or carry them further off, and in order to this <I>they 
 let down the boat,</I> which they had taken in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>),

 and were <I>going into it,</I> having agreed among themselves, when 
 they were in to make straight for the shore. The treacherous seamen are 
 like the treacherous shepherd, who flees when he sees the danger 
 coming, and there is most need of his help, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:12">John x. 12</A>.

 Thus true is that of Solomon, <I>Confidence in an unfaithful man in
 time of trouble is like a broken tooth or a foot out of joint.</I> Let 
 us therefore cease from man. Paul had, in God's name, assured them
 that they should come safely to land, but they will rather trust their 
 own refuge of lies than God's word and truth.

 2. Paul's discovery of it, and protestation against it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 They all saw them preparing to go into the boat, but were deceived by
 the pretence they made; only Paul saw through it, and gave notice to 
 the centurion and the soldiers concerning it, and told them plainly, 
 <I>Except these abide in the ship, you cannot be saved.</I> The skill 
 of a mariner is seen in a storm, and, in the distress of the ship, then 
 is the proper time for him to exert himself. Now the greatest
 difficulty of all was before them, and therefore the seamen were now 
 more necessary than ever yet; it was indeed not by any skill of theirs 
 <I>that they were brought to land,</I> for it was quite beyond their 
 skill, but, now that they are near land, they must use their art to 
 bring the ship to it. When God has done that for us which we could not, 
 we must then in his strength help ourselves. Paul speaks humanly, when 
 he says, <I>You cannot be saved except these abide in the ship;</I> and 
 he does not at all weaken the assurances he had divinely given that 
 they should infallibly be saved. God, who appointed the end, <I>that 
 they should be saved,</I> appointed the means, that they should be 
 saved by the help of these seamen; though, if they had gone off, no 
 doubt God would have made his word good some other way. Paul speaks as 
 a prudent man, not as a prophet, when he says, These are necessary to 
 your preservation. Duty is ours, events are God's; and we do not trust 
 God, but tempt him, when we say, "We put ourselves under his 
 protection," and do not use proper means, such as are within our power,
 for our own preservation. 

 3. The effectual defeat of it by the soldiers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 It was not time to stand arguing the case with the seamen, and
 therefore they made no more ado, <I>but cut the ropes of the boat,</I> 
 and though it might otherwise have done them service in their present 
 distress, they chose rather <I>to let it fall off,</I> and lose it, 
 than suffer it to do them this disservice. And now the seamen, being 
 forced to stay in the ship whether they would or no, are forced 
 likewise to work for the safety of the ship as hard as they could, 
 because if the rest perish they must perish with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The new life which Paul put into the company, by cheerfully 
 inviting them to take some refreshment, and by the repeated assurances 
 he gave them that they should all of them have their lives given them 
 for a prey. Happy they who had such a one as Paul in their company, who 
 not only had correspondence with Heaven, but was of a hearty lively 
 spirit with those about him, that sharpened the countenance of his 
 friend, as iron sharpens iron. Such a friend in distress, when 
 <I>without are fightings and within are fears,</I> is a friend indeed. 
 <I>Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart; so doth the sweetness of a 
 man's friend by hearty counsel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:9">Prov. xxvii. 9</A>.

 Such was Paul's here to his companions in tribulation. The day was 
 coming on: those that wish for the day, let them wait awhile, and they 
 shall have what they wish for. The dawning of the day revived them a 
 little, and then Paul got them together. 

 1. He chid them for their neglect of themselves, that they had so far 
 given way to fear and despair as to forget or not to mind their food: 
 <I>This is the fourteenth day that you have tarried, and continued 
 fasting, having taken nothing;</I> and that is not well,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Not that they had all, or any of them, continued fourteen days without 
 any food, but they had not had any set meal, as they used to have, all 
 that time; they ate very little, next to nothing. Or, "<I>You have 
 continued fasting,</I> that is, you have lost your stomach; you have 
 had no appetite at all to your food, nor any relish of it, through 
 prevailing fear and despair." A very disconsolate state is thus 
 expressed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:4">Ps. cii. 4</A>),

 <I>I forget to eat my bread.</I> It is a sin to starve the body, and to 
 deny it its necessary supports; he is an unnatural man indeed <I>that 
 hateth his own flesh, and does not nourish and cherish it;</I> and it 
 is a sore evil under the sun to have a sufficiency of the good things 
 of this life, and not to have power to use them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+6:2">Eccl. vi. 2</A>.

 If this arise from the sorrow of the world, and from any inordinate 
 fear or trouble, it is so far from excusing it that it is another sin, 
 it is discontent, it is distrust of God, it is all wrong. What folly is 
 it to die for fear of dying! But thus <I>the sorrow of the world works 
 death,</I> while joy in God is life and peace in the greatest 
 distresses and dangers.

 2. He courts them to their food

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):
 
 "<I>Wherefore I pray you to take some meat.</I> We have a hard struggle 
 before us, must get to shore as well as we can; if our bodies be weak 
 through fasting, we shall not be able to help ourselves." The angel 
 bade Elijah, <I>Arise and eat,</I> for otherwise he would find <I>the 
 journey too great for him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:7">1 Kings xix. 7</A>.

 So Paul will have these people eat, or otherwise the waves will be too
 hard for them: <I>I pray you,</I> <B><I>parakalo,</I></B> "<I>I exhort 
 you,</I> if you will be ruled by me, take some nourishment; though you 
 have no appetite to it, though you have fasted away your stomach, yet 
 let reason bring you to it, <I>for this is for your health,</I> or 
 rather <I>your preservation, or safety, at this time;</I> it is for 
 your salvation, you cannot without nourishment have strength to shift 
 for your lives." As <I>he that will not labour, let him not eat;</I> so 
 he that means to labour must eat. Weak and trembling Christians, that
 give way to doubts and fears about their spiritual state, continue 
 fasting from the Lord's supper, and fasting from divine consolations, 
 and then complain they cannot go on in their spiritual work and 
 warfare; and it is owing to themselves. If they would feed and feast as 
 they ought, upon the provision Christ has made for them, they would be 
 strengthened, and it would be for their souls' health and salvation.

 3. He assures them of their preservation: <I>There shall not a hair 
 fall from the head of any of you.</I> It is a proverbial expression, 
 denoting a complete indemnity. It is used 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:51,Lu+21:18">1 Kings i. 51; Luke xxi. 18</A>.

 "You cannot eat for fear of dying; I tell you, you are sure of living,
 and therefore eat. You will come to shore wet and cold, but sound wind 
 and limb; your hair wet, but not a hair lost."

 4. He himself spread their table for them; for none of them had any
 heart to do it, they were all so dispirited: <I>When he had thus 
 spoken, he took bread,</I> fetched it from the ship's stores, to which 
 every one might safely have access when none of them had an appetite. 
 They were not reduced to short allowance, as sailors sometimes are when 
 they are kept longer at sea than they expected by distress of weather; 
 they had plenty, but what good did that do them, when they had no 
 stomach? We have reason to be thankful to God that we have not only 
 food to our appetite, but appetite to our food; that our soul abhors 
 not even dainty meat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:20">Job xxxiii. 20</A>),

 through sickness or sorrow. 

 5. He was chaplain to the ship, and they had reason to be proud of 
 their chaplain. <I>He gave thanks to God in presence of them all.</I> 
 We have reason to think he had often prayed with Luke and Aristarchus, 
 and what others there were among them that were Christians, that they 
 prayed daily together; but whether he had before this prayed with the 
 whole company promiscuously is not certain. Now <I>he gave thanks to
 God, in presence of them all,</I> that they were alive, and had been 
 preserved hitherto, and that they had a promise that their lives should 
 be preserved in the imminent peril now before them; he gave thanks for 
 the provision they had, and begged a blessing upon it. We must <I>in 
 every thing give thanks;</I> and must particularly have an eye to God 
 in receiving our food, for <I>it is sanctified to us by the word of God 
 and prayer,</I> and is <I>to be received with thanksgiving.</I> Thus 
 the curse is taken off from it, and we obtain a covenant-right to it 
 and a covenant-blessing upon it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:3-5">1 Tim. iv. 3-5</A>.

 And <I>it is not by bread alone that man lives, but by the word of
 God,</I> which must be met with prayer. <I>He gave thanks in presence 
 of them all,</I> not only to show that he served a Master he was not 
 ashamed of, but to invite them into his service too. If we crave a 
 blessing upon our meat, and give thanks for it in a right manner, we 
 shall not only keep up a comfortable communion with God ourselves, but 
 credit our profession, and recommend it to the good opinion of others. 
 
 6. He set them a good example: <I>When he had given thanks, he broke
 the bread</I> (it was sea-biscuit) and <I>he began to eat.</I> Whether
 they would be encouraged or no, he would; if they would be sullen, and, 
 like froward children, refuse their victuals because they had not every 
 thing to their mind, he would eat his meat, and be thankful. Those that 
 teach others are inexcusable if they do not themselves do as they 
 teach, and the most effectual way of preaching is by example. 

 7. It had a happy influence upon them all

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>Then were they all of good cheer.</I> They then ventured to believe 
 the message God sent them by Paul when they plainly perceived that Paul 
 believed it himself, who was in the same common danger with them. Thus 
 God sends good tidings to the perishing world of mankind by those who 
 are of themselves, and in the same common danger with themselves, who 
 are sinners too, and must be saved, if ever they be saved, in the same 
 way in which they persuade others to venture; for it is a common 
 salvation which they bring the tidings of; and it is an encouragement 
 to people to commit themselves to Christ as their Saviour when those 
 who invite them to do so make it to appear that they do so themselves.
 It is here upon this occasion that the number of the persons is set 
 down, which we took notice of before: <I>they were in all two hundred 
 threescore and sixteen souls.</I> See how many may be influenced by the 
 good example of one. <I>They did all eat,</I> nay, <I>they did all eat
 enough</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 they were satiated with food, or filled with it; <I>they made a hearty 
 meal.</I> This explains the meaning of <I>their fasting before for 
 fourteen days;</I> not that they did not eat during all that time, but 
 they never had enough all that time, as they had now. 

 8. They once more lightened the ship, that it might escape the better
 in the shock it was now to have. They had before thrown <I>the wares 
 and the tackle overboard,</I> and now <I>the wheat,</I> the victuals 
 and provisions they had; better they should sink the food than that it 
 should sink them. See what good reason our Saviour had to call our 
 bodily food meat that perishes. We may ourselves be under a necessity 
 of throwing that away to save our lives which we had gathered and laid 
 up for the support of our lives. It is probable that the ship was
 overloaded with the multitude of the passengers (for this comes in just 
 after the account of the number of them) and that this obliged them so 
 often to lighten the ship.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Their putting to shore, and the staving of the ship in the 
 adventure. It was about break of day when they ate their meat, and when 
 it was quite day they began to look about them; and here we are told, 
 
 1. <I>That they knew not where they were;</I> they could not tell what 
 country it was they were now upon the coast of, whether it was Europe,
 Asia, or Africa, for each had shores washed by the Adriatic Sea. It is
 probable that these seamen had often sailed this way, and thought they
 knew every country they came near perfectly well, and yet here they
 were at a loss. <I>Let not the wise man then glory in his wisdom,</I>
 since it may perhaps fail him thus egregiously even in his own
 profession.

 2. <I>They observed a creek with a level shore, into which they hoped
 to thrust the ship,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 Though they knew not what country it was, nor whether the inhabitants
 were friends or foes, civil or barbarous, they determined to cast 
 themselves upon their mercy; it was dry land, which would be very 
 welcome to those that had been so long at sea. It was a pity but they 
 had had some help from the shore, a pilot sent them, that knew the 
 coast, who might steer their ship in, or another second ship, to take 
 some of the men on board. Those who live on the sea-coast have often 
 opportunity of succouring those who are in distress at sea, and of 
 saving precious lives, and they ought to do their utmost in order to 
 it, with all readiness and cheerfulness; for it is a great sin, and 
 very provoking to God, <I>to forbear to deliver those that are driven 
 unto death, and are ready to be slain;</I> and it will not serve for an 
 excuse to say, <I>Behold, we knew it not,</I> when either we did, or 
 might, and should, have <I>known</I> it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:11,12">Prov. xxiv. 11, 12</A>.

 I have been told there are some, and in our own nation too, who when 
 from the sea-coast they see a ship in distress and at a loss will, by 
 misguiding fires or otherwise, purposely lead them into danger, that 
 the lives may be lost, and they may have the plunder of the ship. One 
 can scarcely believe that any of the human species can possibly be so 
 wicked, so barbarously inhuman, and can have so much of the devil in 
 them; if there be, <I>let them know of a truth that they shall have 
 judgment without mercy who have shown no mercy.</I> 

 3. They made straight to the shore with wind and tide

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 <I>They took up the anchors, the four anchors which they cast out of
 the stern,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Some think that they took pains to weigh them up, hoping they should 
 have use for them again at the shore; others that they did it with such 
 precipitation that they were forced to cut the cables and leave them; 
 the original will admit either. <I>They then committed themselves to 
 the sea,</I> the wind standing fair to carry them into the port, and 
 <I>they loosed the rudder-bands,</I> which were fastened during the 
 storm for the greater steadiness of the ship, but, now that they were 
 <I>putting into the port, were loosed,</I> that the pilot might steer 
 with the greater freedom; <I>they then hoisted up the main-sail to the 
 wind, and made towards shore.</I> The original words here used for the 
 <I>rudder-bands</I> and the <I>main-sail</I> find the critics a great 
 deal of work to accommodate them to the modern terms; but they need not 
 give us any difficulty who are content to know that when they saw the 
 shore they hastened to it as fast as they could, and perhaps made more 
 haste than good speed. And should not a poor soul that has long been 
 struggling with winds and tempests in this world long to put into the 
 safe and quiet haven of everlasting rest? Should it not get clear from 
 all that which fastens it to this earth, and straitens the out-goings 
 of its pious and devout affections heavenward? And should it not hoist
 up the main-sail of faith to the wind of the Spirit, and so with 
 longing desires make to shore? 

 4. They made a shift among them <I>to run the ship aground,</I> in a
 shelf or bed of sand, as it should seem, or an isthmus, or neck of 
 land, washed with the sea on both sides, and therefore two seas are 
 said to meet upon it, and <I>there the forepart stuck fast;</I> and 
 then, when it had no liberty to play, as a ship has when it rides at 
 anchor, but remained immovable, <I>the hinder part</I> would soon be 
 broken of course <I>by the violence of the waves.</I> Whether the 
 seamen did not do their part, being angry that they were disappointed 
 in their design to escape, and therefore wilfully ran the ship aground, 
 or whether we may suppose that they did their utmost to save it, but 
 God in his providence overruled, for the fulfilling of Paul's word, 
 <I>that the ship must be lost</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 I cannot say; but this we are sure of <I>that God will confirm the word 
 of his servants, and perform the counsel of his messengers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xliv. 26</A>.

 The ship, that had strangely weathered the storm in the vast ocean,
 where it had room to roll, is dashed to pieces when it sticks fast. 
 Thus if the heart fixes in the world, in love and affection, and 
 adherence to it, it is lost. Satan's temptations beat against it, and 
 it is gone; but, as long as it keeps above the world, though it be 
 tossed with its cares and tumults, there is hope of it. They had the
 shore in view, and yet suffered shipwreck in the harbour, to teach us 
 never to be secure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. A particular danger that Paul and the rest of the prisoners were 
 in, besides their share in the common calamity, and their deliverance 
 from it. 

 1. In this critical moment, when every man hung in doubt of his life,
 <I>the soldiers advised the killing of the prisoners</I> that were 
 committed to their custody, and whom they were to give an account of, 
 <I>lest any of them should swim out and escape,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 There was no great danger of that, for they could not escape far, weak 
 and weary as they were; and, under the eye of so many soldiers that had 
 the charge of them, it was not likely they should attempt it; and if it 
 should so happen, though they might be obnoxious to the law for a 
 permissive escape, yet in such a case as this equity would certainly 
 relieve them. But it was a brutish barbarous motion, and so much the 
 worse that they were thus prodigal of other people's lives when without 
 a miracle of mercy they must lose their own. 

 2. The centurion, for Paul's sake, quashed this motion presently.
 Paul, who was his prisoner, had found favour with him, as Joseph with
 the captain of the guard. Julius, though he despised Paul's advice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 yet afterwards saw a great deal of cause to respect him, and therefore, 
 being <I>willing to save Paul,</I> he prevented the execution of that 
 bloody project, and <I>in favorem vit&aelig;--from a regard to his 
 life,</I> he kept them from their purpose. It does not appear that they 
 were any of them malefactors convicted, but only suspected, and waiting 
 their trial, and in such a case as this better ten guilty ones should 
 escape than one that was innocent be slain. As God had saved all in the 
 ship for Paul's sake, so here the centurion saves all the prisoners for 
 his sake; such a diffusive good is a good man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The saving of the lives of all the persons in the ship, by the
 wonderful providence of God. When the ship broke under them, surely
 <I>there was but a step between them and death;</I> and yet infinite
 mercy interposed, and that step was not stepped. 

 1. Some were saved by swimming: <I>The centurion commanded his
 soldiers</I> in the first place, <I>as many of them as could swim, to
 get to land</I> first, and to be ready to receive the prisoners, and
 prevent their escape. The Romans trained up their youth, among other
 exercises, to that of swimming, and it was often of service to them in
 their wars: Julius Caesar was a famous swimmer. It may be very useful
 to these who deal much at sea, but otherwise perhaps more lives have
 been lost by swimming in sport, and learning to swim, than have been
 saved by swimming for need. 

 2. The rest with much ado scrambled to the shore, some on boards that
 they had loose with them in the ship, and others on the <I>broken
 pieces of the ship,</I> every one making the best shift he could for
 himself and his friends, and the more busy because they were assured 
 their labour should not be in vain; but so <I>it came to pass</I> that 
 through the good providence of God none of them miscarried, none of 
 them were by accident turned off, but they <I>escaped all safely to 
 land.</I> See here an instance of the special providence of God in the 
 preservation of people's lives, and particularly in the deliverance of
 many from perils by water, ready to sink, and yet kept from sinking, 
 <I>the deep from swallowing them up and the water-floods from 
 overflowing them,</I> the storm turned into a calm. They were rescued 
 from the dreaded sea, and brought to the desired haven. O that men
 would praise the Lord for his goodness!
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:30,31">Ps. cviii. 30, 31</A>.

 Here was an instance of the performance of a particular word of promise
 which God gave, that all the persons in this ship should be saved for
 Paul's sake. Though there be great difficulty in the way of the
 promised salvation, yet it shall without fail be accomplished; and even
 the wreck of the ship may furnish out means for the saving of the
 lives, and, when all seems to be gone, all proves to be safe, though it
 be <I>on boards, and broken pieces of the ship.</I></P>
