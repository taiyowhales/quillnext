 we find a canonical epistle inscribed, principally, not only to a 
 single person, but to one also of the softer sex. And why not to one of 
 that sex? In gospel redemption, privilege, and dignity, <I>there is 
 neither male nor female;</I> they are both one <I>in Christ Jesus.</I> 
 Our Lord himself neglected his own repast, to commune with the woman of 
 Samaria, in order to show her the fountain of life; and, when almost 
 expiring upon the cross, he would with his dying lips bequeath his 
 blessed mother to the care of his beloved disciple, and thereby 
 instruct him to respect female disciples for the future. It was to one 
 of the same sex that our Lord chose to appear first after his return 
 from the grave, and to send by her the news of his resurrection to this 
 as well as to the other apostles; and we find afterwards a zealous 
 Priscilla so well acquitting herself in her Christian race, and 
 particularly in some hazardous service towards the apostle Paul, that 
 she is not only often mentioned before her husband, but to her as well 
 as to him, not only the apostle himself, but also all the Gentile 
 churches, were ready to return their thankful acknowledgments. No 
 wonder then that a heroine in the Christian religion, honoured by 
 divine providence, and distinguished by divine grace, should be 
 dignified also by an apostolical epistle.</P>
