 In this chapter the apostle condemns a sinful regarding of the rich, 
 and despising the poor, which he imputes to partiality and injustice, 
 and shows it to be an acting contrary to God, who has chosen the poor, 
 and whose interest is often persecuted, and his name blasphemed, by the 
 rich, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 He shows that the whole law is to be fulfilled, and that mercy should
 be followed, as well as justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:8-13">ver. 8-13</A>.

 He exposes the error and folly of those who boast of faith without
 works, telling us that this is but a dead faith, and such a faith as 
 devils have, not the faith of Abraham, or of Rahab,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,
 <I>the Lord</I> of glory, with respect of persons.
 &nbsp; 2  For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring,
 in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile
 raiment;
 &nbsp; 3  And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and
 say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor,
 Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
 &nbsp; 4  Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges
 of evil thoughts?
 &nbsp; 5  Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of
 this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath
 promised to them that love him?
 &nbsp; 6  But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you,
 and draw you before the judgment seats?
 &nbsp; 7  Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are
 called?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle is here reproving a very corrupt practice. He shows how 
 much mischief there is in the sin of 
 <B><I>prosopolepsia</I></B>--<I>respect of persons,</I> which seemed to
 be a very growing evil in the churches of Christ even in those early 
 ages, and which, in these after-times, has sadly corrupted and divided 
 Christian nations and societies. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A caution against this sin laid down in general: <I>My brethren, 
 have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with 
 respect of persons,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 Observe here, 

 1. The character of Christians fully implied: they are such as have the 
 faith of our Lord Jesus Christ; they embrace it; they receive it; they 
 govern themselves by it; they entertain the doctrine, and submit to the 
 law and government, of Christ; they have it as a trust; they have it as 
 a treasure. 

 2. How honorably James speaks of Jesus Christ; he calls him <I>the Lord
 of glory;</I> for he is <I>the brightness of his Father's glory, and 
 the express image of his person.</I> 

 3. Christ's being the Lord of glory should teach us not to respect
 Christians for any thing so much as their relation and conformity to 
 Christ. You who profess to believe the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
 which the poorest Christian shall partake of equally with the rich, and 
 to which all worldly glory is but vanity, you should not make men's 
 outward and worldly advantages the measure of your respect. In 
 professing the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, we should not show 
 respect to men, so as to cloud or lessen the glory of our glorious 
 Lord: how ever any may think of it, this is certainly a very heinous 
 sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have this sin described and cautioned against, by an instance or 
 example of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>):

 <I>For if there come into your assembly a man with a gold ring,</I> &c. 
 <I>Assembly</I> here is meant of those meetings which were appointed 
 for deciding matters of difference among the members of the church, or 
 for determining when censures should be passed upon any, and what those 
 censures should be; therefore the Greek word here used, 
 <B><I>synagoge,</I></B> signifies such an assembly as that in the 
 Jewish synagogues, when they met to do justice. Maimonides says (as I 
 find the passage quoted by Dr. Manton) "That is was expressly provided 
 by the Jews' constitutions that, when a poor man and a rich plead 
 together, the rich shall not be bidden to sit down and the poor stand, 
 or sit in a worse place, but both sit or both stand alike." To this the 
 phrases used by the apostle have a most plain reference, and therefore 
 the assembly here spoken of must be some such as the 
 synagogue-assemblies of the Jews were, when they met to hear causes and 
 to execute justice: to these the arbitrations and censures of their 
 Christian assemblies are compared. But we must be careful not to apply 
 what is here said to the common assemblies for worship; for in these 
 certainly there may be appointed different places of persons according 
 to their rank and circumstances, without sin. Those do not understand 
 the apostle who fix his severity here upon this practice; they do not 
 consider the word judges (used in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 nor what is said of their being convected as transgressors of the law,
 if they had such a respect of persons as is here spoken of, according
 to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Thus, now put the case: "<I>There comes into your assembly</I> (when of 
 the same nature with some of those at the synagogue) <I>a man</I> that 
 is distinguished by his dress, and who makes a figure, <I>and there 
 comes in also a poor man in vile raiment,</I> and you act partially, 
 and determine wrong, merely because the one makes a better appearance, 
 or is in better circumstances, than the other." Observe hence, 

 1. God has his remnant among all sorts of people, among those that wear
 soft and gay clothing, and among those that wear poor and vile raiment.
 
 2. In matters of religion, rich and poor stand upon a level; no man's
 riches set him in the least nearer to God, nor does any man's poverty 
 set him at a distance from God. <I>With the Most High there is no 
 respect of persons,</I> and therefore in matters of conscience there 
 should be none with us.

 3. All undue honouring of worldly greatness and riches should
 especially be watched against in Christian societies. James does not
 here encourage rudeness or disorder. Civil respect must be paid, and 
 some difference may be allowed in our carriage towards persons of 
 different ranks; but this respect must never be such as to influence 
 the proceedings of Christian societies in disposing of the offices of 
 the church, or in passing the censures of the church, or in any thing 
 that is purely a matter of religion; here we are to know no man after 
 the flesh. It is the character of a citizen of Zion that <I>in his eyes 
 a vile person is contemned, but he honoureth those that fear the 
 Lord.</I> If a poor man be a good man, we must not value him a whit the 
 less for his poverty; and, if a rich man be a bad man (though he may 
 have both gay clothing and a gay profession), we must not value him any 
 whit the more for his riches. 

 4. Of what importance it is to take care what rule we go by in judging 
 of men; if we allow ourselves commonly to judge by outward appearance, 
 this will too much influence our spirits and our conduct in religious 
 assemblies. There is many a man, whose wickedness renders him vile and 
 despicable, who yet makes a figure in the world; and, on the other 
 hand, there is many a humble, heavenly, good Christian, who is clothed 
 meanly; but neither should he nor his Christianity be thought the worse 
 of on this account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have the greatness of this sin set forth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 It is great partiality, it is injustice, and it is to set ourselves 
 against God, who has chosen the poor, and will honour and advance them 
 (if good), let who will despise them. 

 1. In this sin there is shameful partiality: <I>Are you not then
 partial in yourselves?</I> The question is here put, as what could not 
 fail of being answered by every man's conscience that would put it 
 seriously to himself. According to the strict rendering of the 
 original, the question is, "<I>Have you not made a difference?</I> And, 
 in that difference, do you not judge by a false rule, and go upon false 
 measures? And does not the charge of a partiality condemned by the law 
 lie fully against you? Does not your own conscience tell you that you 
 are guilty?" Appeals to conscience are of great advantage, when we have 
 to do with such as make a profession, even though they may have fallen 
 into a very corrupt state. 

 2. This respect of persons is owing to the evil and injustice of the
 thoughts. As the temper, conduct, and proceedings, are partial, so the
 heart and thoughts, from which all flows, are evil: "<I>You have become 
 judges of evil thoughts;</I> that is, you are judges according to those 
 unjust estimations and corrupt opinions which you have formed to 
 yourselves. Trace your partiality till you come to those hidden
 thoughts which accompany and support it, and you will find those to be 
 <I>exceedingly evil.</I> You secretly prefer outward pomp before inward 
 grace, and the things that are seen before those which are not seen." 
 The deformity of sin is never truly and fully discerned till the evil 
 of our thoughts be disclosed: and it is this which highly aggravates 
 the faults of our tempers and lives--that <I>the imagination of the 
 thoughts of the heart is evil,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:5">Gen. vi. 5</A>.

 3. This respect of persons is a heinous sin, because it is to show 
 ourselves most directly contrary to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith? &c. But 
 you have despised them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 God has made those heirs of a kingdom whom you make of no reputation, 
 and has given very great and glorious promises to those to whom you can 
 hardly give a good word or a respectful look. And is not this a 
 monstrous iniquity in you who pretend to be the children of God and 
 conformed to him? <I>Hearken, my beloved brethren;</I> by all the love 
 I have for you, and all the regards you have to me, I beg you would 
 consider these things. Take notice that many of the poor of this world 
 are the chosen of God. Their being God's chosen does not prevent their 
 being poor; their being poor does not at all prejudice the evidences of 
 their being chosen.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:5">Matt. xi. 5</A>,

 <I>The poor are evangelized.</I>" God designed to recommend his holy
 religion to men's esteem and affection, not by the external advantages 
 of gaiety and pomp, but by its intrinsic worth and excellency; and 
 therefore chose the poor of this world. Again, take notice that many 
 poor of the world are rich in faith; thus the poorest may become rich; 
 and this is what they ought to be especially ambitious of. It is 
 expected from those who have wealth and estates that they be rich in 
 good works, because the more they have the more they have to do good 
 with; but it is expected from the poor in the world that they be rich 
 in faith, for the less they have here the more they may, and should, 
 live in the believing expectation of better things in a better world. 
 Take notice further, Believing Christians are rich in title, and in 
 being heirs of a kingdom, though they may be very poor as to present 
 possessions. What is laid out upon them is but little; what is laid up 
 for them is unspeakably rich and great. Note again, Where any are rich 
 in faith, there will be also divine love; faith working by love will be 
 in all the heirs of glory. Note once more, under this head, Heaven is a
 kingdom, and a kingdom promised to those that love God. We read of the
 crown promised to those that love God, in the former chapter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);
 
 we here find there is a kingdom too. And, as the crown is a crown of
 life, so the kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom. All these things, 
 laid together, show how highly the poor in this world, if rich in 
 faith, are now honoured, and shall hereafter be advanced by God; and 
 consequently how very sinful a thing it was for them to despise the 
 poor. After such considerations as these, the charge is cutting indeed: 
 <I>But you have despised the poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 4. Respecting persons, in the sense of this place, on account of their 
 riches or outward figure, is shown to be a very great sin, because of 
 the mischiefs which are owing to worldly wealth and greatness, and the 
 folly which there is in Christians' paying undue regards to those who 
 had so little regard either to their God or them: "<I>Do not rich men 
 oppress you, and draw you before the judgment-seat? Do not they 
 blaspheme that worthy name by which you are called?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Consider how commonly riches are the incentives of vice and mischief, 
 of blasphemy and persecution: consider how many calamities you 
 yourselves sustain, and how great reproaches are thrown upon your 
 religion and your God by men of wealth, and power, and worldly 
 greatness; and this will make your sin appear exceedingly sinful and 
 foolish, in setting up that which tends to pull you down, and to 
 destroy all that you are building up, and to dishonour that worthy name 
 by which you are called." The name of Christ is a worthy name; it 
 reflects honour, and gives worth to those who wear it.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having condemned the sin of those who had an undue respect 
 of persons, and having urged what was sufficient to convict them of the 
 greatness of this evil, now proceeds to show how the matter may be
 mended; it is the work of a gospel ministry, not only to reprove and
 warn, but to teach and direct. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:28">Col. i. 28</A>,

 <I>Warning every man, and teaching every man.</I> And here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have the law that is to guide us in all our regards to men set 
 down in general. <I>If you fulfil the royal law, according to the 
 scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, you do well,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Lest any should think James had been pleading for the poor so as to 
 throw contempt on the rich, he now lets them know that he did not 
 design to encourage improper conduct towards any; they must not hate 
 nor be rude to the rich, any more than despise the poor; but as the 
 scripture teaches us to love all our neighbours, be they rich or poor, 
 as ourselves, so, in our having a steady regard to this rule, <I>we 
 shall do well.</I> Observe hence, 

 1. The rule for Christians to walk by is settled in the scriptures:
 <I>If according to the scriptures,</I> &c. It is not great men, nor 
 worldly wealth, nor corrupt practices among professors themselves, that 
 must guide us, but the scriptures of truth. 

 2. The scripture gives us this as a law, to love our neighbour as 
 ourselves; it is what still remains in full force, and is rather 
 carried higher and further by Christ than made less important to us. 

 3. This law is a royal law, it comes from the King of kings. Its own
 worth and dignity deserve it should be thus honoured; and the state in 
 which all Christians now are, as it is a state of liberty, and not of 
 bondage or oppression, makes this law, by which they are to regulate 
 all their actions to one another, a royal law. 

 4. A pretence of observing this royal law, when it is interpreted with 
 partiality, will not excuse men in any unjust proceedings. In is 
 implied here that some were ready to flatter rich men, and be partial 
 to them, because, if they were in the like circumstances, they should 
 expect such regards to themselves; or they might plead that to show a 
 distinguished respect to those whom God in his providence had 
 distinguished by their rank and degree in the world was but doing 
 right; therefore the apostle allows that, so far as they were concerned 
 to observe the duties of the second table, they <I>did well in giving 
 honour to whom honour was due;</I> but this fair pretence would not 
 cover their sin in that undue <I>respect of persons</I> which they 
 stood chargeable with; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This general law is to be considered together with a particular 
 law: "<I>If you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are 
 convinced of the law as transgressors,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Notwithstanding the law of laws, <I>to love your neighbour as 
 yourselves,</I> and to show that respect to them which you would be apt 
 to look for yourselves if in their circumstances, yet this will not 
 excuse your distributing either the favours or the censures of the 
 church according to men's outward condition; but here you must look to 
 a particular law, which God, who gave the other, has given you together 
 with it, and by this you will stand fully convicted of the sin I have 
 charged you with." This law is in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:15">Lev. xix. 15</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt do no unrighteousness in judgment; thou shalt not respect 
 the person of the poor nor the person of the mighty; but in 
 righteousness shalt though judge thy neighbour.</I> Yea, the very royal 
 law itself, rightly explained, would serve to convict them, because it 
 teaches them to put themselves as much in the places of the poor as in 
 those of the rich, and so to act equitably towards one as well as the 
 other. Hence he proceeds,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. To show the extent of the law, and how far obedience must be paid 
 to it. They must fulfil the royal law, have a regard to one part as 
 well as another, otherwise it would not stand them in stead, when they 
 pretended to urge it as a reason for any particular actions: <I>For 
 whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, is 
 guilty of all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 This may be considered, 

 1. With reference to the case James has been upon: Do you plead for
 your respect to the rich, because you are to love your neighbour as 
 yourselves? Why then show also an equitable and due regard to the poor, 
 because you are to love your neighbour as yourself: or else your 
 offending in one point will spoil your pretence of observing that law 
 at all. <I>Whosoever shall keep the whole law, if he offend in one 
 point,</I> wilfully, avowedly, and with continuance, and so as to think 
 he shall be excused in some matters because of his obedience in others, 
 <I>he is guilty of all;</I> that is, he incurs the same penalty, and is 
 liable to the same punishment, by the sentence of the law, as if he had 
 broken it in other points as well as that he stands chargeable with. 
 Not that all sins are equal, but that all carry the same contempt of 
 the authority of the Lawgiver, and so bind over to such punishment as 
 is threatened on the breach of that law. This shows us what a vanity it 
 is to think that our good deeds will atone for our bad deeds, and 
 plainly puts us upon looking for some other atonement.

 2. This is further illustrated by putting a case different from that 
 before mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. 
 Now, if thou commit no adultery, yet, if thou kill, thou art become a 
 transgressor of the law.</I> One, perhaps, is very severe in the case 
 of adultery, or what tends to such pollutions of the flesh; but less 
 ready to condemn murder, or what tends to ruin the health, break the 
 hearts, and destroy the lives, of others: another has a prodigious 
 dread of murder, but has more easy thoughts of adultery; whereas one 
 who looks at the authority of the Lawgiver more than the matter of the 
 command will see the same reason for condemning the one as the other. 
 Obedience is then acceptable when all is done with an eye to the will 
 of God; and disobedience is to be condemned, in whatever instance it 
 be, as it is a contempt of the authority of God; and, for that reason, 
 if we offend in one point, we contemn the authority of him who gave the 
 whole law, and so far are guilty of all. Thus, if you look to the law 
 of the old, you stand condemned; for <I>cursed is every one that continueth
 not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:10">Gal. iii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. James directs Christians to govern and conduct themselves more 
 especially by the law of Christ. <I>So speak and so do as those that 
 shall be judged by the law of liberty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This will teach us, not only to be just and impartial, but very 
 compassionate and merciful to the poor; and it will set us perfectly 
 free from all sordid and undue regards to the rich. Observe here, 

 1. The gospel is called a law. It has all the requisites of a law:
 precepts with rewards and punishments annexed; it prescribes duty, as 
 well as administers comfort; and Christ is a king to rule us as well as 
 a prophet to teach us, and a priest to sacrifice and intercede for us.
 <I>We are under the law to Christ.</I> 

 2. It is a <I>law of liberty,</I> and one that we have no reason to
 complain of as a yoke or burden; for the service of God, according to 
 the gospel, is perfect freedom; it sets us at liberty from all slavish 
 regards, either to the persons or the things of this world. 

 3. We must all be judged by this law of liberty. Men's eternal
 condition will be determined according to the gospel; this is the book 
 that will be opened, when we shall stand before the judgment-seat; 
 there will be no relief to those whom the gospel condemns, nor will any 
 accusation lie against those whom the gospel justifies. 

 4. It concerns us therefore so to speak and act now as become those who 
 must shortly be judged by this law of liberty; that is, that we come up 
 to gospel terms, that we make conscience of gospel duties, that we be of
 a gospel temper, and that our conversation be a gospel conversation, 
 because by this rule we must be judged. 

 5. The consideration of our being judged by the gospel should engage us
 more especially to be merciful in our regards to the poor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>For he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shown no mercy; 
 and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</I> Take notice here, 

 (1.) The doom which will be passed upon impenitent sinners at last will 
 be judgment without mercy; there will be no mixtures or allays in the 
 cup of wrath and of trembling, the dregs of which they must drink. 

 (2.) Such as show no mercy now shall find no mercy in the great day. 
 But we may note, on the other hand, 

 (3.) That there will be such as shall become instances of the triumph 
 of mercy, in whom mercy rejoices against judgment: all the children of 
 men, in the last day, will be either vessels of wrath or vessels of 
 mercy. It concerns all to consider among which they shall be found; and 
 let us remember that <I>blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain 
 mercy.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  What <I>doth it</I> profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath
 faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
 &nbsp; 15  If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily
 food,
 &nbsp; 16  And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be <I>ye</I>
 warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things
 which are needful to the body; what <I>doth it</I> profit?
 &nbsp; 17  Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
 &nbsp; 18  Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show
 me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by
 my works.
 &nbsp; 19  Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the
 devils also believe, and tremble.
 &nbsp; 20  But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is
 dead?
 &nbsp; 21  Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
 offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
 &nbsp; 22  Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works
 was faith made perfect?
 &nbsp; 23  And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham
 believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and
 he was called the Friend of God.
 &nbsp; 24  Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
 faith only.
 &nbsp; 25  Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works,
 when she had received the messengers, and had sent <I>them</I> out
 another way?
 &nbsp; 26  For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
 works is dead also.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this latter part of the chapter, the apostle shows the error of 
 those who rested in a bare profession of the Christian faith, as if 
 that would save them, while the temper of their minds and the tenour of 
 their lives were altogether disagreeable to that holy religion which 
 they professed. To let them see, therefore, what a wretched foundation 
 they built their hopes upon, it is here proved at large that a man is 
 justified, not by faith only, but by works. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Upon this arises a very great question, namely, how to reconcile 
 Paul and James. Paul, in his epistles to the Romans and Galatians, 
 seems to assert the directly contrary thing to what James here lays 
 down, saying if often, and with a great deal of emphasis, <I>that we 
 are justified by faith only and not by the works of the law. Amic&aelig;
 scripturarum lites, utinam et nostr&aelig;--There is a very happy agreement
 between one part of scripture and another, notwithstanding seeming 
 differences: it were well if the differences among Christians were as 
 easily reconciled.</I> "Nothing," says Mr. Baxter, "but men's 
 misunderstanding the plain drift and sense of Paul's epistles, could 
 make so many take it for a matter of great difficulty to reconcile Paul 
 and James." A general view of those things which are insisted on by the 
 Antinomians may be seen in Mr. Baxter's Paraphrase: and many ways might 
 be mentioned which have been invented among learned men to make the
 apostles agree; but it may be sufficient only to observe these few
 things following:--

 1. When Paul says that <I>a man is justified by faith, without the
 deeds of the law</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:28">Rom. iii. 28</A>),

 he plainly speaks of another sort of work than James does, but not of 
 another sort of faith. Paul speaks of works wrought in obedience to the 
 law of Moses, and before men's embracing the faith of the gospel; and 
 he had to deal with those who valued themselves so highly upon those 
 works that they rejected the gospel (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:1-21">Rom. x.</A>,

 at the beginning most expressly declares); but James speaks of works
 done in obedience to the gospel, and as the proper and necessary 
 effects and fruits of sound believing in Christ Jesus. Both are 
 concerned to magnify the faith of the gospel, as that which alone could 
 save us and justify us; but Paul magnifies it by showing the 
 insufficiency of any works of the law before faith, or in opposition to 
 the doctrine of justification by Jesus Christ; James magnifies the same 
 faith, by showing what are the genuine and necessary products and 
 operations of it. 

 2. Paul not only speaks of different works from those insisted on by
 James, but he speaks of a quite different use that was made of good 
 works from what is here urged and intended. Paul had to do with those 
 who depended on the merit of their works in the sight of God, and thus 
 he might well make them of no manner of account. James had to do with 
 those who cried up faith, but would not allow works to be used even as 
 evidence; they depended upon a bare profession, as sufficient to 
 justify them; and with these he might well urge the necessity and vast 
 importance of good works. As we must not break one table of the law, by 
 dashing it against the other, so neither must we break in pieces the 
 law and the gospel, by making them clash with one another: those who 
 cry up the gospel so as to set aside the law, and those who cry up the 
 law so as to set aside the gospel, are both in the wrong; for we must 
 take our work before us; there must be both faith in Jesus Christ and 
 good works the fruit of faith. 

 3. The justification of which Paul speaks is different from that spoken
 of by James; the one speaks of our persons being justified before God, 
 the other speaks of our faith being justified before men: "<I>Show me 
 thy faith by thy works,</I>" says James, "let thy faith be justified in 
 the eyes of those that behold thee by thy works;" but Paul speaks of 
 justification in the sight of God, who justifies those only that 
 believe in Jesus, and purely on account of the redemption that is in 
 him. Thus we see that our persons are justified before God by faith, 
 but our faith is justified before men by works. This is so plainly the 
 scope and design of the apostle James that he is but confirming what 
 Paul, in other places, says of his faith, that it is a laborious faith, 
 and a faith working by love,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:6;1Th+1:3;Tit+3:8">Gal. v. 6;
 1 Thess. i. 3; Titus iii. 8</A>;

 and many other places.

 4. Paul may be understood as speaking of that justification which is
 inchoate, James of that which is complete; it is by <I>faith</I> only 
 that we are put into a justified state, but then good works come in for 
 the completing of our justification at the last great day; then, 
 <I>Come you children of my Father--for I was hungry, and you gave me 
 meat,</I> &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Having thus cleared this part of scripture from every thing of a 
 contradiction to other parts of it, let us see what is more 
 particularly to be learnt from this excellent passage of James; we are 
 taught,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That faith without works will not profit, and cannot save us. 
 <I>What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, and 
 have not works? Can faith save him?</I> Observe here, 

 (1.) That faith which does not save will not really profit us; a bare 
 profession may sometimes seem to be profitable, to gain the good 
 opinion of those who are truly good, and it may procure in some cases 
 worldly good things; but what profit will this be, for any to gain the 
 world and to lose their souls? <I>What doth it profit?--Can faith save 
 him?</I> All things should be accounted profitable or unprofitable to 
 us as they tend to forward or hinder the salvation of our souls. And, 
 above all other things, we should take care thus to make account of 
 faith, as that which does not profit, if it do not save, but will 
 aggravate our condemnation and destruction at last. 

 (2.) For a man to have faith, and to say he has faith, are two 
 different things; the apostle does not say, <I>If a man have faith 
 without works,</I> for that is not a supposable case; the drift of this 
 place of scripture is plainly to show that an opinion, or speculation, 
 or assent, without works, is not faith; but the case is put thus, <I>If 
 a man say he hath faith,</I> &c. Men may boast of that to others, and
 be conceited of that in themselves, of which they are really 
 destitute.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We are taught that, as love or charity is an operative principle, so 
 is faith, and that neither of them would otherwise be good for any 
 thing; and, by trying how it looks for a person to pretend he is very 
 charitable who yet never does any works of charity, you may judge what 
 sense there is in pretending to have faith without the proper and 
 necessary fruits of it: "<I>If a brother or a sister be naked, and 
 destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, 
 be you warmed and filled, notwithstanding you give them not those 
 things which are needful to the body, what doth it profit?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.

 What will such a charity as this, that consists in bare words, avail 
 either you or the poor? Will you come before God with such empty shows 
 of charity as these? You might as well pretend that your love and 
 charity will stand the test without acts of mercy as think that a 
 profession of faith will bear you out before God without works of piety 
 and obedience. <I>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being 
 along,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 We are too apt to rest in a bare profession of faith, and to think that 
 this will save us; it is a cheap and easy religion to say, "We believe 
 the articles of the Christian faith;" but it is a great delusion to 
 imagine that this is enough to bring us to heaven. Those who argue thus 
 wrong God, and put a cheat upon their own souls; a mock-faith is as 
 hateful as mock-charity, and both show a heart dead to all real 
 godliness. You may as soon take pleasure in a dead body, void of soul, 
 or sense, or action, as God take pleasure in a dead faith, where there 
 are no works.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We are taught to compare a faith boasting of itself without works 
 and a faith evidenced by works, by looking on both together, to try how 
 this comparison will work upon our minds. <I>Yea, a man may say, Thou 
 hast faith, and I have works. Show me thy faith without thy works, and 
 I will show thee my faith by my works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Suppose a true believer thus pleading with a boasting hypocrite, "Thou 
 makest a profession, and sayest thou hast faith; I make no such boasts, 
 but leave my works to speak for me. Now give any evidence of having the 
 faith thou professest without works if thou canst, and I will soon let 
 thee see how my works flow from faith and are the undoubted evidences 
 of its existence." This is the evidence by which the scriptures all 
 along teach men to judge both of themselves and others. And this is the 
 evidence according to which Christ will proceed at the day of judgment.
 <I>The dead were judged according to their works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:12">Rev. xx. 12</A>.

 How will those be exposed then who boast of that which they cannot 
 evidence, or who go about to evidence their faith by any thing but 
 works of piety and mercy!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. We are taught to look upon a faith of bare speculation and knowledge 
 as the faith of devils: <I>Thou believest that there is one God; thou 
 doest well; the devils also believe, and tremble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 That instance of faith which the apostle here chooses to mention is the 
 first principle of all religion. "<I>Thou believest that there is a 
 God,</I> against the atheists; and that there is but one God, against 
 the idolaters; <I>thou doest well:</I> so far all is right. But to rest 
 here, and take up a good opinion of thyself, or of thy state towards 
 God, merely on account of thy believing in him, this will render thee 
 miserable: <I>The devils also believe, and tremble.</I> If thou 
 contentest thyself with a bare assent to articles of faith, and some 
 speculations upon them, thus far the devils go. And as their faith and 
 knowledge only serve to excite horror, so in a little time will thine." 
 The word tremble is commonly looked upon as denoting a good effect of 
 faith; but here it may rather be taken as a bad effect, when applied to 
 the faith of devils. They tremble, not out of reverence, but hatred and 
 opposition to that one God on whom they believe. To rehearse that 
 article of our creed, therefore, <I>I believe in God the Father 
 Almighty,</I> will not distinguish us from devils at last, unless we 
 now give up ourselves to God as the gospel directs, and love him, and 
 delight ourselves in him, and serve him, which the devils do not, 
 cannot do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. We are taught that he who boasts of faith without works is to be 
 looked upon at present as a foolish condemned person. <I>But wilt thou 
 know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 The words translated <I>vain man</I>--<B><I>anthrope kene,</I></B> are 
 observed to have the same signification with the word <I>Raca,</I> 
 which must never be used to private persons, or as an effect of anger

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:22">Matt. v. 22</A>),

 but may be used as here, to denote a just detestation of such a sort of
 men as are empty of good works, and yet boasters of their faith. And it 
 plainly declares them fools and abjects in the sight of God. Faith 
 without works is said to be <I>dead,</I> not only as void of all those 
 operations which are the proofs of spiritual life, but as unavailable 
 to eternal life: such believers as rest in a bare profession of faith 
 <I>are dead while they live.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. We are taught that a justifying faith cannot be without works, from 
 two examples, Abraham and Rahab.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The first instance is that of Abraham, the father of the faithful, 
 and the prime example of justification, to whom the Jews had a special 
 regard 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered 
 Isaac his son upon the altar?</I> Paul, on the other hand, says (in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:3"><I>ch.</I> 4 of the epistle to the Romans</A>)

 that Abraham <I>believed, and it was counted to him for
 righteousness.</I> But these are well reconciled, by observing what is
 said in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:1-40">Heb. 11</A>,

 which shows that the faith both of Abraham and Rahab was such as to
 produce those good works of which James speaks, and which are not to be
 separated from faith as justifying and saving. By what Abraham did, it
 appeared that he truly believed. Upon this footing, the words of God
 himself plainly put this matter.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:16,17">Gen. xxii. 16, 17</A>,

 <I>Because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,
 thine only son; therefore in blessing I will bless thee.</I> Thus the 
 faith of Abraham was a working faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 <I>it wrought with his works, and by works was made perfect.</I> And by 
 this means you come to the true sense of that scripture which saith, 
 Abraham believed God, <I>and it was imputed unto him for 
 righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 And thus he became the <I>friend of God.</I> Faith, producing such 
 works, endeared him to the divine Being, and advanced him to very 
 peculiar favours and intimacies with God. It is a great honour done to 
 Abraham that he is called and counted the friend of God. You see then

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 how that <I>by works a man is justified</I> (comes into such a state of
 favour and friendship with God), <I>and not by faith only;</I> not by a 
 bare opinion, or profession, or believing without obeying, but by 
 having such a faith as is productive of good works. Now besides the 
 explication of this passage and example, as thus illustrating and 
 supporting the argument James is upon, many other useful lessons may be 
 learned by us from what is here said concerning Abraham. 

 [1.] Those who would have Abraham's blessings must be careful to copy
 after his faith: to boast of being Abraham's seed will not avail any, 
 if they do not believe as he did.

 [2.] Those works which evidence true faith must be works of
 self-denial, and such as God himself commands (as Abraham's offering up 
 his son, his only son, was), and not such works as are pleasing to 
 flesh and blood and may serve our interest, or are the mere fruits of 
 our own imagination and devising. 

 [3.] What we piously purpose and sincerely resolve to do for God is 
 accepted as if actually performed. Thus Abraham is regarded as
 offering up his son, though he did not actually proceed to make a 
 sacrifice of him. It was a done thing in the mind, and spirit, and 
 resolution of Abraham, and God accepts it as if fully performed and 
 accomplished. 

 [4.] The actings of faith make it grow perfect, as the truth of faith 
 makes it act. 

 [5.] Such an acting faith will make others, as well as Abraham, friends 
 of God. Thus Christ says to his disciples, <I>I have called you 
 friends,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:15">John xv. 15</A>.

 All transactions between God and the truly believing soul are easy,
 pleasant, and delightful. There is one will and one heart, and there is 
 a mutual complacency. <I>God rejoiceth over those</I> who truly 
 believe, to do them good; and they delight themselves in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The second example of faith's justifying itself and us with and by 
 works is Rahab: <I>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by 
 works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out 
 another way?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 The former instance was of one renowned for his faith all his life 
 long, This is of one noted for sin, whose faith was meaner and of a 
 much lower degree; so that the strongest faith will not do, nor the 
 meanest be allowed to go without works. Some say that the word here 
 rendered <I>harlot</I> was the proper name of Rahab. Others tell us 
 that it signifies no more than a <I>hostess,</I> or one who keeps a 
 public house, with whom therefore the spies lodged. But it is very 
 probable that her character was infamous; and such an instance is 
 mentioned to show that faith will save the worst, when evidenced by 
 proper works; and it will not save the best without such works as God 
 requires. This Rahab believed the report she had heard of God's 
 powerful presence with Israel; but that which proved her faith sincere 
 was, that, to the hazard of her life, she <I>received the messengers, 
 and sent them out another way.</I> Observe here, 

 [1.] The wonderful power of faith in transforming and changing sinners. 
 
 [2.] The regard which an operative faith meets with from God, to obtain 
 his mercy and favour. 

 [3.] Where great sins are pardoned, there must prefer the honour of God 
 and the good of his people before the preservation of her own country. 
 Her former acquaintance must be discarded, her former course of life 
 entirely abandoned, and she must give signal proof and evidence of this 
 before she can be in a justified state; and even after she is 
 justified, yet her former character must be remembered; not so much to 
 her dishonour as to glorify the rich grace and mercy of God. Though
 justified, she is called <I>Rahab the harlot.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. And now, upon the whole matter, the apostle draws this conclusion, 
 <I>As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is 
 dead also,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 These words are read differently; some reading them, <I>As the body 
 without the breath is dead, so is faith without works:</I> and then 
 they show that works are the companions of faith, as breathing is of 
 life. Others read them, <I>As the body without the soul is dead, so 
 faith without works is dead also:</I> and then they show that as the 
 body has no action, nor beauty, but becomes a loathsome carcass, when 
 the soul is gone, so a bare profession without works is useless, yea, 
 loathsome and offensive. Let us then take head of running into extremes 
 in this case. For,

 (1.) The best works, without faith, are dead; they want their root and 
 principle. It is by faith that any thing we do is really good, as done 
 with an eye to God, in obedience to him, and so as to aim principally 
 at his acceptance.

 (2.) The most plausible profession of faith, without works, is dead: as 
 the root is dead when it produces nothing green, nothing of fruit.
 Faith is the root, good works are the fruits, and we must see to it 
 that we have both. We must not think that either, without the other, 
 will justify and save us. This is the grace of God wherein we stand, 
 and we should stand to it.</P>
