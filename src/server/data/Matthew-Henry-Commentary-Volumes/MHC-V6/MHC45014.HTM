 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle having, in the former chapter, directed our conduct one 
 towards another in civil things, and prescribed the sacred laws of 
 justice, peaceableness, and order, to be observed by us as members of 
 the commonwealth, comes in this and part of the following chapter in 
 like manner to direct our demeanour one towards another in sacred 
 things, which pertain more immediately to conscience and religion, and 
 which we observe as members of the church. Particularly, he gives rules 
 how to manage our different apprehensions about indifferent things, in 
 the management of which, it seems, there was something amiss among the 
 Roman Christians, to whom he wrote, which he here labours to redress. 
 But the rules are general, and of standing use in the church, for the 
 preservation of that Christian love which he had so earnestly pressed 
 in the foregoing chapter as the fulfilling of the law. It is certain 
 that nothing is more threatening, nor more often fatal, to Christian 
 societies, than the contentions and divisions of their members. By 
 these wounds the life and soul of religion expire. Now in this chapter 
 we are furnished with the sovereign balm of Gilead; the blessed apostle 
 prescribes like a wise physician. "Why then is not the hurt of the 
 daughter of my people recovered," but because his directions are not 
 followed? This chapter, rightly understood, made use of, and lived up 
 to, would set things to rights, and heal us all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, <I>but</I> not to
 doubtful disputations.
 &nbsp; 2  For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is
 weak, eateth herbs.
 &nbsp; 3  Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let
 not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath
 received him.
 &nbsp; 4  Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own
 master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for
 God is able to make him stand.
 &nbsp; 5  One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth
 every day <I>alike.</I> Let every man be fully persuaded in his own
 mind.
 &nbsp; 6  He that regardeth the day, regardeth <I>it</I> unto the Lord; and
 he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard
 <I>it.</I> He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God
 thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and
 giveth God thanks.
 &nbsp; 7  For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to
 himself.
 &nbsp; 8  For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we
 die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we
 are the Lord's.
 &nbsp; 9  For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that
 he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
 &nbsp; 10  But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at
 nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment
 seat of Christ.
 &nbsp; 11  For it is written, <I>As</I> I live, saith the Lord, every knee
 shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
 &nbsp; 12  So then every one of us shall give account of himself to
 God.
 &nbsp; 13  Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge
 this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to
 fall in <I>his</I> brother's way.
 &nbsp; 14  I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that <I>there is</I>
 nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to
 be unclean, to him <I>it is</I> unclean.
 &nbsp; 15  But if thy brother be grieved with <I>thy</I> meat, now walkest
 thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom
 Christ died.
 &nbsp; 16  Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
 &nbsp; 17  For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but
 righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
 &nbsp; 18  For he that in these things serveth Christ <I>is</I> acceptable
 to God, and approved of men.
 &nbsp; 19  Let us therefore follow after the things which make for
 peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
 &nbsp; 20  For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed
 <I>are</I> pure; but <I>it is</I> evil for that man who eateth with
 offence.
 &nbsp; 21  <I>It is</I> good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor
 <I>any thing</I> whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is
 made weak.
 &nbsp; 22  Hast thou faith? have <I>it</I> to thyself before God. Happy <I>is</I>
 he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
 &nbsp; 23  And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because <I>he
 eateth</I> not of faith: for whatsoever <I>is</I> not of faith is sin.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have in this chapter,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An account of the unhappy contention which had broken out in the 
 Christian church. Our Master had foretold that offences would come; 
 and, it seems, so they did, for want of that wisdom and love which 
 would have prevented discord, and kept up union among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There was a difference among them about the distinction of meats and 
 days; these are the two things specified. There might be other similar 
 occasions of difference, while these made the most noise, and were most 
 taken notice of. The case was this: The members of the Christian church 
 at Rome were some of them originally Gentiles, and others of them Jews. 
 We find Jews at Rome believing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:24">Acts xxviii. 24</A>.

 Now those that had been Jews were trained up in the observance of the
 ceremonial appointments touching meats and days. This, which had been 
 bred in the bone with them, could hardly be got out of the flesh, even 
 after they turned Christians; especially with some of them, who were 
 not easily weaned from what they had long been wedded to. They were not 
 well instructed touching the cancelling of the ceremonial law by the 
 death of Christ, and therefore retained the ceremonial institutions, 
 and practised accordingly; while other Christians that understood 
 themselves better, and knew their Christian liberty, made no such 
 difference.

 (1.) Concerning meats 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>One believeth that he may eat all things</I>--he is well satisfied 
 that the ceremonial distinction of meats into clean and unclean is no 
 longer in force, but that every creature of God is good, and nothing to 
 be refused; nothing <I>unclean of itself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This he was assured of, not only from the general tenour and scope of
 the gospel, but particularly from the revelation which Peter, the 
 apostle of the circumcision (and therefore more immediately concerned 
 in it), had to this purport,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:15,28">Acts x. 15, 28</A>.

 This the strong Christian is clear in, and practises accordingly, 
 eating what is set before him, and asking no question for conscience' 
 sake,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:27">1 Cor. x. 27</A>.

 On the other hand, <I>another, who is weak,</I> is dissatisfied in this
 point, is not clear in his Christian liberty, but rather inclines to 
 think that the meats forbidden by the law remain still unclean; and 
 therefore, to keep at a distance from them, he will eat no flesh at 
 all, but <I>eateth herbs,</I> contenting himself with only the fruits 
 of the earth. See to what degrees of mortification and self-denial a 
 tender conscience will submit. None know but those that experience it 
 how great both the restraining and the constraining power of conscience 
 is. 

 (2.) Concerning days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Those who thought themselves still under some kind of obligation to the 
 ceremonial law esteemed <I>one day above another</I>--kept up a respect 
 to the times of the passover, pentecost, new moons, and feasts of 
 tabernacles; thought those days better than other days, and solemnized 
 them accordingly with particular observances, binding themselves to 
 some religious rest and exercise on those days. Those who knew that all 
 these things were abolished and done away by Christ's coming esteemed 
 every day alike. We must understand it with an exception of the Lord's 
 day, which all Christians unanimously observed; but they made no 
 account, took no notice, of those antiquated festivals of the Jews. 
 Here the apostle speaks of the distinction of meats and days as a thing 
 indifferent, when it went no further than the opinion and practice of 
 some particular persons, who had been trained up all their days to such 
 observances, and therefore were the more excusable if they with 
 difficulty parted with them. But in the epistle to the Galatians, where 
 he deals with those that were originally Gentiles, but were influenced 
 by some judaizing teachers, not only to believe such a distinction and 
 to practise accordingly, but to lay a stress upon it as necessary to 
 salvation, and to make the observance of the Jewish festivals public 
 and congregational, here the case was altered, and it is charged upon 
 them as the frustrating of the design of the gospel, falling from 
 grace,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:9-11">Gal. iv. 9-11</A>.

 The Romans did it out of weakness, the Galatians did it out of
 wilfulness and wickedness; and therefore the apostle handles them thus 
 differently. This epistle is supposed to have been written some time 
 before that to the Galatians. The apostle seems willing to let the 
 ceremonial law wither by degrees, and to let it have an honourable 
 burial; now these weak Romans seem to be only following it weeping to 
 its grave, but those Galatians were raking it out of its ashes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was not so much the difference itself that did the mischief as 
 the mismanagement of the difference, making it a bone of contention. 
 
 (1.) Those who were strong, and knew their Christian liberty, and made 
 use of it, despised the weak, who did not. Whereas they should have
 pitied them, and helped them, and afforded them meek and friendly 
 instruction, they trampled upon them as silly, and humoursome, and 
 superstitious, for scrupling those things which they knew to be lawful: 
 so apt are those who have knowledge to be puffed up with it, and to 
 look disdainfully and scornfully upon their brethren. 

 (2.) Those who were weak, and durst not use their Christian liberty, 
 judged and censured the strong, who did, as if they were loose 
 Christians, carnal professors, that cared not what they did, but walked 
 at all adventures, and stuck at nothing. They judged them as breakers 
 of the law, contemners of God's ordinance, and the like. Such censures 
 as these discovered a great deal of rashness and uncharitableness, and 
 would doubtless tend much to the alienating of affection. Well, this 
 was the disease, and we see it remaining in the church to this day; the 
 like differences, in like manner mismanaged, are still the disturbers 
 of the church's peace. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have proper directions and suggestions laid down for allaying 
 this contention, and preventing the ill consequences of it. The 
 apostle, as a wise physician, prescribes proper remedies for the 
 disease, which are made up of rules and reasons. Such gentle methods 
 does he take, with such cords of a man does he draw them together; not 
 by excommunicating, suspending, and silencing either side, but by 
 persuading them both to a mutual forbearance: and as a faithful daysman 
 he lays his hand upon them both, reasoning the case with the strong 
 that they should not be so scornful, and with the weak that they should 
 not be so censorious. If the contending parties will but submit to this 
 fair arbitration, each abate of his rigour, and sacrifice their 
 differences to their graces, all will be well quickly. Let us observe 
 the rules he gives, some to the strong and some to the weak, and some 
 to both, for they are interwoven; and reduce the reasons to their 
 proper rules.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Those who are weak must be <I>received, but not to doubtful 
 disputations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Take this for a general rule; spend your zeal in those things wherein 
 you and all the people of God are agreed, and do not dispute about 
 matters that are doubtful. <I>Receive him,</I>
 <B><I>proslambavesthe</I></B>--<I>take him to you,</I> bid him welcome, 
 receive him with the greatest affection and tenderness; <I>porrigite 
 manum</I> (so the Syriac): <I>lend him your hand,</I> to help him, to 
 fetch him to you, to encourage him. Receive him into your company, and 
 converse, and communion, entertain him with readiness and
 condescension, and treat him with all possible endearments. Receive 
 him: not to quarrel with him, and to argue about uncertain points that 
 are in controversy, which will but confound him, and fill his head with 
 empty notions, perplex him, and shake his faith. Let not your Christian 
 friendship and fellowship be disturbed with such vain janglings and 
 strifes of words.--<I>Not to judge his doubtful thoughts</I> (so the 
 margin), "not to pump out his weak sentiments concerning those things 
 which he is in doubt about, that you may censure and condemn him." 
 Receive him, not to expose him, but to instruct and strengthen him. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:10,Php+3:15,16">1 Cor. i. 10; Phil. iii. 15, 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Those who are strong must by no means despise the weak; nor those 
 who are weak judge the strong, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This is levelled directly against the fault of each party. It is seldom 
 that any such contention exists but there is a fault on both sides, and 
 both must mend. He argues against both these jointly: we must not 
 despise nor judge our brethren. Why so?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Because God hath received them; and we reflect upon him if we 
 reject those whom he hath received. God never cast off any one that had 
 true grace, though he was but weak in it; never broke the bruised reed. 
 Strong believers and weak believers, those that eat and those that eat 
 not, if they be true believers, are accepted of God. It will be good 
 for us to put this question to ourselves, when we are tempted to behave 
 scornfully towards our brethren, to disdain and censure them: "Hast not 
 God owned them; and, if he has, dare I disown them?" "Nay, God doth not 
 only receive him, but <I>hold him up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 You think that he who eateth will fall by his presumption, or that he 
 who eateth not will sink under the weight of his own fears and 
 scruples; but if they have true faith, and an eye to God, the one in 
 the intelligent use of his Christian liberty and the other in the 
 conscientious forbearance of it, they shall be held up--the one in his 
 integrity, and the other in his comfort. This hope is built upon the 
 power of God, for <I>God is able to make him stand;</I> and, being 
 able, no doubt he is willing to exert that power for the preservation 
 of those that are his own." In reference to spiritual difficulties and 
 dangers (our own and others), much of our hope and comfort are grounded 
 upon the divine power,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:5,Jude+1:24">1 Pet. i. 5; Jude 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Because they are servants to their own master 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?</I> We reckon it a 
 piece of ill manners to meddle with other people's servants, and to 
 find fault with them and censure them. Weak and strong Christians are 
 indeed our brethren, but they are not our servants. This rash judging 
 is reproved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:1">Jam. iii. 1</A>,

 under the notion of being many masters. We make ourselves our
 brethren's masters, and do in effect usurp the throne of God, when we 
 take upon us thus to judge them, especially to judge their thoughts and 
 intentions, which are out of our view, to judge their persons and 
 state, concerning which it is hard to conclude by those few indications 
 which fall within our cognizance. God sees not as man sees; and he is 
 their master, and not we. In judging and censuring our brethren, we 
 meddle with that which does not belong to us: we have work enough to do 
 at home; and, if we must needs be judging, let us exercise our faculty 
 upon our own hearts and ways.--<I> To his own master he stands or 
 falls;</I> that is, his doom will be according to his master's 
 sentence, and not according to ours. How well for us is it that we are 
 not to stand nor fall by the judgment one of another, but by the 
 righteous and unerring judgment of God, which is according to truth!
 "While thy brother's cause is before thy judgment, it is <I>coram non 
 judice--before one who is not the judge;</I> the court of heaven is the 
 proper court for trial, where, and where only, the sentence is 
 definitive and conclusive; and to this, if his heart be upright, he may 
 comfortably appeal from thy rash censure."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Because both the one and the other, if they be true believers, and 
 are right in the main, have an eye to God, and do approve themselves to 
 God in what they do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He <I>that regards the day</I>--that makes conscience of the observance 
 of the Jewish fasts and festivals, not imposing it upon others, nor 
 laying a stress upon it, but willing to be as he thinks on the surer 
 side, as thinking there is no harm in resting from worldly labours, and 
 worshipping God on those days--it is well. We have reason to think, 
 because in other things he conducts himself like a good Christian, that 
 in this also his eye is single, and that <I>he regardeth it unto the 
 Lord;</I> and God will accept of his honest intention, though he be 
 under a mistake about the observance of days; for the sincerity and 
 uprightness of the heart were never rejected for the weakness and 
 infirmity of the head: so good a master do we serve. On the other
 hand, he <I>that regards not the day</I>--that does not make a 
 difference between one day and another, does not call one day holy and 
 another profane, one day lucky and another unlucky, but esteems every 
 day alike--he does not do it out of a spirit of opposition, 
 contradiction, or contempt of his brother. If he be a good Christian, 
 he does not, he dares not, do it from such a principle; and therefore 
 we charitably conclude that to the <I>Lord he does not regard it.</I>
 He makes no such difference of days only because he knows God hath made
 none; and therefore intends his honour in endeavouring to dedicate every
 day to him. So for the other instance: <I>He that eateth</I> whatever 
 is set before him, though it be blood, though it be swine's flesh, if 
 it be food convenient for him, he <I>eateth to the Lord.</I> He 
 understands the liberty that God has granted him, and uses it to the 
 glory of God, with an eye to his wisdom and goodness in enlarging our 
 allowance now under the gospel, and taking off the yoke of legal 
 restraints; and he <I>giveth God thanks</I> for the variety of food he 
 has, and the liberty he has to eat it, and that in those things his 
 conscience is not fettered. On the other hand, <I>he that eatest 
 not</I> those meats which were forbidden by the ceremonial law, <I>to 
 the Lord he eateth not.</I> It is for God's sake, because he is afraid 
 of offending God by eating that which he is sure was once prohibited; 
 and he <I>giveth God thanks too</I> that there is enough besides. If he 
 conscientiously deny himself that which he takes to be forbidden fruit, 
 yet he blesses God that of other trees in the garden he may freely eat.
 Thus, while both have an eye to God in what they do, and approve 
 themselves to him in their integrity, why should either of them be 
 judged or despised? Observe, Whether we eat flesh, or eat herbs, it is 
 a thankful regard to God, the author and giver of all our mercies, that 
 sanctifies and sweetens it. Bishop Sanderson, in his 34th sermon, upon

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:4">1 Tim. iv. 4</A>,

 justly makes this observation: It appears by this that <I>saying 
 grace</I> (as we commonly call it, perhaps from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:30">1 Cor. x. 30</A>)
 
 before and after meat was the common known practice of the church,
 among Christians of all sorts, weak and strong: an ancient,
 commendable, apostolical, Christian practice, derived down from
 Christ's example through all the ages of the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:19,15:36,Lu+9:16,Joh+6:11,Mt+26:26,27,Ac+27:35">Matt. xiv. 19; xv. 36;
 Luke ix. 16; John vi. 11; Matt. xxvi. 26, 27; Acts xxvii. 35</A>.

 Blessing the creatures in the name of God before we use them, and
 blessing the name of God for them after, are both included; for 
 <B><I>eulogein</I></B> and <B><I>eucharistein</I></B> are used 
 promiscuously. To clear this argument against rash judging and 
 despising, he shows how essential it is to true Christianity to have a 
 regard to God and not to ourselves, which therefore, unless the 
 contrary do manifestly appear, we must presume concerning those that in 
 minor things differ from us. Observe his description of true 
 Christians, taken from their end and aim 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>),

 and the ground of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Our end and aim: not self, but the Lord. As the particular end 
 specifies the action, so the general scope and tendency specify the 
 state. If we would know what way we walk in, we must enquire what end
 we walk towards. <I>First,</I> Not to self. We have learned to deny
 ourselves; this was our first lesson: <I>None of us liveth to 
 himself.</I> This is a thing in which all the people of God are one, 
 however they differ in other things; though some are weak and others 
 are strong, yet both agree in this, not to live to themselves. Not one 
 that hath given up his name to Christ is allowedly a self-seeker; it is 
 contrary to the foundation of true Christianity. We neither <I>live to 
 ourselves nor die to ourselves.</I> We are not our own masters, nor our 
 own proprietors--we are not at our own disposal. The business of our
 lives is not to please ourselves, but to please God. The business of 
 our deaths, to which we are every day exposed and delivered, is not to 
 make ourselves talked of; we run not such hazards out of vain-glory, 
 while we are dying daily. When we come to die actually, neither is that 
 to ourselves; it is not barely that we would be unclothed, and eased of 
 the burden of the flesh, but it is to the Lord, that we may depart and 
 be with Christ, may be present with the Lord. <I>Secondly,</I> But 
 <I>to the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 to the Lord Christ, to whom all power and judgment are committed, and 
 in whose name we are taught, as Christians, to do every thing we do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:17">Col. iii. 17</A>),

 with an eye to the will of Christ as our rule, to the glory of Christ 
 as our end, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:21">Phil. i. 21</A>.

 Christ is the gain we aim at, living and dying. We live to glorify him
 in all the actions and affairs of life; we die, whether a natural or a 
 violent death, to glorify him, and to go to be glorified with him. 
 Christ is the centre, in which all the lines of life and death do meet. 
 This is true Christianity, which makes Christ all in all. So that, 
 <I>whether we live or die, we are the Lord's,</I> devoted to him, 
 depending on him, designed and designing for him. Though some
 Christians are weak and others strong,--though of different sizes, 
 capacities, apprehensions, and practices, in minor things, yet they are 
 all the Lord's--all eying, and serving, and approving themselves to 
 Christ, and are accordingly owned and accepted of him. Is it for us 
 then to judge or despise them, as if we were their masters, and they 
 were to make it their business to please us, and to stand or fall by 
 our dooms?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The ground of this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It is grounded upon Christ's absolute sovereignty and dominion, which 
 were the fruit and end of his death and resurrection. <I>To this end he 
 both died, and rose, and revived</I> (he, having risen, entered upon a 
 heavenly life, the glory which he had before) <I>that he might be Lord 
 both of dead and living</I>--that he might be universal monarch, Lord 
 of all

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:36">Acts x. 36</A>),

 all the animate and inanimate creatures; for he is head over all things 
 to the church. He is Lord of those that are living to rule them, of
 those that are dead to receive them and raise them up. This was that 
 <I>name above every name</I> which God gave him as the reward of his 
 humiliation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:8,9">Phil. ii. 8, 9</A>.

 It was after he had died and risen that he said, <I>All power is given
 unto me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:18">Matt. xxviii. 18</A>),

 and presently he exerts that power in issuing out commissions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 Now if Christ paid so dearly for his dominion over souls and 
 consciences, and has such a just and undisputed right to exercise that 
 dominion, we must not so much as seem to invade it, nor intrench upon 
 it, by judging the consciences of our brethren, and arraigning them at 
 our bar. When we are ready to reproach and reflect upon the name and 
 memory of those that are dead and gone, and to pass a censure upon them 
 (which some the rather do, because such judgments of the dead are more 
 likely to pass uncontrolled and uncontradicted), we must consider that 
 Christ is Lord of the dead, as well as of the living. If they are dead, 
 they have already given up their account, and let that suffice. And 
 this leads to another reason against judging and despising,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Because both the one and the other must shortly give an account, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>.

 A believing regard to the judgment of the great day would silence all
 these rash judgings: <I>Why dost thou</I> that art weak <I>judge thy
 brother</I> that is strong? And <I>why dost thou</I> that art strong
 <I>set at nought thy brother</I> that is weak? Why is all this
 clashing, and contradicting, and censuring, among Christians? <I>We
 shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:10">2 Cor. v. 10</A>.
 
 Christ will be the judge, and he has both authority and ability to
 determine men's eternal state according to their works, and before him
 we shall stand as persons to be tried, and to give up an account,
 expecting our final doom from him, which will be eternally conclusive.
 To illustrate this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 he quotes a passage out of the Old Testament, which speaks of Christ's 
 universal sovereignty and dominion, and that established with an oath: 
 <I>As I live</I> (saith the Lord), <I>every knee shall bow to me.</I> 
 It is quoted from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:23">Isa. xlv. 23</A>.

 There it is, <I>I have sworn by myself;</I> here it is, <I>As I
 live.</I> So that whenever God saith <I>As I live,</I> it is to be 
 interpreted as swearing by himself; for it is God's prerogative to have 
 life in himself: there is a further ratification of it there, <I>The 
 word is gone out of my mouth.</I> It is a prophecy, in general, of 
 Christ's dominion; and here very fully applied to the judgment of the 
 great day, which will be the highest and most illustrious exercise of 
 that dominion. Here is a proof of Christ's Godhead: he is the Lord and 
 he is God, equal with the Father. Divine honour is due to him, and must 
 be paid. It is paid to God through him as Mediator. God will judge the 
 world by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:31">Acts xvii. 31</A>.

 The bowing of the knee to him, and the confession made with the tongue,
 are but outward expressions of inward adoration and praise. <I>Every 
 knee</I> and <I>every tongue,</I> either freely or by force.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] All his friends do it freely, are made willing in the day of his 
 power. Grace is the soul's cheerful, entire, and avowed subjection to 
 Jesus Christ. <I>First,</I> Bowing to him--the understanding bowed to
 his truths, the will to his laws, the whole man to his authority; and 
 this expressed by the bowing of the knee, the posture of adoration and 
 prayer. It is proclaimed before our Joseph, <I>Bow the knee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:43">Gen. xli. 43</A>.

 Though bodily exercise alone profits little, yet, as it is guided by
 inward fear and reverence, it is accepted. <I>Secondly,</I> Confessing 
 to him--acknowledging his glory, grace, and greatness--acknowledging 
 our own meanness and vileness, confessing our sins to him; so some 
 understand it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] All his foes shall be constrained to do it, whether they will or 
 no. When he shall come in the clouds, and every eye shall see him, 
 then, and not till then, will all those promises which speak of his 
 victories over his enemies and their subjection to him have their full 
 and complete accomplishment; then his foes shall be his footstool, and 
 all his enemies shall lick the dust. Hence he concludes
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 <I>Every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</I> We must 
 not give account for others, nor they for us; but every one for 
 himself. We must give account how we have spent our time, how we have 
 improved our opportunities, what we have done and how we have done it. 
 And therefore, <I>First,</I> We have little to do to judge others, for 
 they are not accountable to us, nor are we accountable for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:6">Gal. ii. 6</A>):

 <I>Whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me, God accepteth no 
 man's person.</I> Whatever they are, and whatever they do, they must 
 give account to their own master, and not to us; if we can in any thing 
 be helpers of their joy, it is well; but we have not dominion over 
 their faith. And, <I>Secondly,</I> We have the more to do to judge 
 ourselves. We have an account of our own to make up, and that is enough 
 for us; let every <I>man prove his own work</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:4">Gal. vi. 4</A>),

 state his own accounts, search his own heart and life; let this take up 
 his thoughts, and he that is strict in judging himself and abasing 
 himself will not be apt to judge and despise his brother. Let all these
 differences be referred to the arbitration of Christ at the great 
 day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Because the stress of Christianity is not to be laid upon these 
 things, nor are they at all essential to religion, either on the one 
 side or on the other. This is his reason 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>),

 which is reducible to this branch of exhortation. Why should you spend 
 your zeal either for or against those things which are so minute and 
 inconsiderable in religion? Some make it a reason why, in case of 
 offence likely to be taken, we should refrain the use of our Christian 
 liberty; but it seems directed in general against that heat about those 
 things which he observed on both sides. <I>The kingdom of God is not 
 meat,</I> &c. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The nature of true Christianity, what it is: it is here called, 
 <I>The kingdom of God;</I> it is a religion intended to rule us, a 
 kingdom: it stands in a true and hearty subjection to God's power and 
 dominion. The gospel dispensation is in a special manner called <I>the 
 kingdom of God,</I> in distinction from the legal dispensation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:2,4:17">Matt. iii. 2; iv. 17</A>.

 <I>First,</I> It is <I>not meat and drink:</I> it does not consist
 either in using or in abstaining from such and such meats and drinks.
 Christianity gives no rule in that case, either in one way or another.
 The Jewish religion consisted much in meats and drinks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10">Heb. ix. 10</A>),

 abstaining from some meats religiously 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:2">Lev. xi. 2</A>),

 eating other meats religiously, as in several of the sacrifices, part 
 of which were to be eaten before the Lord: but all those appointments 
 are now abolished and are no more,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:21,22">Col. ii. 21, 22</A>.

 The matter is left at large. Every <I>creature of God is good,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:4">1 Tim. iv. 4</A>.

 So, as to other things, it is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:6,6:15,1Co+7:19">Gal. v. 6; vi. 15; 1 Cor. vii. 19</A>),

 it is not being of this party and persuasion, of this or the other
 opinion in minor things, that will recommend us to God. It will not be 
 asked at the great day, "Who ate flesh, and who ate herbs?" "Who kept 
 holy days, and who did not?" Nor will it be asked, "Who was conformist 
 and who was non-conformist?" But it will be asked, "Who feared God and 
 worked righteousness, and who did not?" Nothing more destructive to 
 true Christianity than placing it in modes, and forms, and 
 circumstantials, which eat out the essentials. <I>Secondly, It is 
 righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</I> These are some 
 of the essentials of Christianity, things in which all the people of 
 God are agreed, in the pursuit of which we must spend our zeal, and 
 which we must mind with an excelling care. Righteousness, peace, and 
 joy, are very comprehensive words; and each of them includes much, both 
 of the foundation and the superstructure of religion. Might I limit the 
 sense of them, it should be thus:--As to God, our great concern is 
 <I>righteousness</I>--to appear before him justified by the merit of 
 Christ's death, sanctified by the Spirit of his grace; for the 
 righteous Lord loveth righteousness. As to our brethren, it is 
 <I>peace</I>--to live in peace and love, and charity with them, 
 following peace with all men: Christ came into the world to be the
 great peace-maker. As to ourselves, it is <I>joy in the Holy 
 Ghost</I>--that spiritual joy which is wrought by the blessed Spirit in 
 the hearts of believers, which respects God as their reconciled Father 
 and heaven as their expected home. Next to our compliance with God, the 
 life of religion consists in our complacency in him; to delight 
 ourselves always in the Lord. Surely we serve a good Master, who makes 
 peace and joy so essential to our religion. Then and then only we may 
 expect peace and joy in the Holy Ghost when the foundation is laid in 
 righteousness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:17">Isa. xxxii. 17</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> It is in these things to <I>serve Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 to do all this out of respect to Christ himself as our Master, to his 
 will as our rule and to his glory as our end. That which puts an 
 acceptableness upon all our good duties is a regard to Christ in the 
 doing of them. We are to serve his interests and designs in the world, 
 which are in the first place to reconcile us one to another. What is 
 Christianity but the serving of Christ? And we may well afford to serve 
 him who for us and for our salvation took upon him the form of a 
 servant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The advantages of it. He that duly observeth these things, 
 <I>First,</I> Is acceptable to God. God is well pleased with such a 
 one, though he be not in every thing just of our length. He has the 
 love and favour of God; his person, his performances, are accepted of 
 God, and we need no more to make us happy. If God now accepts thy 
 works, thou mayest eat thy bread with joy. Those are most pleasing to 
 God that are best pleased with him; and they are those that abound most 
 in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. <I>Secondly,</I> He is approved of 
 men--of all wise and good men, and the opinion of others is not to be
 regarded. The persons and things which are acceptable to God should be 
 approved of us. Should not we be pleased with that which God is pleased 
 with? What is it to be sanctified, but to be of God's mind? Observe, 
 The approbation of men is not to be slighted; for we must provide 
 things honest in the sight of all men, and study those things that are 
 lovely and of good report: but the acceptance of God is to be desired 
 and aimed at in the first place, because, sooner or later, God will 
 bring all the world to be of his mind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Another rule here given is this, that in these doubtful things every 
 one not only may, but must, walk according to the light that God hath 
 given him. This is laid down 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>,

 <I>Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind;</I> that is, 
 "Practise according to your own judgment in these things, and leave 
 others to do so too. Do not censure the practice of others; let them 
 enjoy their own opinion; if they be persuaded in their own mind that 
 they ought to do so and so, do not condemn them, but, if your sober 
 sentiments be otherwise, do not make their practice a rule to you, any 
 more than you must prescribe yours as a rule to them. Take heed of 
 acting contrary to the dictates of a doubting conscience. First be 
 persuaded that what you do is lawful, before you venture to do it." In 
 doubtful things, it is good keeping on the sure side of the hedge. If a 
 weak Christian doubts whether it be lawful to eat flesh, while he 
 remains under that doubt he had best forbear, till he be fully 
 persuaded in his own mind. We must not pin our faith upon any one's 
 sleeve, nor make the practice of others our rule; but follow the 
 dictates of our own understanding. To this purport he argues,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:14,23"><I>v.</I> 14 and 23</A>,

 which two verses explain this, and give us a rule not to act against
 the dictates,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Of a mistaken conscience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 If a thing be indifferent, so that it is not in itself a sin not to do 
 it, if we really think it a sin to do it it is to us a sin, though not 
 to others, because we act against our consciences, though mistaken and 
 misinformed. He specifies the case in hand, concerning the difference 
 of meats. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] His own clearness in this matter. "<I>I know and am 
 persuaded</I>--I am fully persuaded, I am acquainted with my Christian
 liberty, and am satisfied in it, without any doubt or scruple, that 
 there <I>is nothing unclean of itself,</I> that is, no kind of meat 
 that lies under any ceremonial uncleanness, nor is forbidden to be 
 eaten, if it be food proper for human bodies." Several kinds of meat 
 were forbidden to the Jews, that in that, as in other things, they 
 might be a peculiar and separate people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:44,De+14:2,3">Lev. xi. 44; Deut. xiv. 2, 3</A>.

 Sin had brought a curse upon the whole creation: <I>Cursed is the
 ground for thy sake;</I> the use of the creatures and dominion over 
 them were forfeited, so that to man they were all unclean 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:15">Tit. i. 15</A>),
 
 in token of which God in the ceremonial law prohibited the use of some, 
 to show what he might have done concerning all; but now that Christ has 
 removed the curse the matter is set at large again, and that 
 prohibition is taken away. Therefore Paul says that he was persuaded by 
 the Lord Jesus, not only as the author of that persuasion, but as the 
 ground of it; it was built upon the efficacy of Christ's death, which 
 removed the curse, took off the forfeiture, and restored our right to 
 the creature in general, and consequently put a period to that 
 particular distinguishing prohibition. So that now there is nothing 
 unclean of itself, every creature of God is good; nothing 
 <I>common:</I> so the margin, <B><I>ouden koinon;</I></B> nothing which 
 is common to others to eat, from the use of which the professors of 
 religion are restrained: nothing profane; in this sense the Jews used 
 the word <I>common.</I> It is explained by the word 
 <B><I>akatharton,</I></B> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:14">Acts x. 14</A>,

 nothing <I>common</I> or <I>unclean.</I> It was not only from the
 revelation made to Peter in this matter, but from the tenour and 
 tendency of the whole gospel, and from the manifest design of Christ's 
 death in general, that Paul learned to count nothing common or unclean. 
 This was Paul's own clearness, and he practised accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] But here is a caution he gives to those who had not that clearness 
 in this matter which he had: <I>To him that esteemeth any thing to be 
 unclean,</I> though it be his error, yet <I>to him it is unclean.</I> 
 This particular case, thus determined, gives a general rule, That he 
 who does a thing which he verily believes to be unlawful, however the 
 thing be in itself, to him it is a sin. This arises from that 
 unchangeable law of our creation, which is, that our wills, in all 
 their choices, motions, and directions, should follow the dictates of 
 our understandings. This is the order of nature, which order is broken 
 if the understanding (though misguided) tell us that such a thing is a 
 sin, and yet we will do it. This is a <I>will</I> to do evil; for, if 
 it appears to us to be sin, there is the same pravity and corruption of 
 the will in the doing of it as if really it were a sin; and therefore 
 we ought not to do it. Not that it is in the power of any man's 
 conscience to alter the nature of the action in itself, but only as to 
 himself. It must be understood likewise with this proviso, though men's 
 judgments and opinions may make that which is good in itself to become 
 evil to them, yet they cannot make that which is evil in itself to 
 become good, either in itself or to them. If a man were verily 
 persuaded (it is Dr. Sanderson's instance, sermon on 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:23"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 23</A>)

 that it were evil to ask his father's blessing, that mispersuasion
 would make it become evil to him: but, if he should be as verily
 persuaded that it were good to curse his father, this would not make it
 become good. The Pharisees taught people to plead conscience, when they
 made <I>corban</I> an excuse for denying relief to their parents,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:5,6">Matt. xv. 5, 6</A>.

 But this would not serve any more than Paul's erroneous conscience
 would justify his rage against Christianity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:9">Acts xxvi. 9</A>),
 
 or theirs,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:2">John xvi. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Nor must we act against the dictates of a doubting conscience. In 
 those indifferent things which we are sure it is no sin not to do, and 
 yet are not clear that it is lawful to do them, we must not do them 
 while we continue under those doubts; for he <I>that doubteth is damned 
 if he eat</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 that is, it turns into sin to him; he is <I>damned,</I> 
 <B><I>katakekritai</I></B>--<I>he is condemned</I> of his own 
 conscience, because he <I>eateth not of faith,</I> because he does that 
 which he is not fully persuaded he may lawfully do. He is not clear 
 that it is lawful for him to eat swine's flesh (suppose), and yet is 
 drawn, notwithstanding his doubts, to eat it, because he sees others do 
 it, because he would gratify his appetite with it, or because he would 
 not be reproached for his singularity. Here his own heart cannot but 
 condemn him as a transgressor. Our rule is, to walk as far as we have
 attained, not further,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:15,16">Phil. iii. 15, 16</A>.--

 <I>For whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</I> Taking it in general, it
 is the same with that of the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:6">Heb. xi. 6</A>),

 <I>Without faith it is impossible to please God.</I> Whatever we do in 
 religion, it will not turn to any good account, except we do it from a 
 principle of faith, with a believing regard to the will of Christ as 
 our rule, to the glory of Christ as our end, and to the righteousness 
 of Christ as our plea. Here it seems to be taken more strictly; 
 whatever is not of faith (that is, whatever is done while we are not 
 clearly persuaded of the lawfulness of it), is a sin against 
 conscience. He that will venture to do that which his own conscience 
 suggests to him to be unlawful, when it is not so in itself, will by a 
 like temptation be brought to do that which his conscience tells him is 
 unlawful when it is really so. The spirit of a man is the candle of the 
 Lord, and it is a dangerous thing to debauch and put a force upon 
 conscience, though it be under a mistake. This seems to be the meaning 
 of that aphorism, which sounds somewhat darkly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 <I>Happy is he that condemns not himself in that thing which he 
 allows.</I> Many a one allows himself in practice to do that which yet 
 in his judgment and conscience he condemns himself for--allows it for 
 the sake of the pleasure, profit, or credit of it--allows it in 
 conformity to the custom; and yet whilst he does it, and pleas for it, 
 his own heart gives him the lie, and his conscience condemns him for 
 it. Now, happy is the man who so orders his conversation as not in any 
 action to expose himself to the challenges and reproaches of his own 
 conscience--that does not make his own heart his adversary, as he must 
 needs do who does that which he is not clear he may lawfully do. He is 
 happy that has peace and quietness within, for the testimony of 
 conscience will be a special cordial in troublesome times. Though men 
 condemn us, it is well enough if our own hearts condemn us not,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:21">1 John iii. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Another rule here prescribed is to those who are clear in these 
 matters, and know their Christian liberty, yet to take heed of using it 
 so as to give offence to a weak brother. This is laid down 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>,

 <I>Let us not judge one another any more.</I> "Let it suffice that you 
 have hitherto continued in this uncharitable practice, and do so no 
 more." The better to insinuate the exhortation, he puts himself in; Let 
 us not; as if he had said, "It is what I have resolved against, 
 therefore do you leave it: but <I>judge this rather,</I> instead of 
 censuring the practice of others, let us look to our own, that no 
 <I>man put a stumbling-block, or an occasion to fall, in his brother's 
 way,</I>"--<B><I>proskomma, e skandalon.</I></B> We must take heed of
 saying or doing any thing which may occasion our brother to stumble or 
 fall; the one signifies a less, the other a greater degree of mischief 
 and offence--that which may be an occasion,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Of grief to our brother, "One that is weak, and thinks it unlawful 
 to eat such and such meats, will be greatly troubled to see thee eat 
 them, out of a concern for the honour of the law which he thinks 
 forbids them, and for the good of thy soul which he thinks is wronged 
 by them, especially when thou dost it wilfully and with a seeming 
 presumption, and not with that tenderness and that care to give 
 satisfaction to thy weak brother which would become thee." Christians 
 should take heed of grieving one another, and of saddening the hearts 
 of Christ's little ones. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:6,10">Matt. xviii. 6, 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Of guilt to our brother. The former is a <I>stumbling-block,</I> 
 that gives our brother a great shake, and is a hindrance and 
 discouragement to him; but this is an <I>occasion to fall.</I> "If thy 
 weak brother, purely by thy example and influence, without any 
 satisfaction received concerning his Christian liberty, be drawn to act 
 against his conscience and to walk contrary to the light he has, and so 
 to contract guilt upon his soul, though the thing were lawful to thee, 
 yet not being so to him (he having not yet <I>thereto attained</I>), 
 thou art to be blamed for giving the occasion." See this case 
 explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:9-11">1 Cor. viii. 9-11</A>.

 To the same purport 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 he recommends it to our care not to give offence to any one by the use 
 of lawful things: <I>It is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink 
 wine;</I> these are things lawful indeed and comfortable, but not 
 necessary to the support of human life, and therefore we may, and must, 
 deny ourselves in them, rather than give offence. <I>It is 
 good</I>--pleasing to God, profitable to our brother, and no harm to 
 ourselves. Daniel and his fellows were in better liking with pulse and 
 water than those were who ate the portion of the king's meat. It is a 
 generous piece of self-denial, for which we have Paul's example

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:13">1 Cor. viii. 13</A>),

 <I>If meat make my brother to offend;</I> he does not say, <I>I will
 eat no meat,</I> that is to destroy himself; but <I>I will eat no 
 flesh,</I> that is to deny himself, <I>while the world stands.</I> This 
 is to be extended to all such indifferent things whereby thy brother 
 stumbleth, or is offended, is involved either in sin or in trouble: or 
 <I>is made weak</I>--his graces weakened, his comforts weakened, his 
 resolutions weakened. <I>Is made weak,</I> that is, takes occasion to 
 show his weakness by his censures and scruples. We must not weaken
 those that are weak; that is to quench the smoking flax and to break 
 the bruised reed. Observe the motives to enforce this caution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Consider the royal law of Christian love and charity, which is 
 hereby broken 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>If thy brother be grieved with thy meat</I>--be troubled to see thee 
 eat those things which the law of Moses did forbid, which yet thou 
 mayest lawfully do; possibly thou art ready to say, "Now he talks 
 foolishly and weakly, and it is no great matter what he says." We are 
 apt, in such a case, to lay all the blame on that side. But the reproof 
 is here given to the stronger and more knowing Christian: <I>Now 
 walkest thou not charitably.</I> Thus the apostle takes part with the 
 weakest, and condemns the defect in love on the one side more than the 
 defect in knowledge on the other side; agreeably to his principles 
 elsewhere, that the way of love is the <I>more excellent way,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:31">1 Cor. xii. 31</A>.

 Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:1-3">1 Cor. viii. 1-3</A>.

 <I>Now walkest thou not charitably.</I> Charity to the souls of our
 brethren is the best charity. True love would make us tender of their 
 peace and purity, and beget a regard to their consciences as well as to 
 our own. Christ deals gently with those that have true grace, though 
 they are weak in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Consider the design of Christ's death: <I>Destroy not him with thy 
 meat for whom Christ died,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>First,</I> Drawing a soul to sin threatens the destruction of that 
 soul. By shaking his faith, provoking his passion, and tempting him to 
 act against the light of his own conscience, thou dost, as much as in 
 thee lies, destroy him, giving him an occasion to return to Judaism.
 <B><I>Me apollye.</I></B> It denotes an utter destruction. The 
 beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water; we are not sure that 
 it will stop any where on this side of eternal destruction. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> The consideration of the love of Christ in dying for 
 souls should make us very tender of the happiness and salvation of 
 souls, and careful not to do any thing which may obstruct and hinder 
 them. Did Christ quit a life for souls, such a life, and shall not we 
 quit a morsel of meat for them? Shall we despise those whom Christ 
 valued at so high a rate? Did he think it worth while to deny himself 
 so much for them as to die for them, and shall not we think it worth 
 while to deny ourselves so little for them as abstaining from flesh 
 comes to?--<I>with thy meat.</I> Thou pleadest that it is thy own meat, 
 and thou mayest do what thou wilt with it; but remember that, though 
 the meat is thine, the brother offended by it is Christ's, and a part 
 of his purchase. While thou destroyest thy brother thou art helping 
 forward the devil's design, for he is the great destroyer; and, as much 
 as in thee lies, thou art crossing the design of Christ, for he is the 
 great Saviour, and dost not only offend thy brother, but offend Christ; 
 for the work of salvation is that which his heart is upon. But are any 
 destroyed for whom Christ died? If we understand it of the sufficiency 
 and general intendment of Christ's death, which was to save all upon 
 gospel terms, no doubt but multitudes are. If of the particular 
 determination of the efficacy of his death to the elect, then, though 
 none that were given to Christ shall perish

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:39">John vi. 39</A>),
 
 yet thou mayest, as much as is in thy power, destroy such. No thanks to
 thee if they be not destroyed; by doing that which has a tendency to 
 it, thou dost manifest a great opposition to Christ. Nay, and thou 
 mayest utterly destroy some whose profession may be so justifiable that 
 thou art bound to believe, in a judgment of charity, that Christ died 
 for them. Compare this with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:10,11">1 Cor. viii. 10, 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Consider the work of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>For meat destroy not the work of God</I>--the work of grace, 
 particularly the work of faith in thy brother's soul." The works of 
 peace and comfort are destroyed by such an offence given; take heed of 
 it therefore; do not undo that which God hath done. You should work 
 together with God, do not countermine his work. <I>First,</I> The work 
 of grace and peace is the work of God; it is wrought by him, it is 
 wrought for him; it is a good work of his beginning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:6">Phil. i. 6</A>.
 
 Observe, The same for whom Christ died

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 are here called the work of God; besides the work that is wrought for
 us there is a work to be wrought in us, in order to our salvation. 
 Every saint is God's workmanship, his husbandry, his building,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:10,1Co+3:9">Eph. ii. 10; 1 Cor. iii. 9</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> We must be very careful to do nothing which tends to
 the destruction of this work, either in ourselves or others. We must 
 deny ourselves in our appetites, inclinations, and in the use of 
 Christian liberty, rather than obstruct and prejudice our own or 
 others' grace and peace. Many do for meat and drink destroy the work of 
 God in themselves (nothing more destructive to the soul than pampering
 and pleasing the flesh, and fulfilling the lusts of it), so likewise in 
 others, by wilful offence given. Think what thou destroyest--<I>the 
 work of God,</I> whose work is honourable and glorious; think for what 
 thou destroyest it--<I>for meat,</I> which was but for the belly, and 
 the belly for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] Consider the evil of giving offence, and what an abuse it is of 
 our Christian liberty. He grants that <I>all things indeed are 
 pure.</I> We may lawfully eat flesh, even those meats which were 
 prohibited by the ceremonial law; but, if we abuse this liberty, it 
 turns into sin to us: <I>It is evil to him that eats with offence.</I> 
 Lawful things may be done unlawfully.--<I>Eats with offence,</I> either
 carelessly or designedly giving offence to his brethren. It is 
 observable that the apostle directs his reproof most against those who 
 gave the offence; not as if those were not to be blamed who causelessly 
 and weakly took the offence from their ignorance of Christian liberty, 
 and the want of that charity which is not easily provoked and which 
 thinketh no evil (he several times tacitly reflects upon them), but he 
 directs his speech to the strong, because they were better able to bear 
 the reproof, and to begin the reformation. For the further pressing of 
 this rule, we may here observe two directions which have relation to 
 it:--<I>First, Let not then your good be evil spoken of</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)--

 take heed of doing any thing which may give occasion to others to speak
 evil, either of the Christian religion in general, or of your Christian
 liberty in particular. The gospel is your good; the liberties and
 franchises, the privileges and immunities, granted by it, are your
 good; your knowledge and strength of grace to discern and use your
 liberty in things disputed are your good, a good which the weak brother
 hath not. Now let not this be evil spoken of. It is true we cannot
 hinder loose and ungoverned tongues from speaking evil of us, and of
 the best things we have; but we must not (if we can help it) give them
 any occasion to do it. Let not the reproach arise from any default of
 ours; as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:12">1 Tim. iv. 12</A>,

 <I>Let no man despise thee,</I> that is, do not make thyself
 despicable. So here, Do not use your knowledge and strength in such a 
 manner as to give occasion to people to call it presumption and loose 
 walking, and disobedience to God's law. We must deny ourselves in many 
 cases for the preservation of our credit and reputation, forbearing to 
 do that which we rightly know we may lawfully do, when our doing it may 
 be a prejudice to our good name; as, when it is suspicious and has the 
 appearance of evil, or when it becomes scandalous among good people, or 
 has any way a brand upon it. In such a case we must rather cross 
 ourselves than shame ourselves. Though it be but a little folly, it may 
 be like a dead fly, very prejudicial to one that is in reputation for 
 wisdom and honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:1">Eccl. x. 1</A>.

 We may apply it more generally. We should manage all our good duties in
 such a manner that they may not be evil spoken of. That which for the 
 matter of it is good and unexceptionable may sometimes, by 
 mismanagement, be rendered liable to a great deal of censure and 
 reproach. Good praying, preaching, and discourse, may often, for want 
 of prudence in ordering the time, the expression, and other 
 circumstances to edification, be evil spoken of. It is indeed their
 sin who do speak evil of that which is good for the sake of any such 
 circumstantial errors, but it is our folly if we give any occasion to 
 do so. As we tender the reputation of the good we profess and practise, 
 let us so order it that it may not be evil spoken of. <I>Secondly, Hast 
 thou faith? Have it to thyself before God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 It is not meant of justifying faith (that must not be hid, but 
 manifested by our works), but of a knowledge and persuasion of our 
 Christian liberty in things disputed. "Hast thou clearness in such a 
 particular? Art thou satisfied that thou mayest eat all meats, and 
 observe all days (except the Lord's day) alike? <I>Have it to 
 thyself,</I> that is, enjoy the comfort of it in thy own bosom, and do 
 not trouble others by the imprudent use of it, when it might give 
 offence, and cause thy weak brother to stumble and fall." In these 
 indifferent things, though we must never contradict our persuasion, yet 
 we may sometimes conceal it, when the avowing of it will do more hurt 
 than good. <I>Have it to thyself</I>--a rule to thyself (not to be 
 imposed upon others, or made a rule to them), or a rejoicing to 
 thyself. Clearness in doubtful matters contributes very much to our 
 comfortable walking, as it frees us from those scruples, jealousies, 
 and suspicions, which those who have not such clearness are entangled 
 in endlessly. Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:4">Gal. vi. 4</A>,

 <I>Let every man prove his own work,</I> that is, bring it to the
 touchstone of the word and try it by that so exactly as to be well 
 satisfied in what he does; and then he <I>shall have rejoicing in 
 himself alone, and not in another.</I> Paul had faith in these things: 
 <I>I am persuaded that there is nothing unclean of itself;</I> but he 
 had it to himself, so as not to use his liberty to the offence of 
 others. How happy were it for the church if those that have a clearness 
 in disputable things would be satisfied to have it to themselves before 
 God, and not impose those things upon others, and make them terms of 
 communions, than which nothing is more opposite to Christian liberty, 
 nor more destructive both to the peace of churches and the peace of 
 consciences. That healing method is not the less excellent for being 
 common: in things necessary let there be unity, things unnecessary let 
 there be liberty, and in both let there be charity, then all will be 
 well quickly.--<I>Have it to thyself before God.</I> The end of such 
 knowledge is that, being satisfied in our liberty, we may have a 
 conscience void of offence towards God, and let that content us. That 
 is the true comfort which we have before God. Those are right indeed
 that are so in God's sight.</P>
