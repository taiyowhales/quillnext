 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times
 some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
 spirits, and doctrines of devils;
 &nbsp; 2  Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared
 with a hot iron;
 &nbsp; 3  Forbidding to marry, <I>and commanding</I> to abstain from meats,
 which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them
 which believe and know the truth.

 refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a prophecy of the apostasy of the latter times, which he 
 had spoken of as a thing expected and taken for granted among
 Christians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1-17">2 Thess. ii</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In the close of the foregoing chapter, we had the mystery of 
 godliness summed up; and therefore very fitly, in the beginning of this 
 chapter, we have the mystery of iniquity summed up: <I>The Spirit 
 speaks expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the 
 faith;</I> whether he means the Spirit in the Old Testament, or the 
 Spirit in the prophets of the New Testament, or both. The prophecies 
 concerning antichrist, as well as the prophecies concerning Christ,
 came from the Spirit. The Spirit in both spoke expressly of a general
 apostasy from the faith of Christ and the pure worship of God. This
 should come in the <I>latter times,</I> during the Christian
 dispensation, for these are called the latter days; in the following
 ages of the church, for the mystery of iniquity now began to work.
 <I>Some shall depart from the faith,</I> or there shall be an apostasy
 from the faith. Some, not all; for in the worst of times God will have
 a remnant, according to the election of grace. <I>They shall depart
 from the faith,</I> the faith delivered to the saints 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:3">Jude 3</A>),

 which was delivered at once, the sound doctrine of the gospel.
 <I>Giving heed to seducing spirits,</I> men who pretended to the 
 Spirit, but were not really guided by the Spirit,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:1">1 John iv. 1</A>.

 <I>Beloved, believe not every spirit,</I> every one who pretends to the 
 Spirit. Now here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. One of the great instances of the apostasy, namely, giving heed to 
 doctrines of demons, or concerning demons; that is, those doctrines 
 which teach the worship of saints and angels, as a middle sort of 
 deities, between the immortal God and mortal men, such as the heathen 
 called demons, and worshipped under that notion. Now this plainly 
 agrees to the church of Rome, and it was one of the first steps towards 
 that great apostasy, the enshrining of the relics of martyrs, paying 
 divine honours to them, erecting altars, burning incense, consecrating 
 images and temples, and making prayers and praises to the honour of 
 saints departed. This demon-worship is paganism revived, the image of 
 the first beast.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The instruments of promoting and propagating this apostasy and 
 delusion. 

 (1.) It will be done by hypocrisy of those that speak lies, the agents 
 and emissaries of Satan, who promote these delusions by lies and 
 forgeries and pretended miracles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It is done by their hypocrisy, professing honour to Christ, and yet at 
 the same time fighting against all his anointed offices, and corrupting 
 or profaning all his ordinances. This respects also the hypocrisy of 
 those who have <I>their consciences seared with a red-hot iron,</I> who 
 are perfectly lost to the very first principles of virtue and moral 
 honesty. If men had not their consciences seared as with a hot iron, 
 they could never maintain a power to dispense with oaths for the good 
 of the catholic cause, could never maintain that no faith is to be kept 
 with heretics, could never divest themselves of all remains of humanity 
 and compassion, and clothe themselves with the most barbarous cruelty, 
 under pretence of promoting the interest of the church.

 (2.) Another part of their character is that they forbid to marry, 
 forbid their clergy to marry, and speak very reproachfully of marriage, 
 though an ordinance of God; and that they command <I>to abstain from 
 meats,</I> and place religion in such abstinence at certain times and 
 seasons, only to exercise a tyranny over the consciences of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. On the whole observe, 

 (1.) The apostasy of the latter times should not surprise us, because 
 it was expressly foretold by the Spirit. 

 (2.) The Spirit is God, otherwise he could not certainly foresee such 
 distant events, which as to us are uncertain and contingent, depending 
 on the tempers, humours, and lusts of men. 

 (3.) The difference between the predictions of the Spirit and the 
 oracles of the heathen is remarkable; the Spirit speaks expressly, but 
 the oracles of the heathen were always doubtful and uncertain. 

 (4.) It is comfortable to think that in such general apostasies all are 
 not carried away, but only some. 

 (5.) It is common for seducers and deceivers to pretend to the Spirit, 
 which is a strong presumption that all are convinced that this is the 
 most likely to work in us an approbation of what pretends to come from 
 the Spirit. 

 (6.) Men must be hardened, and their consciences seared, before they 
 can depart from the faith, and draw in others to side with them. 

 (7.) It is a sign that men have departed from the faith when they will
 command what God has forbidden, such as saint and angel or 
 demon-worship; and forbid what God has allowed or commanded, such as 
 marriage and meats.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Having mentioned their hypocritical fastings, the apostle takes 
 occasion to lay down the doctrine of the Christian liberty, which we 
 enjoy under the gospel, of using God's good creatures,--that, whereas
 under the law there was a distinction of meats between clean and 
 unclean (such sorts of flesh they might eat, and such they might not 
 eat), all this is now taken away; and we are to call nothing common or
 unclean, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:15">Acts x. 15</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 1. We are to look upon our food as that which God has created; we have
 it from him, and therefore must use it for him.

 2. God, in making those things, had a special regard to <I>those who
 believe and know the truth,</I> to good Christians, who have a covenant 
 right to the creatures, whereas others have only a common right. 

 3. What God has created is to be <I>received with thanksgiving.</I> We
 must not refuse the gifts of God's bounty, nor be scrupulous in making 
 differences where God has made none; but receive them, and be thankful, 
 acknowledging the power of God the Maker of them, and the bounty of God 
 the giver of them: <I>Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be 
 refused,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This plainly sets us at liberty from all the distinctions of meats 
 appointed by the ceremonial law, as particularly that of swine's flesh, 
 which the Jews were forbidden to eat, but which is allowed to us 
 Christians, by this rule, <I>Every creature of God is good,</I> &c. 
 Observe, God's good creatures are then good, and doubly sweet to us, 
 when they are received with thanksgiving.--<I>For it is sanctified by 
 the word of God and prayer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It is a desirable thing to have a sanctified use of our 
 creature-comforts. Now they are sanctified to us,

 (1.) By the word of God; not only his permission, allowing us the 
 liberty of the use of these things, but his promise to feed us with 
 food convenient for us. This gives us a sanctified use of our
 creature-comforts. 

 (2.) By prayer, which blesses our meat to us. The word of God and 
 prayer must be brought to our common actions and affairs, and then we 
 do all in faith. Here observe, 

 [1.] Every creature is God's, for he made all. <I>Every beast in the
 forest is mine</I> (says God), <I>and the cattle upon a thousand hills. 
 I know all the fowls of the mountains, and the wild beasts of the field 
 are mine,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:10,11">Ps. l. 10, 11</A>.

 [2.] Every creature of God is good: when the blessed God took a survey 
 of all his works, God saw all that was made, and, behold, it was very 
 good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:31">Gen. i. 31</A>.

 [3.] The blessing of God makes every creature nourishing to us; man 
 lives not by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the 
 mouth of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:4">Matt. iv. 4</A>),

 and therefore nothing ought to be refused.

 [4.] We ought therefore to ask his blessing by prayer, and so to 
 sanctify the creatures we receive by prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou
 shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the
 words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast
 attained.
 &nbsp; 7  But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise
 thyself <I>rather</I> unto godliness.
 &nbsp; 8  For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is
 profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now
 is, and of that which is to come.
 &nbsp; 9  This <I>is</I> a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
 &nbsp; 10  For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we
 trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially
 of those that believe.
 &nbsp; 11  These things command and teach.
 &nbsp; 12  Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
 believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
 faith, in purity.
 &nbsp; 13  Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
 doctrine.
 &nbsp; 14  Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee
 by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
 &nbsp; 15  Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them;
 that thy profiting may appear to all.
 &nbsp; 16  Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in
 them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them
 that hear thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle would have Timothy to instil into the minds of Christians 
 such sentiments as might prevent their being seduced by the judaizing 
 teachers. Observe, Those are good ministers of Jesus Christ who are 
 diligent in their work; not that study to advance new notions, but that 
 <I>put the brethren in remembrance of those things which they have 
 received and heard. Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always 
 in remembrance of these things, though you knew them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:12">2 Pet. i. 12</A>.
 
 And elsewhere, <I>I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:1">2 Pet. iii. 1</A>.

 And, says the apostle Jude, <I>I will therefore put you in
 remembrance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:5">Jude 5</A>.

 You see that the apostles and apostolical men reckoned it a main part
 of their work to put their hearers in remembrance; for we are apt to
 forget, and slow to learn and remember, the things of God.--<I>Nourished
 up in the words of faith and good doctrine, whereunto thou hast 
 attained.</I> Observe, 

 1. Even ministers themselves have need to be growing and increasing in
 the knowledge of Christ and his doctrine: they must be nourished up in 
 the words of faith. 

 2. The best way for ministers to grow in knowledge and faith is to put
 the brethren in remembrance; while we teach others, we teach ourselves. 
 
 3. Those whom ministers teach are brethren, and are to be treated like
 brethren; for ministers are not lords of God's heritage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Godliness is here pressed upon him and others: <I>Refuse profane and 
 old wives' sayings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>,

 The Jewish traditions, which some people fill their heads with, have 
 nothing to do with them. <I>But exercise thyself rather unto 
 godliness;</I> that is, mind practical religion. Those who would be 
 godly must exercise themselves unto godliness; it requires a constant 
 exercise. The reason is taken from the fain of godliness; <I>bodily 
 exercise profits little,</I> or for a little time. Abstinence from 
 meats and marriage, and the like, though they pass for acts of 
 mortification and self-denial, yet profit little, they turn to little 
 account. What will it avail us to mortify the body if we do not mortify 
 sin? Observe, 

 1. There is a great deal to be got by godliness; it will be of use to
 us in the whole of our life, for it has <I>the promise of the life that 
 now is, and of that which is to come.</I> 

 2. The gain of godliness lies much in the promise: and the promises
 made to godly people relate to the life that now is, but especially 
 they relate to the life that is to come. Under the Old Testament the 
 promises were mostly of temporal blessings, but under the New Testament 
 of spiritual and eternal blessings. If godly people have but little of 
 the good things of the life that now is, yet it shall be made up to 
 them in the good things of the life that is to come. 

 3. There were profane and old wives' fables in the days of the
 apostles; and Timothy, though an excellent man, was not above such a 
 word of advice, <I>Refuse profane,</I> &c.

 4. It is not enough that we refuse profane and old wives' fables, but
 we must exercise ourselves to godliness; we must not only cease to do 
 evil, but we must learn to do well 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:16,17">Isa. i. 16, 17</A>),

 and we must make a practice of exercising ourselves to godliness. And, 
 
 5. Those who are truly godly shall not be losers at last, whatever
 becomes of those who content themselves with bodily exercise, for 
 godliness has the promise, &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The encouragement which we have to proceed in the ways of 
 godliness, and to exercise ourselves to it, notwithstanding the 
 difficulties and discouragements that we meet with in it. He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 that it <I>is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life 
 which now is.</I> But the question is, Will the profit balance the 
 loss? For, if it will not, it is not profit. Yes, we are sure it will. 
 Here is another of Paul's faithful sayings, worthy of all 
 acceptation--that all our labours and losses in the service of God and 
 the work of religion will be abundantly recompensed, so that though we 
 lose for Christ we shall not lose by him. <I>Therefore we labour and 
 suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Godly people must labour and expect reproach; they must do well, and 
 yet expect at the same time to suffer ill: toil and trouble are to be 
 expected by us in this world, not only as men, but as saints.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Those who labour and suffer reproach in the service of God and the 
 work of religion may depend upon the living God that they shall not 
 lose by it. Let this encourage them, <I>We trust in the living God.</I> 
 The consideration of this, that the God who has undertaken to be our 
 pay-master is the living God, who does himself live for ever and is the 
 fountain of life to all who serve him, should encourage us in all our 
 services and in all our sufferings for him, especially considering that 
 he is <I>the Saviour of all men.</I> 

 (1.) By his providences he protects the persons, and prolongs the 
 lives, of the children of men.

 (2.) He has a general good-will to the eternal salvation of all men 
 thus far that he is not willing that any should perish, but that all 
 should come to repentance. He desires not the death of sinners; he is 
 thus far the Saviour of all men that none are left in the same 
 desperate condition that fallen angels are in. Now, if he be thus the
 Saviour of all men, we may hence infer that much more he will be the 
 rewarder of those who seek and serve him; if he has such a good-will 
 for all his creatures, much more will he provide well for those who are 
 new creatures, who are born again. He is the Saviour of all men, but 
 <I>especially of those that believe;</I> and the salvation he has in 
 store for those that believe is sufficient to recompense them for all 
 their services and sufferings. Here we see, 

 [1.] The life of a Christian is a life of labour and suffering: <I>We 
 labour and suffer.</I>

 [2.] The best we can expect to suffer in the present life is reproach 
 for our well-doing, for our work of faith and labour of love.

 [3.] True Christians trust in the living God; for cursed is the man 
 that trusts in man, or in any but the living God; and those that trust 
 in him shall never be ashamed. <I>Trust in him at all times.</I>

 [4.] God is the general Saviour of all men, as he has put them into a 
 salvable state; but he is in a particular manner the Saviour of true 
 believers; there is then a general and a special redemption.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He concludes the chapter with an exhortation to Timothy,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To <I>command and teach these things</I> that he had now been 
 teaching him. "Command them to exercise themselves unto godliness, 
 teach them the profit of it, and that if they serve God they serve one 
 who will be sure to bear them out."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To conduct himself with that gravity and prudence which might gain 
 him respect, notwithstanding his youth: "<I>Let no man despise thy 
 youth;</I> that is, give no man an occasion to despise thy youth." 
 Men's youth will not be despised if they do not by youthful vanities 
 and follies make themselves despicable; and this men may do who are 
 old, who may therefore thank themselves if they be despised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. To confirm his doctrine by a good example: <I>Be thou an example of 
 the believers,</I> &c. Observe, Those who teach by their doctrine must 
 teach by their live, else they pull down with one hand what they build 
 up with the other: they must be examples both <I>in word and 
 conversation.</I> Their discourse must be edifying, and this will be a 
 good example: their conversation must be strict, and this will be a 
 good example: they must be examples <I>in charity,</I> or love to God 
 and all good men, examples <I>in spirit,</I> that is, in 
 spiritual-mindedness, in spiritual worship,--<I>in faith,</I> that is,
 in the profession of Christian faith,--and <I>in purity</I> or
 chastity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He charges him to study hard: <I>Till I come, give attendance to 
 reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, to meditation upon these 
 things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Though Timothy had extraordinary gifts, yet he must use ordinary means. 
 Or it may be meant of the public reading of the scriptures; he must 
 <I>read and exhort,</I> that is, read and expound, read and press what 
 he read upon them; he must expound it both by way of exhortation and by 
 way of doctrine; he must teach them both what to do and what to 
 believe. Observe,

 (1.) Ministers must teach and command the things that they are
 themselves taught and commanded to do; they must teach people to 
 observe all things whatsoever Christ has commanded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20">Matt. xxviii. 20</A>.

 (2.) The best way for ministers to avoid being despised is to teach and
 practise the things that are given them in charge. No wonder if 
 ministers are despised who do not teach these things, or who, instead 
 of being examples of good to believers, act directly contrary to the 
 doctrines they preach; for ministers are to be ensamples of their 
 flock. 

 (3.) Those ministers that are the best accomplished for their work must 
 yet mind their studies, that they may be improving in knowledge; and 
 they must mind also their work; they are to give attendance to reading, 
 to exhortation, to doctrine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He charges him to beware of negligence: <I>Neglect not the gift that 
 is in thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The gifts of God will wither if they be neglected. It may be understood 
 either of the office to which he was advanced, or of his qualifications 
 for that office; if of the former, it was ordination in an ordinary 
 way; if of the latter, it was extraordinary. It seems to be the former, 
 for it was by <I>laying on of hands,</I> &c. Here see the scripture-way 
 of ordination: it was by the laying on of hands, and the laying on of 
 the hands of the presbytery. Observe, Timothy was ordained by men in
 office. It was an extraordinary gift that we read of elsewhere as being 
 conferred on him by the laying on of Paul's hands, but he was invested 
 in the office of the ministry by the laying on of the hands of the 
 presbytery.

 (1.) We may note, The office of the ministry is a gift, it is the gift 
 of Christ; when he ascended on high, he received gifts for men, and he 
 gave some apostles, and some pastors and teachers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8,11">Eph. iv. 8, 11</A>),

 and this was a very kind gift to his church. 

 (2.) Ministers ought not to neglect the gift bestowed upon them,
 whether by gift we are here to understand the office of the ministry or 
 the qualifications for the office; neither the one nor the other must 
 be neglected. 

 (3.) Though there was a prophecy in the case of Timothy (the gift was
 given by prophecy), yet this was accompanied by the laying on of the 
 hands of the presbytery, that is, a number of presbyters; the office 
 was conveyed to him this way; and I should think here is a sufficient 
 warrant for ordination by presbyters, since it does not appear that 
 Paul was concerned in Timothy's ordination. It is true, extraordinary 
 gifts were conferred on him by the laying on of the apostle's hands 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:6">2 Tim. i. 6</A>),

 but, if he was concerned in his ordination, the presbytery was not 
 excluded, for that is particularly mentioned, whence it seems pretty 
 evident that the presbytery have the inherent power of ordination.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Having this work committed to him, he must <I>give himself 
 wholly</I> to it: "Be wholly in those things, <I>that thy profiting may 
 appear.</I>" He was a wise knowing man, and yet must still be 
 profiting, and make it appear that he improved in knowledge. Observe, 
 
 (1.) Ministers are to be much in meditation. They are to consider
 beforehand how and what they must speak. They are to meditate on the 
 great trust committed to them, on the worth and value of immortal 
 souls, and on the account they must give at the last. 

 (2.) Ministers must be wholly in these things, they must mind these 
 things as their principal work and business: <I>Give thyself wholly to 
 them.</I> 

 (3.) By this means their profiting will appear in all things, as well a 
 to all persons; this is the way for them to profit in knowledge and 
 grace, and also to profit others.</P>

 and to the doctrine,</I> consider what thou preachest; <I>continue in

 (3.) Ministers in preaching should aim at the salvation of those that 
 hear them, next to the salvation of their own souls. 

 (4.) The best way to answer both these ends is to take heed to
 ourselves, &c.</P>
