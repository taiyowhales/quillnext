 ought to be no prejudice to the credit and authority of this book that 
 it has been rejected by men of corrupt minds, such as Cerdon and 
 Marcion, and doubted of by men of a better character; for this has been 
 the lot of other parts of holy writ, and of the divine Author of the 
 scripture himself. The image and superscription of this book are truly 
 sacred and divine, and the matter of it agreeable with other 
 prophetical books, particularly Ezekiel and Daniel; the church of God 
 has generally received it, and found good counsel and great comfort in 
 it. From the beginning, the church of God has been blessed with 
 prophecy. That glorious prediction of breaking the serpent's head was 
 the stay and support of the patriarchal age; and the many prophecies 
 there were concerning the Messiah to come were the gospel of the Old 
 Testament. Christ himself prophesied of the destruction of Jerusalem; 
 and, about the time in which that was accomplished, he entrusted the 
 apostle John with this book of revelation, to deliver it to the church 
 as a prediction of the most important events that should happen to it 
 to the end of time, for the support of the faith of his people and the 
 direction of their hope. It is called the <I>Revelation,</I> because 
 God therein discovers those things which could never have been sifted 
 out by the reasonings of human understanding, those deep things of God 
 which no man knows, but the Spirit of God, and those to whom he reveals 
 them.</P>
