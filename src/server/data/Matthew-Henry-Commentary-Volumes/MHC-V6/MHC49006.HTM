 In this chapter,

 I. The apostle proceeds in the exhortation to relative duties which he
 began in the former, particularly he insists on the duties of children
 and parents, and of servants and masters,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. He exhorts and directs Christians how to behave themselves in the
 spiritual warfare with the enemies of their souls; and to the exercise
 of several Christian graces, which he proposes to them as so many
 pieces of spiritual armour, to preserve and defend them in the conflict,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:10-18">ver. 10-18</A>.

 III. We have here the conclusion of the epistle, in which he takes his
 leave of them, recommending himself to the prayers of the believing
 Ephesians, and praying for them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
 &nbsp; 2  Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment
 with promise;)
 &nbsp; 3  That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on
 the earth.
 &nbsp; 4  And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but
 bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
 &nbsp; 5  Servants, be obedient to them that are <I>your</I> masters
 according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of
 your heart, as unto Christ;
 &nbsp; 6  Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of
 Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
 &nbsp; 7  With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:
 &nbsp; 8  Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same
 shall he receive of the Lord, whether <I>he be</I> bond or free.
 &nbsp; 9  And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing
 threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither
 is there respect of persons with him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have further directions concerning relative duties, in which 
 the apostle is very particular.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The duty of children to their parents. <I>Come, you children, 
 hearken to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</I> The great 
 duty of children is to obey their parents 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 parents being the instruments of their being, God and nature having 
 given them an authority to command, in subserviency to God; and, if 
 children will be obedient to their pious parents, they will be in a 
 fair way to be pious as they are. That obedience which God demands from 
 their children, in their behalf, includes an inward reverence, as well 
 as the outward expressions and acts. Obey in the Lord. Some take this 
 as a limitation, and understand it thus: "as far as is consistent with 
 your duty to God." We must not disobey our heavenly Father in obedience 
 to earthly parents; for our obligation to God is prior and superior to 
 all others. I take it rather as a reason: "Children, obey your
 parents; for the Lord has commanded it: obey them therefore for the 
 Lord's sake, and with an eye to him." Or it may be a particular 
 specification of the general duty: "Obey your parents, especially in 
 those things which relate to the Lord. Your parents teach you good 
 manners, and therein you must obey them. They teach you what is for 
 your health, and in this you must obey them: but the chief things in 
 which you are to do it are the things pertaining to the Lord." 
 Religious parents charge their children to keep the ways of the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:19">Gen. xviii. 19</A>.

 They command them to be found in the way of their duty towards God, and
 to take heed of those sins most incident to their age; in these things 
 especially they must see that they be obedient. There is a general 
 reason given: <I>For this is right,</I> there is a natural equity in 
 it, God has enjoined it, and it highly becomes Christians. It is the 
 order of nature that parents command and children obey. Though this may 
 seem a hard saying, yet it is duty, and it must be done by such as 
 would please God and approve themselves to him. For the proof of this 
 the apostle quotes the law of the fifth commandment, which Christ was 
 so far from designing to abrogate and repeal that he came to confirm 
 it, as appears by his vindicating it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:4">Matt. xv. 4</A>,

 &c. <I>Honour thy father and mother</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 which honour implies reverence, obedience, and relief and maintenance, 
 if these be needed. The apostle adds, <I>which is the first
 commandment with promise.</I> Some little difficulty arises from this, 
 which we should not overlook, because some who plead for the lawfulness 
 of images bring this as a proof that we are not bound by <I>the second 
 commandment.</I> But there is no manner of force in the argument. The 
 second commandment has not a particular promise; but only a general 
 declaration or assertion, which relates to the whole law of God's 
 keeping mercy for thousands. And then by this is not meant the first
 commandment of the decalogue that has a promise, for there is no other 
 after it that has, and therefore it would be improper to say it is the 
 first; but the meaning may be this: "This is a prime or chief 
 commandment, and it has a promise; it is the first commandment in the 
 second table, and it has a promise." The promise is, <I>That it may be 
 well with thee,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Observe, Whereas the promise in the commandment has reference to the 
 land of Canaan, the apostle hereby shows that this and other promises 
 which we have in the Old Testament relating to the land of Canaan are 
 to be understood more generally. That you may not think that the Jews
 only, to whom God gave the land of Canaan, were bound by the fifth 
 commandment, he here gives it a further sense, <I>That it may be well 
 with thee,</I> &c. Outward prosperity and long life are blessings 
 promised to those who keep this commandment. This is the way to have
 it well with us, and obedient children are often rewarded with outward 
 prosperity. Not indeed that it is always so; there are instances of 
 such children who meet with much affliction in this life: but 
 <I>ordinarily</I> obedience is thus rewarded, and, where it is not, it 
 is made up with something better. Observe,

 1. The gospel has its temporal promises, as well as spiritual ones. 

 2. Although the authority of God be sufficient to engage us in our
 duty, yet we are allowed to have respect to the promised reward: and, 
 
 3. Though it contains some temporal advantage, even this may be
 considered as a motive and encouragement to our obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The duty of parents: <I>And you fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Or, you parents,
 
 1. "<I>Do not provoke your children to wrath.</I> Though God has given 
 you power, you must not abuse that power, remembering that your 
 children are, in a particular manner, pieces of yourselves, and 
 therefore ought to be governed with great tenderness and love. Be not 
 impatient with them, use no unreasonable severities and lay no rigid 
 injunctions upon them. When you caution them, when you counsel them, 
 when you reprove them, do it in such a manner as not to <I>provoke them 
 to wrath.</I> In all such cases deal prudently and wisely with them, 
 endeavouring to convince their judgments and to work upon their 
 reason." 

 2. "<I>Bring them up</I> well, <I>in the nurture and admonition of the
 Lord,</I> in the discipline of proper and of compassionate correction, 
 and in the knowledge of that duty which God requires of them and by 
 which they may become better acquainted with him. Give them a good 
 education." It is the great duty of parents to be careful in the 
 education of their children: "Not only bring them up, as the brutes do, 
 taking care to provide for them; but bring them up in nurture and 
 admonition, in such a manner as is suitable to their reasonable 
 natures. Nay, not only bring them up as men, in nurture and admonition, 
 but as Christians, in the admonition of the Lord. Let them have a 
 religious education. Instruct them to fear sinning; and inform them of, 
 and excite them to, the whole of their duty towards God."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The duty of servants. This also is summed up in one word, which 
 is, <I>obedience.</I> He is largest on this article, as knowing there 
 was the greatest need of it. These servants were generally slaves. 
 Civil servitude is not inconsistent with Christian liberty. Those may 
 be the Lord's freemen who are slaves to men. "<I>Your masters according 
 to the flesh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 that is, who have the command of your bodies, but not of your souls and 
 consciences: God alone has dominion over these." Now, with respect to 
 servants, he exhorts, 

 1. That they obey <I>with fear and trembling.</I> They are to reverence
 those who are over them, fearing to displease them, and trembling lest 
 they should justly incur their anger and indignation. 

 2. That they be sincere in their obedience: <I>In singleness of
 heart;</I> not pretending obedience when they design disobedience, but 
 serving them with faithfulness. 

 3. They should have an eye to Jesus Christ in all the service that they
 perform to their masters

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>),

 <I>doing service as to the Lord, and not to men;</I> that is, not to 
 men only or principally. When servants, in the discharge of the duty of 
 their places, have an eye to Christ, this puts an honour upon their 
 obedience, and an acceptableness into it. Service done to their earthly 
 masters, with an eye to him, becomes acceptable service to him also. To 
 have an eye to Christ is to remember that he sees them and is ever 
 present with them, and that his authority obliges them to a faithful 
 and conscientious discharge of the duties of their station. 

 4. They must not serve their masters <I>with eye-service</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)--

 that is, only when their master's eye is upon them; but they must be as
 conscientious in the discharge of their duty, when they are absent and 
 out of the way, because then their Master in heaven beholds them: and 
 therefore they must not act as <I>men-pleasers</I>--as though they had
 no regard to the pleasing of God, and approving themselves to him, if 
 they can impose upon their masters. Observe, A steady regard to the 
 Lord Jesus Christ will make men faithful and sincere in every station 
 of life. 

 5. What they do they must do cheerfully: <I>Doing the will of God from
 the heart,</I> serving their masters as God wills they should, not 
 grudgingly, nor by constraint, but from a principle of love to them and 
 their concerns. This is <I>doing it with good-will</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 which will make their service easy to themselves, pleasing to their 
 masters, and acceptable to the Lord Christ. There should be 
 <I>good-will</I> to their masters, good-will to the families they are 
 in; and especially a readiness to do their duty to God. Observe, 
 Service, performed with conscience, and from a regard to God, though it 
 be to unrighteous masters, will be accounted by Christ as service done 
 to himself. 

 6. Let faithful servants trust God for their wages, while they do their
 duty in his fear: <I>Knowing that whatsoever good thing</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 how poor and mean soever it may be, considered in itself,--<I>the same 
 shall he receive of the Lord,</I> that is, by a metonymy, the reward of 
 the same. Though his master on earth should neglect or abuse him, 
 instead of rewarding him, he shall certainly be rewarded by the Lord 
 Christ, <I>whether he be bond or free,</I> whether he be a poor 
 bond-servant or a freeman or master. Christ regards not these 
 differences of men at present; nor will he in the great and final 
 judgment. You think, "A prince, or a magistrate, or a minister, that 
 does his duty here, will be sure to receive his reward in heaven: but 
 what capacity am I, a poor servant, in, of recommending myself to the 
 favour of God." Why, God will as certainly reward thee for the meanest 
 drudgery that is done from a sense of duty and with an eye to himself.
 And what can be said more proper either to engage or to encourage 
 servants to their duty?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The duty of masters: "<I>And you masters, do the same things unto 
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 that is, act after the same manner. Be just to them, as you expect they 
 should be to you: show the like good-will and concern for them, and be 
 careful herein to approve yourselves to God." Observe, Masters are 
 under as strict obligations to discharge their duty to their servants 
 as servants are to be obedient and dutiful to them. "<I>Forbearing 
 threatening;</I> <B><I>anientes</I></B>--<I>moderating</I> threatening, 
 and remitting the evils with which you threaten them. Remember that 
 your servants are made of the same mould with yourselves, and therefore 
 be not tyrannical and imperious over them, <I>knowing that your Master 
 also is in heaven:</I>" some copies read, both <I>your</I> and 
 <I>their</I> Master. "You have a Master to obey who makes this your 
 duty; and you and they are but fellow-servants in respect of Christ. 
 You will be as punishable by him, for the neglect of your duty, or for 
 acting contrary to it, as any others of meaner condition in the world. 
 You are therefore to show favour to others, as ever you expect to find 
 favour with him; and you will never be a match for him, though you may 
 be too hard for your servants." <I>Neither is there respect of persons 
 with him;</I> a rich, a wealthy, and a dignified master, if he be 
 unjust, imperious, and abusive, is not a jot the nearer being accepted 
 of God for his riches, wealth, and honour. He will call masters and 
 servants to an impartial account for their conduct one to another, and 
 will neither spare the former because they are more advanced nor be 
 severe towards the latter because they are inferior and mean in the 
 world. If both masters and servants would consider their relation and 
 obligation to God and the account they must shortly give to him, they 
 would be more careful of their duty to each other. Thus the apostle 
 concludes his exhortation to relative duties.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the
 power of his might.
 &nbsp; 11  Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
 against the wiles of the devil.
 &nbsp; 12  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
 principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
 darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
 <I>places.</I>
 &nbsp; 13  Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may
 be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to
 stand.
 &nbsp; 14  Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth,
 and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
 &nbsp; 15  And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of
 peace;
 &nbsp; 16  Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be
 able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
 &nbsp; 17  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the
 Spirit, which is the word of God:
 &nbsp; 18  Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the
 Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and
 supplication for all saints;
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a general exhortation to constancy in our Christian course, and 
 to encourage in our Christian warfare. Is not our life a warfare? It is 
 so; for we struggle with the common calamities of human life. Is not 
 our religion much more a warfare? It is so; for we struggle with the 
 opposition of the powers of darkness, and with many enemies who would 
 keep us from God and heaven. We have enemies to fight against, a 
 captain to fight for, a banner to fight under, and certain rules of war 
 by which we are to govern ourselves. "<I>Finally, my brethren</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 it yet remains that you apply yourselves to your work and duty as 
 Christian soldiers." Now it is requisite that a soldier be both 
 stout-hearted and well armed. If Christians be soldiers of Jesus 
 Christ,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They must see that they be stout-hearted. This is prescribed here: 
 <I>Be strong in the Lord,</I> &c. Those who have so many battles to 
 fight, and who, in their way to heaven, must dispute every pass, with 
 dint of sword, have need of a great deal of courage. <I>Be strong 
 therefore,</I> strong for service, strong for suffering, strong for 
 fighting. Let a soldier be ever so well armed without, if he have not 
 within a good heart, his armour will stand him in little stead. Note, 
 spiritual strength and courage are very necessary for our spiritual 
 warfare. Be strong in the Lord, either in his cause and for his sake or 
 rather in his strength. We have no sufficient strength of our own. Our 
 natural courage is as perfect cowardice, and our natural strength as 
 perfect weakness; but all our sufficiency is of God. In his strength we 
 must go forth and go on. By the actings of faith, we must fetch in 
 grace and help from heaven to enable us to do that which of ourselves 
 we cannot do, in our Christian work and warfare. We should stir up 
 ourselves to resist temptations in a reliance upon God's 
 all-sufficiency and the omnipotence of his might.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They must be well armed: "<I>Put on the whole armour of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 make use of all the proper defensitives and weapons for repelling the 
 temptations and stratagems of Satan--get and exercise all the Christian 
 graces, the whole armour, that no part be naked and exposed to the 
 enemy." Observe, Those who would approve themselves to have true grace 
 must aim at all grace, the whole armour. It is called the armour of 
 God, because he both prepares and bestows it. We have no armour of our 
 own that will be armour of proof in a trying time. Nothing will stand 
 us in stead but the armour of God. This armour is prepared for us, but 
 we must put it on; that is, we must pray for grace, we must use the 
 grace given us, and draw it out into act and exercise as there is 
 occasion. The reason assigned why the Christian should be completely 
 armed is <I>that he may be able to stand against the wiles of the 
 devil</I>--that he may be able to hold out, and to overcome, 
 notwithstanding all the devil's assaults, both of force and fraud, all 
 the deceits he puts upon us, all the snares he lays for us, and all his 
 machinations against us. This the apostle enlarges upon here, and 
 shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What our danger is, and what need we have to put on this whole 
 armour, considering what sort of enemies we have to deal with--the devil
 and all the powers of darkness: <I>For we wrestle not against flesh and 
 blood,</I> &c., 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The combat for which we are to be prepared is not against ordinary
 human enemies, not barely against men compounded of <I>flesh and 
 blood,</I> nor against our own corrupt natures singly considered, but 
 against the several ranks of devils, who have a government which they 
 exercise in this world.

 (1.) We have to do with a subtle enemy, an enemy who uses wiles and 
 stratagems, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He has a thousand ways of beguiling unstable souls: hence he is called 
 a serpent for subtlety, an old serpent, experienced in the art and 
 trade of tempting.

 (2.) He is a powerful enemy: <I>Principalities,</I> and <I>powers,</I> 
 and <I>rulers.</I> They are numerous, they are vigorous; and rule in 
 those heathen nations which are yet in darkness. The dark parts of the 
 world are the seat of Satan's empire. Yea, they are usurping princes 
 over all men who are yet in a state of sin and ignorance. Satan's is a 
 kingdom of darkness; whereas Christ's is a kingdom of light. 

 (3.) They are spiritual enemies: <I>Spiritual wickedness in high 
 places,</I> or wicked spirits, as some translate it. The devil is a
 spirit, a wicked spirit; and our danger is the greater from our enemies 
 because they are unseen, and assault us ere we are aware of them. The 
 devils are wicked spirits, and they chiefly annoy the saints with, and 
 provoke them to, spiritual wickednesses, pride, envy, malice, &c. These 
 enemies are said to be <I>in high places,</I> or in heavenly places, so 
 the word is, taking heaven (as one says) for the whole <I>expansum,</I> 
 or spreading out of the air between the earth and the stars, the air 
 being the place from which the devils assault us. Or the meaning may 
 be, "<I>We wrestle</I> about heavenly places or heavenly things;" so 
 some of the ancients interpret it. Our enemies strive to prevent our 
 ascent to heaven, to deprive us of heavenly blessings and to obstruct 
 our communion with heaven. They assault us in the things that belong to 
 our souls, and labour to deface the heavenly image in our hearts; and 
 therefore we have need to be upon our guard against them. We have need 
 of faith in our Christian warfare, because we have spiritual enemies to 
 grapple with, as well as of faith in our Christian work, because we 
 have spiritual strength to fetch in. Thus you see your danger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What our duty is: to take and put on the whole armour of God, and 
 then to stand our ground, and withstand our enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We must <I>withstand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 We must not yield to the devil's allurements and assaults, but oppose 
 them. Satan is said <I>to stand up against us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:1">1 Chron. xxi. 1</A>.

 If he stand up against us, we must stand against him; set up, and keep
 up, an interest in opposition to the devil. Satan is the wicked one, 
 and his kingdom is the kingdom of sin: to stand against Satan is to 
 strive against sin. <I>That you may be able to withstand in the evil 
 day,</I> in the day of temptation, or of any sore affliction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We must stand our ground: <I>And, having done all, to stand.</I> 
 We must resolve, by God's grace, not to yield to Satan. Resist him, and 
 he will flee. If we distrust our cause, or our leader, or our armour, 
 we give him advantage. Our present business is to withstand the 
 assaults of the devil, and to stand it out; and then, having done all 
 that is incumbent on the good soldiers of Jesus Christ, our warfare 
 will be accomplished, and we shall be finally victorious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) We must stand armed; and this is here most enlarged upon. Here is 
 a Christian in complete armour: and the armour is divine: <I>Armour of
 God, armour of light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:12">Rom. xiii. 12</A>.
 
 <I>Armour of righteousness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:7">2 Cor. vi. 7</A>.

 The apostle specifies the particulars of this armour, both offensive
 and defensive. The military girdle or belt, the breast-plate, the 
 greaves (or soldier's shoes), the shield, the helmet, and the sword. It 
 is observable that, among them all, there is none for the back; if we 
 turn our back upon the enemy, we lie exposed. 

 [1.] Truth or sincerity is our girdle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 It was prophesied of Christ
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:5">Isa. xi. 5</A>)

 that <I>righteousness should be the girdle of his loins and
 faithfulness the girdle of his reins.</I> That which Christ was girded 
 with all Christians must be girded with. God desires truth, that is, 
 sincerity, in the inward parts. This is the strength of our loins; and 
 it girds on all other pieces of our armour, and therefore is first 
 mentioned. I know no religion without sincerity. Some understand it of 
 the doctrine of the truths of the gospel: they should cleave to us as 
 the girdle does to the loins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:11">Jer. xiii. 11</A>.

 This will restrain from libertinism and licentiousness, as a girdle
 restrains and keeps in the body. This is the Christian soldier's belt: 
 ungirded with this, he is unblessed.

 [2.] Righteousness must be our breast-plate. The breast-plate secures 
 the vitals, shelters the heart. The righteousness of Christ imputed to 
 us is our breast-plate against the arrows of divine wrath. The 
 righteousness of Christ implanted in us is our breast-plate to fortify 
 the heart against the attacks which Satan makes against us. The apostle 
 explains this in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:8">1 Thess. v. 8</A>,

 <I>Putting on the breast-plate of faith and love.</I> Faith and love
 include all Christian graces; for by faith we are united to Christ and 
 by love to our brethren. These will infer a diligent observance of our 
 duty to God, and a righteous deportment towards men, in all the offices 
 of justice, truth, and charity. 

 [3.] Resolution must be as the greaves to our legs: <I>And their feet 
 shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Shoes, or greaves of brass, or the like, were formerly part of the 
 military armour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:6">1 Sam. xvii. 6</A>):

 the use of them was to defend the feet against the gall-traps, and
 sharp sticks, which were wont to be laid privily in the way, to 
 obstruct the marching of the enemy, those who fell upon them being 
 unfit to march. <I>The preparation of the gospel of peace</I> signifies 
 a prepared and resolved frame of heart, to adhere to the gospel and 
 abide by it, which will enable us to walk with a steady pace in the way 
 of religion, notwithstanding the difficulties and dangers that may be 
 in it. It is styled <I>the gospel of peace</I> because it brings all 
 sorts of peace, peace with God, with ourselves, and with one another. 
 It may also be meant of that which prepares for the entertainment of 
 the gospel, namely, repentance. With this our feet must be shod: for by 
 living a life of repentance we are armed against temptations to sin, 
 and the designs of our great enemy. Dr. Whitby thinks this may be the 
 sense of the words: "That you may be ready for the combat, be shod with 
 the gospel of peace, endeavour after that peaceable and quiet mind 
 which the gospel calls for. Be not easily provoked, nor prone to
 quarrel: but show all gentleness and all long-suffering to all men, and 
 this will certainly preserve you from many great temptations and 
 persecutions, as did those shoes of brass the soldiers from those 
 galltraps," &c. 

 [4.] Faith must be our shield: <I>Above all,</I> or chiefly, <I>taking 
 the shield of faith,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This is more necessary than any of them. Faith is all in all to us in 
 an hour of temptation. The breast-plate secures the vitals; but with 
 the shield we turn every way. <I>This is the victory over the world, 
 even our faith.</I> We are to be fully persuaded of the truth of all 
 God's promises and threatenings, such a faith being of great use 
 against temptations. Consider faith as it <I>is the evidence of things 
 not seen and the substance of things hoped for,</I> and it will appear 
 to be of admirable use for this purpose. Faith, as receiving Christ and 
 the benefits of redemption, so deriving grace from him, is like a 
 shield, a sort of universal defence. Our enemy the devil is here called 
 <I>the wicked one.</I> He is wicked himself, and he endeavours to make 
 us wicked. His temptations are called <I>darts,</I> because of their 
 swift and undiscerned flight, and the deep wounds that they give to the 
 soul; <I>fiery darts,</I> by way of allusion to the poisonous darts 
 which were wont to inflame the parts which were wounded with them, and 
 therefore were so called, as the serpents with poisonous stings are 
 called fiery serpents. Violent temptations, by which the soul is set on 
 fire of hell, are the darts which Satan shoots at us. Faith is the 
 shield with which we must quench these fiery darts, wherein we should 
 receive them, and so render them ineffectual, that they may not hit us, 
 or at least that they may not hurt us. Observe, Faith, acted upon the 
 word of God and applying that, acted upon the grace of Christ and 
 improving that, quenches the darts of temptation. 

 [5.] Salvation must be our helmet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 that is, <I>hope,</I> which has salvation for its object; so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:8">1 Thess. v. 8</A>.

 The helmet secures the head. A good hope of salvation, well founded and
 well built, will both purify the soul and keep it from being defiled by 
 Satan, and it will comfort the soul and keep it from being troubled and 
 tormented by Satan. He would tempt us to despair; but good hope keeps
 us trusting in God, and rejoicing in him. 

 [6.] The word of God is the sword of the Spirit. The sword is a very 
 necessary and useful part of a soldier's furniture. The word of God is 
 very necessary, and of great use to the Christian, in order to his 
 maintaining the spiritual warfare and succeeding in it. It is called 
 <I>the sword of the Spirit,</I> because it is of the Spirit's inditing 
 and he renders it efficacious and powerful, and <I>sharper than a 
 two-edged sword.</I> Like Goliath's sword, none like that; with this we 
 assault the assailants. Scripture-arguments are the most powerful
 arguments to repel temptation with. Christ himself resisted Satan's 
 temptations with, <I>It is written,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:4,6,7,10">Matt. iv. 4, 6, 7, 10</A>.

 This, being hid in the heart, will preserve from sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:11">Ps. cxix. 11</A>),

 and will mortify and kill those lusts and corruptions that are latent 
 there. 

 [7.] Prayer must buckle on all the other parts of our Christian armour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 We must join prayer with all these graces, for our defence against 
 these spiritual enemies, imploring help and assistance of God, as the 
 case requires: and we must pray always. Not as though we were to do 
 nothing else but pray, for there are other duties of religion and of 
 our respective stations in the world that are to be done in their place 
 and season; but we should keep up constant times of prayer, and be 
 constant to them. We must pray upon all occasions, and as often as our 
 own and others' necessities call us to it. We must always keep up a 
 disposition to prayer, and should intermix ejaculatory prayers with 
 other duties, and with common business. Though set and solemn prayer 
 may sometimes be unseasonable (as when other duties are to be done), 
 yet pious ejaculations <I>can</I> never be so. We must pray <I>with all 
 prayer and supplication,</I> with all kinds of prayer: public, private, 
 and secret, social and solitary, solemn and sudden; with all the parts 
 of prayer: confession of sin, petition for mercy, and thanksgivings for 
 favours received. We must pray <I>in the Spirit;</I> our spirits must 
 be employed in the duty and we must do it by the grace of God's good 
 Spirit. We must <I>watch thereunto,</I> endeavouring to keep our hearts 
 in a praying frame, and taking all occasions, and improving all 
 opportunities, for the duty: we must watch to all the motions of our 
 own hearts towards the duty. When God says, <I>Seek my face,</I> our 
 hearts must comply, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:8">Ps. xxvii. 8</A>.

 This we must do <I>with all perseverance.</I> We must abide by the duty
 of prayer, whatever change there may be in our outward circumstances; 
 and we must continue in it as long as we live in the world. We must 
 persevere in a particular prayer; not cutting it short, when our hearts 
 are disposed to enlarge, and there is time for it, and our occasions 
 call for it. We must likewise persevere in particular requests, 
 notwithstanding some present discouragements and repulses. And we must 
 pray <I>with supplication,</I> not for ourselves only, but <I>for all 
 saints;</I> for we are members one of another. Observe, None are so 
 much saints, and in so good a condition in this world, but they need 
 our prayers, and they ought to have them. The apostle passes hence to 
 the conclusion of the epistle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, I. He desires their prayers for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Having mentioned <I>supplication for all saints,</I> he puts himself 
 into the number. We must pray for all saints, and particularly for 
 God's faithful ministers. <I>Brethren, pray for us, that the word of 
 the Lord may run and be glorified.</I> Observe what it is he would have 
 them pray for in his behalf: "<I>That utterance may be given unto 
 me;</I> that I may be enlarged from my present restraints, and so have 
 liberty to propagate the faith of Christ; that I may have ability to 
 express myself in a suitable and becoming manner; <I>and that I may 
 open my mouth boldly,</I> that is, that I may deliver the whole counsel 
 of God, without any base fear, shame, or partiality." <I>To make known 
 the mystery of the gospel;</I> some understand it of that part of the 
 gospel which concerns the calling of the Gentiles, which had hitherto, 
 as a mystery, been concealed. But the whole gospel was a mystery, till 
 made known by divine revelation; and it is the work of Christ's 
 ministers to publish it. Observe, Paul had a great command of language; 
 they called him Mercury, because he was the chief speaker

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:12">Acts xiv. 12</A>),
 
 and yet he would have his friends ask of God the gift of utterance for 
 him. He was a man of great courage, and often signalized himself for 
 it; yet he would have them pray that God would give him boldness. He 
 knew as well what to say as any man; yet he desires them to pray for 
 him, that he may <I>speak as he ought to speak.</I> The argument with 
 which he enforces his request is that for the sake of the gospel he was 
 <I>an ambassador in bonds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He was persecuted and imprisoned for preaching the gospel; though, 
 notwithstanding, he continued in the embassy committed to him by 
 Christ, and persisted in preaching it. Observe,

 1. It is no new thing for Christ's ministers to be in bonds.

 2. It is a hard thing for them to speak boldly when that is their case.
 
 3. The best and most eminent ministers have need of, and may receive
 advantage by, the prayers of good Christians; and therefore should 
 earnestly desire them. Having thus desired their prayers,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He recommends Tychicus unto them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 He sent him with this epistle, that he might acquaint them with what 
 other churches were informed of, namely, how he did, and what he did; 
 how he was used by the Romans in his bonds, and how he behaved himself 
 in his present circumstances. It is desirable to good ministers both 
 that their Christian friends should know their state and that they 
 should be acquainted with the condition of their friends; for by this 
 means they may the better help each other in their prayers.--<I>And 
 that he might comfort their hearts,</I> by giving such an account of 
 his sufferings, of the cause of them, and of the temper of his mind and 
 his behaviour under them, as might prevent their fainting at his 
 tribulations and even minister matter of joy and thanksgiving unto 
 them. He tells them that Tychicus was <I>a beloved brother and faithful 
 minister in the Lord.</I> He was a sincere Christian, and so a brother 
 in Christ: he was a faithful minister in the work of Christ, and he was 
 very dear to Paul, which makes Paul's love to these Christian Ephesians 
 the more observable, in that he should now part with so good and dear a 
 friend for their sakes, when his company and conversation must have 
 been peculiarly delightful and serviceable to himself. But the faithful 
 servants of Jesus Christ are wont to prefer the public good to their 
 own private or personal interests.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He concludes with his good wishes and prayers for them, and not 
 for them only, but for all the brethren, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 His usual benediction was, <I>Grace and peace;</I> here it is, <I>Peace 
 be to the brethren, and love with faith.</I> By peace we are to 
 understand all manner of peace--peace with God, peace with conscience, 
 peace among themselves: and all outward prosperity is included in the 
 word; as if he had said, "I wish the continuance and increase of all 
 happiness to you." <I>And love with faith.</I> This in part explains 
 what he means in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:24">following verse</A>

 by grace; not only grace in the fountain, or the love and favour of
 God, but grace in the streams, the grace of the Spirit flowing from 
 that divine principle, faith and love including all the rest. It is the 
 continuance and increase of these that he desires for them, in whom 
 they were already begun. It follows, <I>from God the Father,</I> &c. 
 All Grace and blessings are derived to the saints from God, through the 
 merit and intercession of Jesus Christ our Lord. The closing 
 benediction is more extensive than the former; for in this he prays for 
 all true believers at Ephesus, and every where else. It is the 
 undoubted character of all the saints that they love our Lord Jesus 
 Christ. Our love to Christ is not acceptable, unless it be in 
 sincerity: indeed there is no such thing as love to Christ, whatever 
 men may pretend, where there is not sincerity. The words may be read, 
 <I>Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in
 incorruption,</I> who continue constant in their love to him, so as not 
 to be corrupted out of it by any baits or seductions whatsoever, and 
 whose love to him is uncorrupted by any opposite lust, or the love of 
 any thing displeasing to him. Grace, that is, the favour of God, and 
 all good (spiritual and temporal), that is, the product of it, are and 
 shall be with all those who thus love our Lord Jesus Christ. And it is, 
 or ought to be, the desire and prayer of every lover of Christ that it 
 may be so with all his fellow-christians. <I>Amen,</I> so be it.</P>
