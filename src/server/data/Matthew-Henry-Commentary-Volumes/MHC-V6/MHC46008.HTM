 The apostle, in this chapter, answers another case proposed to him by 
 some of the Corinthians, about eating those things that had been 
 sacrificed to idols. 

 I. He hints at the occasion of this case, and gives a caution against
 too high an esteem of their knowledge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. He asserts the vanity of idols, the unity of the Godhead, and the
 sole mediation of Christ between God and man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 III. He tells them that upon supposition that it were lawful in itself
 to eat of things offered to idols (for that they themselves are 
 nothing), yet regard must be had to the weakness of Christian brethren, 
 and nothing done that would lay a stumbling block before them, and 
 occasion their sin and destruction,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we
 all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.

 nothing yet as he ought to know.
 &nbsp; 3  But if any man love God, the same is known of him.

 The apostle comes here to the case of things that had been offered to 
 idols, concerning which some of them sought satisfaction: a case that 
 frequently occurred in that age of Christianity, when the church of 
 Christ was among the heathen, and the Israel of God must live among the 
 Canaanites. For the better understanding of it, it must be observed 
 that it was a custom among the heathens to make feasts on their 
 sacrifices, and not only to eat themselves, but invite their friends to 
 partake with them. These were usually kept in the temple, where the
 sacrifice was offered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and, if any thing was left when the feast ended, it was usual to carry 
 away a portion to their friends; what remained, after all, belonged to 
 the priests, who sometimes sold it in the markets. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:25"><I>ch.</I> x. 25</A>.

 Nay, feasts, as Athen&aelig;us informs us, were always accounted, among
 the heathen, sacred and religious things, so that they were wont to 
 sacrifice before all their feasts; and it was accounted a very profane 
 thing among them, <B><I>athyta esthiein,</I></B> to eat at their 
 private tables any meat whereof they had not first sacrificed on such 
 occasions. In this circumstance of things, while Christians lived among 
 idolaters, had many relations and friends that were such, with whom 
 they must keep up acquaintance and maintain good neighbourhood, and 
 therefore have occasion to eat at their tables, what should they do if 
 any thing that had been sacrificed should be set before them? What, if 
 they should be invited to feast with them in their temples? It seems as 
 if some of the Corinthians had imbibed an opinion that even this might 
 be done, because they knew an idol was nothing in the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The apostle seems to answer more directly to the case

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:1-22"><I>ch.</I> x.</A>),

 and here to argue, upon supposition of their being right in this
 thought, against their abuse of their liberty to the prejudice of 
 others; but he plainly condemns such liberty in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:1-22"><I>ch.</I> x</A>.

 The apostle introduces his discourse with some remarks about knowledge
 that seem to carry in them a censure of such pretences to knowledge as 
 I have mentioned: <I>We know,</I> says the apostle, <I>that we all have 
 knowledge</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 as if he had said, "You who take such liberty are not the only knowing 
 persons; we who abstain know as much as you of the vanity of idols, and 
 that they are nothing; but we know too that the liberty you take is 
 very culpable, and that even lawful liberty must be used with charity 
 and not to the prejudice of weaker brethren." <I>Knowledge puffeth up, 
 but charity edifieth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 Note, 

 1. The preference of charity to conceited knowledge. That is best which 
 is fitted to do the greatest good. Knowledge, or at least a high 
 conceit of it, is very apt to swell the mind, to fill it with wind, and 
 so puff it up. This tends to no good to ourselves, but in many 
 instances is much to the hurt of others. But true love, and tender
 regard to our brethren, will put us upon consulting their interest, and 
 acting as may be for their edification. Observe,

 2. That there is no evidence of ignorance more common than a conceit of
 knowledge: <I>If any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth 
 nothing yet as he ought to know.</I> He that knows most best 
 understands his own ignorance, and the imperfection of human knowledge.
 He that imagines himself a knowing man, and is vain and conceited on 
 this imagination, has reason to suspect that he knows nothing aright, 
 <I>nothing as he ought to know it.</I> Note, It is one thing to know 
 truth, and another to know it as we ought, so as duly to improve our 
 knowledge. Much may be known when nothing is known to any good purpose, 
 when neither ourselves nor others are the better for our knowledge. And 
 those who think they know any thing, and grow fain hereupon, are of all 
 men most likely to make no good use of their knowledge; neither 
 themselves nor others are likely to be benefited by it. <I>But,</I> 
 adds the apostle, <I>if any man love God, the same is known</I> of God.
 If any man love God, and is thereby influenced to love his neighbour, 
 the same is known of God; that is, as some understand it, is made by 
 him to know, is taught of God. Note, Those that love God are most 
 likely to be taught of God, and be made by him to know as they ought.
 Some understand it thus: He shall be approved of God; he will accept 
 him and have pleasure in him. Note, The charitable person is most 
 likely to have God's favour. Those who love God, and for his sake love 
 their brethren and seek their welfare, are likely to be beloved of God; 
 and how much better is it to be approved of God than to have a vain 
 opinion of ourselves!</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are
 offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol <I>is</I>
 nothing in the world, and that <I>there is</I> none other God but one.
 &nbsp; 5  For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven
 or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)
 &nbsp; 6  But to us <I>there is but</I> one God, the Father, of whom <I>are</I>
 all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
 <I>are</I> all things, and we by him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this passage he shows the vanity of idols: <I>As to the eating of 
 things that have been sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is 
 nothing in the world;</I> or, there is no idol in the world; or, an 
 idol can do nothing in the world: for the form of expression in the 
 original is elliptical. The meaning in the general is, that heathen 
 idols have no divinity in them; and therefore the Old Testament they 
 are commonly called <I>lies</I> and <I>vanities,</I> or <I>lying 
 vanities.</I> They are merely imaginary gods, and many of them no 
 better than imaginary beings; they have no power to pollute the 
 creatures of God, and thereby render them unfit to be eaten by a child 
 or servant of God. <I>Every creature of God is good, if it be received 
 with thanksgiving,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:4">1 Tim. iv. 4</A>.

 It is not in the power of the vanities of the heathens to change its
 nature.--<I>And there is no other God but one.</I> Heathen idols are 
 not gods, nor to be owned and respected as gods, for there is no other 
 God but one. Note, the unity of the Godhead is a fundamental principle 
 in Christianity, and in all right religion. The gods of the heathens 
 must be nothing in the world, must have no divinity in them, nothing of 
 real godhead belonging to them; for there is no other God but one.
 Others may be called gods: <I>There are that are called gods, in heaven 
 and earth, gods many, and lords many;</I> but they are falsely thus 
 called. The heathens had many such, some in heaven and some on earth, 
 celestial deities, that were of highest rank and repute among them, and 
 terrestrial ones, men made into gods, that were to mediate for men with 
 the former, and were deputed by them to preside over earthly affairs. 
 These are in scripture commonly called <I>Baalim.</I> They had gods of 
 higher and lower degree; nay, many in each order: <I>gods many, and 
 lords many;</I> but all titular deities and mediators: so called, but 
 not such in truth. All their divinity and mediation were imagery. For,

 1. <I>To us there is but one God,</I> says the apostle, <I>the Father,
 of whom are all things, and we in or for him.</I> We Christians are 
 better informed; we well know there is but one God, the fountain of 
 being, the author of all things, maker, preserver, and governor of the 
 whole world, of whom and for whom are all things. Not one God to govern 
 one part of mankind, or one rank and order of men, and another to 
 govern another. One God made all, and therefore has power over all. All 
 things are of him, and we, and all things else, are for him. Called the 
 <I>Father</I> here, not in contradistinction to the other persons of 
 the sacred Trinity, and to exclude them from the Godhead, but in 
 contradistinction to all creatures that were made by God, and whose 
 formation is attributed to each of these three in other places of 
 scripture, and not appropriated to the Father alone. God the Father, as 
 <I>Fons et fundamentum Trinitatis--as the first person in the Godhead, 
 and the original of the other two,</I> stands here for the Deity, which 
 yet comprehends all three, the name God being sometimes in scripture 
 ascribed to the Father, <B><I>kat exochen,</I></B> or <I>by way of 
 eminency,</I> because he is <I>fons et principiam Deitatis</I> (as 
 Calvin observes), <I>the fountain of the Deity</I> in the other two, 
 they having it by communication from him: so that there is but one God 
 the Father, and yet the Son is God too, but is not another God, the 
 Father, with his Son and Spirit, being the one God, but not without 
 them, or so as to exclude them from the Godhead. 

 2. There is to us but one Lord, one Mediator between God and men, even
 Jesus Christ. Not many mediators, as the heathen imagined, but one 
 only, by whom all things were created and do consist, and to whom all 
 our hope and happiness are owing--the man Christ Jesus; but a man in 
 personal union with the divine Word, or God the Son. This very man hath 
 God made both Lord and Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:36">Acts ii. 36</A>.

 Jesus Christ, in his human nature and mediatorial state, has a
 delegated power, a name given him, though above every name, that at his 
 name every knee should bow, and every tongue confess that he is Lord.
 And thus he is the only Lord, the only Mediator, that Christians 
 acknowledge, the only person who comes between God and sinners, 
 administers the world's affairs under God, and mediates for men with 
 God. All the lords of this sort among heathens are merely imaginary 
 ones. Note, It is the great privilege of us Christians that we know the 
 true God, and true Mediator between God and man: <I>the true God, and 
 Jesus Christ whom he hath sent,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Howbeit <I>there is</I> not in every man that knowledge: for some
 with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat <I>it</I> as a thing
 offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
 &nbsp; 8  But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat,
 are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.
 &nbsp; 9  But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become
 a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
 &nbsp; 10  For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in
 the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak
 be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;
 &nbsp; 11  And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for
 whom Christ died?
 &nbsp; 12  But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their
 weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
 &nbsp; 13  Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no
 flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle, having granted, and indeed confirmed, the opinion of some 
 among the Corinthians, that idols were nothing, proceeds now to show 
 them that their inference from this assumption was not just, namely, 
 that therefore they might go into the idol-temple, and eat of the 
 sacrifices, and feast there with their heathen neighbours. He does not 
 indeed here so much insist upon the unlawfulness of the thing in itself 
 as the mischief such freedom might do to weaker Christians, persons 
 that had not the same measure of knowledge with these pretenders. And 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He informs them that every Christian man, at that time, was not so 
 fully convinced and persuaded that an idol was nothing. <I>Howbeit, 
 there is not in every man this knowledge; for some, with conscience of 
 the idol, unto this hour, eat it as a thing offered unto an idol;</I> 
 with conscience of the idol; that is, some confused veneration for it. 
 Though they were converts to Christianity, and professed the true 
 religion, they were not perfectly cured of the old leaven, but retained 
 an unaccountable respect for the idols they had worshipped before. 
 Note, Weak Christians may be ignorant, or have but a confused knowledge 
 of the greatest and plainest truths. Such were those of the one God and 
 one Mediator. And yet some of those who were turned form heathenism to 
 Christianity among the Corinthians seem to have retained a veneration 
 for their idols, utterly irreconcilable with those great principles; so 
 that when an opportunity offered to eat things offered to idols they 
 did not abstain, to testify their abhorrence of idolatry, nor eat with 
 a professed contempt of the idol, by declaring they looked upon it to 
 be nothing; and <I>so their conscience, being weak, was defiled;</I> 
 that is, they contracted guilt; they ate out of respect to the idol, 
 with an imagination that it had something divine in it, and so 
 committed idolatry: whereas the design of the gospel was to turn men 
 from dumb idols to the living God. They were weak in their 
 understanding, not thoroughly apprized of the vanity of idols; and, 
 while they ate what was sacrificed to them out of veneration for them, 
 contracted the guilt of idolatry, and so greatly polluted themselves. 
 This seems to be the sense of the place; though some understand it of 
 weak Christians defiling themselves by eating what was offered to an 
 idol with an apprehension that thereby it became unclean, and made 
 those so in a moral sense who should eat it, every one not having a 
 knowledge that the idol was nothing, and therefore that it could not 
 render what was offered to it in this sense unclean. Note, We should be 
 careful to do nothing that may occasion weak Christians to defile their 
 consciences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He tells them that mere eating and drinking had nothing in them 
 virtuous nor criminal, nothing that could make them better nor worse, 
 pleasing nor displeasing to God: <I>Meat commendeth us not to God; for 
 neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we eat not are we the 
 worse,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It looks as if some of the Corinthians made a merit of their eating 
 what had been offered to idols, and that in their very temples too

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 because it plainly showed that they thought the idols nothing. But 
 eating and drinking are in themselves actions indifferent. It matters 
 little what we eat. What goes into the man of this sort neither 
 purifies nor defiles. Flesh offered to idols may in itself be as proper 
 for food as any other; and the bare eating, or forbearing to eat, has 
 no virtue in it. Note, It is a gross mistake to think that distinction 
 of food will make any distinction between men in God's account. Eating 
 this food, and forbearing that, having nothing in them to recommend a 
 person to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He cautions them against abusing their liberty, the liberty they 
 thought they had in this matter. For that they mistook this matter, and 
 had no allowance to sit at meat in the idol's temple, seems plain from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:20"><I>ch.</I> x. 20</A>,

 &c. But the apostle argues here that, even upon the
 supposition that they had such power, they must be cautious how they 
 use it; it might be a <I>stumbling-block to the weak</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 it might occasion their falling into idolatrous actions, perhaps their 
 falling off from Christianity and revolting again to heathenism. "If a 
 man see thee, who hast knowledge (hast superior understanding to his, 
 and hereupon concedest that thou hast a liberty to sit at meat, or 
 feast, in an idol's temple, because an idol, thou sayest, is nothing), 
 shall not one who is less thoroughly informed in this matter, and 
 thinks an idol something, be emboldened to eat what was offered to the 
 idol, not as common food, but sacrifice, and thereby be guilty of 
 idolatry?" Such an occasion of falling they should be careful of laying 
 before their weak brethren, whatever liberty or power they themselves 
 had. The apostle backs this caution with two considerations:--

 1. The danger that might accrue to weak brethren, even those weak
 brethren for whom Christ died. We must deny ourselves even what is 
 lawful rather than occasion their stumbling, and endanger their souls 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Through thy knowledge shall thy weak brother perish, for whom Christ 
 died?</I> Note, Those whom Christ hath redeemed with his most precious 
 blood should be very precious and dear to us. If he had such compassion 
 as to die for them, that they might not perish, we should have so much 
 compassion for them as to deny ourselves, for their sakes, in various 
 instances, and not use our liberty to their hurt, to occasion their 
 stumbling, or hazard their ruin. That man has very little of the spirit 
 of the Redeemer who had rather his brother should perish than himself 
 be abridged, in any respect, of his liberty. He who hath the Spirit of 
 Christ in him will love those whom Christ loved, so as to die for them, 
 and will study to promote their spiritual and eternal warfare, and shun 
 every thing that would unnecessarily grieve them, and much more every 
 thing that would be likely to occasion their stumbling, or falling into 
 sin. 

 2. The hurt done to them Christ takes as done to himself: <I>When you
 sin so against the weak brethren and wound their consciences, you sin 
 against Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, Injuries done to Christians are injuries to Christ, especially to
 babes in Christ, to weak Christians; and most of all, involving them in 
 guilt: wounding their consciences is wounding him. He has a particular 
 care of the lambs of the flock: <I>He gathers them in his arm and 
 carries them in his bosom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:11">Isa. lx. 11</A>.

 Strong Christians should be very careful to avoid what will offend weak
 ones, or lay a stumbling-block in their way. Shall we be void of 
 compassion for those to whom Christ has shown so much? Shall we sin 
 against Christ who suffered for us? Shall we set ourselves to defeat 
 his gracious designs, and help to ruin those whom he died to save?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He enforces all with his own example 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend I will eat no flesh 
 while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.</I> He does 
 not say that he will never eat more. This were to destroy himself, and 
 to commit a heinous sin, to prevent the sin and fall of a brother. Such 
 evil must not be done that good may come of it. But, though it was 
 necessary to eat, it was not necessary to eat flesh. And therefore, 
 rather than occasion sin in a brother, he would abstain from it as long 
 as he lived. He had such a value for the soul of his brother that he 
 would willingly deny himself in a matter of liberty, and forbear any 
 particular food, which he might have lawfully eaten and might like to 
 eat, rather than lay a stumbling-block in a weak brother's way, and 
 occasion him to sin, by following his example, without being clear in 
 his mind whether it were lawful or no. Note, We should be very tender 
 of doing any thing that may be an occasion of stumbling to others, 
 though it may be innocent in itself. Liberty is valuable, but the 
 weakness of a brother should induce, and sometimes bind, us to waive 
 it. We must not rigorously claim nor use our own rights, to the hurt 
 and ruin of a brother's soul, and so to the in jury of our Redeemer, 
 who died for him. When it is certainly foreseen that my doing what I 
 may forbear will occasion a fellow-christian to do what he ought to 
 forbear, I shall offend, scandalize, or lay a stumbling-block in his 
 way, which to do is a sin, however lawful the thing itself be which is 
 done. And, if we must be so careful not to occasion other men's sins, 
 how careful should we be to avoid sin ourselves! If we must not 
 endanger other men's souls, how much should we be concerned not to 
 destroy our own!</P>
