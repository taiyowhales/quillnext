 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye
 sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
 Jesus Christ the righteous:
 &nbsp; 2  And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours
 only, but also for <I>the sins of</I> the whole world.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses relate to the concluding subject of the foregoing chapter, 
 in which the apostle proceeds upon the supposition of the real 
 Christian's sin. And here he gives them both dissuasion and 
 support.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Dissuasion. He would leave no room for sin: "<I>My little children,
 these things write I unto you, that you sin not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The design or purport of this letter, the design of what I have just 
 said concerning communion with God and the overthrow of it by an 
 irreligious course, is to dissuade and drive you from sin." See the 
 familiar affectionate compellation with which he introduces his 
 admonition: <I>My little children,</I> children as having perhaps been 
 begotten by his gospel, <I>little children</I> as being much beneath 
 him in age and experience, <I>my little children,</I> as being dear to 
 him in the bonds of the gospel. Certainly the gospel most prevailed 
 where and when such ministerial love most abounded. Or perhaps the 
 judicious reader will find reason to think that the apostle's meaning 
 in this dissuasion or caution is this, or amounts to this reading: 
 <I>These things write I unto you, not that you sin.</I> And so the 
 words will look back to what he had said before concerning the assured 
 pardon of sin: <I>God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,</I> 
 &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:9"><I>ch.</I> i. 9</A>.

 And so the words are a preclusion of all abuse of such favour and
 indulgence. "Though sins will be forgiven to penitent confessors, yet
 this I write, not to encourage you in sin, but upon another account." 
 Or this clause will look forward to what the apostle is going to say 
 about the Advocate for sinners: and so it is a prolepsis, a prevention 
 of like mistake or abuse: "<I>These things write I unto you, not that 
 you sin,</I> but that you may see your remedy for sin." And so the 
 following particle (as the learned know) may be rendered adversatively:
 <I>But, if a man sin,</I> he may know his help and cure. And so we 
 see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The believer's support and relief in case of sin: <I>And (or but) 
 if any man sin</I> (any of us, or of our foresaid communion), <I>We 
 have we an Advocate with the Father,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Believers themselves, those that are advanced to a happy gospel-state,
 have yet their sins. There is a great distinction therefore between the 
 sinners that are in the world. There are Christianized (such as are 
 instated in the sacred saving privileges of Christ's mystical or 
 spiritual body) and unchristianized, converted and unconverted sinners. 
 There are some who, though they really sin, yet, in comparison with 
 others, are said <I>not to sin,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:9"><I>ch.</I> iii. 9</A>.

 Believers, as they have an atonement applied unto them at their
 entrance into a state of pardon and justification, so they have an 
 Advocate in heaven still to continue to them that state, and procure 
 their continued forgiveness. And this must be the support, 
 satisfaction, and refuge of believers (or real Christians) in or upon 
 their sins: <I>We have an Advocate.</I> The original name is sometimes 
 given to the Holy Ghost, and then it is rendered, <I>the Comforter.</I> 
 He acts within us; he puts pleas and arguments into our hearts and
 mouths; and so is our advocate, by teaching us to intercede for 
 ourselves. But here is an advocate without us, in heaven and with the
 Father. The proper office and business of an advocate is with the 
 judge; with him he pleads the client's cause. The Judge with whom our 
 advocate pleads is the Father, his Father and ours. He who was our 
 Judge in the legal court (the court of the violated law) is our Father 
 in the gospel court, the court of heaven and of grace. His throne or 
 tribunal is the mercy-seat. And he that is our Father is also our 
 Judge, the supreme arbitrator of our state and circumstances, either 
 for life or death, for time or eternity. <I>You have come--to God, the 
 Judge of all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:23">Heb. xii. 23</A>.

 That believers may be encouraged to hope that their cause will go well,
 as their Judge is represented to them in the relation of a Father, so 
 their advocate is recommended to them upon these considerations:--

 1. By his person and personal names. <I>It is Jesus Christ the Son of
 the Father,</I> one anointed by the Father for the whole office of 
 mediation, the whole work of salvation, and consequently for that of 
 the intercessor or advocate. 

 2. By his qualification for the office. <I>It is Jesus Christ the
 righteous,</I> the righteous one in the court and sight of the Judge. 
 This is not so necessary in another advocate. Another advocate (or an
 advocate in another court) may be an unjust person himself, and yet may 
 have a just cause (and the cause of a just person in that case) to 
 plead, and may accordingly carry his cause. But here the clients are 
 guilty; their innocence and legal righteousness cannot be pleaded; 
 their sin must be confessed or supposed. It is the advocate's own 
 righteousness that he must plead for the criminals. He has been 
 righteous to the death, righteous for them; he has brought in 
 everlasting righteousness. This the Judge will not deny. Upon this 
 score he pleads, that the clients' sins may not be imputed to them. 

 3. By the plea he has to make, the ground and basis of his advocacy:
 <I>And he is the propitiation for our sins,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He is the expiatory victim, the propitiatory sacrifice that has been 
 offered to the Judge for all our offences against his majesty, and law, 
 and government. In vain do the professors of Rome distinguish between 
 and advocate of redemption and an advocate of intercession, or a 
 mediator of such different service. The Mediator of intercession, the 
 Advocate for us, is the Mediator of redemption, the propitiation for 
 our sins. It is his propitiation that he pleads. And we might be apt
 to suppose that his blood had lost its value and efficacy if no mention 
 had been made of it in heaven since the time it was shed. But now we 
 see it is of esteem there, since it is continually represented in the 
 intercession of the great advocate (the attorney-general) for the 
 church of God. <I>He ever lives to make intercession for those that 
 come to God through him.</I> 

 4. By the extent of his plea, the latitude of his propitiation. It is
 not confined to one nation; and not particularly to the ancient Israel 
 of God: <I>He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours 
 only</I> (not only for the sins of us Jews, us that are Abraham's seed 
 according to the flesh), <I>but also for those of the whole world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 not only for the past, or us present believers, but for the sins of all 
 who shall hereafter believe on him or come to God through him. The 
 extent and intent of the Mediator's death reach to all tribes, nations, 
 and countries. As he is the only, so he is the universal atonement and 
 propitiation for all that are saved and brought home to God, and to his 
 favour and forgiveness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses may seem to relate to the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:7">seventh verse 
 of the former chapter</A>,

 between which and these verses there occurred an incidental discourse
 concerning the believer's duty and relief in case of sin, occasioned by 
 the mention of one of the believer's privileges--his being cleansed 
 from sin by the Mediator's blood. In that verse the apostle asserts the 
 beneficial consequence of <I>walking in the light: "We have then 
 fellowship with one another,</I> such divine fellowship and communion 
 as are the prerogative of the church of Christ." Here now succeeds the 
 trial or test of our light and of our love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The trial of our light: <I>And hereby we do know that we know him, 
 if we keep his commandments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Divine light and knowledge are the beauty and improvement of the mind; 
 it becomes the disciples of the Mediator to be persons of wisdom and 
 understanding. Young Christians are apt to magnify their new light and 
 applaud their own knowledge, especially if they have been suddenly or 
 in a short time communicated; and old ones are apt to suspect the 
 sufficiency and fulness of their knowledge; they lament that they know 
 God, and Christ, and the rich contents of his gospel, no more: but here 
 is the evidence of the soundness of our knowledge, if it constrain us 
 to <I>keep God's commandments.</I> Each perfection of his nature 
 enforces his authority; the wisdom of his counsels, the riches of his 
 grace, the grandeur of his works, recommend his law and government. A 
 careful conscientious obedience to his commands shows that the 
 apprehension and knowledge of these things are graciously impressed 
 upon the soul; and therefore it must follow in the reverse that <I>he 
 that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, 
 and the truth is not in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Professors of the truth are often ashamed of their ignorance, or 
 ashamed to own it; they frequently pretend to great attainments in the 
 knowledge of divine mysteries: <I>Thou makest thy boast of God, and 
 knowest his will, and approvest</I> (in thy rational judgment) <I>the 
 things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law and art 
 confident that thou thyself art</I> (or art fit to be) <I>a guide to 
 the blind,</I> &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:17">Rom. ii. 17</A>,

 &c. But what knowledge of God can that be which sees not that he is
 most worthy of the most entire and intense obedience? And, if that be 
 seen and known, how vain and superficial is even this knowledge when it 
 sways not the heart unto obedience! A disobedient life is the 
 confutation and shame of pretended religious knowledge; it gives the 
 lie to such boasts and pretences, and shows that there is neither 
 religion nor honesty in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The trial of our love: <I>But whoso keepeth his word in him verily 
 is the love of God perfected; hereby know we that we are in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 To keep the word of God, or of Christ, is sacredly to attend thereto in 
 all the conduct and motion of life; in him that does so is the love of 
 God perfected. Possibly, some may here understand God's love to us; and 
 doubtless his love to us cannot be perfected (or obtain its perfect 
 design and fruit) without our practical observance of his word. We are 
 chosen, to be holy and blameless before him in love; we are 
 <I>redeemed, to be a peculiar people, zealous of good works;</I> we are 
 pardoned and justified, that we may be partakers of larger measures of 
 the divine Spirit for sanctification; we are sanctified, that we may 
 walk in ways of holiness and obedience: no act of divine love that here 
 terminates upon us obtains its proper tendency, issue, and effect, 
 without our holy attendance to God's word. But the phrase rather 
 denotes here our love to God; so 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,

 <I>The love of (to) the Father is not in him;</I> so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:17"><I>ch.</I> iii. 17</A>,

 <I>How dwelleth the love of (to) God in him?</I> Now light is to kindle
 love; and love must and will keep the word of God; it enquires wherein 
 the beloved may be pleased and served, and, finding he will be so by 
 observance of his declared will, there it employs and exerts itself; 
 there love is demonstrated; there it has its perfect (or complete) 
 exercise, operation, and delight; and hereby (by this dutiful 
 attendance to the will of God, or Christ) <I>we know that we are in 
 him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 we know that we belong to him, and that we are united to him by that 
 Spirit which elevates and assists us to this obedience; and if we 
 acknowledge our relation to him, and our union with him, it must have 
 this continued enforcement upon us: <I>He that saith he abideth in him 
 ought himself to walk even as he walked,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The Lord Christ was an inhabitant of this world, and walked here below; 
 here he gave a shining example of absolute obedience to God. Those who
 profess to be on his side, and to abide with him, must walk with him, 
 walk after his pattern and example. The partisans of the several sects 
 of philosophers of old paid great regard to the dictates and practice 
 of their respective teachers and sect-masters; much more should the 
 Christian, he who professes to abide in and with Christ, aim to 
 resemble his infallible Master and head, and conform to his course and 
 prescriptions: <I>Then are you my friends if you do whatsoever I 
 command you,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
 commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment
 is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.
 &nbsp; 8  Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is
 true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the
 true light now shineth.
 &nbsp; 9  He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is
 in darkness even until now.
 &nbsp; 10  He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there
 is none occasion of stumbling in him.
 &nbsp; 11  But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh
 in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that
 darkness hath blinded his eyes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The seventh verse may be supposed either to look backward to what 
 immediately preceded (and then it is <I>walking as Christ walked</I> 
 that is here represented as <I>no new, but an old commandment;</I> it 
 is that which the apostles would certainly inculcate wherever they 
 brought Christ's gospel), or to look forward to what the apostle is now 
 going to recommend, and that is the law of fraternal love; this is the 
 message <I>heard from the beginning</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:11"><I>ch.</I> iii. 11</A>),

 and <I>the old commandment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:5">2 John 5</A>.

 Now, while the apostle addresses himself to the recommendation of such
 a practice, he is ready to give an instance thereof in his affectionate 
 appellation: "<I>Brethren,</I> you who are dear to me in the bond of 
 that love to which I would solicit you;" and so the precept of 
 fraternal love is recommended,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As an old one: <I>I write no new commandment unto you, but an old 
 commandment, which you had from the beginning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The precept of love must be as old as human nature; but it might admit 
 divers enactions, enforcements, and motives. In the state of innocence, 
 had human nature then been propagated, men must have loved one another 
 as being of one blood, made to dwell on the earth, as being God's 
 offspring, and bearing his image. In the state of sin and promised 
 recovery, they must love one another as related to God their Maker, as 
 related to each other by blood, and as partners in the same hope. When 
 the Hebrews were peculiarly incorporated, they must accordingly love 
 each other, as being the privileged people, whose were the covenants 
 and the adoption, and of whose race the Messiah and head of the church 
 must spring; and the law of love must be conveyed with new obligations 
 to the new Israel of God, to the gospel church, and so it is the <I>old 
 commandment,</I> or the word which the children of the gospel Israel 
 have heard from the beginning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As a new one: "<I>Again,</I> to constrain you to this duty the 
 more, <I>a new commandment I write unto you,</I> the law of the new 
 society, the Christian corporation, <I>which thing is true in him,</I> 
 the matter of which was first true in and concerning the head of it; 
 the truth of it was first and was abundantly in him; <I>he loved the 
 church, and gave himself for it:</I> and it is true <I>in you;</I> this 
 law is in some measure written upon your hearts; you are taught of God 
 to love one another, and that <I>because</I>" (or since, or forasmuch 
 as) "<I>the darkness is past,</I> the darkness of your prejudiced 
 unconverted (whether Jewish or Gentile) minds, your deplorable 
 ignorance of God and of Christ is now past, <I>and the true light now 
 shineth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 <I>the light</I> of evangelical revelation hath shone with life and 
 efficacy into your hearts; hence you have seen the excellency of 
 Christian love, and the fundamental obligation thereto." Hence we see 
 that the fundamentals (and particularly the fundamental precepts) of 
 the Christian religion may be represented either as new or old; the 
 reformed doctrine, or doctrine of religion in the reformed churches, is 
 new and old--new, as taught after long darkness, by the lights of the 
 reformation, new as purged from the adulterations of Rome; but old as 
 having been taught and <I>heard from the beginning.</I> We should see 
 that that grace or virtue which was true in Christ be true also in us; 
 we should be conformable to our head. The more our darkness is past, 
 and gospel light shines unto us, the deeper should our subjection be to 
 the commandments of our Lord, whether considered as old or new. Light 
 should produce a suitable heat. Accordingly, here is another trial of
 our Christian light; before, it was to be approved by obedience to God; 
 here by Christian love. 

 1. He who wants such love in vain pretends his light: <I>He that saith
 he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even unto 
 now,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It is proper for sincere Christians to acknowledge what God has done 
 for their souls; but in the visible church there are often those who 
 assume to themselves more than is true, there are those who say they 
 are in the light, the divine revelation has made its impression upon 
 their minds and spirits, and yet they walk in hatred and enmity towards 
 their Christian brethren; these cannot be swayed by the sense of the 
 love of Christ to their brethren, and therefore remain in their dark 
 state, notwithstanding their pretended conversion to the Christian 
 religion. 

 2. He who is governed by such love approves his light to be good and
 genuine: <I>He that loveth his brother</I> (as his brother in Christ) 
 <I>abideth in the light,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He sees the foundation and reason of Christian love; he discerns the 
 weight and value of the Christian redemption; he sees how meet it is 
 that we should love those whom Christ hath loved; and then the 
 consequence will be that <I>there is no occasion of stumbling in 
 him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 he will be no scandal, <I>no stumbling-block, to his brother;</I> he 
 will conscientiously beware that he neither induce his brother to sin 
 nor turn him out of the way of religion, Christian love teaches us 
 highly to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing that will 
 be injurious to his innocence and peace. 

 3. Hatred is a sign of spiritual darkness: <I>But he that hateth his
 brother is in darkness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Spiritual light is instilled by the Spirit of grace, and one of <I>the 
 first-fruits of that Spirit is love;</I> he then who is possessed with 
 malignity towards a Christian brother must needs be destitute of 
 spiritual light; consequently <I>he walks in darkness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 his life is agreeable to a dark mind and conscience, <I>and he knows 
 not whither he goes;</I> he sees not whither this dark spirit carries 
 him, and particularly that it will carry him to the world of utter 
 darkness, <I>because darkness hath blinded his eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The darkness of regeneracy, evidenced by a malignant spirit, is 
 contrary to the light of life; where that darkness dwells, the mind, 
 the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and so will mistake 
 the way to heavenly endless life. Here we may observe how effectually 
 our apostle is now cured of his once hot and flaming spirit. Time was 
 when he was for <I>calling for fire from heaven</I> upon poor ignorant 
 Samaritans who received them not,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:54">Luke ix. 54</A>.

 But his Lord had shown him that he knew not his own spirit, nor whither
 it led him. Having now imbibed more of the Spirit of Christ, he 
 breathes out good-will to man, and love to all the brethren. It is the 
 Lord Jesus that is the great Master of love: it is his school (his own
 church) that is the school of love. His disciples are the disciples of 
 love, and his family must be the family of love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This new command of holy love, with the incentives thereto, may 
 possibly be directed to the several ranks of disciples that are here 
 accosted. The several graduates in the Christian university, the 
 catholic church, must be sure to preserve the bond of sacred love. Or, 
 there being an important dehortation and dissuasion to follow, without 
 the observance of which vital religion in the love of God and love of 
 the brethren cannot subsist, the apostle may justly seem to preface it 
 with a solemn address to the several forms or orders in the school of 
 Christ: let the infants or minors, the adults, the seniors (or the 
 <I>adepti,</I> the <B><I>teleioi,</I></B> the most <I>perfect</I>), in 
 the Christian institution, know that they must <I>not love this 
 world;</I> and so,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have the address itself made to the various forms and ranks in 
 the church of Christ. All Christians are not of the same standing and 
 stature; there are babes in Christ, there are grown men, and old 
 disciples. As these have their peculiar states, so they have their 
 peculiar duties; but there are precepts and a correspondent obedience 
 common to them all, as particularly mutual love and contempt of the 
 world. We see also that wise pastors will judiciously distribute the 
 word of life, and give to the several members of Christ's family their 
 several suitable portions: <I>I write unto you children, fathers, and 
 young men.</I> In this distribution the apostle addresses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The lowest in the Christian school: <I>I write unto you, little 
 children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 There are novices in religion, babes in Christ, those who are learning 
 the rudiments of Christian godliness. The apostle may seem to encourage 
 them by applying to them first; and it may be useful to the greater 
 proficients to hear what is said to their juniors; elements are to be 
 repeated; first principles are the foundation of all. He addresses 
 <I>the children</I> in Christianity upon two accounts:--

 (1.) <I>Because their sins were forgiven them for his name's sake,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The youngest sincere disciple is pardoned; <I>the communion of
 saints</I> is attended with <I>the forgiveness of sins.</I> Sins are 
 forgiven either for God's name's sake, for the praise of his glory (his 
 glorious perfections displayed in forgiveness), or <I>for Christ's 
 name's sake,</I> upon his score, and upon the account of the redemption 
 that is in him; and those that are forgiven of God are strongly obliged 
 to relinquish this world, which so interferes with <I>the love of 
 God.</I> 

 (2.) Because of their knowledge of God: <I>I write unto you, little 
 children, because you have known the Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Children are wont to know none so soon as their father. Children in 
 Christianity must and do know God. <I>They shall all know me, from the 
 least to the greatest,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:11">Heb. viii. 11</A>.

 Children in Christ should know that God is their Father; it is their
 wisdom. We say, It is a wise child that knows his father. These 
 children cannot but know theirs; they can well be assured by whose 
 power they are regenerated and by whose grace they are adopted. Those 
 that know the Father may well be withdrawn from the love of this world. 
 Then the apostle, proceeds,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To those of the highest station and stature, to the seniors in
 Christianity, to whom he gives an honourable appellation: <I>I write
 unto you, fathers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>),

 <I>unto you, Mnasons, you old disciples,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:16">Acts xxi. 16</A>.

 The apostle immediately passes from the bottom to the top of the
 school, from the lowest form to the highest, that those in the middle 
 may hear both lessons, may remember what they have learned and perceive 
 what they must come to: <I>I write unto you, fathers.</I> Those that 
 are of longest standing in Christ's school have need of further advice 
 and instruction; the oldest disciple must go to heaven (the university 
 above) with his book, his Bible, in his hand; fathers must be written 
 to, and preached to; none are too old to learn. He writes to them upon
 the account of their knowledge: <I>I write unto you, fathers, because 
 you have known him that is from the beginning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Old men have knowledge and experience, and expect deference. The 
 apostle is ready to own the knowledge of old Christians, and to 
 congratulate them thereupon. They know the Lord Christ, particularly 
 <I>him that was from the beginning;</I> as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1"><I>ch.</I> i. 1</A>.

 As Christ is <I>Alpha</I> and <I>Omega,</I> so he must be the beginning
 and end of our Christian knowledge. <I>I count all things but loss for 
 the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:8">Phil. iii. 8</A>.
 
 Those who know him that was from the beginning, before this world was
 made, may well be induced thereby to relinquish this world. Then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. To the middle age of Christians, to those who are in their bloom and 
 flower: <I>I write unto you, young men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 There are the adult in Christ Jesus, those that have arrived at the 
 strength of spirit and sound sense and can discern between good and 
 evil. The apostle applies to them upon these accounts:--

 (1.) Upon the account of their martial exploits. Dexterous soldiers
 they are in the camp of Christ: <I>Because you have overcome the wicked 
 one,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 There is a wicked one that is continually warring against souls, and 
 particularly against the disciples: but those that are well taught in 
 Christ's school can handle their arms and vanquish the evil one; and 
 those that can vanquish him may be called to vanquish the world too, 
 which is so great an instrument for the devil.

 (2.) Upon the account of their strength, discovered in this their 
 achievement: <I>Because you are strong, and you have overcome the 
 wicked one,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Young men are wont to glory in their strength; it will be the glory of 
 youthful persons to be strong in Christ and in his grace; it will be 
 their glory, and it will try their strength, to overcome the devil; if 
 they be not too hard for the devil, he will be too hard for them. Let 
 vigorous Christians show their strength in conquering the world; and 
 the same strength must be exerted in overcoming the world as is 
 employed in overcoming the devil.

 (3.) Because of their acquaintance with the word of God: <I>And the 
 word of God abideth in you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The word of God must abide in the adult disciples; it is the nutriment 
 and supply of strength to them; it is the weapon by which they overcome 
 the wicked one; the sword of the Spirit, whereby they quench his fiery 
 darts: and those in whom the word of God dwells are well furnished for 
 the conquest of the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have the dehortation or dissuasion thus prefaced and introduced, 
 a caution fundamental to vital practical religion: "<I>Love not the 
 world, neither the things that are in the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Be crucified to the world, be mortified to the things, to the affairs 
 and enticements, of it." The several degrees of Christians should unite 
 in this, in being dead to the world. Were they thus united, they would 
 soon unite upon other accounts: their love should be reserved for God; 
 throw it not away upon the world. Now here we see the reasons of this 
 dissuasion and caution. They are several, and had need to be so; it is 
 hard to dispute or dissuade disciples themselves from the love of the 
 world. These reasons are taken,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. From the inconsistency of this love with the love of God: <I>If any 
 man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 The heart of man is narrow, and cannot contain both loves. The world 
 draws down the heart from God; and so the more the love of the world 
 prevails the more the love of God dwindles and decays.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. From the prohibition of worldly love or lust; it is not ordained of 
 God: <I>It is not of the Father, but is of the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This love or lust is not appointed of God (he calls us from it), but it 
 intrudes itself from the world; the world is a usurper of our 
 affection. Now here we have the due consideration and notion of the 
 world, according to which it is to be crucified and renounced. <I>The 
 world,</I> physically considered, is good, and is to be admired as the 
 work of God and a glass in which his perfections shine; but it is to be 
 considered in its relation to us now in our corrupted state, and as it 
 works upon our weakness and instigates and inflames our vile 
 affections. There is great affinity and alliance between this world and 
 the flesh, and this world intrudes and encroaches upon the flesh, and 
 thereby makes a party against God. The things of the world therefore 
 are distinguished into three classes, according to the three 
 predominant inclinations of depraved nature; as,

 (1.) There is <I>the lust of the flesh. The flesh</I> here, being 
 distinguished from <I>the eyes</I> and <I>the life,</I> imports the 
 body. The lust of the flesh is, subjectively, the humour and appetite 
 of indulging fleshly pleasures; and, objectively, all those things that 
 excite and inflame the pleasures of the flesh. This lust is usually 
 called <I>luxury.</I> 

 (2.) There is <I>the lust of the eyes.</I> The eyes are delighted with 
 treasures; riches and rich possessions are craved by an extravagant 
 eye; this is the lust of covetousness. 

 3. There is <I>the pride of life.</I> A vain mind craves all the
 grandeur, equipage, and pomp of a vain-glorious life; this is ambition, 
 and thirst after honour and applause. This is, in part, the disease of 
 the ear; it must be flattered with admiration and praise. The objects 
 of these appetites must be abandoned and renounced; as they engage and 
 engross the affection and desire, <I>they are not of the Father, but of 
 the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The Father disallows them, and the world should keep them to itself. 
 The lust or appetite to these things must be mortified and subdued; and 
 so the indulging of it is not appointed by the Father, but is 
 insinuated by the ensnaring world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. From the vain and vanishing state of earthly things and the 
 enjoyment of them. <I>And the world passeth away, and the lust 
 thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The things of the world are fading and dying apace. The lust itself
 and the pleasure of it wither and decay; desire itself will ere long 
 fail and cease, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:5">Eccl. xii. 5</A>.

 And what has become of all the pomp and pleasure of all those who now
 lie mouldering in the grave?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. From the immortality of the divine lover, the lover of God: <I>But 
 he that doeth the will of God,</I> which must be the character of the 
 lover of God, in opposition to this lover of the world, <I>abideth for 
 ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The object of his love in opposition to <I>the world</I> that 
 <I>passeth away,</I> abideth for ever; his sacred passion or affection, 
 in opposition to the lust that passeth away, abideth for ever; love 
 shall never fail; and he himself is an heir of immortality and endless 
 life, and shall in time be translated thither.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From the whole of these verses we should observe the purity and 
 spirituality of the apostolical doctrine. The animal life must be 
 subjected to the divine; the body with its affections should be swayed 
 by religion, or the victorious love of God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard
 that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists;
 whereby we know that it is the last time.
 &nbsp; 19  They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they
 had been of us, they would <I>no doubt</I> have continued with us: but
 <I>they went out,</I> that they might be made manifest that they were
 not all of us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 I. A moral prognostication of the time; the end is coming: <I>Little 
 children, it is the last time,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Some may suppose that the apostle here addresses the first rank of 
 Christians again; the juniors are most apt to be seduced, and 
 therefore, "<I>Little children,</I> you that are young in religion, 
 take heed to yourselves that you be not corrupted." But it may be, as 
 elsewhere, a universal appellation, introductive of an alarm to all 
 Christians: "<I>Little children, it is the last time;</I> our Jewish 
 polity in church and state is hastening to an end; the Mosaic 
 institution and discipline are just upon vanishing away; Daniel's weeks 
 are now expiring; the destruction of the Hebrew city and sanctuary is 
 approaching, <I>the end whereof must be with a flood, and to the end of 
 the war desolations are determined,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:26">Dan. ix. 26</A>.

 It is meet that the disciples should be warned of the haste and end of
 time, and apprised as much as may be of the prophetic periods of 
 time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sign of this last time: <I>Even now there are many 
 antichrists</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 many that oppose the person, doctrine, and kingdom of Christ. It is a 
 mysterious portion of providence that antichrists should be permitted; 
 but, when they have come, it is good and safe that the disciples should 
 be informed of them; ministers should be <I>watchmen to the house of 
 Israel.</I> Now it should be no great offence nor prejudice to the 
 disciples that there are such antichrists: 

 1. One great one has been foretold: <I>As you have heard that
 antichrist shall come,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 The generality of the church have been informed by divine revelation 
 that there must be a long and fatal adversary to Christ and his church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:8-10">2 Thess. ii. 8-10</A>.

 No wonder then that there are many harbingers and forerunners of the
 great one: <I>Even now there are many antichrists,</I> the mystery of 
 iniquity already worketh. 

 2. They were foretold also as the sign of this last time. <I>For there
 shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall show great 
 signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall 
 deceive the very elect,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:24">Matt. xxiv. 24</A>.

 And these were the forerunners of the dissolution of the Jewish state,
 nation, and religion: <I>Whereby we know it is the last time,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Let the prediction that we see there has been of seducers arising in 
 the Christian world fortify us against their seduction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Some account of these seducers or antichrists. 

 1. More positively. They were once entertainers or professors of
 apostolical doctrine: "<I>They went out from us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 from our company and communion;" possibly from the church of Jerusalem, 
 or some of the churches of Judea, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:1">Acts xv. 1</A>,

 <I>Certain men came down from Judea, and taught the brethren,</I> &c.
 The purest churches may have their apostates and revolters; the
 apostolic doctrine did not convert all whom it convinced of its truth.
 
 2. More privately. "They were not inwardly such as we are: <I>But they
 were not of us;</I> they had not <I>from the heart obeyed the form of 
 sound doctrine delivered to them;</I> they were not of our union with 
 Christ the head." Then here is, 

 (1.) The reason upon which it is concluded that they were not of us, 
 were not what they pretended, or what we are, and that is their actual 
 defection: "<I>For, if they had been of us, they would</I> no doubt 
 <I>have continued with us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 had the sacred truth been rooted in their hearts it would have held 
 them with us; had they had the anointing from above, by which they had 
 been made true and real Christians, they would not have turned 
 antichrists." Those that apostatize from religion sufficiently indicate 
 that, before, they were hypocrites in religion: those who have imbibed 
 the spirit of gospel truth have a good preservative against destructive 
 error. 

 (2.) The reason why they are permitted thus to depart from apostolical 
 doctrine and communion--that their insincerity may be detected: 
 <I>But</I> this was done (or <I>they went out) that they might be made 
 manifest that they were not all of us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The church knows not well who are its vital members and who are not; 
 and therefore the church, considered as internally sanctified, may well 
 be styled <I>invisible.</I> Some of the hypocritical must be manifested 
 here, and that for their own shame and benefit too, in their reduction 
 to the truth, if they have not sinned unto death, and for the terror 
 and caution of others. <I>You therefore, beloved, seeing you know these 
 things before, beware lest you also, being led away with the error of 
 the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. But grow in grace,</I> 
 &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:17,18">2 Pet. iii. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in

 you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same
 anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no
 lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here,

 I. The apostle encourages the disciples (to whom he writes) in these 
 dangerous times, in this hour of seducers; he encourages them in the 
 assurance of their stability in this day of apostasy: <I>But you have 
 an unction from the Holy One, and you know all</I> things. We see, 

 1. The blessing wherewith they were enriched--an unguent from heaven:
 <I>You have an unction.</I> True Christians are anointed ones, their 
 name intimates as much. They are anointed with the oil of grace, with 
 gifts and spiritual endowments, by the Spirit of grace. They are 
 anointed into a similitude of their Lord's offices, as subordinate 
 prophets, priests, and kings, unto God. The Holy Spirit is compared to 
 oil, as well as to fire and water; and the communication of his 
 salvific grace is our anointing. 

 2. From whom this blessing comes--<I>from the Holy One,</I> either from
 the Holy Ghost or from the Lord Christ, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:7">Rev. iii. 7</A>,

 <I>These things saith he that is holy--the Holy One.</I> The Lord 
 Christ is glorious in his holiness. The Lord Christ disposes of the
 graces of the divine Spirit, and he anoints the disciples to make them 
 like himself, and to secure them in his interest. 

 3. The effect of this unction--it is a spiritual eye-salve; it
 enlightens and strengthens the eyes of the understanding: "<I>And</I> 
 thereby <I>you know all things</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 all these things concerning Christ and his religion; it was promised 
 and given you for that end,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:26">John xiv. 26</A>.

 The Lord Christ does not deal alike by all his professed disciples;
 some are more anointed than others. There is great danger lest those 
 that are not thus anointed should be so far from being true to Christ 
 that they should, on the contrary, turn antichrists, and prove 
 adversaries to Christ's person, and kingdom, and glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle indicates to them the mind and meaning with which he 
 wrote to them. 

 1. By way of negation; not as suspecting their knowledge, or supposing
 their ignorance in the grand truths of the gospel: "<I>I have not 
 written unto you because you know not the truth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 I could not then be so well assured of your stability therein, nor 
 congratulate you on your unction from above." It is good to surmise 
 well concerning our Christian brethren; we ought to do so till evidence 
 overthrows our surmise: a just confidence in religious persons may both 
 encourage and contribute to their fidelity. 

 2. By way of assertion and acknowledgment, as relying upon their
 judgment in these things: <I>But because you know it</I> (you know 
 <I>the truth in Jesus), and that no lie is of the truth.</I> Those who 
 know the truth in any respect are thereby prepared to discern what is 
 contrary thereto and inconsistent therewith. <I>Rectum est index sui et 
 obliqui--The line which shows itself to be straight shows also what 
 line is crooked.</I> Truth and falsehood do not well mix and suit 
 together. Those that are well acquainted with Christian truth are 
 thereby well fortified against antichristian error and delusion. No lie 
 belongs to religion, either natural or revealed. The apostles most of
 all condemned lies, and showed the inconsistency of lies with their 
 doctrine: they would have been the most self-condemned persons had they 
 propagated the truth by lies. It is a commendation of the Christian 
 religion that it so well accords with natural religion, which is the 
 foundation of it, that it so well accords with the Jewish religion, 
 which contained the elements or rudiments of it. <I>No lie is of the 
 truth;</I> frauds and impostures then are very unfit means to support 
 and propagate the truth. I suppose it had been better with the state of 
 religion if they had never been used. The result of them appears in the 
 infidelity of our age; the detection of ancient pious frauds and wiles 
 has almost run our age into atheism and irreligion; but the greatest 
 actors and sufferers for the Christian revelation would assure us that 
 <I>no lie is of the truth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The apostle further impleads and arraigns these seducers who had 
 newly arisen. 

 1. They are <I>liars,</I> egregious opposers of sacred truth: <I>Who is
 a liar,</I> or the liar, the notorious liar of the time and age in 
 which we live, <I>but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?</I> The 
 great and pernicious lies that the father of lies, or of liars, spreads 
 in the world, were of old, and usually are, falsehoods and errors 
 relating to the person of Christ. There is no truth so sacred and fully 
 attested but some or other will contradict or deny it. That Jesus of 
 Nazareth was the Son of God had been attested by heaven, and earth, and 
 hell. It should seem that some, in the tremendous judgment of God, are 
 given up to strong delusions. 

 2. They are direst enemies to God as well as to the Lord Christ: <I>He
 is antichrist who denieth the Father and the Son,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 He that opposes Christ denies the witness and testimony of the Father, 
 and the seal that he hath given to his Son; <I>for him hath God the 
 Father sealed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:27">John vi. 27</A>.

 And he that denies the witness and testimony of the Father, concerning
 Jesus Christ denies that God is the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
 and consequently abandons the knowledge of God in Christ, and thereupon 
 the whole revelation of God in Christ, and particularly of God in 
 Christ <I>reconciling the world unto himself;</I> and therefore the 
 apostle may well infer, <I>Whosoever denies the Son the same has not 
 the Father</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 he has not the true knowledge of the Father, for the Son has most and 
 best revealed him; he has no interest in the Father, in his favour, and 
 grace, and salvation, <I>for none cometh to the Father but by the Son. 
 But,</I> as some copies add, <I>he that acknowledgeth the Son has the 
 Father also,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 As there is an intimate relation between the Father and the Son, so 
 there is an inviolable union in the doctrine, knowledge, and interests 
 of both; so that he who has the knowledge of, and right to, the Son, 
 has the knowledge of, and right to, the Father also. Those that adhere 
 to the Christian revelation hold the light and benefit of natural 
 religion withal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Hereupon the apostle advises and persuades the disciples to 
 continue in the old doctrine at first communicated to them: <I>Let that 
 therefore abide in you which you have heard from the beginning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Truth is older than error. The truth concerning Christ, that was at 
 first delivered to the saints, is not to be exchanged for novelties. So 
 sure were the apostles of the truth of what they had delivered 
 concerning Christ, and from him, that after all their toils and 
 sufferings they were not willing to relinquish it. The Christian truth 
 may plead antiquity, and be recommended thereby. This exhortation is 
 enforced by these considerations:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. From the sacred advantage they will receive by adhering to the 
 primitive truth and faith. 

 (1.) They will continue thereby in holy union with God and Christ: 
 <I>If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, 
 you also shall continue in the Son and in the Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 It is the truth of Christ abiding in us that is the means of severing 
 us from sin and uniting us to the Son of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:3,4">John xv. 3, 4</A>.

 The Son is the medium or the Mediator by whom we are united to the
 Father. What value then should we put upon gospel truth!

 (2.) They will thereby secure the promise of eternal life: <I>And this
 is the promise that he</I> (even God the Father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:11"><I>ch.</I> v. 11</A>)

 <I>hath promised us, even eternal life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Great is the promise that God makes to his faithful adherents. It is 
 suitable to his own greatness, power, and goodness. It is <I>eternal 
 life,</I> which none but God can give. The blessed God puts great value 
 upon his Son, and the truth relating to him, when he is pleased to 
 promise to those who continue in that truth (under the light, and 
 power, and influence of it) <I>eternal life.</I> Then the exhortation 
 aforesaid is enforced,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. From the design of the apostle's writing to them. This letter is to 
 fortify them against the deceivers of the age: "<I>These things have I 
 written to you concerning those that seduce you</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and therefore, if you continue not in what <I>you have heard from the 
 beginning,</I> my writing and service will be in vain." We should 
 beware lest the apostolical letters, yea, lest the whole scripture of 
 God, should be to us insignificant and fruitless. <I>I have written to 
 him the great things of my law</I> (and my gospel too), <I>but they 
 were counted as a strange thing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:12">Hos. viii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. From the instructive blessing they had received from heaven: <I>But 
 the anointing which you have received from him abideth in you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 True Christians have an inward confirmation of the divine truth they 
 have imbibed: the Holy Spirit has imprinted it on their minds and 
 hearts. It is meet that the Lord Jesus should have a constant witness 
 in the hearts of his disciples. The unction, the pouring out of the 
 gifts of grace upon sincere disciples, is a seal to the truth and 
 doctrine of Christ, since none giveth that seal but God. <I>Now he who 
 establisheth us with you</I> (and you with us) <I>in Christ, and hath 
 anointed us, is God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:21">2 Cor. i. 21</A>.

 This sacred chrism, or divine unction, is commended on these
 accounts:--

 (1.) It is durable and lasting; oil or unguent is not so soon dried up
 as water: it <I>abideth in you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Divine illumination, in order to confirmation, must be something 
 continued or constant. Temptations, snares, and seductions, arise. The
 anointing must abide.

 (2.) It is better than human instruction: "<I>And you need not that any 
 man teach you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Not that this anointing will teach you without the appointed ministry. 
 It could, if God so pleased; but it will not, though it will teach you 
 better than we can: <I>And you need not that any man teach you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 You were instructed by us before you were anointed; but now our 
 teaching is nothing in comparison to that. <I>Who teacheth like 
 him?</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:22">Job xxxvi. 22</A>.

 The divine unction does not supersede ministerial teaching, but 
 surmount it. 

 (3.) It is a sure evidence of truth, and all that it teaches is 
 infallible truth: <I>But as the same anointing teacheth you of all 
 things, and is truth, and is no lie,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 The Holy Spirit must needs be <I>the Spirit of truth,</I> as he is 
 called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:17">John xiv. 17</A>.

 The instruction and illumination that he affords must needs be in and
 of the truth. The Spirit of truth will not lie; and he teacheth all 
 things, that is, all things in the present dispensation, all things 
 necessary to our knowledge of God in Christ, and their glory in the 
 gospel. And, 

 (4.) It is of a conservative influence; it will preserve those in whom 
 it abides against seducers and their seduction: "<I>And even as it hath 
 taught you you shall abide in him,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 It teaches you to abide in Christ; and, as it teaches you, it secures 
 you; it lays a restraint upon your minds and hearts, that you may not 
 revolt from him. <I>And he that hath anointed us is God, who also hath 
 sealed us</I> for himself, <I>and given the earnest of the Spirit in 
 our hearts.</I>"

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From the blessing of the sacred unction the apostle proceeds in his 
 advice and exhortation to constancy in and with Christ: <I>And now, 
 little children, abide in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The apostle repeats his kind appellation, <I>little children,</I> which 
 I suppose does not so much denote their diminutiveness as his 
 affection, and therefore, I judge, may be rendered <I>dear 
 children.</I> He would persuade by love, and prevail by endearment as 
 well as by reason. "Not only the love of Christ, but the love of you, 
 constrains us to inculcate your perseverance, and that <I>you would 
 abide in him,</I> in the truth relating to his person, and in your 
 union with him and allegiance to him." Evangelical privileges are 
 obligatory to evangelical duties; and those that are anointed by the 
 Lord Jesus are highly obliged to abide with him in opposition to all 
 adversaries whatever. This duty of perseverance and constancy in trying 
 times is strongly urged by the two following considerations:--

 1. From the consideration of his return at the great day of account:
 <I>That when he shall appear we may have confidence, and not be ashamed 
 before him at his coming,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 It is here taken for granted that the Lord Jesus will come again. This 
 was part of that truth they had heard from the beginning. And, when he
 shall come again, he will publicly appear, be manifested to all. When 
 he was here before, he came privately, in comparison. He proceeded from 
 a womb, and was introduced into a stable: but, when he shall come 
 again, he will come from the opened heavens, and every eye shall see 
 him; and then those who have continued with him throughout all their 
 temptations shall have confidence, assurance, and joy, in the sight of 
 him. They shall lift up their heads with unspeakable triumph, as 
 knowing that their complete redemption comes along with him. On the 
 contrary, those that have deserted him <I>shall be ashamed before 
 him;</I> they shall be ashamed of themselves, ashamed of their 
 unbelief, their cowardice, ingratitude, temerity, and folly, in 
 forsaking so glorious a Redeemer. They shall be ashamed of their hopes, 
 expectations, and pretences, and ashamed of all the wages of 
 unrighteousness, by which they were induced to desert him: <I>That we 
 may have confidence, and may not be ashamed.</I> The apostle includes 
 himself in the number. "Let not us be ashamed of you," as well as, "you 
 will not be ashamed of yourselves." Or <B><I>me aischynthomen ap 
 autou</I></B>--<I>that we be not ashamed</I> (made ashamed, or put to 
 shame) <I>by him at his coming.</I> At his public appearance he will 
 shame all those who have abandoned him, he will disclaim all 
 acquaintance with them, will cover them with shame and confusion, will 
 abandon them to darkness, devils, and endless despair, by professing 
 before men and angels that he is ashamed of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:38">Mark viii. 38</A>.

 To the same advice and exhortation he proceeds, 

 2. From the consideration of the dignity of those who still adhere to
 Christ and his religion: <I>If you know that he is righteous, you know 
 that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 The particle here rendered <I>if</I> seems not to be <I>vox 
 dubitantis,</I> but <I>concedentis;</I> not so much a conditional 
 particle, as a suppositional one, if I may call it so, a note of 
 allowance or concession, and so seems to be of the same import with our 
 English <I>inasmuch,</I> or <I>whereas,</I> or <I>since.</I> So the 
 sense runs more clearly: <I>Since you know that he is righteous, you 
 know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.</I> He 
 that doeth righteousness may here be justly enough assumed as another 
 name for him that abideth in Christ. For he that abideth in Christ 
 abideth in the law and love of Christ, and consequently in his 
 allegiance and obedience to him; and so must do, or work, or practise, 
 righteousness, or the parts of gospel holiness. Now such a one must 
 needs <I>be born of him.</I> He is renewed by the Spirit of Christ, 
 after the image of Christ, <I>created in Christ Jesus unto good works, 
 which God hath fore-ordained that he should walk in them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:10">Eph. ii. 10</A>.

 "<I>Since then you know that the Lord Christ is righteous</I>
 (righteous in his quality and capacity, the Lord our righteousness, and 
 the Lord our sanctifier or our sanctification, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:30">1 Cor. i. 30</A>),

 you cannot but know thereupon" (or know you, it is for your
 consideration and regard) "that he who by the continued practice of 
 Christianity abideth in him is born of him." The new spiritual nature 
 is derived from the Lord Christ. He that is constant to the practice of 
 religion in trying times gives good evidence that he is born from 
 above, from the Lord Christ. The Lord Christ is an everlasting Father. 
 It is a great privilege and dignity to be born of him. Those that are 
 so are the children of God. <I>To as many as received him to them gave 
 he power to become the sons of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:12">John i. 12</A>.

 And this introduces the context of the following chapter.</P>
