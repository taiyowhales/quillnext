 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this and the following chapter Paul is exhorting and directing the
 Corinthians about a particular work of charity--to relieve the
 necessities of the poor saints at Jerusalem and in Judea, according to
 the good example of the churches in Macedonia, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:26">Rom. xv. 26</A>.

 The Christians at Jerusalem, through war, famine, and persecution, had
 become poor, many of them had fallen into decay, and perhaps most of
 them were but poor when they first embraced Christianity; for Christ
 said, "The poor receive the gospel." Now Paul, though he was the
 apostle of the Gentiles, had a fonder regard, and kind concern, for
 those among the Jews who were converted to the Christian faith; and,
 though many of them had not so much affection to the Gentile converts
 as they ought to have had, yet the apostle would have the Gentiles to
 be kind to them, and stirred them up to contribute liberally for their
 relief. Upon this subject he is very copious, and writes very
 affectingly. In this eighth chapter he acquaints the Corinthians with,
 and commends, the good example of the Macedonians in this work of 
 charity, and that Titus was sent to Corinth to collect their bounty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 He the proceeds to urge this duty with several cogent arguments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:7-15">ver. 7-15</A>),

 and commends the persons who were employed in this affair,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God
 bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
 &nbsp; 2  How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of
 their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of
 their liberality.
 &nbsp; 3  For to <I>their</I> power, I bear record, yea, and beyond <I>their</I>
 power <I>they were</I> willing of themselves;
 &nbsp; 4  Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift,
 and <I>take upon us</I> the fellowship of the ministering to the
 saints.
 &nbsp; 5  And <I>this they did,</I> not as we hoped, but first gave their
 own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
 &nbsp; 6  Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he
 would also finish in you the same grace also.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle takes occasion from the good example of the churches of 
 Macedonia, that is, of Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, and others in the 
 region of Macedonia, to exhort the Corinthians and the Christians in 
 Achaia to the good work of charity.  And,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He acquaints them with their great liberality, which he calls <I>the 
 grace of God bestowed on the churches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Some think the words should be rendered, <I>the gift of God given in or 
 by the churches.</I> He certainly means the charitable gifts of these 
 churches, which are called the grace or gifts of God, either because 
 they were very large, or rather because their charity to the poor 
 saints did proceed from God as the author, and was accompanied with 
 true love to God, which also was manifested this way. The grace of God 
 must be owned as the root and fountain of all the good that is in us, 
 or done by us, at any time; and it is great grace and favour from God, 
 and bestowed on us, if we are made useful to others, and are forward to 
 any good work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He commends the charity of the Macedonians, and sets it forth with 
 good advantage. He tells them, 

 (1.) They were but in a low condition, and themselves in distress, yet 
 they contributed to the relief of others. <I>They were in great 
 tribulation and deep poverty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It was a time of great affliction with them, as may be seen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:17">Acts xviii. 17</A>.

 The Christians in these parts met with ill treatment, which had reduced 
 them to deep poverty; yet, as they had abundance of joy in the midst of 
 tribulation, they abounded in their liberality; they gave out of a 
 little, trusting in God to provide for them, and make it up to them.

 (2.) They gave very largely, with <I>the riches of liberality</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that is, as liberally as if they had been rich. It was a large
 contribution they made, all things considered; it was <I>according 
 to,</I> yea <I>beyond, their power</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 as much as could well be expected from them, if not more. Note, Though
 men may condemn the indiscretion, yet God will accept the pious zeal, 
 of those who in real works of piety and charity do rather beyond their 
 power. 

 (3.) They were very ready and forward to this good work. <I>They were 
 willing of themselves</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and were so far from needing that Paul should urge and press them with 
 many arguments that they <I>prayed him with much entreaty to receive 
 the gift,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 It seems Paul was backward to undertake this trust, for <I>he would 
 give himself to the word and prayer;</I> or, it may be, he was 
 apprehensive how ready his enemies would be to reproach and blacken him 
 upon all occasions, and might take a handle against him upon account of 
 so large a sum deposited in his hands, to suspect or accuse him of 
 indiscretion and partiality in the distribution, if not of some 
 injustice.  Note, How cautious ministers should be, especially in 
 money-matters, not to give occasion to those who seek occasion to speak 
 reproachfully!

 (4.) Their charity was founded in true piety, and this was the great 
 commendation of it. They performed this good work in a right method: 
 <I>First they gave themselves to the Lord, and then</I> they gave unto 
 us their contributions, <I>by the will of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:5"><I>v.</I>  5</A>),

 that is, according as it was the will of God they should do, or to be 
 disposed of as the will of God should be, and for his glory. This, it 
 seems, exceeded the expectation of the apostle; it was more than he 
 hoped for, to see such warm and pious affections shining in these 
 Macedonians, and this good work performed with so much devotion and 
 solemnity. They solemnly, jointly, and unanimously, made a fresh 
 surrender of themselves, and all they had, unto the Lord Jesus Christ.  
 They had done this before, and now they do it again upon this occasion; 
 sanctifying their contributions to God's honour, by first giving 
 themselves to the Lord.  Note, 

 [1.] We should give ourselves to God; we cannot bestow ourselves 
 better.

 [2.] When we give ourselves to the Lord, we then give him all we have, 
 to be called for and disposed of according to his will.

 [3.] Whatever we use or lay out for God, it is only giving to him what 
 is his own.

 [4.] What we give or bestow for charitable uses will not be accepted of 
 God, nor turn to our advantage, unless we first give ourselves to the 
 Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle tells them that Titus was desired to go and make a 
 collection among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and Titus, he knew, would be an acceptable person to them. He had met 
 with a kind reception among them formerly. They had shown good 
 affection to him, and he had a great love for them. Besides, Titus had 
 already begun this work among them, therefore he was desired to finish 
 it. So that he was, on all accounts, a proper person to be employed; 
 and, when so good a work had already prospered in so good a hand, it 
 would be a pity if it should not proceed and be finished. Note, It is 
 an instance of wisdom to use proper instruments in a work we desire to 
 do well; and the work of charity will often succeed the best when the 
 most proper persons are employed to solicit contributions and dispose 
 of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Therefore, as ye abound in every <I>thing, in</I> faith, and
 utterance, and knowledge, and <I>in</I> all diligence, and <I>in</I> your
 love to us, <I>see</I> that ye abound in this grace also.
 &nbsp; 8  I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the
 forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
 &nbsp; 9  For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though
 he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through
 his poverty might be rich.
 &nbsp; 10  And herein I give <I>my</I> advice: for this is expedient for
 you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be
 forward a year ago.
 &nbsp; 11  Now therefore perform the doing <I>of it;</I> that as <I>there was</I>
 a readiness to will, so <I>there may be</I> a performance also out of
 that which ye have.
 &nbsp; 12  For if there be first a willing mind, <I>it is</I> accepted
 according to that a man hath, <I>and</I> not according to that he hath
 not.
 &nbsp; 13  For <I>I mean</I> not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:
 &nbsp; 14  But by an equality, <I>that</I> now at this time your abundance
 <I>may be a supply</I> for their want, that their abundance also may
 be <I>a supply</I> for your want: that there may be equality:
 &nbsp; 15  As it is written, He that <I>had gathered</I> much had nothing
 over; and he that <I>had gathered</I> little had no lack.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle uses several cogent arguments to stir up 
 the Corinthians to this good work of charity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He urges upon them the consideration of their eminence in other 
 gifts and graces, and would have them excel in this of charity also, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Great address and much holy art are here used by the apostle. When he 
 would persuade the Corinthians to this good thing, he commends them for 
 other good things that were found in them. Most people love to be 
 complimented, especially when we ask a gift of them for ourselves or 
 others; and it is a justice we owe to those in whom God's grace shines 
 to give them their due commendation. Observe here, What it was that the 
 Corinthians abounded in. Faith is mentioned first, for that is the 
 root; and, as <I>without faith it is impossible to please God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:6">Heb. xi. 6</A>),

 so those who abound in faith will abound in other graces and good works 
 also; and this will work and show itself by love. To their faith was 
 added utterance, which is an excellent gift, and redounds much to the 
 glory of God and the good of the church. Many have faith who want 
 utterance. But these Corinthians excelled most churches in spiritual 
 gifts, and particularly in utterance; and yet this was not in them, as 
 in too many, both the effect and evidence of ignorance; for with their 
 utterance there appeared knowledge, abundance of knowledge.  They had a 
 treasury of things new and old, and in their utterance they brought out 
 of this treasury. They abounded also in all diligence.  Those who have 
 great knowledge and ready utterance are not always the most diligent 
 Christians. Great talkers are not always the best doers; but these 
 Corinthians were diligent to do, as well as know and talk, well. And 
 further, they had abundant love to their minister; and were not like 
 too many, who, having gifts of their own, are but too apt to slight 
 their ministers, and neglect them. Now to all these good things the 
 apostle desires them to add this grace also, to abound in charity to 
 the poor; that, where so much good was found, there should be found yet 
 more good. Before the apostle proceeds to another argument he takes 
 care to prevent any misapprehensions of his design to impose on them, 
 or to bind heavy burdens upon them by his authority; and tells them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 he does not speak by commandment, or in a way of authority. I give 
 <I>my advice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He took occasion from the forwardness of others to propose what would 
 be expedient for them, and would prove the sincerity of their love, or 
 be the genuine effect and evidence thereof.  Note, A great difference 
 should be made between plain and positive duty, and the improvement of 
 a present opportunity of doing or getting good. Many a thing which is 
 good for us to do, yet can not be said to be, by express and 
 indispensable commandment, our duty at this or that time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Another argument is taken from the consideration of the grace of 
 our Lord Jesus Christ. The best arguments for Christian duties are 
 those that are taken from the love of Christ, <I>that constraineth 
 us.</I> The example of the churches of Macedonia was such as the 
 Corinthians should imitate; but the example of our Lord Jesus Christ 
 should have much greater influence. And <I>you know,</I> saith the 
 apostle, <I>the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>that though he was rich,</I> as being God, equal in power and glory 
 with the Father, rich in all the glory and blessedness of the upper 
 world, <I>yet for your sakes he became poor;</I> not only did become 
 man for us, but he became poor also. He was born in poor circumstances, 
 lived a poor life, and died in poverty; and this was for our sakes, 
 that we thereby might be made rich, rich in the love and favour of God, 
 rich in the blessings and promises of the new covenant, rich in the 
 hopes of eternal life, being heirs of the kingdom. This is a good 
 reason why we should be charitable to the poor out of what we have, 
 because we ourselves live upon the charity of the Lord Jesus 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Another argument is taken from their good purposes, and their 
 forwardness to begin this good work. As to this he tells them, 

 1. It was expedient for them to perform what they purposed, and finish
 what they had begun,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 What else did their good purposes and good beginnings signify? Good 
 purposes, indeed, are good things; they are like buds and blossoms, 
 pleasant to behold, and give hopes of good fruit; but they are lost, 
 and signify nothing, without performances. So good beginnings are 
 amiable; but we shall lose the benefit unless there be perseverance, 
 and we bring forth fruit to perfection. Seeing therefore the 
 Corinthians had shown a readiness to will, he would have them be 
 careful also in the performance, according to their ability.  For,

 2. This would be acceptable to God. <I>This willing mind is
 accepted</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 when accompanied with sincere endeavours. When men purpose that which 
 is good, and endeavour, according to their ability, to perform also, 
 God will accept of what they have, or can do, and not reject them for 
 what they have not, and what is not in their power to do: and this is 
 true as to other things besides the work of charity. But let us note 
 here that this scripture will by no means justify those who think good 
 meanings are enough, or that good purposes, and the profession of a 
 willing mind, are sufficient to save them. It is accepted, indeed, 
 where there is a performance as far as we are able, and when Providence 
 hinders the performance, as in David's case concerning building a house 
 for the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:1-29">2 Sam. vii</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Another argument is taken from the discrimination which the divine 
 Providence makes in the distribution of the things of this world, and 
 the mutability of human affairs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:13-15"><I>v.</I> 13-15</A>.

 The force of the arguing seems to be this:--Providence gives to some
 more of the good things of this world, and to some less, and that with 
 this design, that those who have a greater <I>abundance may supply 
 those who are in want,</I> that there may be room for charity. And 
 further, considering the mutability of human affairs, and how soon 
 there may be an alteration, so that those who now have an abundance may 
 stand in need of being supplied themselves in their wants, this should 
 induce them to be charitable while they are able. It is the will of God 
 that, by our mutually supplying one another, there should <I>be some 
 sort of equality;</I> not an <I>absolute</I> equality indeed, or such a 
 levelling as would destroy property, for in such a case there could be 
 no exercise of charity. But as in works of charity there should be an 
 equitable proportion observed, that the burden should not lie too heavy 
 on some, while others are wholly eased, so all should think themselves 
 concerned to supply those who are in want. This is illustrated by the 
 instance of gathering and distributing manna in the wilderness, 
 concerning which (as we may read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:1-36">Exod. xvi.</A>)

 it was the duty of every family, and all in the family, to gather what
 they could, which, when it was gathered, was put into some common 
 receptacle for each family, whence the master of the family distributed 
 to every one as he had occasion, to some more than they were able, 
 through age and infirmity, to gather up; to others less than they 
 gathered, because they did not need so much: and thus <I>he that had 
 gathered much</I> (more than he had occasion for) had nothing over, 
 when a communication was made to him <I>that had gathered little,</I> 
 who by this method had no lack.  Note, Such is the condition of men in 
 this world that we mutually depend on one another, and should help one 
 another. Those who have ever so much of this world have no more than 
 food and raiment; and those who have but a little of this world seldom 
 want these; nor, indeed, should those who have abundance suffer others 
 to want, but be ready to afford supply.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  But thanks <I>be</I> to God, which put the same earnest care into
 the heart of Titus for you.
 &nbsp; 17  For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more
 forward, of his own accord he went unto you.
 &nbsp; 18  And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise <I>is</I> in
 the gospel throughout all the churches;
 &nbsp; 19  And not <I>that</I> only, but who was also chosen of the churches
 to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to
 the glory of the same Lord, and <I>declaration of</I> your ready mind:
 &nbsp; 20  Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance
 which is administered by us:
 &nbsp; 21  Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the
 Lord, but also in the sight of men.
 &nbsp; 22  And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have
 oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more
 diligent, upon the great confidence which <I>I have</I> in you.
 &nbsp; 23  Whether <I>any do enquire</I> of Titus, <I>he is</I> my partner and
 fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren <I>be enquired of,
 they are</I> the messengers of the churches, <I>and</I> the glory of
 Christ.
 &nbsp; 24  Wherefore show ye to them, and before the churches, the
 proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle commends the brethren who were sent to them 
 to collect their charity; and as it were, gives them letters
 credential, that, if they <I>were enquired after</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 if any should be inquisitive or suspicious concerning them, it might be
 known who they were and how safely they might be trusted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He commends Titus, 

 1. For his earnest care and great concern of heart for them, and desire
 in all things to promote their welfare. This is mentioned with 
 thankfulness to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and it is cause of thankfulness if God hath put it into the hearts of
 any to do us or others any good. 

 2. For his readiness to this present service. He accepted the office,
 and was forward to go upon this good errand,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:17"><I>v.</I>  17</A>.

 Asking charity for the relief of others is by many looked upon as a 
 thankless office; yet it is a good office, and what we should not be 
 shy of when we are called to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He commends another brother, who was sent with Titus. It is 
 generally thought that this was Luke. He is commended, 

 1. As a man whose <I>praise was in the gospel through all the
 churches,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 His ministerial services of several kinds were well known, and he had 
 approved himself praiseworthy in what he had done. 

 2. As one chosen of the churches

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 and joined with the apostle in his ministration.  This was done, it is
 most likely, at the motion and request of Paul himself; for this 
 reason, <I>that no man might blame him in that abundance which was 
 administered by him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 so cautious was the apostle to avoid all occasions that evil-minded men
 might lay hold on to blacken him. He would not give occasion to any to 
 accuse him of injustice or partiality in this affair, and thought it to 
 be his duty, as it is the duty of all Christians, <I>to provide for 
 things honest, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight 
 of men;</I> that is, to act so prudently as to prevent, as far as we 
 can, all unjust suspicions concerning us, and all occasions of 
 scandalous imputations. Note, We live in a censorious world, and should 
 cut off occasion from those who seek occasion to speak reproachfully. 
 It is the crime of others if they reproach or censure us without 
 occasion; and it is our imprudence at least if we give them any 
 occasion, when there may not be a just cause for them so to do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He commends also another brother who was joined with the two 
 former in this affair. This brother is thought to be Apollos. Whoever 
 he was, he had <I>approved himself diligent in many things;</I> and 
 therefore was fit to be employed in this affair.  Moreover, he had
 great desire to this work, because of the confidence or good opinion he 
 had of the Corinthians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and it is a great comfort to see those employed in good works who have
 formerly approved themselves diligent.</P>

 IV. He concludes this point with a general good character of them all 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 as <I>fellow-labourers with him</I> for their welfare; as the
 <I>messengers of the churches;</I> as the <I>glory of Christ,</I> who 
 were to him for a name and a praise, who brought glory to Christ as 
 instruments and had obtained honour from Christ to be counted faithful 
 and employed in his service. Wherefore, upon the whole, he exhorts them 
 to show their liberality, answerable to the great expectation others 
 had concerning them at this time, that these messengers of the 
 churches, and the churches themselves, might see a full <I>proof of 
 their love</I> to God and to their afflicted brethren, and that it was 
 with good reason the apostle had even <I>boasted on their behalf,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Note, The good opinion others entertain of us should be an argument 
 with us to do well.</P>
