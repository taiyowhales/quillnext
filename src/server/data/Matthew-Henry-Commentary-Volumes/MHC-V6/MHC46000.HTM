 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 C<FONT SIZE=-1>ORINTH</FONT> was a principal city of Greece, in that 
 particular division of it which was called <I>Achaia.</I> It was 
 situated on the isthmus (or neck of land) that joined Peloponnesus to 
 the rest of Greece, on the southern side, and had two ports adjoining, 
 one at the bottom of the Corinthian Gulf, called <I>Lech&aelig;um,</I> 
 not far from the city, whence they traded to Italy and the west, the 
 other at the bottom of the Sinus Saronicus, called <I>Cenchrea,</I> at 
 a more remote distance, whence they traded to Asia. From this 
 situation, it is no wonder that Corinth should be a place of great 
 trade and wealth; and, as affluence is apt to produce luxury of all 
 kinds, neither is it to be wondered at if a place so famous for wealth 
 and arts should be infamous for vice. It was in a particular manner 
 noted for fornication, insomuch that a <I>Corinthian woman</I> was a 
 proverbial phrase for a strumpet, and <B><I>korinthiazein, 
 korinthiasesthai</I></B>--<I>to play the Corinthian,</I> is to play the 
 whore, or indulge whorish inclinations.  Yet in this lewd city did 
 Paul, by the blessing of God on his labours, plant and raise a 
 Christian church, chiefly among the Gentiles, as seems very probable 
 from the history of this matter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:1-18">Acts xviii. 1-18</A>,

 compared with some passages in this epistle, particularly 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:2">xii. 2</A>,

 where the apostle tells them, <I>You know that you wee Gentiles,
 carried away to those dumb idols even as you were led,</I> though it is
 not improbable that many Jewish converts might be also among them, for
 we are told that <I>Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed
 on the Lord, with all his house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:8">Acts xviii. 8</A>.

 He continued in this city nearly two years, as is plain from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:11,18">Acts xviii. 11 and 18</A>

 compared, and laboured with great success, being encouraged by a divine
 vision assuring him God <I>had much people in that city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:9,10">Acts xviii. 9, 10</A>.

 Nor did he use to stay long in a place where his ministry met not with 
 acceptance and success.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some time after he left them he wrote this epistle to them, to water 
 what he had planted and rectify some gross disorders which during his 
 absence had been introduced, partly from the interest some false 
 teacher or teachers had obtained amongst them, and partly from the 
 leaven of their old maxims and manners, that had not been thoroughly 
 purged out by the Christian principles they had entertained. And it is 
 but too visible how much their wealth had helped to corrupt their 
 manners, from the several faults for which the apostle reprehends them. 
 Pride, avarice, luxury, lust (the natural offspring of a carnal and 
 corrupt mind), are all fed and prompted by outward affluence. And with 
 all these either the body of this people or some particular persons 
 among them are here charged by the apostle. Their pride discovered 
 itself in their parties and factions, and the notorious disorders they 
 committed in the exercise of their spiritual gifts. And this vice was 
 not wholly fed by their wealth, but by the insight they had into the 
 Greek learning and philosophy. Some of the ancients tell us that the 
 city abounded with rhetoricians and philosophers. And these were men 
 naturally vain, full of self-conceit, and apt to despise the plain 
 doctrine of the gospel, because it did not feed the curiosity of an 
 inquisitive and disputing temper, nor please the ear with artful 
 speeches and a flow of fine words. Their avarice was manifest in their 
 law-suits and litigations about <I>meum--mine,</I> and
 <I>tuum--thine,</I> before heathen judges. Their luxury appeared in more
 instances than one, in their dress, in their debauching themselves even 
 at the Lord's table, when the rich, who were most faulty on this 
 account, were guilty also of a very proud and criminal contempt of 
 their poor brethren. Their lust broke out in a most flagrant and 
 infamous instance, such as had not been named among the Gentiles, not 
 spoken of without detestation--that a man should have his father's wife,
 either as his wife, or so as to commit fornication with her. This 
 indeed seems to be the fault of a particular person; but the whole 
 church were to blame that they had his crime in no greater abhorrence, 
 that they could endure one of such very corrupt morals and of so 
 flagitious a behaviour among them. But their participation in his sin 
 was yet greater, if, as some of the ancients tell us, they were puffed 
 up on behalf of the great learning and eloquence of this incestuous 
 person. And it is plain from other passages of the epistle that they 
 were not so entirely free from their former lewd inclinations as not to 
 need very strict cautions and strong arguments against fornication: see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:9-20">vi. 9-20</A>.

 The pride of their learning had also carried many of them so far as to
 disbelieve or dispute against the doctrine of the resurrection. It is 
 not improbable that they treated this question problematically, as they 
 did many questions in philosophy, and tried their skill by arguing it 
 <I>pro</I> and <I>con.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is manifest from this state of things that there was much that 
 deserved reprehension, and needed correction, in this church. And the 
 apostle, under the direction and influence of the Holy Spirit, sets 
 himself to do both with all wisdom and faithfulness, and with a due 
 mixture of tenderness and authority, as became one in so elevated and 
 important a station in the church. After a short introduction at the 
 beginning of the epistle, he first blames them for their discord and 
 factions, enters into the origin and source of them, shows them how 
 much pride and vanity, and the affectation of science, and learning, 
 and eloquence, flattered by false teachers, contributed to the 
 scandalous schism; and prescribes humility, and submission to divine 
 instruction, the teaching of God by his Spirit, both by external 
 revelation and internal illumination, as a remedy for the evils that 
 abounded amongst them. He shows them the vanity of their pretended 
 science and eloquence on many accounts. This he does through the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:1-4:21">first four chapters</A>.
 
 In the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:1-13">fifth</A>

 he treats of the case of the incestuous person, and orders him to be
 put out from among them. Nor is what the ancients say improbable, that
 this incestuous person was a man in great esteem, and head of one party
 at least among them. The apostle seems to tax them with being puffed up
 on his account,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:2">v. 2</A>.

 In the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:1-8">sixth chapter</A>

 he blames them for their law-suits, carried on before heathen judges,
 when their disputes about property should have been amicably determined
 amongst themselves, and in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:9-20">close of the chapter</A>

 warns them against the sin of fornication, and urges his caution with a 
 variety of arguments. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:1-40">seventh chapter</A> 

 he gives advice upon a case of conscience, which some of that church 
 had proposed to him in an epistle, about marriage, and shows it to be 
 appointed of God as a remedy against fornication, that the ties of it 
 were not dissolved, though a husband or wife continued a heathen, when 
 the other became a Christian; and, in short, that Christianity made no 
 change in men's civil states and relations. He gives also some 
 directions here about virgins, in answer, as is probable, to the 
 Corinthians' enquiries. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:1-13">eighth</A>

 he directs them about meats offered to idols, and cautions them against
 abusing their Christian liberty. From this he also takes occasion, in 
 the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:1-27">ninth chapter</A>,

 to expatiate a little on his own conduct upon this head of liberty. 
 For, though he might have insisted on a maintenance from the churches 
 where he ministered, he waived this demand, that <I>he might make the 
 gospel of Christ without charge,</I> and did in other things comply 
 with and suit himself to the tempers and circumstances of those among 
 whom he laboured, for their good. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:1-33">tenth chapter</A>

 he dissuades them, from the example of the Jews, against having 
 communion with idolaters, by eating of their sacrifices, inasmuch as 
 they could not be at once partakers of the Lord's table and the table 
 of devils, though they were not bound to enquire concerning meat sold 
 in the shambles, or set before them at a feast made by unbelievers, 
 whether it were a part of the idol-sacrifices or no, but were at 
 liberty to eat without asking questions. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:1-34">eleventh chapter</A>

 he gives direction about their habit in public worship, blames them for 
 their gross irregularities and scandalous disorders in receiving the 
 Lord's supper, and solemnly warns them against the abuse of so sacred 
 an institution. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:1-31">twelfth chapter</A> 

 he enters on the consideration of spiritual gifts, which were poured 
 forth in great abundance on this church, upon which they were not a 
 little elated. He tells them, in this chapter, that all came from the 
 same original, and were all directed to the same end. They issued from 
 one Spirit, and were intended for the good of the church, and must be 
 abused when they were not made to minister to this purpose. Towards the 
 close he informs them that they were indeed valuable gifts, but he 
 could recommend to them something far more excellent, upon which he 
 breaks out, in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:1-13">thirteenth chapter</A>, 

 into the commendation and characteristics of charity. And them, in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:1-40">fourteenth</A>,

 he directs them how to keep up decency and order in the churches in the
 use of their spiritual gifts, in which they seem to have been
 exceedingly irregular, through pride of their gifts and a vanity of 
 showing them.  The

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:1-58">fifteenth chapter</A>

 is taken up in confirming and explaining the great doctrine of the
 resurrection. The 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:1-24">last chapter</A>

 consists of some particular advices and salutations; and thus the
 epistle closes.</P>
