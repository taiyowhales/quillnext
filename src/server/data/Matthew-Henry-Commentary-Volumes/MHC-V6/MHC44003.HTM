 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have a miracle and a sermon: the miracle wrought to
 make way for the sermon, to confirm the doctrine that was to be
 preached, and to make way for it into the minds of the people; and then 
 the sermon to explain the miracle, and to sow the ground which by it 
 was broken up. 

 I. The miracle was the healing of a man that was lame from his birth,
 with a word speaking 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>),

 and the impression which this made upon the people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>.

 II. The scope of the sermon which was preached here upon was to bring
 people to Christ, to repent of their sin in crucifying him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:12-19">ver. 12-19</A>),

 to believe in him now that he was glorified, and to comply with the
 Father's design in glorifying him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:20-26">ver. 20-26</A>.

 The former part of the discourse opens the wound, the latter applies 
 the remedy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the
 hour of prayer, <I>being</I> the ninth <I>hour.</I>
 &nbsp; 2 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried,
 whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called
 Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
 &nbsp; 3 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked
 an alms.
 &nbsp; 4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look
 on us.
 &nbsp; 5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of
 them.
 &nbsp; 6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I
 have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up
 and walk.
 &nbsp; 7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted <I>him</I> up: and
 immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
 &nbsp; 8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them
 into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
 &nbsp; 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
 &nbsp; 10 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the
 Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder
 and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
 &nbsp; 11 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John,
 all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called
 Solomon's, greatly wondering.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We were told in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:43"><I>ch.</I> ii. 43</A>)

 that <I>many signs and wonders were done by the apostles,</I> which are
 not written in this book; but here we have one given us for an 
 instance. As they wrought miracles, not upon every body as every body 
 had occasion for them, but as the Holy Spirit gave direction, so as to 
 answer the end of their commission; so all the miracles they did work 
 are not written in this book, but such only are recorded as the Holy 
 Ghost thought fit, to answer the end of this sacred history.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The persons by whose ministry this miracle was wrought were Peter 
 and John, two principal men among the apostles; they were so in 
 Christ's time, one speaker of the house for the most part, the other 
 favourite of the Master; and they continue so. When, upon the
 conversion of thousands, the church was divided into several societies, 
 perhaps Peter and John presided in that which Luke associated with, and 
 therefore he is more particular in recording what they said and did, as 
 afterwards what Paul said and did when he attended him, both the one 
 and the other being designed for specimens of what the other apostles 
 did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Peter and John had each of them a brother among the twelve, with whom
 they were coupled when they were sent out; yet now they seem to be knit
 together more closely than either of them to his brother, for the bond
 of friendship is sometimes stronger than that of relation: <I>there is
 a friend that sticks closer than a brother.</I> Peter and John seem to
 have had a peculiar intimacy after Christ's resurrection more than 
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:2">John xx. 2</A>.

 The reason of which (if I may have liberty to conjecture) might be
 this, that John, a disciple made up of love, was more compassionate to 
 Peter upon his fall and repentance, and more tender of him in his 
 <I>bitter weeping</I> for his sin, than any other of the apostles were, 
 and more solicitous to restore him in the <I>spirit of meekness,</I> 
 which made him very dear to Peter ever after; and it was good evidence 
 of Peter's acceptance with God, upon his repentance, that Christ's 
 favourite was made his bosom friend. David prayed, after his fall,
 <I>Let those that fear thee turn unto me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:79">Ps. cxix. 79</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The time and place are here set down. 

 1. It was in <I>the temple,</I> whither <I>Peter and John went up
 together,</I> because it was the place of concourse; there were the 
 shoals of fish among which the net of the gospel was to be cast, 
 especially during the days of pentecost, within the compass of which we 
 may suppose this to have happened. Note, It is good to go up to the 
 temple, to attend on public ordinances; and it is comfortable to go up 
 together to the temple: <I>I was glad when they said unto me, Let us 
 go.</I> The best society is society in worshipping God. 

 2. It was <I>at the hour of prayer,</I> one of the hours of public
 worship commonly appointed and observed among the Jews. Time and place 
 are two necessary circumstances of every action, which must be 
 determined by consent, as is most convenient for edification. With 
 reference to public worship, there must be a house of prayer and an 
 hour of prayer: the ninth hour, that is, three o'clock in the 
 afternoon, was one of the hours of prayer among the Jews; nine in the 
 morning and twelve at noon were the other two. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:17,Da+6:10">Ps. lv. 17; Dan. vi. 10</A>.

 It is of use for private Christians so far to have their hours of 
 prayer as may serve, though not to bind, yet to remind conscience: 
 <I>every thing is beautiful in its season.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The patient on whom this miraculous cure was wrought is here
 described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He was a poor lame beggar at the temple gate. 

 1. He was a cripple, not by accident, but born so; he was <I>lame from
 his mother's womb,</I> as it should seem, by a paralytic distemper,
 which weakened his limbs; for it is said in the description of his cure

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>His feet and ankle bones received strength.</I> Some such piteous 
 cases now and then there are, which we ought to be affected with and 
 look upon with compassion, and which are designed to show us what we 
 all are by nature spiritually: <I>without strength,</I> lame from our 
 birth, unable to work or walk in God's service. 

 2. He was a beggar. Being unable to work for his living, he must live
 upon alms; such are God's poor. He was <I>laid daily</I> by his friends 
 at <I>one of the gates of the temple,</I> a miserable spectacle, unable 
 to do any thing for himself but to <I>ask alms of those that entered 
 into the temple</I> or came out. There was a concourse,--a concourse of
 devout good people, from whom charity might be expected, and a 
 concourse of such people when it might be hoped they were in the best 
 frame; and there he was laid. Those that need, and cannot work, must 
 not be ashamed to beg. He would not have been laid there, and laid 
 there daily, if he had not been used to meet with supplies, daily 
 supplies there. Note, Our prayers and our alms should go together; 
 Cornelius's did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:4"><I>ch.</I> x. 4</A>.

 Objects of charity should be in a particular manner welcome to us when
 we go up to the temple to pray; it is a pity that common beggars at 
 church doors should any of them be of such a character as to discourage 
 charity; but they ought not always to be overlooked: some there are 
 surely that merit regard, and better feed ten drones, yea, and some 
 wasps, than let one bee starve. The gate of the temple at which he was 
 laid is here named: it was called <I>Beautiful,</I> for the 
 extraordinary splendour and magnificence of it. Dr. Lightfoot observes 
 that this was the gate that led out of the court of the Gentiles into 
 that of the Jews, and he supposes that the cripple would beg only of 
 the Jews, as disdaining to ask any thing of the Gentiles. But Dr. 
 Whitby takes it to be at the first entrance into the temple, and 
 beautified sumptuously, as became the frontispiece of that place where 
 the divine Majesty vouchsafed to dwell; and it was no diminution to the 
 beauty of this gate that a poor man lay there begging. 

 3. He begged of Peter and John

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 begged an alms; this was the utmost he expected from them, who had the 
 reputation of being charitable men, and who, though they had not much, 
 yet did good with what they had. It was not many weeks ago that the 
 blind and the lame came to Christ in the temple, and were healed there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:14">Matt. xxi. 14</A>.

 And why might not he have asked more than an alms, if he knew that
 Peter and John were Christ's messengers, and preached and wrought 
 miracles in his name? But he had that done for him which he looked not 
 for; he <I>asked an alms,</I> and had a cure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We have here the method of the cure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His expectations were raised. Peter, instead of turning his eyes 
 form him, as many do from objects of charity, turned his eyes to him, 
 nay, he <I>fastened his eyes upon him,</I> that his eye might affect 
 his heart with compassion towards him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 John did so too, for they were both guided by one and the same Spirit, 
 and concurred in this miracle; they said, <I>Look on us.</I> Our eye 
 must be ever towards the Lord (the eye of our mind), and, in token of 
 this, the eye of the body may properly be fixed on those whom he 
 employs as the ministers of his grace. This man needed not to be bidden 
 twice to look on the apostles; for he justly thought this gave him 
 cause to expect that he should <I>receive something form them,</I> and 
 therefore he <I>gave heed to them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Note, We must come to God both to attend on his word and to apply 
 ourselves to him in prayer, with hearts fixed and expectations raised. 
 We must look up to heaven and expect to receive benefit by that which 
 God speaks thence, and an answer of peace to the prayers sent up 
 thither. <I>I will direct my prayer unto thee, and will look 
 up.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His expectation of an alms was disappointed. <I>Peter said, "Silver 
 and gold have I none,</I> and therefore none to give thee;" yet he 
 intimated that if he had had any he would have given him an alms, not 
 brass, but silver or gold. Note, 

 (1.) It is not often that Christ's friends and favourites have 
 abundance of the wealth of this world. The apostles were very poor, had 
 but just enough for themselves, and no overplus. Peter and John had 
 abundance of money laid at their feet, but this was appropriated to the 
 maintenance of the poor of the church, and they would not convert any 
 of it to their own use, nor dispose of it otherwise than according tot 
 he intention of the donors. Public trusts ought to be strictly and 
 faithfully observed. 

 (2.) Many who are well inclined to works of charity are yet not in a 
 capacity of doing any thing considerable, while others, who have 
 wherewithal to do much, have not a heart to do any thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His expectations, notwithstanding, were quite outdone. Peter had not 
 money to give him; but, 

 (1.) He had that which was better, such an interest in heaven, such a 
 power from heaven, as to be able to cure his disease. Note, Those who 
 are poor in the world may yet be rich, very rich, in spiritual gifts, 
 graces, and comforts; certainly there is that which we are capable of 
 possessing which is infinitely better than silver and gold; the 
 merchandise and gain of it are better,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:12,Pr+3:14">Job xxviii. 12, &c.; Prov. iii. 14</A>,

 &c. 

 (2.) He gave him that which was better--the cure of his disease, which
 he would gladly have given a great deal of silver and gold for, if he 
 had had it, and the cure could have been so obtained. This would enable 
 him to work for his living, so that he would not need to beg any more; 
 nay, he would <I>have to give to those that needed,</I> and it <I>is 
 more blessed to give than to receive.</I> A miraculous cure would be a 
 greater instance of God's favour, and would put a greater honour upon 
 him, than thousands of gold and silver could. Observe, When Peter had
 no silver and gold to give, yet (says he) <I>such as I have I give 
 thee.</I> Note, Those may be, and ought to be, otherwise charitable and 
 helpful to the poor, who have not wherewithal to give in charity; those 
 who have not silver and gold have their limbs and senses, and with 
 these may be serviceable to the blind, and lame, and sick, and if they 
 be not, as there is occasion, neither would they give to them if they 
 had silver and gold. <I>As every one hath received the gift, so let him 
 minister it.</I> Let us now see how the cure was wrought. 

 [1.] Christ <I>sent his word, and healed him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:20">Ps. cvii. 20</A>);

 for healing grace is given by the word of Christ; this is the vehicle 
 of the healing virtue derived from Christ. Christ spoke cures by 
 himself; the apostles spoke them in his name. Peter bids a lame man 
 <I>rise up and walk,</I> which would have been a banter upon him if he 
 had not premised <I>in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth:</I> "I say 
 it by warrant from him, and it shall be done by power from him, and all 
 the glory and praise of it shall be ascribed to him." He calls Christ 
 <I>Jesus of Nazareth,</I> which was a name of reproach, to intimate 
 that the indignities done him on earth served but as a foil to his 
 glories now that he was in heaven. "Give him what name you will, call
 him if you will in scorn Jesus of Nazareth, in that name you shall see 
 wonders done; for, because he humbled himself, thus highly was he 
 exalted." He bids the cripple <I>rise up and walk,</I> which does not 
 prove that he had power in himself to do it, but that if he attempt to 
 rise and walk, and, in a sense of his own impotency, depend upon a 
 divine power to enable him to do it, he shall be enabled; and by rising 
 and walking he must evidence what that power has wrought upon him; and 
 then let him take the comfort, and let God have the praise. Thus it is 
 in the healing of our souls, which are spiritually impotent. 

 [2.] Peter lent his hand, and helped him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>He took him by the right hand,</I> in the same name in which he had 
 spoken to him to arise and walk, <I>and lifted him up.</I> Not that 
 this could contribute any thing to his cure; but it was a sign, plainly 
 intimating the help he should receive from God, if he exerted himself 
 as he was bidden. When God by his word commands us to rise, and walk in 
 the way of his commandments, if we mix faith with that word, and lay 
 our souls under the power of it, he will give his Spirit to take us by 
 the hand, and lift us up. If we set ourselves to do what we can, God 
 has promised his grace to enable us to do what we cannot; and by that 
 promise we partake of a new nature, and that grace shall not be in 
 vain; it was not here: <I>His feet and ankle-bones received 
 strength,</I> which they had not done if he had not attempted to rise, 
 and been helped up; he does his part, and Peter does his, and yet it is 
 Christ that does all: it is he that puts strength into him. As the
 bread was multiplied in the breaking, and the water turned into wine in 
 the pouring out, so strength was given to the cripple's feet in his 
 stirring them and using them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is the impression which this cure made upon the patient 
 himself, which we may best conceive of if we put our soul into his 
 soul's stead. 

 1. He leaped up, in obedience to the command, <I>Arise.</I> He found in
 himself such a degree of strength in his feet and ankle-bones that he 
 did not steal up gently, with fear and trembling, as weak people do 
 when they begin to recover strength; but he started up, as one 
 refreshed with sleep, boldly, and with great agility, and as one that 
 questioned not his own strength. The incomes of strength were sudden, 
 and he was no less sudden in showing them. He leaped, as one glad to 
 quit the bed or pad of straw on which he had lain so long lame. 

 2. He stood, and walked. He stood without either leaning or trembling,
 stood straight up, and walked without a staff. He trod strongly, and 
 moved steadily; and this was to manifest the cure, and that it was a 
 thorough cure. Note, Those who have had experience of the working of 
 divine grace upon them should evidence what they have experienced. Has 
 God put strength into us? Let us stand before him in the exercises of 
 devotion; let us walk before him in all the instances of a religious 
 conversation. Let us stand up resolutely for him, and walk cheerfully 
 with him, and both in strength derived and received form him. 

 3. He <I>held Peter and John,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 We need not ask why he held them. I believe he scarcely knew himself: 
 but it was in a transport of joy that he embraced them as the best 
 benefactors he had ever met with, and hung upon them to a degree of 
 rudeness; he would not let them go forward, but would have them stay 
 with him, while he published to all about him what God had done for him 
 by them. Thus he testified his affection to them; he held them, and 
 would not let them go. Some suggest that he clung to them for fear 
 lest, if they should leave him, his lameness should return. Those whom 
 God hath healed love those whom he made instruments of their healing, 
 and see the need of their further help. 

 4. He <I>entered with them into the temple.</I> His strong affection to
 them held them; but it could not hold them so fast as to keep them out 
 of the temple, whither they were going to preach Christ. We should 
 never suffer ourselves to be diverted by the utmost affectionate 
 kindnesses of our friends from going in the way of our duty. But, if 
 they will not stay with him, he is resolved to go with them, and the 
 rather because they are going into the temple, whence he had been so 
 long kept by his weakness and his begging: like the impotent man whom 
 Christ cured, he was presently found in the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:14">John v. 14</A>.

 He went into the temple, not only to offer up his praises and
 thanksgivings to God, but to hear more from the apostles of that Jesus 
 in whose name he had been healed. Those that have experienced the power 
 of Christ should earnestly desire to grow in their acquaintance with 
 Christ. 

 5. He was there <I>walking, and leaping, and praising God.</I> Note,
 The strength God has given us, both in mind and body, should be made us 
 of to his praise, and we should study how to honour him with it. Those 
 that are healed in his name must walk up and down in his name and in 
 his strength,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:12">Zech. x. 12</A>.

 This man, as soon as he could leap, leaped for joy in God, and praised 
 him. Here was that scripture fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:6">Isa. xxxv. 6</A>):

 <I>Then shall the lame man leap as a hart.</I> Now that this man was
 newly cured he was in this excess of joy and thankfulness. All true 
 converts walk and praise God; but perhaps young converts leap more in 
 his praises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. How the people that were eye-witnesses of this miracle were 
 influenced by it we are next told. 

 1. They were entirely satisfied in the truth of the miracle, and had
 nothing to object against it. <I>They knew it was he that sat begging 
 at the beautiful gate of the temple,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He had sat there so long that they all knew him; and for this reason he 
 was chosen to be the vessel of this mercy. Now they were not so 
 perverse as to make any doubt whether he was the same man, as the 
 Pharisees had questioned concerning the blind man that Christ cured,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:9,18">John ix. 9, 18</A>.
 
 They now saw him <I>walking, and praising God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and perhaps took notice of a change in his mind; for he was now as loud
 in praising God as he had before been in begging relief. The best 
 evidence that it was a complete cure was that he now praised God for 
 it. Mercies are then perfected, when they are sanctified. 

 2. They were astonished at it: They were <I>filled with wonder and
 amazement</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);
 
 <I>greatly wondering,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They were in an <I>ecstasy.</I> There seems to have been this effect of 
 the pouring out of the Spirit, that the people, at least those in 
 Jerusalem, were much more affected with the miracles the apostles 
 wrought than they had been with those of the same kind that had been 
 wrought by Christ himself; and this was in order to the miracles 
 answering their end. 

 3. They gathered about Peter and John: <I>All the people ran together
 unto them in Solomon's porch:</I> some only to gratify their curiosity 
 with the sight of men that had such power; others with a desire to hear 
 them preach, concluding that their doctrine must needs be of divine 
 origin, which thus had a divine ratification. They flocked to them in 
 Solomon's porch, a part of the court of the Gentiles, where Solomon had 
 built the outer porch of the temple; or, some cloisters or piazzas 
 which Herod had erected upon the same foundation upon which Solomon had 
 built the stately porch that bore his name, Herod being ambitious 
 herein to be a second Solomon. Here the people met, to see this great
 sight.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And when Peter saw <I>it,</I> he answered unto the people, Ye men
 of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on
 us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man
 to walk?
 &nbsp; 13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of
 our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up,
 and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined
 to let <I>him</I> go.
 &nbsp; 14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a
 murderer to be granted unto you;
 &nbsp; 15 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the
 dead; whereof we are witnesses.
 &nbsp; 16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man
 strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath
 given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
 &nbsp; 17 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did <I>it,</I>
 as <I>did</I> also your rulers.
 &nbsp; 18 But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth
 of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so
 fulfilled.
 &nbsp; 19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
 blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the
 presence of the Lord;
 &nbsp; 20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached
 unto you:
 &nbsp; 21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution
 of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
 prophets since the world began.
 &nbsp; 22 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the
 Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me;
 him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.
 &nbsp; 23 And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> every soul, which will not
 hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
 &nbsp; 24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow
 after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these
 days.
 &nbsp; 25 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant
 which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy
 seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
 &nbsp; 26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him
 to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his
 iniquities.

 We have here the sermon which Peter preached after he had cured the 
 lame man. <I>When Peter saw it.</I> 

 1. When he saw the people got together in a crowd, he took that
 opportunity to preach Christ to them, especially the temple being the 
 place of their concourse, and Solomon's porch there: let them come and 
 hear a more excellent wisdom than Solomon's, for, behold, a greater 
 than Solomon is here preached. 

 2. When he saw the people affected with the miracle, and filed with
 admiration, then he sowed the gospel seed in the ground which was thus 
 broken up, and prepared to receive it. 

 3. When he saw the people ready to adore him and John, he stepped in
 immediately, and diverted their respect from them, that it might be 
 directed to Christ only; to this <I>he answered</I> presently, as Paul 
 and Barnabas at Lystra. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:14,15"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 14, 15</A>.

 In the sermon,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He humbly disclaims the honour of the miracle as not due to them, 
 who were only the ministers of Christ, or instruments in his hand for 
 the doing of it. The doctrines they preached were not of their own 
 invention, nor were the seals of it their own, but his whose the 
 doctrines were. He addresses himself to them as <I>men of Israel,</I> 
 men to whom pertained, not only the law and the promises, but the 
 gospel and the performances, and who were nearly interested in the 
 present dispensation. Two things he asks them:--

 1. Why they were so surprised at the miracle itself: <I>Why marvel you
 at this?</I> It was indeed marvellous, and they justly wondered at it, 
 but it was not more than what Christ had done many a time, and they had 
 not duly regarded it, nor been affected with it. It was but a little 
 before that Christ had <I>raised Lazarus from the dead;</I> and why 
 should this then seem so strange? Note, Stupid people think that 
 strange now which might have been familiar to them if it had not been 
 their own fault. Christ had lately risen from the dead himself; why did 
 they not marvel at this? why were they not convinced by this?

 2. Why they gave so much of the praise of it to them, who were only the
 instruments of it: <I>Why look you so earnestly on us?</I>

 (1.) It was certain that they <I>had made this man to walk,</I> by 
 which it appeared that the apostles not only were sent of God, but were 
 sent to be blessings to the world, benefactors to mankind, and were 
 sent to heal sick and distempered souls, that were spiritually lame and 
 impotent, to set broken bones, and make them rejoice. 

 (2.) Yet they did not do it by any <I>power or holiness of their 
 own.</I> It was not done by any might of their own, any skill they had 
 in physic or surgery, nor any virtue in their word: the power they did 
 it by was wholly derived from Christ. Nor was it done by any merit of 
 their own; the power which Christ gave them to do it they had not 
 deserved: it was not by their own holiness; for, as they were weak 
 things, so they were foolish things, that Christ chose to employ; Peter 
 was a sinful man. What holiness had Judas? Yet he wrought miracles in 
 Christ's name. What holiness any of them had it was wrought in them, 
 and they could not pretend to merit by it. 

 (3.) It was the people's fault that they attributed it to their power 
 and holiness, and accordingly looked at them. Note, The instruments of 
 God's favour to us, though they must be respected, must not be 
 idolized; we must take heed of reckoning that to be done by the 
 instrument which God is the author of. 

 (4.) It was the praise of Peter and John that they would not take the 
 honour of this miracle to themselves, but carefully transmitted it to 
 Christ. Useful men must see to it that they be very humble. <I>Not unto 
 us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name give glory.</I> Every crown 
 must be cast at the feet of Christ; <I>not I, but the grace of God with 
 me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He preaches Christ to them; this was his business, that he might 
 lead them into obedience to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He preaches Christ, as the true Messiah promised to the fathers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);
 
 for, 

 (1.) He is Jesus the Son of God; though they had lately condemned 
 Christ as a blasphemer for saying that he was the Son of God, yet Peter 
 avows it: he is <I>his Son Jesus;</I> to him dear as a Son; to us, 
 <I>Jesus,</I> a Saviour. 

 (2.) God hath glorified him, in raising him up to be king, priest, and 
 prophet, of his church; he glorified him in his life and in his death, 
 as well as in his resurrection and ascension.

 (3.) He hath glorified him as <I>the God of our fathers,</I> whom he 
 names with respect (for they were great names with the men of Israel, 
 and justly), <I>the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.</I> God 
 sent him into the world, pursuant to the promises made to those 
 patriarchs, <I>that in their seed the families of the earth should be 
 blessed,</I> and the covenant made with them, <I>that God would be a 
 God to them, and their seed.</I> The apostles call the patriarchs their 
 fathers, and God the God of those patriarchs from whom the Jews were 
 descended, to intimate to them that they had no evil design upon the 
 Jewish nation (that they should look upon them with a jealous eye), but 
 had a value and concern for it, and were hereby well-wishers to it; and 
 the gospel they preached was the revelation of the mind and will of the 
 God of Abraham. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:7,22,Lu+1:72,73"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 7, 22; 
 Luke i. 72, 73</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He charges them flatly and plainly with the murder of this Jesus, as 
 he had done before. 

 (1.) "<I>You delivered him up</I> to your chief priests and elders, the 
 representative body of the nation; and you of the common people were 
 influenced by them to clamour against him, as if he had been a public 
 grievance." 

 (2.) "<I>You denied him,</I> and you disowned him, would not have him 
 then to be your king, could not look upon him as the Messiah, because 
 he came not in external pomp and power; <I>you denied him in the 
 presence of Pilate,</I> renounced all the expectations of your church, 
 in the presence of the Roman governor, who justly laughed at you for 
 it; <I>you denied him against the face of Pilate</I>" (so Dr. Hammond), 
 "in defiance of his reasonings with you" (<I>Pilate had determined to 
 let him go,</I> but the people opposed it, and overruled him). "You 
 were worse than Pilate, for he would have released him, if you had let 
 him follow his own judgment. <I>You denied the Holy One and the 
 Just,</I> who had approved himself so, and all the malice of his 
 persecutors could not disprove it." The holiness and justice of the 
 Lord Jesus, which are something more than his innocency, were a great 
 aggravation of the sin of those that put him to death.

 (3.) "<I>You desired a murderer to be released,</I> and Christ 
 crucified; as if Barabbas had deserved better at your hands than the 
 Lord Jesus, than which a greater affront could not be put upon him." 
 
 (4.) You <I>killed the prince of life.</I> Observe the antithesis: "You 
 preserved <I>a murderer,</I> a destroyer of life; and destroyed the 
 Saviour, <I>the author of life. You killed</I> him who was sent to be 
 to you <I>the prince of life,</I> and so not only forsook, but rebelled 
 against your own mercies. You did an ungrateful thing, in taking away 
 his life who would have been your life. You did a foolish thing to 
 think you could conquer <I>the prince of life,</I> who has life in 
 himself, and would soon resume the life he resigned."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He attests his resurrection as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:32"><I>ch.</I> xi. 32</A>.

 "You thought <I>the prince of life</I> might be deprived of his life,
 as any other prince might be deprived of his dignity and dominion, but 
 you found yourselves mistaken, for <I>God raised him from the dead;</I> 
 so that in putting him to death you fought against God, and were 
 baffled. <I>God raised him from the dead,</I> and thereby ratified his
 demands, and confirmed his doctrine, and rolled away all the reproach 
 of his sufferings, and <I>for the truth of his resurrection we are all 
 witnesses.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He ascribes the cure of this impotent man to the power of Christ, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>His name, through faith in his name,</I> in that discovery which he 
 hath made of himself, <I>has made this man strong.</I> He repeats it 
 again, <I>The faith which is by him hath given him this soundness.</I> 
 Here, 

 (1.) He appeals to themselves concerning the truth of the miracle; the 
 man on whom it was wrought is one <I>whom you see, and know, and have 
 known;</I> he was not acquainted with Peter and John before, so that 
 there was no room to suspect a compact between them: "You know him to 
 have been a cripple from a child. The miracle was wrought publicly, 
 <I>in the presence of you all;</I> not in a corner, but in the gate of 
 the temple; you saw in what manner it was done, so that there could be 
 no juggle in it; you had liberty to examine it immediately, and may 
 yet. The cure is complete; it is a <I>perfect soundness;</I> you see 
 the man walks and leaps, as one that has no remainder either of 
 weakness or pain." 

 (2.) He acquaints them with the power by which it was wrought. 

 [1.] It is done by the name of Christ, not merely by naming it as a 
 spell or charm, but it is done by us as professors and teachers of his 
 name, by virtue of a commission and instructions we have received from 
 him, and a power which he has invested us with, that name which Christ 
 has above every name; his authority, his command has done it; as writs 
 run in the king's name, though it is an inferior officer that executes 
 them. 

 [2.] The power of Christ is fetched in <I>through faith in his 
 name,</I> a confidence in him, a dependence on him, a believing 
 application to him, and expectation from him, even <I>that faith which 
 is,</I> <B><I>di autou</I></B>--<I>by him,</I> which is of his working;
 <I>it is not of ourselves, it is the gift of Christ;</I> and it is for 
 his sake, that he may have the glory of it; for he is both <I>the 
 author and finisher of our faith.</I> Dr. Lightfoot suggests that
 faith is twice named in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:16">this verse</A>,

 because of the apostles' faith in doing this miracle and the cripple's
 faith in receiving it; but I suppose it relates chiefly, if not only, 
 to the former. Those that wrought this miracle by faith derived power 
 from Christ to work it, and therefore returned all the glory to him. By 
 this true and just account of the miracle, Peter both confirmed the 
 great gospel truth they were to preach to the world--that Jesus Christ
 is the fountain of all power and grace, and the great healer and 
 Saviour--and recommended the great gospel duty of faith in him as the
 only way of receiving benefit by him. It explains likewise the great 
 gospel mystery of our salvation by Christ; it is his name that 
 justifies us, that glorious name of his, <I>The Lord our 
 righteousness;</I> but we, in particular, are justified by that name, 
 through faith in it, applying it to ourselves. Thus does Peter preach 
 unto them Jesus, and him crucified, as a faithful friend of the 
 bridegroom, to whose service and honour he devoted all his 
 interest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He encourages them to hope that, though they had been guilty of 
 putting Christ to death, yet they might find mercy; he does all he can 
 to convince them, yet is careful not to drive them to despair. The 
 guilt was very great, but, 

 1. He mollifies their crime by a candid imputation of it to their
 ignorance. Perhaps he perceived by the countenance of his hearers that 
 they were struck with great horror when he told them that they had 
 <I>killed the prince of life,</I> and were ready either to sink down or 
 to fly off, and therefore he saw it needful to mitigate the rigour of 
 the charge by calling them <I>brethren;</I> and well might he call them 
 so, for he had been himself a brother with them in this iniquity: he 
 had <I>denied the holy One and the Just,</I> and sworn that he did not 
 know him; he did it by surprise; "and, for your parts, <I>I know that 
 through ignorance you did it, as did also your rulers,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 This was the language of Peter's charity, and teaches us to make the 
 best of those whom we desire to make better. Peter had searched the 
 wound to the bottom, and now he begins to think of healing it up, in 
 order to which it is necessary to beget in them a good opinion of their 
 physician; and could any thing be more winning than this? That which 
 bears him out in it is that he has the example of his Master's praying 
 for his crucifiers, and pleading in their behalf that they knew not 
 what they did. And it is said of the rulers that <I>if they had known 
 they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>.
 
 Perhaps some of the rulers, and of the people, did therein rebel
 against the light and the convictions of their own consciences, and did 
 it through malice; but the generality went down the stream, and did it 
 through ignorance; as Paul persecuted the church, <I>ignorantly, and in 
 unbelief,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:13">1 Tim. i. 13</A>.

 2. He mollifies the effects of their crime--the death of <I>the prince
 of life;</I> this sounds very dreadful, but it was <I>according to the 
 scriptures</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 the predictions of which, though they did not necessitate their sin,
 yet did necessitate his sufferings; so he himself saith: <I>Thus it is 
 written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer. You did it through 
 ignorance</I> may be taken in this sense: "You fulfilled the scripture, 
 and did not know it; <I>God,</I> by your hands, <I>hath fulfilled what 
 he showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should 
 suffer;</I> this was his design in delivering him up to you, but you 
 had views of your own, and were altogether ignorant of this design; 
 <I>you meant not so, neither did your heart think so.</I> God was 
 fulfilling the scripture when you were gratifying your own passions." 
 Observe, It was not only determined in the secret counsel of God, but 
 declared to the world many ages before, <I>by the mouth</I> and pen 
 <I>of the prophets, that Christ should suffer,</I> in order to the 
 accomplishment of his undertaking; and it was God himself that 
 <I>showed</I> it by them, who will see that his words be made good; 
 what he showed he fulfilled, he so fulfilled as he had shown, 
 punctually and exactly, without any variation. Now, though this is no 
 extenuation at all of their sin in hating and persecuting Christ <I>to 
 the death</I> (this still appears exceedingly sinful), yet it was an 
 encouragement to them to repent, and hope for mercy upon their 
 repentance; not only because in general God's gracious designs were 
 carried on by it (ant thus it agrees with the encouragement Joseph gave 
 to his brethren, when they thought their offence against him almost 
 unpardonable: <I>Fear not,</I> saith he, <I>you thought evil against 
 me, but God meant it unto good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:15,20">Gen. l. 15, 20</A>),

 but because in particular the death and sufferings of Christ were for
 <I>the remission of sins,</I> and the ground of that display of mercy 
 for which he now encouraged them to hope.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He exhorts them all to turn Christians, and assures them it would 
 be unspeakably for their advantage to do so; it would be the making of 
 them for ever. This is the application of his sermon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He tells them what they must believe. 

 (1.) They must believe that Jesus Christ is the promised see, that seed 
 in which God had told Abraham <I>all the kindreds of the earth should 
 be blessed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 This refers to that promise made to Abraham
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:3">Gen. xii. 3</A>),

 which promise was long ere it was fulfilled, but now at length had its 
 accomplishment in this <I>Jesus,</I> who was of <I>the seed of Abraham, 
 according to the flesh,</I> and <I>in him all the families of the earth 
 are blessed,</I> and not the families of Israel only; all have some 
 benefits by him, and some have all benefits. 

 (2.) They must believe that Jesus Christ is a prophet, <I>that prophet 
 like unto Moses</I> whom God had promised to <I>raise up to them from 
 among their brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 This refers to that promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:18">Deut. xviii. 18</A>.

 Christ is a prophet, for by him God speaks unto us; in him all divine 
 revelation centres, and by him it is handed to us; he is a <I>prophet 
 like unto Moses,</I> a favourite of Heaven; more intimately acquainted 
 with the divine counsel, and more familiarly conversed with, than any 
 other prophet. He was a deliverer of his people out of bondage, and 
 their guide through the wilderness, like Moses; a prince and a 
 lawgiver, like Moses; the builder of the true tabernacle, as Moses was 
 of the typical one. Moses was <I>faithful as a servant,</I> Christ 
 <I>as a Son.</I> Moses was murmured against by Israel, defied by 
 Pharaoh, yet God owned him, and ratified his commission. Moses was a 
 pattern of meekness and patience, so is Christ. Moses died by <I>the 
 word of the Lord,</I> so did Christ. <I>There was no prophet like unto
 Moses</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6,7,De+34:10">Num. xii. 6, 7; Deut. xxxiv. 10</A>),

 but a greater than Moses is here where Christ is. He is a prophet of 
 God's raising up, for he took not this honour of himself, but was 
 called of God to it. He was raised up unto Israel in the first place. 
 He executed this office in his own person among them only. They had the 
 first offer of divine grace made to them; and therefore he was 
 <I>raised up from among them--of them, as concerning the flesh, Christ
 came,</I> which, as it was a great honour done to them, so it was both 
 an obligation upon them and an encouragement to them to embrace him. If 
 he come to his own, one would think, they should receive him. The 
 Old-Testament church was blessed with many prophets, with schools of 
 prophets, for many ages with a constant succession of prophets (which 
 is here taken notice of, from <I>Samuel, and those that follow 
 after,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>,

 for from Samuel the prophetic era commenced); but, these servants being 
 abused, last of all God sent them his Son, who had been in his bosom.

 (3.) They must believe <I>that times of refreshing will come from the 
 presence of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and that they will be <I>the times of the restitution of all 
 things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 There is a future state, another life after this; those times will come 
 from the presence of the Lord, from his glorious appearance at that 
 day, his coming at the end of time. The absence of the Lord occasions 
 many of the securities of sinners and the distrusts of saints; but his 
 presence is hastening on, which will for ever silence both. <I>Behold, 
 the Judge standeth before the door.</I> The presence of the Lord will 
 introduce, 
 
 [1.] <I>The restitution of all things</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 <I>the new heavens, and the new earth,</I> which will be the product of 
 the dissolution of all things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:1">Rev. xxi. 1</A>),

 the renovation of the whole creation, which is that which it grieves 
 after, as its present burden under the sin of man is that which it 
 groans under. Some understand this of a state on this side the end of 
 time; but it is rather to be understood of that <I>end of all things 
 which God hath spoken of by the mouth of all his holy prophets since 
 the world began;</I> for this is that which <I>Enoch, the seventh from 
 Adam, prophesied of</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>),

 and the temporal judgments which the other prophets foretold were
 typical of that which the apostle calls <I>the eternal judgment.</I> 
 This is more clearly and plainly revealed in the New Testament than it 
 had been before, and all that receive the gospel have an expectation of 
 it. 
 
 [2.] With this will come <I>the times of refreshing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 of consolation to the Lord's people, like a cool shade to those <I>that 
 have borne the burden and heat of the day.</I> All Christians look for 
 <I>a rest that remains for the people of God,</I> after the travails 
 and toils of their present state, and, with the prospect of this, they 
 are borne up under their present sufferings and carried on in their 
 present services. The refreshing that then <I>comes from the presence 
 of the Lord</I> will continue eternally in the presence of the 
 Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He tells them what they must do. 

 (1.) They must <I>repent,</I> must bethink themselves of what they have 
 done amiss, must return to their right mind, admit a second thought, 
 and submit to the convictions of it; they must begin anew. Peter, who 
 had himself denied Christ, repented, and he would have them to do so 
 too. 

 (2.) They must <I>be converted,</I> must face about, and direct both 
 their faces and steps the contrary way to what they had been; they must 
 <I>return to the Lord their God,</I> from whom they had revolted. It
 is not enough to repent of sin, but we must be converted from it, and 
 not return to it again. They must not only exchange the profession of
 Judaism for that of Christianity, but the power and dominion of a 
 carnal, worldly, sensual mind, for that of holy, heavenly, and divine 
 principles and affections.

 (3.) They must hear Christ, the great prophet: "<I>Him shall you hear 
 in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</I> Attend his 
 dictates, receive his doctrine, submit to his government. Hear him with 
 a divine faith, as prophets should be heard, that come with a divine 
 commission. <I>Him shall you hear,</I> and to him shall you subscribe 
 with an implicit faith and obedience. <I>Hear him in all things;</I> 
 let his laws govern all your actions, and his counsels determine all 
 your submissions. Whenever he has a mouth to speak, you must have an 
 ear to hear. Whatever he saith to you, though ever so displeasing to 
 flesh and blood, bid it welcome." <I>Speak, Lord, for thy servant 
 hears.</I> A good reason is here given why we should be observant of, 
 and obedient to, the word of Christ; for it is at our peril if we turn 
 a deaf ear to his call and a stiff neck to his yoke 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Every soul that will not hear that prophet,</I> and be directed by 
 what he saith, <I>shall be destroyed from among the people.</I> The 
 destruction of the city and nation, by war and famine, was threatened 
 for slighting the prophets of the Old Testament; but the destruction of 
 the soul, a spiritual and eternal destruction, is threatened for 
 slighting Christ, <I>this great prophet.</I> Those that will not be 
 advised by the Saviour can expect no other than to fall into the hands 
 of the destroyer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He tells them what they might expect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That they should have the pardon of their sins; this is always 
 spoken of as the great privilege of all those that embrace the gospel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Repent, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.</I> 
 This implies, 

 [1.] That the remission of sin is the blotting of it out, as a cloud is 
 blotted out by the beams of the sun

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:22">Isa. xliv. 22</A>),

 as a debt is crossed and blotted out when it is remitted. It intimates 
 that when God forgives sin he remembers it no more against the sinner; 
 it is forgotten, as that which is blotted out; all the bitter things 
 written against the sinner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:26">Job xiii. 26</A>)

 are wiped out as it were with a sponge; it is the cancelling of a bond, 
 the vacating of a judgment.

 [2.] That we cannot expect our sins should be pardoned unless we repent 
 of them, and turn from them to God. Though Christ has died to purchase 
 the remission of sin, yet, that we may have the benefit of that 
 purchase in the forgiveness of our sins, we must repent, and be 
 converted: if no repentance, no remission.

 [3.] Hopes of the pardon of sin upon repentance should be a powerful 
 inducement to us to repent. <I>Repent, that your sins may be blotted
 out:</I> and that repentance is evangelical which flows from an 
 apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, and the hopes of pardon. 
 This was the first and great argument, <I>Repent, for the kingdom of 
 heaven is at hand.</I> 

 [4.] The most comfortable fruit of the forgiveness of our sins will be 
 <I>when the times of refreshing shall come;</I> if our sins be forgiven 
 us, we have now reason to be of good cheer; but the comfort will be 
 complete when the pardon shall be allowed in open court, and our 
 justification published <I>before angels and men</I>--when <I>whom he
 has justified, them he glorifies,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:30">Rom. viii. 30</A>.

 As <I>now we are the sons of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:2">1 John iii. 2</A>),

 so now we have our sins blotted out; <I>but it doth not yet appear
 what</I> are the blessed fruits of it, till <I>the times of refreshing 
 shall come.</I> During these times of toil and conflict (doubts and 
 fears within, troubles and dangers without) we cannot have that full 
 satisfaction of our pardon, and in it, that we shall have when the 
 refreshing times come, which shall wipe away all tears.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That they should have the comfort of Christ's coming 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>):
 
 "<I>He shall send Jesus Christ,</I> the same Jesus, the very same 
 <I>that before was preached unto you;</I> for you must not expect 
 another dispensation, another gospel, but the continuance and 
 completion of this; you must not expect another prophet like unto 
 Jesus, as Moses bade you expect another like unto him; for, though 
 <I>the heavens must receive him till the times of the restitution of 
 all things;</I> yet, if you <I>repent and be converted,</I> you shall 
 find no want of him; some way or other he shall be seen of you." 

 [1.] We must not expect Christ's personal presence with us in this 
 world; for the heavens, which received him out of the sight of the 
 disciples, must retain him till the end of time. To that seat of the 
 blessed his bodily presence is confined, and will be to the end of 
 time, the accomplishment of all things (so it may be read); and 
 therefore those dishonour him, and deceive themselves, who dream of his 
 corporal presence in the eucharist. It is agreeable to a state of trial 
 and probation that the glorified Redeemer should be out of sight, 
 because we must live by that faith in him which is <I>the evidence of 
 things not seen;</I> because he must be <I>believed on in the 
 world,</I> he must be <I>received up into glory.</I> Dr. Hammond reads 
 it, <I>Who must receive the heavens,</I> that is, who must <I>receive 
 the glory and power of the upper world; he must reign till all be made 
 subject to him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:25,Ps+75:2">1 Cor. xv. 25; Ps. lxxv. 2</A>.

 [2.] Yet it is promised that he shall be sent to all that repent and 
 are converted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>He shall send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you</I> by his
 disciples, both before and since his resurrection, and is, and will be, 
 all in all to them." <I>First,</I> "You shall have his spiritual 
 presence. He that is sent into the world shall be sent to you; you 
 shall have the comfort of his being sent; he shall be sent among you in 
 his gospel, which shall be his tabernacle, his chariot of war." 
 <I>Secondly, "He shall send Jesus Christ</I> to destroy Jerusalem, and 
 the nation of unbelieving Jews, that are enemies to Christ and 
 Christianity, and to deliver his ministers and people from them, and 
 give them peace in the profession of the gospel, and that shall be a 
 time of refreshing, in which you shall share." <I>Then had the churches 
 rest;</I> so Dr. Hammond. <I>Thirdly,</I> "The sending of Christ to
 judge the world, at the end of time, will be a blessing to you; you 
 shall then <I>lift up your heads with joy, knowing that your redemption 
 draws nigh.</I>" It seems to refer to this, for till then <I>the 
 heavens must receive him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 As God's counsels from eternity, so his predictions from the beginning 
 of time, had a reference to the transactions of the last day, when 
 <I>the mystery of God shall be finished, as he had declared to his 
 servants the prophets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:7">Rev. x. 7</A>.

 The institution of all things in the church had an eye to the 
 restitution of all things at the end of time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He tells them what ground they had to expect these things, if they 
 were converted to Christ. Though they had denied him, and put him to 
 death, yet they might hope to find favour through him, upon the account 
 of their being Israelites. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As Israelites, they had the monopoly of the grace of the Old 
 Testament; they were, above any other, God's favourite nation, and the 
 favours God bestowed upon them were such as had a reference to the 
 Messiah, and his kingdom: <I>You are the children of the prophets, and 
 of the covenant.</I> A double privilege. 

 [1.] They were <I>the children,</I> that is, the disciples, <I>of the 
 prophets,</I> as children at school; <I>not sons of the prophets,</I> 
 in the sense that we read of such in the Old Testament, from Samuel and 
 downward, who were, or are, trained up to be <I>endued with the spirit 
 of prophecy;</I> but you are of that people from among whom prophets 
 were raised up, and to whom prophets were sent. It is spoken of as a 
 great favour to Israel <I>that God raised up of their sons for 
 prophets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:11">Amos ii. 11</A>.

 All the inspired writers, both of the Old and New Testament, were of
 <I>the seed of Abraham;</I> and it was their honour and advantage
 <I>that unto them were committed the oracles of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:2">Rom. iii. 2</A>.
 
 Their government was constituted by prophecy, that is, by divine
 revelation; and by it their affairs were for many ages very much
 managed. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:13">Hos. xii. 13</A>.

 <I>By a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet
 was he preserved.</I> Those of the latter ages of the church, when 
 prophecy had ceased, might yet be fitly called <I>the children of the 
 prophets,</I> because they heard, though they did not know, <I>the 
 voices of the prophets, which were read in their synagogues every 
 sabbath day,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13;27"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 27</A>.

 Now this should quicken them to embrace Christ, and they might hope to
 be accepted of him; for their own prophets had foretold <I>that this 
 grace should be brought unto them at the revelation of Jesus Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:13">1 Pet. i. 13</A>),

 and therefore ought not to be neglected by them, nor should be denied 
 to them. Those that are blessed with prophets and prophecy (as all are 
 that have the scriptures) are concerned not to receive the grace of God 
 therein in vain. We may apply it particularly to ministers' children, 
 who, if they plead their parentage effectually with themselves, as an 
 inducement to be faithful and forward in religion, may comfortably 
 plead it with God, and hope <I>that the children of God's servants 
 shall continue.</I> 

 [2.] They were <I>the children,</I> that is, the heirs, <I>of the 
 covenant which God made with our Fathers,</I> as children in the 
 family. God's covenant was made <I>with Abraham and his seed,</I> and 
 they were <I>that seed</I> with whom the <I>covenant was made,</I> and 
 on whom <I>the blessings of the covenant were entailed:</I> "The 
 promise of the Messiah was made to you, and therefore if you forsake 
 not your own mercies, and do not by an obstinate infidelity put a bar 
 in your own door, you may hope it shall be made good to you." That 
 promise here mentioned, as the principal article of the covenant, <I>In 
 thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed,</I> though 
 referring principally to Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:16">Gal. iii. 16</A>),

 yet may include the church also, which is his body, all believers, that 
 are the spiritual seed of Abraham. <I>All the kindreds of the earth 
 were blessed</I> in having a church for Christ among them; and those 
 that were <I>the seed of Abraham according to the flesh</I> stood 
 fairest for this privilege. If all the kindreds of the earth were to be 
 blessed in Christ, much more that kindred, <I>his kinsmen according to 
 the flesh.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) As Israelites, they had the first offer of the grace of the New 
 Testament. Because <I>they were the children of the prophets and the 
 covenant,</I> therefore to them the Redeemer was first sent, which was 
 an encouragement to them to hope that if they did repent, and were 
 converted, he should be yet further sent for their comfort 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 
 <I>He shall send Jesus Christ,</I> for to you first he hath sent him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 <I>Unto you first,</I> you Jews, though not to you only, <I>God, having 
 raised up his Son Jesus,</I> appointed and authorized him <I>to be a 
 prince and a Saviour,</I> and, in confirmation of this, <I>raised him 
 from the dead, sent him to bless you,</I> to make a tender of his 
 blessing to you, especially that great blessing of <I>turning every one 
 of you from his iniquities;</I> and therefore it concerns you to 
 receive this blessing, and turn from your iniquities, and you may be 
 encouraged to hope that you shall. 

 [1.] We are here told whence Christ had his mission: <I>God raised up 
 his Son Jesus, and sent him.</I> God raised him up when he constituted 
 him a prophet, owned his by a voice from heaven, and filled him with 
 his Spirit without measure, and then sent him; for to this end he 
 raised him up, that he might be his commissioner to treat of peace. He 
 sent him to bear witness of the truth, sent him to seek and save lost 
 souls, sent him against his enemies, to conquer them. Some refer <I>the 
 raising of him up to the resurrection,</I> which was the first step 
 towards his exaltation; this was, as it were, the renewing of his 
 commission; and though, having raised him up, he seemed presently to 
 take him from us, yet he did really send him afresh to us in his gospel 
 and Spirit. 

 [2.] To whom he was sent: "<I>Unto you first.</I> You of the seed of 
 Abraham, you that are <I>the children of the prophets, and of the 
 covenant,</I> to you is the tender made of gospel grace." The personal 
 ministry of Christ, as that of the prophets, was confined to the Jews; 
 he was not then <I>sent but to the lost sheep of the house of 
 Israel,</I> and he forbade the disciples he then sent forth to go any 
 further. After his resurrection, he was to be preached indeed to all 
 nations, but they must <I>begin at Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:47">Luke xxiv. 47</A>.

 And, when they went to other nations, they first preached to the Jews 
 they found therein. They were the first-born, and, as such, had the 
 privilege of the first offer. So far were they from being excluded for 
 their putting Christ to death, that, when he is risen, he is first sent 
 to them, and they are primarily intended to have benefit by his death.

 [3.] On what errand he was sent: "<I>He is sent to you first, to bless
 you;</I> this is his primary errand, not to condemn you, as you 
 deserve, but to justify you, if you will accept of the justification 
 offered you, in the way wherein it is offered; but he that sends him 
 first to bless you, if you refuse and reject that blessing, will send 
 him to curse you with a curse,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:6">Mal. iv. 6</A>.

 Note, <I>First,</I> Christ's errand into the world was to bless us, to
 bring a blessing with him, for <I>the Sun of righteousness rose with
 healing under his wings;</I> and, when he left the world, he left a
 blessing behind him for he was <I>parted from the disciples as he
 blessed them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:51">Luke xxiv. 51</A>.

 He sent his Spirit to be the great blessing, the blessing of blessings,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:3">Isa. xliv. 3</A>.

 It is by Christ that God sends blessings to us, and through him only we 
 can expect to receive them. <I>Secondly,</I> The great blessing 
 wherewith Christ came to bless us was the turning of us away from our 
 iniquities, the saving of us from our sins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:21">Matt. i. 21</A>),

 to turn us from sin, that we may be qualified to receive all other
 blessings. Sin is that to which naturally we cleave; the design of 
 divine grace is to turn us from it, nay, to turn us against it, that we 
 may not only forsake it, but hate it. The gospel has a direct tendency 
 to do this, not only as it requires us, every one of us, to turn from 
 our iniquities, but as it promises us grace to enable us to do so. 
 "Therefore, do your part; <I>repent, and be converted,</I> because 
 Christ is ready to do his, <I>in turning you from your iniquities,</I> 
 and so blessing you."</P>
