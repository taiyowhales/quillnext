 Hitherto, according to the judgment of very eminent expositors, God had 
 represented to his servant, John, 

 I. The state of the church under the pagan powers, in the six seals
 opened; and then, 

 II. The state of the church under the papal powers, in the vision of
 the six trumpets that began to sound upon the opening of the seventh
 seal: and then is inserted.

 III. A more general and brief account of the past, present, and future
 state of the church, in the little book, &c. He now proceeds, 

 IV. To show him how antichrist should be destroyed, by what steps that
 destruction should be accomplished, in the vision of the seven vials.
 This chapter contains an awful introduction or preparation for the
 pouring out of the vials, in which we have,

 1. A sight of those angels in heaven who were to have the execution of
 this great work, and with what acclamations of joy the heavenly hosts 
 applauded the great design, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+15:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 2. A sight of these angels coming out of heaven to receive those vials
 which they were to pour out, and the great commotions this caused in 
 the world,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven
 angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up
 the wrath of God.
 &nbsp; 2  And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and
 them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his
 image, and over his mark, <I>and</I> over the number of his name,
 stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
 &nbsp; 3  And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the
 song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous <I>are</I> thy works,
 Lord God Almighty; just and true <I>are</I> thy ways, thou King of
 saints.
 &nbsp; 4  Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for
 <I>thou</I> only <I>art</I> holy: for all nations shall come and worship
 before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.

 Here we have the preparation of matters for the pouring out of the 
 seven vials, which was committed to seven angels; and observe how these 
 angels appeared to the apostle--<I>in heaven;</I> it was in a wonderful
 manner, and that upon account, 

 1. Of the work they had to do, which was to finish the destruction of
 antichrist. God was now about to pour out his seven last plagues upon 
 that interest; and, as the measure of Babylon's sins was filled up, 
 they should now find the full measure of his vindictive wrath. 

 2. The spectators and witnesses of this their commission: all <I>that
 had gotten the victory over the beast,</I> &c. These stood on a <I>sea
 of glass,</I> representing this world, as some think, a brittle thing, 
 that shall be broken to pieces; or, as others, the gospel covenant, 
 alluding to the brazen sea in the temple, in which the priests were to 
 wash (the faithful servants of God stand upon the foundation of the 
 righteousness of Christ); or, as others, <I>the Red Sea,</I> that stood 
 as it were congealed while the Israelites went through; and, the pillar 
 of fire reflecting light upon the waters, they would seem to have fire 
 mingled with them; and this to show that the fire of God's wrath 
 against Pharaoh and his horses should dissolve the congealed waters, 
 and destroy them thereby, to which there seems to be an allusion by 
 their <I>singing the song of Moses,</I> in which,

 (1.) They extol the greatness of God's works, and the justice and truth 
 of his ways, both in delivering his people and destroying their 
 enemies. They rejoiced in hope, and the near prospect they had of
 this, though it was not yet accomplished. 

 (2.) They call upon all nations to render unto God the fear, glory, and 
 worship, due to such a discovery of his truth and justice: <I>Who shall 
 not fear thee?</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the
 tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:
 &nbsp; 6  And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven
 plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their
 breasts girded with golden girdles.
 &nbsp; 7  And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven
 golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and
 ever.
 &nbsp; 8  And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God,
 and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple,
 till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, I. How these angels appeared--coming out of heaven to execute
 their commission: <I>The temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in 
 heaven was opened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+15:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Here is an allusion to the holiest of all the tabernacle and temple, 
 where was <I>the mercy-seat, covering the ark of the testimony,</I> 
 where the high priest made intercession, and God communed with his 
 people, and heard their prayers. Now by this, as it is here mentioned, 
 we may understand, 

 1. That, in the judgments God was now about to execute upon the
 antichristian interest, he was fulfilling the prophecies and promises 
 of his word and covenant, which were there always before him, and of 
 which he was ever mindful. 

 2. That in this work he was answering the prayers of the people, which
 were offered to him by their great high priest. 

 3. That he was herein avenging the quarrel of his own Son, and our
 Saviour Jesus Christ, whose offices and authority had been usurped, his 
 name dishonoured, and the great designs of his death opposed, by 
 antichrist and his adherents. 

 4. That he was opening a wider door of liberty for his people to
 worship him in numerous solemn assemblies, without the fear of their 
 enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they were equipped and prepared for their work. Observe, 

 1. Their array: They were <I>clothed with pure and white linen,</I>
 and had <I>their breasts girded with golden girdles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 This was the habit of the high priests when they went in to enquire of 
 God, and came out with an answer from him. This showed that these 
 angels were acting in all things under the divine appointment and 
 direction, and that they were going to prepare a sacrifice to the Lord, 
 <I>called the supper of the great God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:17"><I>ch.</I> xix. 17</A>.

 The angels are the ministers of divine justice, and they do every thing
 in a pure and holy manner. 

 2. Their artillery, what it was, and whence they received it; their
 artillery, by which they were to do this great execution, was <I>seven 
 vials filled with the wrath of God;</I> they were armed with the wrath 
 of God against his enemies. The meanest creature, when it comes armed 
 with the anger of God, will be too hard for any man in the world; but 
 much more an angel of God. This wrath of God was not to be poured out 
 all at once, but was divided into seven parts, which should 
 successively fall upon the antichristian party. Now from whom did they 
 receive these vials? From one of the four living creatures, one of the 
 ministers of the true church, that is, in answer to the prayers of the 
 ministers and people of God, and to avenge their cause, in which the 
 angels are willingly employed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The impressions these things made upon all who stood near the 
 temple: they were all, as it were, wrapt up in clouds of smoke, which 
 filled the temple, from the glorious and powerful presence of God; so 
 that <I>no man was able to enter into the temple,</I> till the work was 
 finished. The interests of antichrist were so interwoven with the civil 
 interests of the nations that he could not be destroyed without giving
 a great shock to all the world; and the people of God would have but 
 little rest and leisure to assemble themselves before him, while this 
 great work was a doing. For the present, their sabbaths would be 
 interrupted, ordinances of public worship intermitted, and all thrown 
 into a general confusion. God himself was now preaching to the church 
 and to all the world, by terrible things in righteousness; but, when 
 this work was done, then the churches would have rest, the temple would 
 be opened, and the solemn assemblies gathered, edified, and multiplied. 
 The greatest deliverances of the church are brought about by awful and 
 astonishing steps of Providence.</P>
