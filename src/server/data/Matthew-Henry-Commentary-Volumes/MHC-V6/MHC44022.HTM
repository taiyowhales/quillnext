 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the close of the foregoing chapter we had Paul bound, according to 
 Agabus's prophecy of the hard usage he should receive from the Jews at 
 Jerusalem, yet he had his tongue set at liberty, by the permission the 
 chief captain gave him to speak for himself; and so intent he is upon 
 using that liberty of speech which is allowed him, to the honour of 
 Christ and the service of his interest, that he forgets the bonds he is 
 in, makes no mention of them, but speaks of the great things Christ had 
 done for him with as much ease and cheerfulness as if nothing had been 
 done to ruffle him or put him into disorder. We have here, 

 I. His address to the people, and their attention to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The account he gives of himself.

 1. What a bigoted Jew he had been in the beginning of his time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 2. How he was miraculously converted and brought over to the faith of
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:6-11">ver. 6-11</A>.

 3. How he was confirmed and baptized by the ministry of Ananias, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:12-16">ver. 12-16</A>.

 4. How he was afterwards called, by an immediate warrant from heaven,
 to be the apostle of the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:17-21">ver. 17-21</A>.

 III. The interruption given him upon this by the rabble, who could not 
 bear to hear any thing said in favour of the Gentiles, and the violent 
 passion they flew into upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:22,23">ver. 22, 23</A>.

 IV. Paul's second rescue out of the hands of the rabble, and the 
 further course which the chief captain took to find out the true reason 
 of this mighty clamour against Paul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:24,25">ver. 24, 25</A>.

 V. Paul's pleading his privilege as a Roman citizen, by which he was
 exempted from this barbarous method of inquisition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:26-29">ver. 26-29</A>.

 VI. The chief captain's removing the cause into the high priest's 
 court, and Paul's appearing there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:30">ver. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence <I>which I make</I>
 now unto you.
 &nbsp; 2 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to
 them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul had, in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:40">last 
 verse of the foregoing chapter</A>,

 gained a great
 point, by commanding so profound a silence after so loud a clamour. Now 
 here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. With what an admirable composure and presence of mind he addresses 
 himself to speak. Never was poor man set upon in a more tumultuous 
 manner, nor with more rage and fury; and yet, in what he said, 

 1. There appears o fright, but his mind is sedate and composed. Thus he
 makes his own words good, <I>None of these things move me;</I> and 
 David's

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:6">Ps. iii. 6</A>),

 <I>I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set 
 themselves against me round about.</I> 

 2. There appears no passion. Though the suggestions against him were
 all frivolous and unjust, though it would have vexed any man alive to 
 be charged with profaning the temple just then when he was contriving 
 and designing to show his respect to it, yet he breaks out into no 
 angry expressions, but is <I>led as a lamb to the slaughter.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What respectful titles he gives even to those who thus abused him, 
 and how humbly he craves their attention: "<I>Men, brethren, and 
 fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 <I>To you, O men, I call;</I> men, that should hear reason, and be 
 ruled by it; men, from whom one may expect humanity. You,
 <I>brethren</I> of the common people; you, <I>fathers</I> of the 
 priests." Thus he lets them know that he was one of them, and had not 
 renounced his relation to the Jewish nation, but still had a kindness 
 and concern for it. Note, Though we must not give flattering titles to
 any, yet we ought to give titles of due respect to all; and those we 
 would do good to we should endeavour not to provoke. Though he was 
 rescued out of their hands, and was taken under the protection of the 
 chief captain, yet he does not fall foul upon them, with, <I>Hear now, 
 you rebels;</I> but compliments them with, <I>Men, brethren, and 
 fathers.</I> And observe, he does not exhibit a charge against them, 
 does not recriminate, Hear now what I have to say against you, but, 
 Hear now what I have to say for myself: <I>Hear you my defence;</I> a 
 just and reasonable request, for every man that is accused has a right 
 to answer for himself, and has not justice done him if his answer be 
 not patiently and impartially heard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The language he spoke in, which recommended what he said to the 
 auditory; <I>He spoke in the Hebrew tongue,</I> that is, the vulgar 
 language of the Jews, which, at this time, was not the pure 
 Old-Testament Hebrew, but the Syriac, a dialect of the Hebrew, or 
 rather a corruption of it, as the Italian of the Latin. However, 

 1. It showed his continued respect to his countrymen, the Jews. Though
 he had conversed so much with the Gentiles, yet he still retained the 
 Jews' language, and could talk it with ease; by this it appears he is a 
 Jew, <I>for his speech betrayeth him.</I> 

 2. What he said was the more generally understood, for that was the
 language every body spoke, and therefore to speak in that language was 
 indeed to appeal to the people, by which he might have somewhat to 
 insinuate into their affections; and therefore, <I>when they heard that 
 he spoke in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more silence.</I> How can 
 it be thought people should give any attention to that which is spoken 
 to them in a language they do not understand? The chief captain was 
 surprised to hear him speak Greek

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:37"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 37</A>),
 
 the Jews were surprised to hear him speak Hebrew, and both
 therefore think the better of him. But how would they have been
 surprised if they had enquired, as they ought to have done, and found
 in what variety of tongues <I>the Spirit gave him utterance!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:18">1 Cor. xiv. 18</A>,

 <I>I speak with tongues more than you all.</I> But the truth is, many
 wise and good men are therefore slighted only because they are not 
 known.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 I am verily a man <I>which am</I> a Jew, born in Tarsus, <I>a city</I>
 in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel,
 <I>and</I> taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the
 fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
 &nbsp; 4 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and
 delivering into prisons both men and women.
 &nbsp; 5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the
 estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the
 brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there
 bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.
 &nbsp; 6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come
 nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a
 great light round about me.
 &nbsp; 7 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,
 Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
 &nbsp; 8 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am
 Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
 &nbsp; 9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were
 afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
 &nbsp; 10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto
 me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee
 of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
 &nbsp; 11 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being
 led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
 &nbsp; 12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a
 good report of all the Jews which dwelt <I>there,</I>
 &nbsp; 13 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul,
 receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
 &nbsp; 14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that
 thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and
 shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.
 &nbsp; 15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
 seen and heard.
 &nbsp; 16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash
 away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
 &nbsp; 17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to
 Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
 &nbsp; 18 And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly
 out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony
 concerning me.
 &nbsp; 19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in
 every synagogue them that believed on thee:
 &nbsp; 20 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also
 was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the
 raiment of them that slew him.
 &nbsp; 21 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence
 unto the Gentiles.

 Paul here gives such an account of himself as might serve not only to 
 satisfy the chief captain that he was not that Egyptian he took him to 
 be, but the Jews also that he was not that enemy to their church and 
 nation, to their law and temple, they took him to be, and that what he 
 did in preaching Christ, and particularly in preaching him to the 
 Gentiles, he did by a divine commission. He here gives them to 
 understand,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What his extraction and education were. 

 1. That he was one of their own nation, <I>of the stock of Israel, of
 the seed of Abraham, a Hebrew of the Hebrews,</I> not of any obscure 
 family, or a renegado of some other nation: "No, <I>I am verily a man 
 who is a Jew,</I> <B><I>aner Ioudaios</I></B>--<I>a Jewish man;</I> I
 am a man, and therefore ought not to be treated as a beast; a man who 
 is a Jew, not a barbarian; I am a sincere friend to your nation, for I 
 am one of it, and should defile my own nest if I should unjustly 
 derogate from the honour of your law and your temple." 

 2. That he was born in a creditable reputable place, <I>in Tarsus, a 
 city of Cilicia,</I> and was by his birth a freeman of that city. He 
 was not born in servitude, as some of the Jews of the dispersion, it is 
 likely, were; but he was a gentleman born, and perhaps could produce 
 his certificate of his freedom in that ancient and honourable city. 
 This was, indeed, but a small matter to make any boast of, and yet it 
 was needful to be mentioned at this time to those who insolently 
 trampled upon him, as if he were to be ranked with the children of 
 fools, yea, the children of base men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:8">Job xxx. 8</A>.

 3. That he had a learned and liberal education. He was not only a Jew, 
 and a gentleman, but a scholar. He <I>was brought up</I> in Jerusalem, 
 the principal seat of the Jewish learning, and <I>at the feet of 
 Gamaliel,</I> whom they all knew to be an eminent doctor of the Jewish 
 law, of which Paul was designed to be himself a teacher; and therefore 
 he could not be ignorant of their law, nor be thought to slight it 
 because he did not know it. His parents had brought him very young to 
 this city, designing him for a Pharisee; and some think his being 
 brought up at the feet of Gamaliel intimates, not only that he was one 
 of his pupils, but that he was, above any other, diligent and constant 
 in attending his lectures, observant of him, and obsequious to him, in 
 all he said, as <I>Mary,</I> that <I>sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his 
 word.</I> 

 4. That he was in his early days a very forward and eminent professor
 of the Jews' religion; his studies and learning were all directed that 
 way. So far was he from being principled in his youth with any 
 disaffection to the religious usages of the Jews that there was not a 
 young man among them who had a greater and more entire veneration for 
 them than he had, was more strict in observing them himself, or more 
 hot in enforcing them upon others.

 (1.) He was an intelligent professor of their religion, and had a clear 
 head. He minded his business at Gamaliel's feet, and was there 
 <I>taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the 
 fathers.</I> What departures he had made from the law were not owing to 
 any confused or mistaken notions of it, for he understood it to a 
 nicety, <B><I>kata akribeian</I></B>--<I>according to the most accurate
 and exact method.</I> He was not trained up in the principles of the 
 latitudinarians, had nothing in him of a Sadducee, but was of that sect 
 that was most studious in the law, kept most close to it, and, to make 
 it more strict than it was, added to it the traditions of the elders, 
 the law of the fathers, the law which was given to them, and which they 
 gave to their children, and so it was handed down to us. Paul had as 
 great a value for antiquity, and tradition, and the authority of the 
 church, as any of them had; and there was never a Jew of them all that 
 understood his religion better than Paul did, or could better give an 
 account of it or a reason for it. 

 (2.) He was an active professor of their religion, and had a warm 
 heart: <I>I was zealous towards God, as you all are this day.</I> Many 
 that are very well skilled in the theory of religion are willing to 
 leave the practice of it to others, but Paul was as much a zealot as a 
 rabbi. He was zealous against every thing that the law prohibited, and 
 for every thing that the law enjoined; and this was zeal towards God, 
 because he thought it was for the honour of God and the service of his 
 interests; and here he compliments his hearers with a candid and 
 charitable opinion of them, <I>that they all were this day zealous 
 towards God; he bears them record</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:2">Rom. x. 2</A>),

 <I>that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</I> 
 In hating him, and casting him out, they said, <I>Let the Lord be 
 glorified</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5">Isa. lxvi. 5</A>),

 and, though this did by no means justify their rage, yet it enabled 
 those that prayed, <I>Father, forgive them,</I> to plead, as Christ 
 did, <I>For they know not what they do.</I> And when Paul owns that he 
 had been zealous for God in the law of Moses, <I>as they were this 
 day,</I> he intimates his hope that they might be zealous for God, in 
 Christ, as he was this day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What a fiery furious persecutor he had been of the Christian 
 religion in the beginning of his time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 He mentions this to make it the more plainly and evidently to appear 
 that the change which was wrought upon him, when he was converted to 
 the Christian faith, was purely the effect of a divine power; for he 
 was so far from having any previous inclinations to it, or favourable 
 opinions of it, that immediately before that sudden change was wrought 
 in him he had the utmost antipathy imaginable to Christianity, and was 
 filled with rage against it to the last degree. And perhaps he mentions 
 it to justify God in his present trouble; how unrighteous soever those 
 were that persecuted him, God was righteous, who permitted them to do 
 it, for time was when he was a persecutor; and he may have a further 
 view in it to invite and encourage those people to repent, for he 
 himself had been <I>a blasphemer, and a persecutor,</I> and yet 
 obtained mercy. Let us view Paul's picture of himself when he was a 
 persecutor. 

 1. He hated Christianity with a mortal enmity: <I>I persecuted this way
 unto the death,</I> that is, "Those that walked in this way I aimed, if 
 possible, to be the death of." <I>He breathed out slaughter against 
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:1"><I>ch.</I> ix. 1</A>.

 When <I>they were put to death, he gave his voice against them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:10"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 10</A>.

 Nay, he persecuted not only those that walked in this way, but the way
 itself, Christianity, which was branded as a byway, a sect; he aimed to 
 persecute this to the death, to be the ruin of this religion. He 
 <I>persecuted it to the death,</I> that is, he could have been willing 
 himself to die in his opposition to Christianity, so some understand 
 it. He would contentedly have lost his life, and would have thought it 
 well laid out, in defence of the laws and traditions of the fathers. 

 2. He did all he could to frighten people from this way, and out of
 it, by <I>binding and delivering into prison both men and women;</I> he 
 filled the jails with Christians. Now that he himself was bound, he 
 lays a particular stress upon this part of his charge against himself, 
 that he had bound the Christians, and carried them to prison; he 
 likewise reflects upon it with a special regret that he had imprisoned 
 not only the men, but the women, the weaker sex, who ought to be 
 treated with particular tenderness and compassion. 

 3. He was employed by the great sanhedrim, the high priest, and all the 
 estate of the elders, as an agent for them, in suppressing this new 
 sect; so much had he already signalized himself for his zeal against 
 it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The high priest can witness for him that he was ready to be employed in 
 any service against the Christians. When they heard that many of the 
 Jews at Damascus had embraced the Christian faith, to deter others from 
 doing the like they resolved to proceed against them with the utmost 
 severity, and could not think of a fitter person to be employed in that 
 business, nor one more likely to go through with it, than Paul. They 
 therefore sent him, and letters by him, to the Jews at Damascus, here 
 called <I>the brethren,</I> because they all descended from one common 
 stock, and were of one family in religion too, ordering them to be 
 assisting to Paul in seizing those among them that had turned 
 Christians, and bringing them up prisoners to Jerusalem, in order to 
 their being punished as deserters from the faith and worship of the God 
 of Israel; and so might either be compelled to retract, or be put to 
 death for a terror to others. Thus did Saul make <I>havoc of the 
 church,</I> and was in a fair way, if he had gone on awhile, to ruin 
 it, and root it out. "Such a one," says Paul, "I was at first, just 
 such as you now are. I know the heart of a persecutor, and therefore 
 pity you, and pray that you may know the heart of a convert, as God 
 soon made me to do. <I>And who was I that I could withstand
 God?</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In what manner he was converted and made what he now was. It was 
 not from any natural or external causes; he did not change his religion 
 from an affectation of novelty, for he was then as well affected to 
 antiquity as he used to be; nor did it arise from discontent because he 
 was disappointed in his preferment, for he was now, more than ever, in 
 the way of preferment in the Jewish church; much less could it arise 
 from covetousness, or ambition, or any hope of mending his fortune in 
 the world by turning Christian, for it was to expose himself to all 
 manner of disgrace and trouble; nor had he any conversation with the 
 apostles or any other Christians, by whose subtlety and sophistry he 
 might be thought to have been wheedled into this change. No, it was the 
 Lord's doing, and the circumstances of the doing of it were enough to 
 justify him in the change, to all those who believe there is a 
 supernatural power; and none can condemn him for it, without reflecting 
 upon that divine energy by which he was he rein overruled. He relates 
 the story of his conversion here very particularly, as we had it before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:1-19"><I>ch.</I> ix.</A>),

 aiming to show that it was purely the act of God.

 1. He was a fully bent upon persecuting the Christians just before
 Christ arrested him as ever. He <I>made his journey, and was come nigh
 to Damascus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and had no other thought than to execute the cruel design he was sent 
 upon; he was not conscious of the least compassionate relentings 
 towards the poor Christians, but still represented them to himself as 
 heretics, schismatics, and dangerous enemies both to church and state. 
 
 2. It was <I>a light from heaven</I> that first startled him, <I>a 
 great light,</I> which <I>shone suddenly round about him,</I> and the 
 Jews knew that God is light, and his angels angels of light, and that 
 such a light as this shining at noon, and therefore exceeding that of 
 the sun, must be from God. Had it shone in upon him into some private 
 room, there might have been a cheat in it, but it shone upon him in the 
 open road, at high noon, and so strongly <I>that it struck him to the 
 ground</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 and all <I>that were with him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:14"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 14</A>.

 They could not deny but that surely the Lord was in this light.

 3. It was a voice <I>from heaven</I> that first begat in him awful
 thoughts of Jesus Christ, of whom before he had had nothing but hateful 
 spiteful thoughts. The voice called to him by name, to distinguish him 
 from <I>those that journeyed with him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou 
 me?</I> And when he asked, <I>Who art thou, Lord?</I> it was answered, 
 <I>I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 By which it appeared that this Jesus of Nazareth, whom they also were 
 now persecuting, was one that spoke from heaven, and they knew it was 
 dangerous resisting one that did so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:25">Heb. xii. 25</A>.

 4. Lest it should be objected, "How came this light and voice to work
 such a change upon him, and not upon those that journeyed with him?" 
 (though, it is very probable, it had a good effect upon them, and that 
 they thereupon became Christians), he observes <I>that his fellow 
 travellers saw indeed the light, and were afraid</I> they should be 
 consumed with fire from heaven, their own consciences, perhaps, now 
 telling them that the way they were in was not good, but like Balaam's 
 when he was going to curse Israel, and therefore they might expect to 
 meet an angel with a flaming glittering sword; but, though the light 
 made them afraid, they heard not the voice of him that spoke to Paul, 
 that is, they did not distinctly hear the words. Now faith comes by 
 hearing, and therefore that change was now presently wrought upon him 
 that heard the words, and heard them directed to himself, which was not 
 wrought upon those who only saw the light; and yet it might afterwards 
 be wrought upon them too. 

 5. He assures them that when he was thus startled he referred himself
 entirely to a divine guidance; he did not hereupon presently cry out, 
 "Well, I will be a Christian," but, "<I>What shall I do, Lord?</I> Let 
 the same voice from heaven that has stopped me in the wrong way guide 
 me into the right way,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Lord, tell me what I shall do, and I will do it." And immediately he 
 had directions to go to Damascus, and there he should hear further from 
 him that now spoke to him: "No more needs to be said from heaven, 
 <I>there it shall be told thee,</I> by a man like thyself, in the name 
 of him that now speaks to thee, <I>all things which are appointed for 
 thee to do.</I>" The extraordinary ways of divine revelation, by 
 visions, and voices, and the appearance of angels, were designed, both 
 in the Old Testament and in the New, only to introduce and establish 
 the ordinary method by the scriptures and a standing ministry, and 
 therefore were generally superseded when these were settled. The angel 
 did not preach to Cornelius himself, but bade him send for Peter; so 
 the voice here tells not Paul what he shall do, but bids him go to 
 Damascus, and there it shall be told him.

 6. As a demonstration of the greatness of that light which fastened 
 upon him, he tells them of the immediate effect it had upon his 
 eye-sight 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>I could not see for the glory of that light.</I> It struck him blind 
 for the present. <I>Nimium sensibile l&aelig;dit sensum--Its radiance
 dazzled him.</I> Condemned sinners are struck blind, as the Sodomites 
 and Egyptians were, by the power of darkness, and it is a lasting 
 blindness, like that of the unbelieving Jews; but convinced sinners are 
 struck blind, as Paul here was, not by darkness, but by light: they are 
 for the present brought to be at a loss within themselves, but it is in 
 order to their being enlightened, as the putting of clay upon the eyes 
 of the blind man was the designed method of his cure. Those that were 
 with Paul had not the light so directly darted into their faces as Paul 
 had unto his, and therefore they were not blinded, as he was; yet, 
 considering the issue, who would not rather have chosen his lot than 
 theirs? They, having their sight, led <I>Paul by the hand into the 
 city.</I> Paul, being a Pharisee, was proud of his spiritual eyesight. 
 The Pharisees said, <I>Are we blind also?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:40">John ix. 40</A>.

 Nay, they were confident <I>that they themselves were guides to the 
 blind,</I> and <I>lights to those that were in darkness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:19">Rom. ii. 19</A>.

 Now Paul was thus struck with bodily blindness to make him sensible of 
 his spiritual blindness, and his mistake concerning himself, when he
 was <I>alive without the law,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:9">Rom. vii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How he was confirmed in the change he had made, and further 
 directed what he should do, by Ananias who lived at Damascus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. The character here given of Ananias. He was not a man that was any 
 way prejudiced against the Jewish nation or religion, but was himself 
 <I>a devout man according to the law;</I> if not a Jew by birth, yet 
 one that had been proselyted to the Jewish religion, and therefore 
 called a devout man, and thence advanced further to the faith of 
 Christ; and he conducted himself so well that he had a <I>good report 
 of all the Jews that dwelt at Damascus.</I> This was the first 
 Christian that Paul had any friendly communication with, and it was not 
 likely that he should instil into him any such notions as they 
 suspected him to espouse, injurious to the law or to this holy 
 place.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The cure immediately wrought by him upon Paul's eyes, which miracle 
 was to confirm Ananias's mission to Paul, and to ratify all that he 
 should afterwards say to him. He <I>came to him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 and, to assure him that he came to him from Christ (the very same who
 had torn and would heal him, had smitten, but would bind him up, had 
 taken away his sight, but would restore it again, with advantage), he 
 <I>stood by him, and said, Brother Saul, receive thy sight.</I> Power 
 went along with this word, and <I>the same hour,</I> immediately, he 
 recovered his sight, and <I>looked up upon him,</I> ready to receive 
 from him the instructions sent by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The declaration which Ananias makes to him of the favour, the
 peculiar favour, which the Lord Jesus designed him above any other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In the present manifestation of himself to him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>The God of our fathers has chosen thee.</I> This powerful call is 
 the result of a particular choice; his calling God the God of our 
 fathers intimates that Ananias was himself a Jew by birth, that 
 observed the law of the fathers, and lived upon the promise made unto 
 the fathers; and he gives a reason why he said <I>Brother Saul,</I> 
 when he speaks of God as the God of our fathers: <I>This God of our 
 fathers has chosen thee that thou shouldst,</I> 

 [1.] <I>Know his will,</I> the will of his precept that is to be done 
 by thee, the will of his providence that is to be done concerning thee. 
 He hath chosen thee that thou shouldst know it in a more peculiar 
 manner; not of man nor by man, but immediately by <I>the revelation of 
 Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:1,2">Gal. i. 1, 12</A>.

 Those whom God hath chosen he hath chosen to know his will, and to do 
 it.

 [2.] <I>That thou shouldst see that Just One, and shouldst hear the
 voice of his mouth,</I> and so shouldst know his will immediately from 
 himself. This was what Paul was, in a particular manner, chosen to 
 above others; it was a distinguishing favour, that he should see Christ 
 here upon earth after his ascension into heaven. Stephen saw him
 <I>standing at the right hand of God,</I> but Paul saw him standing at 
 his right hand. This honour none had but Paul. Stephen saw him, but we
 do not find that he heard the voice of his mouth, as Paul did, who 
 says, <I>he was last of all seen of me, as of one born out of due 
 time,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:8">1 Cor. xv. 8</A>.

 Christ is here called <I>that Just One;</I> for he is Jesus Christ the 
 righteous, and suffered wrongfully. Observe, Those whom God has chosen 
 to know his will must have an eye to Christ, and must see him, and hear 
 the voice of his mouth; for it is by him that God has made known his 
 will, his good-will to us, and he has said, <I>Hear you him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In the after-manifestation of himself by him to others 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou shalt be his witness,</I> not only a monument of his grace, as 
 a pillar may be, but a witness <I>viva voce--by word of mouth;</I> thou
 shalt publish his gospel, as that which thou hast experienced the power 
 of, and been delivered into, the mould of; <I>thou shalt be his witness 
 unto all men,</I> Gentiles as well as Jews, <I>of what thou hast seen
 and heard,</I> now at the very first." And finding Paul so particularly
 relating the manner of his conversation in his apologies for himself,
 here and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:1-32">
 <I>ch.</I> xxvi.</A>,

 we have reason to think that he frequently related the same narrative
 in his preaching for the conversion of others; he told them what God 
 had done for his soul, to encourage them to hope that he would do 
 something for their souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The counsel and encouragement he gave him to join himself to the 
 Lord Jesus by baptism 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Arise, and be baptized,</I> He had in his circumcision been given up 
 to God, but he must now by baptism be given up to God in Christ--must
 embrace the Christian religion and the privileges of it, in submission 
 to the precepts of it. This must now be done immediately upon his 
 conversion, and so was added to his circumcision: but to the seed of 
 the faithful it comes in the room of it; for it is, as that was to 
 Abraham and his believing seed, <I>a seal of the righteousness which is 
 by faith.</I> 

 (1.) The great gospel privilege which by baptism we have sealed to us 
 is the remission of sins: <I>Be baptized and wash away thy sins;</I> 
 that is, "Receive the comfort of the pardon of thy sins in the through 
 Jesus Christ and lay hold of his righteousness for that purpose, and 
 receive power against sin for the mortifying of thy corruption;" for 
 our being washed includes our being both justified and sanctified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11">1 Cor. vi. 11</A>.

 Be baptized, and rest not in the sign, but make sure of the thing
 signified, the putting away of the filth of sin. 

 (2.) The great gospel duty which by our baptism we are bound to is 
 <I>to call on the name of the Lord, the Lord Jesus;</I> to acknowledge 
 him to be our Lord and our God, and to apply to him accordingly; to 
 give honour to him, to put all our petitions in his hand. To <I>call on 
 the name of Jesus Christ our Lord</I> (Son of David, have mercy on us) 
 is the periphrasis of a Christian,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:2">1 Cor. i. 2</A>.

 We must <I>wash away our sins, calling on the name of the Lord;</I>
 that is, we must seek for the pardon of our sins in Christ's name, and 
 in dependence on him and his righteousness. In prayer, we must not any 
 longer call God the God of Abraham, but the Father of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ, and in him our Father; in every prayer, our eye must be to 
 Christ. 

 (3.) We must do this quickly. <I>Why tarriest thou?</I> Our covenanting 
 with God in Christ is needful work, that must not be deferred. The case 
 is so plain that it is needless to deliberate; and the hazard so great 
 that it is folly to delay. Why should not that be done at the present 
 time that must be done some time, or we are undone?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. How he was commissioned to go and preach the gospel to the Gentiles. 
 This was the great thing for which they were so angry at him, and 
 therefore it was requisite he should for this, in a special manner, 
 produce a divine warrant; and here he does it. This commission he did
 not receive presently upon his conversion, for this was <I>at 
 Jerusalem,</I> whither he did not go till <I>three years after,</I> or 
 more 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:18">Gal. i. 18</A>);

 and whether it was then, or afterwards, that he had this vision here 
 spoken of, we are not certain. But, to reconcile them, if possible, to 
 his preaching the gospel among the Gentiles, he tells them, 

 1. That he received his orders to do it when he was at prayer, begging
 of God to appoint him his work and to show him the course he should 
 steer; and (which was a circumstance that would have some weight with 
 those he was now speaking to) he was <I>at prayer in the temple,</I> 
 which was to be called <I>a house of prayer for all people;</I> not 
 only in which all people should pray, but in which all people should be 
 prayed for. Now as Paul's praying in the temple was an evidence, 
 contrary to their malicious suggestion, that he had a veneration for 
 the temple, though he did not make an idol of it as they did; so God's 
 giving him this commission there in the temple was an evidence that the 
 sending him to the Gentiles would be no prejudice to the temple, unless 
 the Jews by their infidelity made it so. Now it would be a great 
 satisfaction to Paul afterwards, in the execution of this commission, 
 to reflect upon it that he received it when he was at prayer.

 2. He received it in a vision. He fell <I>into a trance</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 his external senses, for the present, locked up; he was in an ecstasy,
 as when he was <I>caught up into the third heaven,</I> and was not at 
 that time sensible whether he was <I>in the body or out of the 
 body.</I> In this trance he saw Jesus Christ, not with the eyes of his 
 body, as at his conversion, but represented to the eye of his mind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>I saw him saying unto me.</I> Our eye must be upon Christ when we 
 are receiving the law from his mouth; and we must not only hear him 
 speak, but see him speaking to us. 

 3. Before Christ gave him a commission to go to the Gentiles, he told 
 him it was to no purpose for him to think of doing any good at 
 Jerusalem; so that they must not blame him, but themselves, if he be 
 sent to the Gentiles. Paul came to Jerusalem full of hopes that, by the 
 grace of God, he might be instrumental to bring those to the faith of 
 Christ who had stood it out against the ministry of the other apostles; 
 and perhaps this was what he was now praying for, that he, having had 
 his education at Jerusalem and being well known there, might be 
 employed in gathering the children of Jerusalem to Christ that were not 
 yet gathered, which he thought he had particular advantages for doing 
 of. But Christ crosses the measures he had laid: "<I>Make haste,</I>" 
 says he, "<I>and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem;</I>" for, though 
 thou thinkest thyself more likely to work upon them than others, thou 
 wilt find they are more prejudiced against thee than against any other, 
 and therefore "<I>will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</I>" As 
 God knows before who will receive the gospel, so he knows who will 
 reject it. 

 4. Paul, notwithstanding this, renewed his petition that he might be
 employed at Jerusalem, because they knew, better than any did, what he 
 had been before his conversion, and therefore must ascribe so great a 
 change in him to the power of almighty grace, and consequently give the 
 greater regard to his testimony; thus he reasoned, both with himself 
 and with the Lord, and thought he reasoned justly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):

 "<I>Lord,</I>" says he, "<I>they know</I> that I was once of their 
 mind, that I was as bitter an enemy as any of them to such as believed 
 on thee, that I irritated the civil power against them, and 
 <I>imprisoned them,</I> and turned the edge of the spiritual power 
 against them too, and <I>beat them in every synagogue.</I>" And 
 therefore they will not impute my preaching Christ to education nor to 
 any prepossession in his favour (as they do that of other ministers), 
 but will the more readily regard what I say because they know I have 
 myself been one of them: particularly in Stephen's case; they know that 
 when he was stoned I was standing by, I was aiding and abetting and 
 <I>consenting to his death,</I> and in token of this <I>kept the 
 clothes of those that stoned him.</I> Now "Lord," says he, "if I appear 
 among them, preaching the doctrine that Stephen preached and suffered 
 for, they will no doubt receive my testimony." "No," says Christ to 
 him, "they will not; but will be more exasperated against thee as a 
 deserter from, than against others whom they look upon only as 
 strangers to, their constitution." 

 5. Paul's petition for a warrant to preach the gospel at Jerusalem is
 overruled, and he has peremptory orders to go among the Gentiles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Depart, for I will send thee far hence, unto the Gentiles.</I> Note,
 God often gives gracious answers to the prayers of his people, not in 
 the thing itself that they pray for, but in something better. Abraham 
 prays, <I>O that Ishmael may live before thee;</I> and God hears him 
 for Isaac. So Paul here prays that he may be an instrument of 
 converting souls at Jerusalem: "No," says Christ, "but thou shalt be 
 employed among the Gentiles, and <I>more shall be the children of the 
 desolate than those of the married wife.</I>" It is God that appoints 
 his labourers both their day and their place, and it is fit they should 
 acquiesce in his appointment, though it may cross their own 
 inclinations. Paul hankers after Jerusalem: to be a preacher there was 
 the summit of his ambition; but Christ designs him greater preferment.
 He shall not enter into other men's labours (as the other apostles did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:38">John iv. 38</A>),

 but shall break up new ground, and <I>preach the gospel where Christ
 was not named,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:20">Rom. xv. 20</A>.

 So often does Providence contrive better for us than we for ourselves;
 to the guidance of that we must therefore refer ourselves. <I>He shall 
 choose our inheritance for us.</I> Observe, Paul shall not go to preach 
 among the Gentiles without a commission: <I>I will send thee.</I> And, 
 if Christ send him, his Spirit will go along with him, he will stand by 
 him, will carry him on, and bear him out, and give him to see the fruit 
 of his labours. Let not Paul set his heart upon Jerusalem, for he must 
 be sent far hence; his call must be quite another way, and his work of 
 another kind. And it might be a mitigation of the offence of this to 
 the Jews that he did not set up a Gentile church in the neighbouring 
 nations; others did this in their immediate vicinity; he was sent to 
 places at a distance, a vast way off, where what he did could not be 
 thought an annoyance to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, if they would lay all this together, surely they would see that 
 they had no reason to be angry with Paul for preaching among the 
 Gentiles, or construe it as an act of ill-will to his own nation, for 
 he was compelled to it, contrary to his own mind, by an overruling 
 command from heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 And they gave him audience unto this word, and <I>then</I> lifted
 up their voices, and said, Away with such a <I>fellow</I> from the
 earth: for it is not fit that he should live.
 &nbsp; 23 And as they cried out, and cast off <I>their</I> clothes, and
 threw dust into the air,
 &nbsp; 24 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the
 castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he
 might know wherefore they cried so against him.
 &nbsp; 25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the
 centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man
 that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
 &nbsp; 26 When the centurion heard <I>that,</I> he went and told the chief
 captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a
 Roman.
 &nbsp; 27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
 thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
 &nbsp; 28 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I
 this freedom. And Paul said, But I was <I>free</I> born.
 &nbsp; 29 Then straightway they departed from him which should have
 examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he
 knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
 &nbsp; 30 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty
 wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from <I>his</I>
 bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to
 appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul was going on with this account of himself, had shown them his 
 commission to preach among the Gentiles without any peevish reflections 
 upon the Jews, and we may suppose designed next to show how he was 
 afterwards, by a special direction of the Holy Ghost at Antioch, 
 separated to this service, how tender he was of the Jews, how 
 respectful to them, and how careful to give them the precedency in all 
 places whither he came, and to unite Jews and Gentiles in one body; and 
 then to show how wonderfully God had owned him, and what good service 
 had been done to the interest of God's kingdom among men in general, 
 without damage to any of the true interests of the Jewish church in 
 particular. But, whatever he designs to say, they resolve he shall say 
 no more to them: <I>They gave him audience to this word.</I> Hitherto 
 they had heard him with patience and some attention. But when he speaks 
 of being sent to the Gentiles, though it was what Christ himself said 
 to him, they cannot bear it, not so much as to hear the Gentiles named, 
 such an enmity had they to them, and such a jealousy of them. Upon the 
 mention of this, they have no manner of patience, but forget all rules 
 of decency and equity; thus were they <I>provoked to jealousy by those 
 that were no people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:19">Rom. x. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now here we are told how furious and outrageous the people were against 
 Paul, for mentioning the Gentiles as taken into the cognizance of 
 divine grace, and so justifying his preaching among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They interrupted him, by lifting up their voice, to put him into 
 confusion, and that nobody might hear a word he said. Galled 
 consciences kick at the least touch; and those who are resolved not to 
 be rules by reason commonly resolve not to hear it if they can help it. 
 And the spirit of enmity against the gospel of Christ commonly shows 
 itself in silencing the ministers of Christ and his gospel, and 
 stopping their mouths, as the Jews did Paul's here. Their fathers had 
 said to the best of seers, <I>See not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:10">Isa. xxx. 10</A>.

 And so they to the best of speakers, <I>Speak not. Forbear, wherefore
 shouldst thou be smitten?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:16">2 Chron. xxv. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They clamoured against him as one that was unworthy of life, much 
 more of liberty. Without weighing the arguments he had urged in his own 
 defence, or offering to make any answer to them, they cried out with a 
 confused noise, "<I>Away with such a fellow</I> as this <I>from the 
 earth,</I> who pretends to have a commission to preach to the Gentiles; 
 why, <I>it is not fit that he should live.</I>" Thus the men that have 
 been the greatest blessings of their age have been represented not only 
 as the burdens of the earth, but the plague of their generation. He 
 that was worthy of the greatest honours of life is condemned as not 
 worthy of life itself. See what different sentiments God and men have 
 of good men, and yet they both agree in this that they are not likely 
 to live long in this world. Paul says of the godly Jews that they were 
 men of <I>whom the world was not worthy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:38">Heb. xi. 38</A>.

 And therefore they must be removed, that the world may be justly
 punished with the loss of them. The ungodly Jews here say of Paul that 
 it was not fit he should live; and therefore he must be removed, that 
 the world may be eased of the burden of him, as of the two witnesses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They went stark mad against Paul, and against the chief captain 
 for not killing him immediately at their request, or throwing him as a 
 pry into their teeth, that they might devour him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 as men whose reason was quite lost in passion, they cried out like 
 roaring lions or raging bears, and howled like the evening wolves; they 
 <I>cast off their clothes</I> with fury and violence, as much as to say 
 that thus they would tear him if they could but come at him. Or, 
 rather, they thus showed how ready they were to stone him; those that 
 stoned Stephen threw off their clothes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Or, they <I>rent their clothes,</I> as if he had spoken blasphemy; and 
 <I>threw dust into the air,</I> in detestation of it; or signifying how 
 ready they were to throw stones at Paul, if the chief captain would 
 have permitted them. But why should we go about to give a reason for
 these experiences of fury, which they themselves could not account for? 
 All they intended was to make the chief captain sensible how much they 
 were enraged and exasperated at Paul, so that he could not do any thing 
 to gratify them more than to let them have their will against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The chief captain took care for his safety, by ordering him to be 
 brought into the castle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 A prison sometimes has been a protection to good men from popular rage. 
 Paul's hour was not yet come, he had not finished his testimony, and 
 therefore God raised up one that took care of him, when none of his 
 friends durst appear on his behalf. <I>Grant not, O Lord, the desire
 of the wicked.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He ordered him the torture, to force from him a confession of some 
 flagrant crimes which had provoked the people to such an uncommon 
 violence against him. <I>He ordered that he should be examined by 
 scourging</I> (as now in some countries by the rack), that <I>he might 
 know wherefore they cried so against him.</I> Herein he did not proceed 
 fairly; he should have singled out some of the clamorous tumultuous 
 complainants, and taken them into the castle as breakers of the peace, 
 and should have examined them, and by scourging too, what they had to 
 lay to the charge of a man that could give so good an account of 
 himself, and did not appear to have done any thing worthy of death or 
 of bonds. It was proper to ask them, but not at all proper to ask Paul, 
 <I>wherefore they cried so against him.</I> He could tell that he had 
 given them no just cause to do it; if there were any cause, let them 
 produce it. No man is bound to accuse himself, though he be guilty, 
 much less ought he to be compelled to accuse himself when he is 
 innocent. Surely the chief captain did not know the Jewish nation when 
 he concluded that he must needs have done something very bad whom they 
 cried out against. Had they not just thus cried out against our Lord 
 Jesus, <I>Crucify him, crucify him,</I> when they had not one word to 
 say in answer to the judge's question, <I>Why, what evil has he 
 done?</I> Is this a fair or just occasion to scourge Paul, that a rude 
 tumultuous mob cry out against him, but cannot tell why or wherefore, 
 and therefore he must be forced to tell?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Paul pleaded his privilege as a Roman citizen, by which he was 
 exempted from all trials and punishments of this nature 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>As they bound him with thongs,</I> or leathern bands, to the 
 whipping post, as they used to bind the vilest of malefactors in 
 bridewell from whom they would extort a confession, he made no outcry 
 against the injustice of their proceedings against an innocent man, but 
 very mildly let them understand the illegality of their proceedings 
 against him as a citizen of Rome, which he had done once before at 
 Philippi after he had been scourged

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:37"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 37</A>),

 but here he makes use of it for prevention. He <I>said to the centurion
 that stood by,</I> "You know the law; pray <I>is it lawful for you</I> 
 who are yourselves Romans to <I>scourge a man that is a Roman, and 
 uncondemned?</I>" The manner of his speaking plainly intimates what a 
 holy security and serenity of mind this good man enjoyed, not disturbed 
 either with anger or fear in the midst of all those indignities that 
 were done him, and the danger he was in. The Romans had a law (it was 
 called <I>lex Sempronia</I>), that if any magistrate did chastise or 
 condemn a freeman of Rome, <I>indicta causa--without hearing him speak
 for himself, and deliberating upon the whole of his case,</I> he should 
 be liable to the sentence of the people, who were very jealous of their 
 liberties. It is indeed the privilege of every man not to have wrong 
 done him, except it be proved he has done wrong; as it is of every 
 Englishman by <I>Magna Charta</I> not to be dis-seized of his life or 
 freehold, but by a verdict of twelve men of his peers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The chief captain was surprised at this, and put into a fright. He 
 had taken Paul to be a vagabond Egyptian, and wondered he could speak 
 Greek 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:37"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 37</A>),

 but is much more surprised now he finds that he is as good a gentleman
 as himself. How many men of great worth and merit are despised because 
 they are not known, are looked upon and treated as the offscouring of 
 all things, when those that count them so, if they knew their true 
 character, would own them to be of the excellent ones of the earth! The 
 chief captain had centurions, under-officers, attending him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:32"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 32</A>.

 One of these reports this matter to the chief captain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>Take heed what thou doest, for this man is a Roman,</I> and what 
 indignity is done to him will be construed an offence against the 
 majesty of the Roman people, as they loved to speak. They all knew what 
 a value was put upon this privilege of the Roman citizens. Tully extols 
 it in one of his orations against Verres, <I>O nomen dulce libertatis, 
 O jus eximium nostr&aelig; civitatis! O lex Porcia! O leges 
 Semproni&aelig;; facinus est vincere Romanum civem, scelus verberare--O
 Liberty! I love thy charming name; and these our Porcian and Sempronian 
 laws, how admirable! It is a crime to bind a Roman citizen, but an 
 unpardonable one to beat him.</I> "Therefore" (says the centurion) "let 
 us look to ourselves; if this man be a Roman, and we do him any 
 indignity, we shall be in danger to lose our commissions at least." 
 Now, 

 1. The chief captain would be satisfied of the truth of this from his
 own mouth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>Tell me, art thou a Roman?</I> Art thou entitled to the privileges
 of a Roman citizen?" "Yes," says Paul, "<I>I am;</I>" and perhaps 
 produced some ticket or instrument which proved it; for otherwise they 
 would scarcely have taken his word. 

 2. The chief captain very freely compares notes with him upon this
 matter, and it appears that the privilege Paul had as a Roman citizen 
 was of the two more honourable than the colonel's; for the colonel owns 
 that his was purchased: "I am a freeman of Rome; but <I>with a great 
 sum obtained I this freedom,</I> it cost me dear, how came you by it?" 
 "Why truly," says Paul, "<I>I was free-born.</I>" Some think he became 
 entitled to this freedom by the place of his birth, as a native of 
 Tarsus, a city privileged by the emperor with the same privileges that 
 Rome itself enjoyed; others rather think it was by his father or 
 grandfather having served in the war between C&aelig;sar and Antony, or 
 some other of the civil wars of Rome, and being for some signal piece 
 of service rewarded with a freedom of the city, and so Paul came to be 
 free-born; and here he pleads it for his own preservation, for which 
 end not only we may but we ought to use all lawful means. 

 3. This put an immediate stop to Paul's trouble. Those that were 
 appointed to examine him by scourging quitted the spot; they 
 <I>departed from him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 lest they should run themselves into a snare. Nay, and the colonel 
 himself, though we may suppose him to have a considerable interest, was 
 afraid when he heard he was a Roman, because, though he had not beaten 
 him, yet he had bound him in order to his being beaten. Thus many are
 restrained from evil practices by the fear of man who would not be 
 restrained from them by the fear of God. See here the benefit of human
 laws and magistracy, and what reason we have to be thankful to God for 
 them; for even when they have given no countenance nor special 
 protection to God's people and ministers, yet, by the general support 
 of equity and fair dealing between man and man, they have served to 
 check the rage of wicked and unreasonable illegal men, who otherwise 
 would know no bounds, and to say, <I>Hitherto it shall come, but no 
 further; here shall its proud waves by stayed.</I> And therefore this 
 service we owe to all in authority, to pray for them, because this 
 benefit we have reason to expect from them, whether we have it or no, 
 as long as we are quiet and peaceable--to live <I>quiet and peaceable
 lives in all godliness and honesty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:1,2">1 Tim. ii. 1, 2</A>.

 4. The governor, the next day, brought Paul before the sanhedrim,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He first <I>loosed him from his bands,</I> that those might not
 prejudge his cause, and that he might not be charged with having 
 pinioned a Roman citizen, and then summoned the chief priests and all 
 their council to come together to take cognizance of Paul's case, for 
 he found it to be a matter of religion, and therefore looked upon them 
 to be the most proper judges of it. Gallio in this case discharged 
 Paul; finding it to be a matter of their law, he drove the prosecutors 
 from the judgement-seat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:16"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 16</A>),

 and would not concern himself at all in it; but this Roman, who was a
 military man, kept Paul in custody, and appealed from the rabble to the 
 general assembly. Now,

 (1.) We may hope that hereby he intended Paul's safety, as thinking, if
 he were an innocent and inoffensive man, though the multitude might be 
 incensed against him, yet the chief priests and elders would do him 
 justice, and clear him; for they were, or should be, men of learning 
 and consideration, and their court governed by rules of equity. When 
 the prophet could find no good among the poorer sort of people, he 
 concluded that it was because they <I>knew not the way of the Lord, nor 
 the judgments of their God,</I> and promised himself that he should 
 speed better among the great men, as the chief captain here did, but 
 soon found himself disappointed there: these have <I>altogether broken 
 the yoke, and burst the bonds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:4,5">Jer. v. 4, 5</A>.
 
 But,

 (2.) That which he is here said to aim at is the gratifying of his own
 curiosity: He <I>would have known the certainty wherefore he was 
 accused of the Jews.</I> Had he sent for Paul to his own chamber, and 
 talked freely with him, he might soon have learned from him that which 
 would have done more than satisfy his enquiry, and which might have 
 persuaded him to be a Christian. But it is too common for great men to 
 affect to set that at a distance from them which might awaken their 
 consciences, and to desire to have no more of the knowledge of God's 
 ways than may serve them to talk of.</P>
