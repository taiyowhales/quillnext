 The apostle, having made good his point, and fully proved justification 
 by faith, in this chapter proceeds in the explication, illustration,
 and application of that truth. 

 I. He shows the fruits of justification, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. He shows the fountain and foundation of justification in the death
 of Jesus Christ, which he discourses of at large in the

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
 through our Lord Jesus Christ:
 &nbsp; 2  By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein
 we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
 &nbsp; 3  And not only <I>so,</I> but we glory in tribulations also: knowing
 that tribulation worketh patience;
 &nbsp; 4  And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
 &nbsp; 5  And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed
 abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The precious benefits and privileges which flow from justification are 
 such as should quicken us all to give diligence to make it sure to 
 ourselves that we are justified, and then to take the comfort it 
 renders to us, and to do the duty it calls for from us. The fruits of 
 this tree of life are exceedingly precious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>We have peace with God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It is sin that breeds the quarrel between us and God, creates not only 
 a strangeness, but an enmity; the holy righteous God cannot in honour 
 be at peace with a sinner while he continues under the guilt of sin. 
 Justification takes away the guilt, and so makes way for peace. And 
 such are the benignity and good-will of God to man that, immediately 
 upon the removing of that obstacle, the peace is made. By faith we lay 
 hold of God's arm and of his strength, and so are at peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4,5">Isa. xxvii. 4, 5</A>.

 There is more in this peace than barely a cessation of enmity, there is
 friendship and loving-kindness, for God is either the worst enemy or 
 the best friend. Abraham, being justified by faith, was called <I>the
 friend of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:23">Jam. ii. 23</A>),

 which was his honour, but not his peculiar honour: Christ has called 
 his disciples <I>friends,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:13-15">John xv. 13-15</A>.

 And surely a man needs no more to make him happy than to have God his 
 friend! But this is <I>through our Lord Jesus Christ</I>--through him as
 the great peace-maker, <I>the Mediator between God and man,</I> that 
 blessed Day's-man that has laid his hand upon us both. Adam, in 
 innocency, had peace with God immediately; there needed no such 
 mediator. But to guilty sinful man it is a very dreadful thing to think 
 of God out of Christ; <I>for he is our peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14">Eph. ii. 14</A>,

 not only the maker, but the matter and maintainer, of our peace,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:20">Col. i. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>We have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This is a further privilege, not only peace, but grace, that is, this
 favour. Observe, 

 1. The saints' happy state. It is a state of grace, God's 
 loving-kindness to us and our conformity to God; he that hath God's 
 love and God's likeness is in a state of grace. Now into this grace we 
 have access <B><I>prosagogen</I></B>--<I>an introduction,</I> which 
 implies that we were not born in this state; we are <I>by nature 
 children of wrath,</I> and <I>the carnal mind is enmity against 
 God;</I> but we are brought into it. We could not have got into it of 
 ourselves, nor have conquered the difficulties in the way, but we have 
 a manuduction, a leading by the hand,--are led into it as blind, or 
 lame, or weak people are led,--are introduced as pardoned 
 offenders,--are introduced by some favourite at court to kiss the 
 king's hand, as strangers, that are to have audience, are conducted.
 <B><I>Prosagogen eschekamen</I></B>--<I>We have had access.</I> He 
 speaks of those that have been already brought out of a state of nature 
 into a state of grace. Paul, in his conversion, had this access; then 
 he was made nigh. Barnabas introduced him <I>to the apostles</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:27">Acts ix. 27</A>),

 and there were others <I>that led him by the hand to Damascus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 but it was Christ that introduced and led him by the hand into this 
 grace. <I>By whom we have access by faith.</I> By Christ as the author 
 and principal agent, by faith as the means of this access. Not by 
 Christ in consideration of any merit or desert of ours, but in 
 consideration of our believing dependence upon him and resignation of 
 ourselves to him. 

 2. Their happy standing in this state: <I>wherein we stand.</I> Not
 only wherein we are, but wherein we stand, a posture that denotes our 
 discharge from guilt; <I>we stand in the judgment</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:5">Ps. i. 5</A>),

 not cast, as convicted criminals, but our dignity and honour secured,
 not thrown to the ground, as abjects. The phrase denotes also our 
 progress; while we stand, we are going. We must not lie down, as if we 
 had already attained, but stand as those that are pressing forward, 
 stand as servants attending on Christ our master. The phrase denotes,
 further, our perseverance: we stand firmly and safely, upheld by the 
 power of God; stand as soldiers stand, that keep their ground, not 
 borne down by the power of the enemy. It denotes not only our admission 
 to, but our confirmation in, the favour of God. It is not in the court 
 of heaven as in earthly courts, where high places are slippery places: 
 but we stand in a humble confidence of this very thing <I>that he who 
 has begun the good work will perform it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:6">Phil. i. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. <I>We rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</I> Besides the 
 happiness in hand, there is a happiness in hope, <I>the glory of 
 God,</I> the glory which God will put upon the saints in heaven, glory 
 which will consist in the vision and fruition of God. 

 1. Those, and those only, that have access by faith into the grace of
 God now may hope for the glory of God hereafter. There is no good hope 
 of glory but what is founded in grace; grace is glory begun, the 
 earnest and assurance of glory. <I>He will give grace and glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:11">Ps. lxxxiv. 11</A>.

 2. Those who hope for the glory of God hereafter have enough to
 rejoice in now. It is the duty of those that hope for heaven to rejoice 
 in that hope.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. <I>We glory in tribulations also;</I> not only notwithstanding our 
 tribulations (these do not hinder our rejoicing in hope of the glory of 
 God), but even in our tribulations, as they are working for us the 
 weight of glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:17">2 Cor. iv. 17</A>.

 Observe, What a growing increasing happiness the happiness of the
 saints is: <I>Not only so.</I> One would think such peace, such grace, 
 such glory, and such a joy in hope of it, were more than such poor 
 undeserving creatures as we are could pretend to; and yet it is <I>not 
 only so:</I> there are more instances of our happiness--<I>we glory in 
 tribulations also,</I> especially tribulations for righteousness' sake, 
 which seemed the greatest objection against the saints' happiness, 
 whereas really their happiness did not only consist with, but take rise 
 from, those tribulations. <I>They rejoiced that they were counted 
 worthy to suffer,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:41">Acts v. 41</A>.

 This being the hardest point, he sets himself to show the grounds and
 reasons of it. How come we to glory in tribulations? Why, because
 tribulations, by a chain of causes, greatly befriend hope, which he 
 shows in the method of its influence.

 1. <I>Tribulation worketh patience,</I> not in and of itself, but the
 powerful grace of God working in and with the tribulation. It proves, 
 and by proving improves, patience, as parts and gifts increase by 
 exercise. It is not the efficient cause, but yields the occasion, as 
 steel is hardened by the fire. See how God brings meat out of the 
 eater, and sweetness out of the strong. That which worketh patience is 
 matter of joy; for patience does us more good than tribulations can do 
 us hurt. Tribulation in itself worketh impatience; but, as it is 
 sanctified to the saints, it worketh patience. 

 2. <I>Patience experience,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 It works an experience of God, and the songs he gives in the night; the 
 patient sufferers have the greatest experience of the divine 
 consolations, which abound as afflictions abound. It works an 
 experience of ourselves. It is by tribulation that we make an 
 experiment of our own sincerity, and therefore such tribulations are 
 called trials. It works, <B><I>dokimen</I></B>--<I>an approbation,</I> 
 as he is approved that has passed the test. Thus Job's tribulation 
 wrought patience, and that patience produced an approbation, that still 
 he <I>holds fast his integrity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:3">Job ii. 3</A>.

 3. <I>Experience hope.</I> He who, being thus tried, comes forth as
 gold, will thereby be encouraged to hope. This experiment, or 
 approbation, is not so much the ground, as the evidence, of our hope, 
 and a special friend to it. Experience of God is a prop to our hope;
 he that hath delivered doth and will. Experience of ourselves helps to 
 evidence our sincerity. 

 4. This <I>hope maketh not ashamed;</I> that is, it is a hope that
 will not deceive us. Nothing confounds more than disappointment. 
 Everlasting shame and confusion will be caused by the perishing of the 
 expectation of the wicked, <I>but the hope of the righteous shall be 
 gladness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:28">Prov. x. 28</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:5,71:1">Ps. xxii. 5; lxxi. 1</A>.

 Or, It maketh not ashamed of our sufferings. Though <I>we are counted
 as the offscouring of all things, and trodden under foot as the mire in 
 the streets,</I> yet, having hopes of glory, we are not ashamed of 
 these sufferings. It is in a good cause, for a good Master, and in good 
 hope; and therefore we are not ashamed. We will never think ourselves 
 disparaged by sufferings that are likely to end so well. <I>Because the 
 love of God is shed abroad.</I> This hope will not disappoint us, 
 because it is sealed with the Holy Spirit as a Spirit of love. It is 
 the gracious work of the blessed Spirit to shed abroad the love of God 
 in the hearts of all the saints. <I>The love of God,</I> that is, the 
 sense of God's love to us, drawing out love in us to him again. Or, The 
 great effects of his love:

 (1.) Special grace; and, 

 (2.) The pleasant gust or sense of it. <I>It is shed abroad,</I> as 
 sweet ointment, perfuming the soul, as rain watering it and making it 
 fruitful. The ground of all our comfort and holiness, and perseverance 
 in both, is laid in the <I>shedding abroad of the love of God in our 
 hearts;</I> it is this which constrains us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:14">2 Cor. v. 14</A>.

 Thus are we drawn and held by the bonds of love. Sense of God's love to
 us will make us not ashamed, either of our hope in him or our 
 sufferings for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ
 died for the ungodly.
 &nbsp; 7  For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet
 peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
 &nbsp; 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were
 yet sinners, Christ died for us.
 &nbsp; 9  Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be
 saved from wrath through him.
 &nbsp; 10  For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by
 the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be
 saved by his life.
 &nbsp; 11  And not only <I>so,</I> but we also joy in God through our Lord
 Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.
 &nbsp; 12  Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and
 death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
 sinned:
 &nbsp; 13  (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not
 imputed when there is no law.
 &nbsp; 14  Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over
 them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
 transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.
 &nbsp; 15  But not as the offence, so also <I>is</I> the free gift. For if
 through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of
 God, and the gift by grace, <I>which is</I> by one man, Jesus Christ,
 hath abounded unto many.
 &nbsp; 16  And not as <I>it was</I> by one that sinned, <I>so is</I> the gift:
 for the judgment <I>was</I> by one to condemnation, but the free gift
 <I>is</I> of many offences unto justification.
 &nbsp; 17  For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more
 they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of
 righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)
 &nbsp; 18  Therefore as by the offence of one <I>judgment came</I> upon all
 men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one <I>the
 free gift came</I> upon all men unto justification of life.
 &nbsp; 19  For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so
 by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
 &nbsp; 20  Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But
 where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
 &nbsp; 21  That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace
 reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our
 Lord.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle here describes the fountain and foundation of 
 justification, laid in the death of the Lord Jesus. The streams are 
 very sweet, but, if you run them up to the spring-head, you will find 
 it to be Christ's dying for us; it is in the precious stream of 
 Christ's blood that all these privileges come flowing to us: and 
 therefore he enlarges upon this instance of the love of God which is 
 shed abroad. Three things he takes notice of for the explication and 
 illustration of this doctrine:--
 
 1. The persons he died for,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.

 2. The precious fruits of his death,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 3. The parallel he runs between the communication of sin and death by
 the first Adam and of righteousness and life by the second Adam, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:12-21"><I>v.</I> 12, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The character we were under when Christ died for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>We were without strength</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 in a sad condition; and, which is worse, altogether unable to help 
 ourselves out of that condition--lost, and no visible way open for our 
 recovery--our condition deplorable, and in a manner desperate; and, 
 therefore our salvation is here said to come <I>in due time.</I> God's 
 time to help and save is when those that are to be saved are without 
 strength, that his own power and grace may be the more magnified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36">Deut. xxxii. 36</A>.

 It is the manner of God to help at a dead lift,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>He died for the ungodly;</I> not only helpless creatures, and 
 therefore likely to perish, but guilty sinful creatures, and therefore 
 deserving to perish; not only mean and worthless, but vile and 
 obnoxious, unworthy of such favour with the holy God. Being ungodly, 
 they had need of one to die for them, to satisfy for guilt, and to 
 bring in a righteousness. This he illustrates 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>)

 as an unparalleled instance of love; herein God's thoughts and ways 
 were above ours. Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:13,14">John xv. 13, 14</A>,
 
 <I>Greater love has no man.</I>
 
 (1.) One would hardly <I>die for a righteous man,</I> that is, an
 innocent man, one that is unjustly condemned; every body will pity such 
 a one, but few will put such a value upon his life as either to hazard, 
 or much less to deposit, their own in his stead. 

 (2.) It may be, one might perhaps be persuaded <I>to die for a good 
 man,</I> that is, a useful man, who is more than barely a righteous 
 man. Many that are good themselves yet do but little good to others; 
 but those that are useful commonly get themselves well beloved, and 
 meet with some that in a case of necessity would venture to be their 
 <B><I>antipsychoi</I></B>--<I>would engage life for life,</I> would be 
 their bail, body for body. Paul was, in this sense, a very good man, 
 one that was very useful, and he met with some that for his life laid 
 down their own necks,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:4"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 4</A>.

 And yet observe how he qualifies this: it is but some that would do so,
 and it is a daring act if they do it, it must be some bold venturing 
 soul; and, after all, it is but a <I>peradventure.</I> 

 (3.) <I>But Christ died for sinners</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 neither righteous nor good; not only such as were useless, but such as 
 were guilty and obnoxious; not only such as there would be no loss of 
 should they perish, but such whose destruction would greatly redound to 
 the glory of God's justice, being malefactors and criminals that ought 
 to die. Some think he alludes to a common distinction the Jews had of
 their people into <B><I>ndyqym</I></B>--<I>righteous,</I> 
 <B><I>hsdym</I></B>--<I>merciful</I> (compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:1">Isa. xvii. 1</A>),

 and <B><I>rssym</I></B>--<I>wicked.</I> Now herein <I>God commended his 
 love,</I> not only proved or evidenced his love (he might have done 
 that at a cheaper rate), but magnified it and made it illustrious. This 
 circumstance did greatly magnify and advance his love, not only put it 
 past dispute, but rendered it the object of the greatest wonder and 
 admiration: "Now my creatures shall see that I love them, I will give 
 them such an instance of it as shall be without parallel." 
 <I>Commendeth his love,</I> as merchants commend their goods when they 
 would put them off. This commending of his love was in order to the 
 shedding abroad of his love in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. He evinces 
 his love in the most winning, affecting, endearing way imaginable.
 <I>While we were yet sinners,</I> implying that we were not to be 
 always sinners, there should be a change wrought; for he died to save 
 us, not in our sins, but from our sins; but we were yet sinners when he 
 died for us. 

 (4.) Nay, which is more, <I>we were enemies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 not only malefactors, but traitors and rebels, in arms against the 
 government; the worst kind of malefactors and of all malefactors the 
 most obnoxious. The carnal mind is not only an enemy to God, but enmity 
 itself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:7,Col+1:21"><I>ch.</I> viii. 7; Col. i. 21</A>.

 This enmity is a mutual enmity, God loathing the sinner, and the sinner
 loathing God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:8">Zech. xi. 8</A>.

 And that for such as these Christ should die is such a mystery, such a
 paradox, such an unprecedented instance of love, that it may well be 
 our business to eternity to adore and wonder at it. This is a 
 commendation of love indeed. Justly might he who had thus loved us make 
 it one of the laws of his kingdom that we should love our enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The precious fruits of his death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Justification and reconciliation are the first and primary fruit of 
 the death of Christ: <I>We are justified by his blood</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 <I>reconciled by his death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Sin is pardoned, the sinner accepted as righteous, the quarrel taken 
 up, the enmity slain, an end made of iniquity, and an everlasting 
 righteousness brought in. This is done, that is, Christ has done all 
 that was requisite on his part to be done in order hereunto, and, 
 immediately upon our believing, we are actually put into a state of 
 justification and reconciliation. <I>Justified by his blood.</I> Our
 justification is ascribed to the blood of Christ because <I>without 
 blood there is no remission</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:22">Heb. ix. 22</A>.

 <I>The blood is the life,</I> and that must go to make atonement. In
 all the propitiatory sacrifices, the sprinkling of the blood was of the 
 essence of the sacrifice. It was <I>the blood that made an atonement 
 for the soul,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:11">Lev. xvii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Hence results salvation from wrath: <I>Saved from wrath</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 <I>saved by his life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 When that which hinders our salvation is taken away, the salvation must 
 needs follow. Nay, the argument holds very strongly; if God justified 
 and reconciled us when we were enemies, and put himself to so much 
 charge to do it, much more will he save us when we are justified and 
 reconciled. He that has done the greater, which is of enemies to make 
 us friends, will certainly the less, which is when we are friends to 
 use us friendly and to be kind to us. And therefore the apostle, once 
 and again, speaks of it with a <I>much more.</I> He that hath digged so 
 deep to lay the foundation will no doubt build upon that 
 foundation.--<I>We shall be saved from wrath,</I> from hell and 
 damnation. It is the wrath of God that is the fire of hell; <I>the 
 wrath to come,</I> so it is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:10">1 Thess. i. 10</A>.

 The final justification and absolution of believers at the great day,
 together with the fitting and preparing of them for it, are the 
 salvation from wrath here spoken of; it is the perfecting of the work 
 of grace.--<I>Reconciled by his death, saved by his life.</I> His life 
 here spoken of is not to be understood of his life in the flesh, but 
 his life in heaven, that life which ensued after his death. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:9"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 9</A>.

 <I>He was dead, and is alive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:18">Rev. i. 18</A>.

 We are reconciled by Christ humbled, we are saved by Christ exalted. 
 The dying Jesus laid the foundation, in satisfying for sin, and slaying 
 the enmity, and so making us salvable; thus is the partition-wall 
 broken down, atonement made, and the attainder reversed; but it is the 
 living Jesus that perfects the work: <I>he lives to make 
 intercession,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:25">Heb. vii. 25</A>.

 It is Christ, in his exaltation, that by his word and Spirit
 effectually calls, and changes, and reconciles us to God, is our 
 Advocate with the Father, and so completes and consummates our 
 salvation. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:25,8:34"><I>ch.</I> iv. 25 and viii. 34</A>.

 Christ dying was the testator, who bequeathed us the legacy; but Christ
 living is the executor, who pays it. Now the arguing is very strong. He 
 that puts himself to the charge of purchasing our salvation will not 
 decline the trouble of applying it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. All this produces, as a further privilege, our <I>joy in God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 God is now so far from being a terror to us that he is our <I>joy, and 
 our hope in the day of evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:17">Jer. xvii. 17</A>.

 <I>We are reconciled and saved from wrath.</I> Iniquity, blessed be 
 God, <I>shall not be our ruin. And not only so,</I> there is more in it 
 yet, a constant stream of favours; we not only go to heaven, but go to 
 heaven triumphantly; not only get into the harbour, but come in with 
 full sail: <I>We joy in God,</I> not only saved from his wrath, but 
 solacing ourselves in his love, and this through Jesus Christ, who is 
 the Alpha and the Omega, the foundation-stone and the top-stone of all 
 our comforts and hopes--not only <I>our salvation, but our strength and 
 our song;</I> and all this (which he repeats as a string he loved to be 
 harping upon) by virtue of the atonement, for by him we Christians, we 
 believers, have now, now in gospel times, or now in this life, 
 <I>received the atonement,</I> which was typified by the sacrifices 
 under thee law, and is an earnest of our happiness in heaven. True 
 believers do by Jesus Christ receive the atonement. Receiving the 
 atonement is our actual reconciliation to God in justification, 
 grounded upon Christ's satisfaction. To <I>receive the atonement</I> 
 is,

 (1.) To give our consent to the atonement, approving of, and agreeing 
 to, those methods which Infinite Wisdom has taken of saving a guilty 
 world by the blood of a crucified Jesus, being willing and glad to be 
 saved in a gospel way and upon gospel terms. 

 (2.) To take the comfort of the atonement, which is the fountain and 
 the foundation of our joy in God. Now <I>we joy in God,</I> now we do 
 indeed <I>receive the atonement,</I> 
 <B><I>kauchomenoi</I></B>--<I>glorying</I> in it. God hath received the 
 atonement 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:17,17:5.28:2">Matt. iii. 17; xvii. 5; xxviii. 2</A>):

 if we but receive it, the work is done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The parallel that the apostle runs between the communication of 
 sin and death by the first Adam and of righteousness and life by the 
 second Adam 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:12-21">
 <I>v.</I> 12, to the end</A>),

 which not only illustrates the truth he is discoursing of, but tends 
 very much to the commending of the love of God and the comforting of 
 the hearts of true believers, in showing a correspondence between our 
 fall and our recovery, and not only a like, but a much greater power in 
 the second Adam to make us happy, than there was in the first to make 
 us miserable. Now, for the opening of this, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A general truth laid down as the foundation of his discourse--that
 Adam was a type of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Who is the figure of him that was to come.</I> Christ is therefore 
 called the <I>last Adam,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:45">1 Cor. xv. 45</A>.
 
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 In this Adam was a type of Christ, that in the covenant-transactions 
 that were between God and him, and in the consequent events of those 
 transactions, Adam was a public person. God dealt with Adam and Adam 
 acted as such a one, as a common father and factor, root and 
 representative, of and for all his posterity; so that what he did in 
 that station, as agent for us, we may be said to have done in him, and 
 what was done to him may be said to have been done to us in him. Thus 
 Jesus Christ, the Mediator, acted as a public person, the head of all 
 the elect, dealt with God for them, as their father, factor, root, and 
 representative--died for them, rose for them, entered within the veil 
 for them, did all for them. When Adam failed, we failed with him; when 
 Christ performed, he performed for us. Thus was Adam <B><I>typos tou 
 mellontos</I></B>--<I>the figure of him that was to come,</I> to come 
 to repair that breach which Adam had made.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A more particular explication of the parallel, in which observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How Adam, as a public person, communicated sin and death to all 
 his posterity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>By one man sin entered.</I> We see the world under a deluge of sin 
 and death, full of iniquities and full of calamities. Now, it is worth 
 while to enquire what is the spring that feeds it, and you will find it 
 to be the general corruption of nature; and at what gap it entered, and 
 you will find it to have been Adam's first sin. It was <I>by one 
 man,</I> and he the first man (for if any had been before him they 
 would have been free), that one man from whom, as from the root, we all 
 spring. 

 [1.] By him <I>sin entered.</I> When God pronounced all very good

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:31">Gen. i. 31</A>)

 there was no sin in the world; it was when Adam ate forbidden fruit 
 that sin made its entry. Sin had before entered into the world of 
 angels, when many of them revolted from their allegiance and left their 
 first estate; but it never entered into the world of mankind till Adam 
 sinned. Then it entered as an enemy, to kill and destroy, as a thief, 
 to rob and despoil; and a dismal entry it was. Then entered the guilt
 of Adam's sin imputed to posterity, and a general corruption and 
 depravedness of nature. <B><I>Eph ho</I></B>--<I>for that</I> (so we
 read it), rather <I>in whom, all have sinned.</I> Sin entered into the 
 world by Adam, for in him we all sinned. As, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:22">1 Cor. xv. 22</A>,

 <I>in Adam all die;</I> so here, <I>in him all have sinned;</I> for it
 is agreeable to the law of all nations that the acts of a public person 
 be accounted theirs whom they represent; and what a whole body does 
 every member of the same body may be said to do. Now Adam acted thus
 as a public person, by the sovereign ordination and appointment of God, 
 and yet that founded upon a natural necessity; for God, as the author 
 of nature, had made this the law of nature, that man should beget in 
 his own likeness, and so the other creatures. In Adam therefore, as in 
 a common receptacle, the whole nature of man was reposited, from him to 
 flow down in a channel to his posterity; for all mankind are made <I>of 
 one blood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:26">Acts xvii. 26</A>),

 so that according as this nature proves through his standing or 
 falling, before he puts it out of his hands, accordingly it is 
 propagated from him. Adam therefore sinning and falling, the nature 
 became guilty and corrupt, and is so derived. Thus in him all have 
 sinned. 

 [2.] <I>Death by sin,</I> for death is the wages of sin. Sin, when it 
 is finished, brings forth death. When sin came, of course death came 
 with it. Death is here put for all that misery which is the due desert 
 of sin, temporal, spiritual, eternal death. If Adam had not sinned, he 
 had not died; the threatening was, <I>In the day thou eatest thou shall 
 surely die,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:17">Gen. ii. 17</A>.

 [3.] <I>So death passed,</I> that is, a sentence of death was passed,
 as upon a criminal, <B><I>dielthen</I></B>--<I>passed through</I> all 
 men, as an infectious disease passes through a town, so that none 
 escape it. It is the universal fate, without exception: death passes
 upon all. There are common calamities incident to human life which do
 abundantly prove this. <I>Death reigned,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He speaks of death as a mighty prince, and his monarchy the most 
 absolute, universal, and lasting monarchy. None are exempted from its 
 sceptre; it is a monarchy that will survive all other earthly rule, 
 authority, and power, for it is the last enemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:26">1 Cor. xv. 26</A>.

 Those sons of Belial that will be subject to no other rule cannot avoid
 being subject to this. Now all this we may thank Adam for; from him
 sin and death descend. Well may we say, as that good man, observing
 the change that a fit of sickness had made in his countenance, <I>O 
 Adam!</I> what hast thou done?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Further, to clear this, he shows that sin did not commence with the law 
 of Moses, but was <I>in the world until,</I> or <I>before,</I> that 
 law; therefore that law of Moses is not the only rule of life, for 
 there was a rule, and that rule was transgressed, before the law was 
 given. It likewise intimates that we cannot be justified by our 
 obedience to the law of Moses, any more than we were condemned by and 
 for our disobedience to it. Sin was in the world before the law; 
 witness Cain's murder, the apostasy of the old world, the wickedness of 
 Sodom. His inference hence is, Therefore there was a law; for <I>sin is 
 not imputed where there is no law.</I> Original sin is a want of 
 conformity to, and actual sin is a transgression of, the law of God: 
 therefore all were under some law. His proof of it is, <I>Death reigned 
 from Adam to Moses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is certain that death could not have reigned if sin had not set up 
 the throne for him. This proves that sin was in the world before the 
 law, and original sin, for death reigned over those that had not sinned 
 any actual sin, that <I>had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's 
 transgression,</I> never sinned in their own persons as Adam did--which 
 is to be understood of infants, that were never guilty of actual sin, 
 and yet died, because Adam's sin was imputed to them. This reign of 
 death seems especially to refer to those violent and extraordinary 
 judgments which were long before Moses, as the deluge and the 
 destruction of Sodom, which involved infants. It is a great proof of 
 original sin that little children, who were never guilty of any actual 
 transgression, are yet liable to very terrible diseases, casualties, 
 and deaths, which could by no means be reconciled with the justice and 
 righteousness of God if they were not chargeable with guilt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How, in correspondence to this, Christ, as a public person, 
 communicates righteousness and life to all true believers, who are his 
 spiritual seed. And in this he shows not only wherein the resemblance 
 holds, but, <I>ex abundanti,</I> wherein the communication of grace and 
 love by Christ <I>goes beyond</I> the communication of guilt and wrath 
 by Adam. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Wherein the resemblance holds. This is laid down most fully, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First, By the offence and disobedience of one many were made 
 sinners, and judgment came upon all men to condemnation.</I> Here 
 observe, 

 1. That Adam's sin was disobedience, disobedience to a plain and
 express command: and it was a command of trial. The thing he did was 
 therefore evil because it was forbidden, and not otherwise; but this 
 opened the door to other sins, though itself seemingly small. 

 2. That the malignity and poison of sin are very strong and spreading,
 else the guilt of Adam's sin would not have reached so far, nor have 
 been so deep and long a stream. Who would think there should be so much 
 evil in sin? 

 3. That by Adam's sin many are made sinners: <I>many,</I> that is, all 
 his posterity; said to be many, in opposition to the one that offended, 
 <I>Made sinners,</I> <B><I>katestathesan.</I></B> It denotes the making 
 of us such by a judicial act: we were cast as sinners by due course of 
 law. 

 4. That judgment is come to condemnation upon all those that by Adam's
 disobedience were made sinners. Being convicted, we are condemned. All 
 the race of mankind lie under a sentence, like an attainder upon a 
 family. There is judgment given and recorded against us in the court of 
 heaven; and, if the judgment be not reversed, we are likely to sink 
 under it to eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> In like manner, <I>by the righteousness and obedience 
 of one</I> (and that one is Jesus Christ, the second Adam), <I>are many 
 made righteous,</I> and so the <I>free gift comes upon all.</I> It is 
 observable how the apostle inculcates this truth, and repeats it again 
 and again, as a truth of very great consequence. Here observe, 

 1. The nature of Christ's righteousness, how it is brought in; it is by
 his obedience. The disobedience of the first Adam ruined us, the 
 obedience of the second Adam saves us,--his obedience to the law of 
 mediation, which was that he should fulfil all righteousness, and then 
 make his soul an offering for sin. By his obedience to this law he 
 wrought out a righteousness for us, satisfied God's justice, and so 
 made way for us into his favour.

 2. The fruit of it. 

 (1.) There is a <I>free gift come upon all men,</I> that is, it is made 
 and offered promiscuously to all. The salvation wrought is a <I>common
 salvation;</I> the proposals are general, the tender free; whoever will 
 may come, and take of these waters of life. This free gift is to all 
 believers, upon their believing, <I>unto justification of life.</I> It 
 is not only a justification that frees from death, but that entitles to 
 life. 

 (2.) <I>Many shall be made righteous</I>--many compared with one, or as 
 many as belong to the election of grace, which, though but a few as 
 they are scattered up and down in the world, yet will be a great many 
 when they come all together. <B><I>Katastathesontai</I></B>--<I>they
 shall be constituted</I> righteous, as by letters patent. Now the 
 antithesis between these two, our ruin by Adam and our recovery by 
 Christ, is obvious enough.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Wherein the communication of grace and love by Christ goes beyond 
 the communication of guilt and wrath by Adam; and this he shows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.

 It is designed for the magnifying of the riches of Christ's love, and
 for the comfort and encouragement of believers, who, considering what a 
 wound Adam's sin has made, might begin to despair of a proportionable 
 remedy. His expressions are a little intricate, but this he seems to 
 intend:--<I>First,</I> If guilt and wrath be communicated, much more
 shall grace and love; for it is agreeable to the idea we have of the 
 divine goodness to suppose that he should be more ready to save upon an 
 imputed righteousness than to condemn upon an imputed guilt: <I>Much 
 more the grace of God, and the gift by grace.</I> God's goodness is, of 
 all his attributes, in a special manner his glory, and it is that grace 
 that is the root (his favour to us in Christ), and the gift is by 
 grace. We know that God is rather inclined to show mercy; punishing is 
 his strange work. <I>Secondly,</I> If there was so much power and
 efficacy, as it seems there was, in the sin of a man, who was of the 
 earth, earthy, to condemn us, much more are there power and efficacy in 
 the righteousness and grace of Christ, who is the Lord from heaven, to 
 justify and save us. The <I>one man</I> that saves us is Jesus Christ. 
 Surely Adam could not propagate so strong a poison but Jesus Christ 
 could propagate as strong an antidote, and much stronger. 

 3. It is but the guilt of one single offence of Adam's that is laid to
 our charge: <I>The judgment was</I> <B><I>ex henos eis 
 katakrima,</I></B> <I>by one,</I> that is, by one offence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>,

 <I>Margin.</I> But from Jesus Christ we receive and derive an 
 <I>abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness.</I> The stream 
 of grace and righteousness is deeper and broader than the stream of 
 guilt; for this righteousness does not only take away the guilt of that 
 one offence, but of many other offences, even of all. God in Christ 
 forgives all trespasses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:13">Col. ii. 13</A>.

 4. By Adam's sin <I>death reigned;</I> but by Christ's righteousness
 there is not only a period put to the reign of death, but believers are 
 preferred to <I>reign of life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 In and by the righteousness of Christ we have not only a charter of 
 pardon, but a patent of honour, are not only freed from our chains, 
 but, like Joseph, advanced to the second chariot, and made unto our God 
 kings and priests--not only pardoned, but preferred. See this observed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5,6,5:9,10">Rev. i. 5, 6; v. 9, 10</A>.

 We are by Christ and his righteousness entitled to, and instated in,
 more and greater privileges than we lost by the offence of Adam. The 
 plaster is wider than the wound, and more healing than the wound is 
 killing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:20,21">last two verses</A>

 the apostle seems to anticipate an objection which is expressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:19">Gal. iii. 19</A>,
 
 <I>Wherefore then serveth the law?</I> Answer,

 1. <I>The law entered that the offence might abound.</I> Not to make
 sin to abound the more in itself, otherwise than as sin takes occasion 
 by the commandment, but to discover the abounding sinfulness of it. The 
 glass discovers the spots, but does not cause them. When the 
 commandment came into the world sin revived, as the letting of a 
 clearer light into a room discovers the dust and filth which were there 
 before, but were not seen. It was like the searching of a wound, which 
 is necessary to the cure. <I>The offence,</I> <B><I>to 
 paraptoma</I></B>--<I>that offence,</I> the sin of Adam, the extending 
 of the guilt of it to us, and the effect of the corruption in us, are 
 the abounding of that offence which appeared upon the entry of the law. 
 
 2. <I>That grace might much more abound</I>--that the terrors of the
 law might make gospel-comforts so much the sweeter. Sin abounded among 
 the Jews; and, to those of them that were converted to the faith of 
 Christ, did not grace much more abound in the remitting of so much 
 guilt and the subduing of so much corruption? The greater the strength 
 of the enemy, the greater the honour of the conqueror. This abounding 
 of grace he illustrates,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 As the reign of a tyrant and oppressor is a foil to set off the
 succeeding reign of a just and gentle prince and to make it the more 
 illustrious, so doth the reign of sin set off the reign of grace. 
 <I>Sin reigned unto death;</I> it was a cruel bloody reign. But 
 <I>grace reigns</I> to life, <I>eternal life,</I> and this <I>through 
 righteousness,</I> righteousness imputed to us for justification, 
 implanted in us for sanctification; and both by <I>Jesus Christ our 
 Lord,</I> through the power and efficacy of Christ, the great prophet, 
 priest, and king, of his church.</P>
