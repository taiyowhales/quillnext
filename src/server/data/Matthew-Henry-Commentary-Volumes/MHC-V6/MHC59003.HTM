 The apostle here reproves ambition, and an arrogant magisterial tongue;
 and shows the duty and advantage of bridling it because of its power to
 do mischief. Those who profess religion ought especially to govern
 their tongues, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:1-12">ver. 1-12</A>.

 True wisdom makes men meek, and avoiders of strife and envy: and hereby
 it may easily be distinguished from a wisdom that is earthly and
 hypocritical,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall
 receive the greater condemnation.
 &nbsp; 2  For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in
 word, the same <I>is</I> a perfect man, <I>and</I> able also to bridle the
 whole body.
 &nbsp; 3  Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey
 us; and we turn about their whole body.
 &nbsp; 4  Behold also the ships, which though <I>they be</I> so great, and
 <I>are</I> driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a
 very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
 &nbsp; 5  Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great
 things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
 &nbsp; 6  And the tongue <I>is</I> a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the
 tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and
 setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of
 hell.
 &nbsp; 7  For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and
 of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
 &nbsp; 8  But the tongue can no man tame; <I>it is</I> an unruly evil, full
 of deadly poison.
 &nbsp; 9  Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse
 we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
 &nbsp; 10  Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
 brethren, these things ought not so to be.
 &nbsp; 11  Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet <I>water</I>
 and bitter?
 &nbsp; 12  Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a
 vine, figs? so <I>can</I> no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The foregoing chapter shows how unprofitable and dead faith is without 
 works. It is plainly intimated by what this chapter first goes upon 
 that such a faith is, however, apt to make men conceited and 
 magisterial in their tempers and their talk. Those who set up faith in 
 the manner the former chapter condemns are most apt to run into those 
 sins of the tongue which this chapter condemns. And indeed the best 
 need to be cautioned against a dictating, censorious, mischievous use 
 of their tongues. We are therefore taught,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Not to use our tongues so as to lord it over others: <I>My brethren, 
 be not many masters,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 These words do not forbid doing what we can to direct and instruct
 others in the way of their duty or to reprove them in a Christian way 
 for what is amiss; but we must not affect to speak and act as those who 
 are continually assuming the chair, we must not prescribe to one 
 another, so as to make our own sentiments a standard by which to try 
 all others, because God gives various gifts to men, and expects from 
 each according to that measure of light which he gives. "Therefore by 
 not many <I>masters</I>" (or <I>teachers,</I> as some read it); "do not 
 give yourselves the air of teachers, imposers, and judges, but rather 
 speak with the humility and spirit of learners; do not censure one 
 another, as if all must be brought to your standard." This is enforced 
 by two reasons. 

 1. Those who thus set up for judges and censurers <I>shall receive the
 greater condemnation.</I> Our judging others will but make our own 
 judgment the more strict and severe,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:1,2">Matt. vii. 1, 2</A>.

 Those who are curious to spy out the faults of others, and arrogant in
 passing censures upon them, may expect that God will be as extreme in 
 marking what they say and do amiss. 

 2. Another reason given against such acting the master is because we
 are all sinners: <I>In many things we offend all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Were we to think more of our own mistakes and offenses, we should be 
 less apt to judge other people. While we are severe against what we 
 count offensive in others, we do not consider how much there is in us 
 which is justly offensive to them. Self-justifiers are commonly
 self-deceivers. We are all guilty before God; and those who vaunt it 
 over the frailties and infirmities of others little think how many 
 things they offend in themselves. Nay, perhaps their magisterial 
 deportment, and censorious tongues, may prove worse than any faults 
 they condemn in others. Let us learn to be severe in judging ourselves, 
 but charitable in our judgments of other people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are taught to govern our tongue so as to prove ourselves perfect 
 and upright men, and such as have an entire government over ourselves: 
 <I>If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able 
 also to bridle the whole body.</I> It is here implied that he whose 
 conscience is affected by tongue-sins, and who takes care to avoid 
 them, is an upright man, and has an undoubted sign of true grace. But, 
 on the other hand, <I>if a man seemeth to be religious</I> (as was 
 declared in the first chapter) <I>and bridleth not his tongue,</I> 
 whatever profession he makes, <I>that man's religion is vain.</I> 
 Further, he that offends not in word will not only prove himself a 
 sincere Christian, but a very much advanced and improved Christian. For 
 the wisdom and grace which enable him to rule his tongue will enable 
 him also to rule all his actions. This we have illustrated by two 
 comparisons:--

 1. The governing and guiding of all the motions of a horse, by the bit
 which is put into his mouth: <I>Behold, we put bits into the horses' 
 mouths, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 There is a great deal of brutish fierceness and wantonness in us. This
 shows itself very much by the tongue: so that this must be bridled; 
 according to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:1">Ps. xxxix. 1</A>,

 <I>I will keep my mouth with a bridle</I> (or, <I>I will bridle my
 mouth) while the wicked is before me.</I> The more quick and lively the 
 tongue is, the more should we thus take care to govern it. Otherwise, 
 as an unruly and ungovernable horse runs away with his rider, or throws 
 him, so an unruly tongue will serve those in like manner who have no 
 command over it. Whereas, let resolution and watchfulness, under the 
 influence of the grace of God, bridle the tongue, and then all the 
 motions and actions of the whole body will be easily guided and 
 overruled. 

 2. The governing of a ship by the right management of the helm:
 <I>Behold also the ships, which though they are so great, and are 
 driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small 
 helm whithersoever the governor listeth. Even so the tongue is a
 little member, and boasteth great things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 As the helm is a very small part of the ship, so is the tongue a very 
 small part of the body: but the right governing of the helm or rudder 
 will steer and turn the ship as the governor pleases; and a right 
 management of the tongue is, in a great measure, the government of the 
 whole man. There is a wonderful beauty in these comparisons, to show 
 how things of small bulk may yet be of vast use. And hence we should 
 learn to make the due management of our tongues more our study, 
 because, though they are little members, they are capable of doing a 
 great deal of good or a great deal of hurt. Therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are taught to dread an unruly tongue as one of the greatest and 
 most pernicious evils. It is compared to a little fire placed among a 
 great deal of combustible matter, which soon raises a flame and 
 consumes all before it: <I>Behold, how great a matter a little fire 
 kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 There is such an abundance of sin in the tongue that it may be called
 <I>a world of iniquity.</I> How many defilements does it occasion! How 
 many and dreadful flames does it kindle! <I>So is the tongue among the 
 members that it defileth the whole body.</I> Observe hence, There is a 
 great pollution and defilement in sins of the tongue. Defiling
 passions are kindled, vented, and cherished by this unruly member. And
 the whole body is often drawn into sin and guilt by the tongue. 
 Therefore Solomon says, <I>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to 
 sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:6">Eccles. v. 6</A>.

 The snares into which men are sometimes led by the tongue are
 insufferable to themselves and destructive of others. <I>It setteth on
 fire the course of nature.</I> The affairs of mankind and of societies 
 are often thrown into confusion, and all is on a flame, by the tongues 
 of men. Some read it, <I>all our generations are set on fire by the 
 tongue.</I> There is no age of the world, nor any condition of life, 
 private or public, but will afford examples of this. <I>And it is set
 on fire of hell.</I> Observe hence, Hell has more to do in promoting of 
 fire of the tongue than men are generally aware of. It is from some
 diabolical designs, that men's tongues are inflamed. The devil is
 expressly called a liar, a murderer, an accuser of the brethren; and, 
 whenever men's tongues are employed in any of these ways, they are set 
 on fire of hell. The Holy Ghost indeed once descended in <I>cloven 
 tongues as of fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1-4">Acts ii</A>.

 And, where the tongue is thus guided and wrought upon by a fire from
 heaven, there it kindleth good thoughts, holy affections, and ardent 
 devotions. But when it is set on fire of hell, as in all undue heats it 
 is, there it is mischievous, producing rage and hatred, and those 
 things which serve the purposes of the devil. As therefore you would 
 dread fires and flames, you should dread contentions, revilings, 
 slanders, lies, and every thing that would kindle the fire of wrath in 
 your own spirit or in the spirits of others. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We are next taught how very difficult a thing it is to govern the
 tongue: <I>For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and 
 of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed, of mankind. But 
 the tongue can no man tame,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 As if the apostle had said, "Lions, and the most savage beasts, as well 
 as horses and camels, and creatures of the greatest strength, have been 
 tamed and governed by men: so have birds, notwithstanding their 
 wildness and timorousness, and their wings to bear them up continually 
 out of our reach: even serpents, notwithstanding all their venom and 
 all their cunning, have been made familiar and harmless: and things in 
 the sea have been taken by men, and made serviceable to them. And these 
 creatures have not been subdued nor tamed by miracle only (as the lions 
 crouched to Daniel, instead of devouring him, and ravens fed Elijah, 
 and a whale carried Jonah through the depths of the sea to dry land), 
 but what is here spoken of is something commonly done; not only hath 
 been tamed, but is tamed of mankind. Yet the tongue is worse than 
 these, and cannot be tamed by the power and art which serves to tame 
 these things. No man can tame the tongue without supernatural grace and 
 assistance." The apostle does not intend to represent it as a thing 
 impossible, but as a thing extremely difficult, which therefore will 
 require great watchfulness, and pains, and prayer, to keep it in due 
 order. And sometimes all is too little; <I>for it is an unruly evil, 
 full of deadly poison.</I> Brute creatures may be kept within certain 
 bounds, they may be managed by certain rules, and even serpents may be 
 so used as to do not hurt with all their poison; but the tongue is apt 
 to break through all bounds and rules, and to spit out its poison on 
 one occasion or other, notwithstanding the utmost care. So that not 
 only does it need to be watched, and guarded, and governed, as much as 
 an unruly beast, or a hurtful and poisonous creature, but much more 
 care and pains will be needful to prevent the mischievous outbreakings 
 and effects of the tongue. However,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. We are taught to think of the use we make of our tongues in religion 
 and in the service of God, and by such a consideration to keep it from 
 cursing, censuring, and every thing that is evil on other occasions: 
 <I>Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, 
 who are made after the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceed 
 blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 How absurd is it that those who use their tongues in prayer and praise 
 should ever use them in cursing, slandering, and the like! If we bless
 God as our Father, it should teach us to speak well of, and kindly to, 
 all who bear his image. That tongue which addresses with reverence the 
 divine Being cannot, without the greatest inconsistency, turn upon 
 fellow-creatures with reviling brawling language. It is said of the 
 seraphim that praise God, they <I>dare not bring a railing 
 accusation.</I> And for men to reproach those who have not only the 
 image of God in their natural faculties, but are renewed after the 
 image of God by the grace of the gospel: this is a most shameful 
 contradiction to all their pretensions of honouring the great Original.
 <I>These things ought not so to be;</I> and, if such considerations 
 were always at hand, surely they would not be. Piety is disgraced in 
 all the shows of it, if there be not charity. That tongue confutes 
 itself which one while pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to 
 refer all things to him, and another while will condemn even good men 
 if they do not just come up to the same words or expressions used by 
 it. Further, to fix this thought, the apostle shows that contrary 
 effects from the same causes are monstrous, and not be found in nature, 
 and therefore cannot be consistent with grace: <I>Doth a fountain send 
 forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? Can the fig-tree bear 
 olive-berries, or a vine, figs? Or doth the same spring yield both salt 
 water and fresh?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 True religion will not admit of contradictions; and a truly religious 
 man can never allow of them either in his words or his actions. How 
 many sins would this prevent, and recover men from, to put them upon 
 being always consistent with themselves!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Who <I>is</I> a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let
 him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of
 wisdom.
 &nbsp; 14  But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts,
 glory not, and lie not against the truth.
 &nbsp; 15  This wisdom descendeth not from above, but <I>is</I> earthly,
 sensual, devilish.
 &nbsp; 16  For where envying and strife <I>is,</I> there <I>is</I> confusion and
 every evil work.
 &nbsp; 17  But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then
 peaceable, gentle, <I>and</I> easy to be intreated, full of mercy and
 good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
 &nbsp; 18  And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that
 make peace.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As the sins before condemned arise from an affectation of being thought 
 more wise than others, and being endued with more knowledge than they, 
 so the apostle in these verses shows the difference between men's 
 pretending to be wise and their being really so, and between the wisdom 
 which is from beneath (from earth or hell) and that which is from 
 above.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have some account of true wisdom, with the distinguishing marks 
 and fruits of it: <I>Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge among 
 you? Let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of 
 wisdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 A truly wise man is a very knowing man: he will not set up for the 
 reputation of being wise without laying in a good stock of knowledge; 
 and he will not value himself merely upon knowing things, if he has not 
 wisdom to make a right application and use of that knowledge. These
 two things must be put together to make up the account of true wisdom: 
 who is wise, and endued with knowledge? Now where this is the happy 
 case of any there will be these following things:--

 1. A good conversation. If we are wiser than others, this should be
 evidenced by the goodness of our conversation, not by the roughness or 
 vanity of it. Words that inform, and heal, and do good, are the marks 
 of wisdom; not those that look great, and do mischief, and are the 
 occasions of evil, either in ourselves or others. 

 2. True wisdom may be known by its works. The conversation here does
 not refer only to words, but to the whole of men's practice; therefore 
 it is said, Let him show out of a good conversation his works. True 
 wisdom does not lie in good notions or speculations so much as in good 
 and useful actions. Not he who thinks well, or he who talks well, is in 
 the sense of the scripture allowed to be wise, if he do not live and 
 act well. 

 3. True wisdom may be known by the meekness of the spirit and temper:
 <I>Let him show with meekness,</I> &c. It is a great instance of wisdom 
 prudently to bridle our own anger, and patiently to bear the anger of 
 others. And as wisdom will evidence itself in meekness, so meekness 
 will be a great friend to wisdom; for nothing hinders the regular 
 apprehension, the solid judgment, and impartiality of thought, 
 necessary to our acting wisely, so much as passion. When we are mild 
 and calm, we are best able to hear reason, and best able to speak it.
 Wisdom produces meekness, and meekness increases wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have the glorying of those taken away who are of a contrary 
 character to that now mentioned, and their wisdom exposed in all its 
 boasts and productions: "<I>If you have bitter envying and strife in 
 your hearts, glory not,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:14-16"><I>v.</I> 14-16</A>.

 Pretend what you will, and think yourselves ever so wise, yet you have
 abundance of reason to cease your glorying, if you run down love and 
 peace, and give way to bitter envying and strife. Your zeal for truth 
 or orthodoxy, and your boasts of knowing more than others, if you 
 employ these only to make others hateful, and to show your own spite 
 and heart-burnings against them, are a shame to your profession of 
 Christianity, and a downright contradiction to it. Lie not thus against 
 the truth." Observe, 

 1. Envying and strife are opposed to the meekness of wisdom. The heart
 is the seat of both; but envy and wisdom cannot dwell together in the 
 same heart. Holy zeal and bitter envying are as different as the flames 
 of seraphim and the fire of hell. 

 2. The order of things here laid down. Envying is first and excites
 strife; strife endeavours to excuse itself by vain-glorying and lying; 
 and then

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 hereupon ensue confusion and every evil work. Those who live in malice, 
 envy, and contention, live in confusion, and are liable to be provoked 
 and hurried to any evil work. Such disorders raise many temptations, 
 strengthen temptations, and involve men in a great deal of guilt. One 
 sin begets another, and it cannot be imagined how much mischief is 
 produced: <I>there</I> is every evil work. And is such wisdom as 
 produces these effects to be gloried in? This cannot be without giving 
 the lie to Christianity, and pretending that this wisdom is what it is 
 not. For observe, 

 3. Whence such wisdom cometh: <I>It descendeth not from above,</I> but
 ariseth from beneath; and, to speak plainly, it is <I>earthly, sensual, 
 devilish,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It springs from earthly principles, acts upon earthly motives, and is 
 intent upon serving earthly purposes. It is sensual indulging the 
 flesh, and making provision to fulfil the lusts and desires of it. Or, 
 according to the original word, <B><I>psychike,</I></B> it is animal of 
 human--the mere working of natural reason, without any supernatural 
 light. And it is devilish, such wisdom being the wisdom of devils (to 
 create uneasiness and to do hurt), and being inspired by devils, whose 
 condemnation is pride

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:6">1 Tim. iii. 6</A>),

 and who are noted in other places of scripture for their wrath, and 
 their accusing the brethren. And therefore those who are lifted up with 
 such wisdom as this must fall into the condemnation of the devil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have the lovely picture of that wisdom which is from above more 
 fully drawn, and set in opposition to this which is from beneath: 
 <I>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable,</I> 
 &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 Observe here, True wisdom is God's gift. It is not gained by conversing
 with men, nor by the knowledge of the world (as some think and speak), 
 but it comes from above. It consists of these several things:--

 1. It is pure, without mixture of maxims or aims that would debase it:
 and it is free from iniquity and defilements, not allowing of any known
 sin, but studious of holiness both in heart and life. 

 2. The wisdom that is from above is peaceable. Peace follows purity,
 and depends upon it. Those who are truly wise do what they can to
 preserve peace, that it may not be broken; and to make peace, that 
 where it is lost it may be restored. In kingdoms, in families, in 
 churches, in all societies, and in all interviews and transactions, 
 heavenly wisdom makes men peaceable. 

 3. It is gentle, not standing upon extreme right in matters of
 property; not saying nor doing any thing rigorous in points of censure; 
 not being furious about opinions, urging our own beyond their weight 
 nor theirs who oppose us beyond their intention; not being rude and 
 overbearing in conversation, nor harsh and cruel in temper. Gentleness
 may thus be opposed to all these. 

 4. Heavenly wisdom is <I>easy to be entreated,</I>
 <B><I>eupeithes;</I></B> it is very <I>persuadable,</I> either to what 
 is good or from what is evil. There is an easiness that is weak and 
 faulty; but it is not a blamable easiness to yield ourselves to the 
 persuasions of God's word, and to all just and reasonable counsels or 
 requests of our fellow-creatures; no, nor to give up a dispute, where 
 there appears a good reason for it and where a good end may be answered 
 by it. 

 5. Heavenly wisdom is full of mercy and good fruits, inwardly disposed
 to every thing that is kind and good, both to relieve those who want 
 and to forgive those who offend, and actually to do this whenever 
 proper occasions offer. 

 6. Heavenly wisdom is without partiality. The original word,
 <B><I>adiakritos,</I></B> signifies to be without suspicion, or free 
 from judging, making no undue surmises nor differences in our conduct 
 towards one person more than another. The margin reads it, <I>without
 wrangling,</I> not acting the part of sectaries, and disputing merely 
 for the sake of a party; nor censuring others purely on account of 
 their differing from us. The wisest men are least apt to be censurers.
 
 7. That wisdom which is from above is without hypocrisy. It has no
 disguises nor deceits. It cannot fall in with those managements which 
 the world counts wise, which are crafty and guileful; but it is sincere 
 and open, steady and uniform, and consistent with itself. O that you 
 and I may always be guided by such wisdom as this! that with Paul we 
 may be able to say, <I>Not with fleshly wisdom, but in simplicity and 
 godly sincerity, by the grace of God, we have our conversation.</I> And 
 then, <I>lastly,</I> true wisdom will go on to sow the fruits of 
 righteousness in peace, and thus, if it may be, to make peace in the 
 world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 And that which is sown in peace will produce a harvest of joys. Let 
 others reap the fruits of contentions, and all the advantages they can 
 propose to themselves by them; but let us go on peaceably to sow the 
 seeds of righteousness, and we may depend upon it our labour will not 
 be lost. <I>For light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the 
 upright in heart; and the work of righteousness shall be peace, and the 
 effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.</I></P>
