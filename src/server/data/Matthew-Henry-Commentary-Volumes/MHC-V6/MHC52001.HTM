 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
 Thessalonians <I>which is</I> in God the Father and <I>in</I> the Lord
 Jesus Christ: Grace <I>be</I> unto you, and peace, from God our
 Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this introduction we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The inscription, where we have,

 1. The persons from whom this epistle came, or by whom it was written.
 Paul was the inspired apostle and writer of this epistle, though he
 makes no mention of his apostleship, which was not doubted of by the
 Thessalonians, nor opposed by any false apostle among them. He joins 
 Silvanus (or Silas) and Timotheus with himself (who had now come to him 
 with an account of the prosperity of the churches in Macedonia), which 
 shows this great apostle's humility, and how desirous he was to put 
 honour upon the ministers of Christ who were of an inferior rank and 
 standing. A good example this is to such ministers as are of greater 
 abilities and reputation in the church than some others. 

 2. The persons to whom this epistle is written, namely, the church of
 the Thessalonians, the converted Jews and Gentiles in Thessalonica; and 
 it is observable that this church is said to <I>be in God the Father 
 and in the Lord Jesus Christ;</I> they had fellowship with the Father, 
 and his Son Jesus Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3">1 John i. 3</A>.

 They were a Christian church, because they believed in God the Father
 and in the Lord Jesus Christ. They believed the principles both of 
 natural and revealed religion. The Gentiles among them were turned to 
 God from idols, and the Jews among them believed Jesus to be the 
 promised Messias. All of them were devoted and dedicated to God the 
 Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: to God as their chief good and 
 highest end, to Jesus Christ as their Lord and Mediator between God and 
 man. God the Father is the original centre of all natural religion; and 
 Jesus Christ is the author and centre of all revealed religion. <I>You 
 believe in God,</I> says our Saviour, <I>believe also in me.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:1">John xiv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The salutation or apostolical benediction: <I>Grace be with you, 
 and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</I> This is 
 the same for substance as in the other epistles. Grace and peace are 
 well joined together; for the free grace or favour of God is the spring 
 or fountain of all the peace and prosperity we do or can enjoy; and 
 where there are gracious dispositions in us we may hope for peaceful 
 thoughts in our own breasts; both grace and peace, and all spiritual 
 blessings, come to us from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ; 
 from God the original of all good, and from the Lord Jesus the 
 purchaser of all good for us; from God in Christ, and so our Father in 
 covenant, because he is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 Note, As all good comes from God, so no good can be hoped for by 
 sinners but from God in Christ. And the best good may be expected from 
 God as our Father for the sake of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of
 you in our prayers;
 &nbsp; 3  Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of
 love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight
 of God and our Father;
 &nbsp; 4  Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
 &nbsp; 5  For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in
 power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know
 what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle begins with thanksgiving to God. Being about to mention 
 the things that were matter of joy to him, and highly praiseworthy in 
 them, and greatly for their advantage, he chooses to do this by way of 
 thanksgiving to God, who is the author of all that good that comes to 
 us, or is done by us, at any time. God is the object of all religious 
 worship, of prayer and praise. And thanksgiving to God is a great duty, 
 to be performed always or constantly; even when we do not actually give 
 thanks to God by our words, we should have a grateful sense of God's 
 goodness upon our minds. Thanksgiving should be often repeated; and not 
 only should we be thankful for the favours we ourselves receive, but 
 for the benefits bestowed on others also, upon our fellow-creatures and 
 fellow-christians. The apostle gave thanks not only for those who were 
 his most intimate friends, or most eminently favoured of God, but for 
 them all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He joined prayer with his praise or thanksgiving. When we in every 
 thing by prayer and supplication make our requests known to God, we 
 should join thanksgiving therewith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:6">Phil. iv. 6</A>.

 So when we give thanks for any benefit we receive we should join
 prayer. We should pray always and without ceasing, and should pray not 
 only for ourselves, but for others also, for our friends, and should 
 make mention of them in our prayers. We may sometimes mention their 
 names, and should make mention of their case and condition; at least, 
 we should have their persons and circumstances in our minds, 
 remembering them without ceasing. Note, As there is much that we ought 
 to be thankful for on the behalf of ourselves and our friends, so there 
 is much occasion of constant prayer for further supplies of good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He mentions the particulars for which he was so thankful to God; 
 namely,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The saving benefits bestowed on them. These were the grounds and 
 reasons of his thanksgiving. 

 (1.) Their faith and their work of faith. Their faith he tells them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 was very famous, and spread abroad. This is the radical grace; and
 their faith was a true and living faith, because a working faith.
 Note, Wherever there is a true faith, it will work: it will have an 
 influence upon heart and life; it will put us upon working for God and 
 for our own salvation. We have comfort in our own faith and the faith 
 of others when we perceive the work of faith. <I>Show me thy faith by
 thy works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:18">Jam. ii. 18</A>.

 (2.) Their love and labour of love. Love is one of the cardinal graces; 
 it is of great use to us in this life and will remain and be perfected 
 in the life to come. <I>Faith works by love;</I> it shows itself in the 
 exercise of love to God and love to our neighbour; as love will show 
 itself by labour, it will put us upon taking pains in religion. 

 (3.) Their hope and the patience of hope. <I>We are saved by hope.</I>
 This grace is compared to the soldier's helmet and sailor's anchor, and 
 is of great use in times of danger. Wherever there is a well-grounded
 hope of eternal life, it will appear by the exercise of patience; in a 
 patient bearing of the calamities of the present time and a patient 
 waiting for the glory to be revealed. <I>For, if we hope for that we
 see not, then do we with patience wait for it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:25">Rom. viii. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The apostle not only mentions these three cardinal graces, faith, 
 hope and love, but also takes notice, 

 (1.) Of the object and efficient cause of these graces, namely, our 
 Lord Jesus Christ. 

 (2.) Of the sincerity of them: being in the <I>sight of God even our 
 Father.</I> The great motive to sincerity is the apprehension of God's 
 eye as always upon us; and it is a sign of sincerity when in all we do 
 we endeavour to approve ourselves to God, and that is right which is so 
 in the sight of God. Then is the work of faith, or labour of love, or 
 patience of hope, sincere, when it is done under the eye of God. 

 (3.) He mentions the fountain whence these graces flow, namely, God's 
 electing love: <I>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Thus he runs up these streams to the fountain, and that was God's 
 eternal election. Some by their election of God would understand only 
 the temporary separation of the Thessalonians from the unbelieving Jews 
 and Gentiles in their conversion; but this was according to the 
 <I>eternal purpose of him who worketh all things according to the 
 counsel of his own will,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:11">Eph. i. 11</A>.

 Speaking of their election, he calls them, <I>brethren beloved;</I> for
 the original of the brotherhood that is between Christians and the 
 relation wherein they stand one to another is election. And it is a 
 good reason why we should <I>love one another,</I> because we are all 
 beloved of God, and were beloved of him in his counsels when there was 
 not any thing in us to merit his love. The election of these
 Thessalonians was known to the apostles, and therefore might be known 
 to themselves, and that by the fruits and effects thereof--their 
 sincere faith, and hope, and love, by the successful preaching of the 
 gospel among them. Observe,

 [1.] All those who in the fulness of time are effectually called and 
 sanctified were from eternity elected and chosen to salvation.

 [2.] The election of God is of his own good pleasure and mere grace, 
 not for the sake of any merit in those who are chosen.

 [3.] The election of God may be known by the fruits thereof.

 [4.] Whenever we are giving thanks to God for his grace either to 
 ourselves or others, we should run up the streams to the fountain, and 
 give thanks to God for his electing love, by which we are made to 
 differ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Another ground or reason of the apostle's thanksgiving is the 
 success of his ministry among them. He was thankful on his own account 
 as well as theirs, that he had not laboured in vain. He had the seal 
 and evidence of his apostleship hereby, and great encouragement in his 
 labours and sufferings. Their ready acceptance and entertainment of the 
 gospel he preached to them were an evidence of their being elected and 
 beloved of God. It was in this way that he knew their election. It is 
 true he had been in the third heavens; but he had not searched the 
 records of eternity, and found their election there, but knew this by 
 the success of the gospel among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and he takes notice with thankfulness, 

 (1.) That the gospel came to them also not in word only, but in power; 
 they not only heard the sound of it, but submitted to the power of it. 
 It did not merely tickle the ear and please the fancy, not merely fill 
 their heads with notions and amuse their minds for awhile, but it 
 affected their hearts: a divine power went along with it for convincing 
 their consciences and amending their lives. Note, By this we may know 
 our election, if we not only speak of the things of God by rote as 
 parrots, but feel the influence of these things in our hearts, 
 mortifying our lusts, weaning us from the world, and raising us up to 
 heavenly things. 

 (2.) It came in the Holy Ghost, that is, with the powerful energy of 
 the divine Spirit. Note, Wherever the gospel comes in power, it is to
 be attributed to the operation of the Holy Ghost; and unless the Spirit 
 of God accompany the word of God, to render it effectual by his power, 
 it will be to us but as a dead letter; and the letter killeth, it is 
 the Spirit that giveth life. 

 (3.) The gospel came to them in much assurance. Thus did they entertain 
 it by the power of the Holy Ghost. They were fully convinced of the
 truth of it, so as not to be easily shaken in mind by objections and 
 doubts; they were willing to leave all for Christ, and to venture their 
 souls and everlasting condition upon the verity of the gospel 
 revelation. The word was not to them, like the sentiments of some 
 philosophers about matters of opinion and doubtful speculation, but the 
 object of their faith and assurance. Their <I>faith was the evidence
 of things not seen;</I> and the Thessalonians thus knew what manner of 
 men the apostle and his fellow-labourers were among them, and what they 
 did for their sake, and with what good success.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having
 received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:
 &nbsp; 7  So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia
 and Achaia.
 &nbsp; 8  For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in
 Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to
 God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any
 thing.
 &nbsp; 9  For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we
 had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the
 living and true God;
 &nbsp; 10  And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the
 dead, <I>even</I> Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these words we have the evidence of the apostle's success among the
 Thessalonians, which was notorious and famous in several places.
 For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They were careful in their holy conversation to imitate the good 
 examples of the apostles and ministers of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 As the apostle took care to demean himself well, not only for his own 
 credit's sake, but for the benefit of others, by a conversation 
 suitable to his doctrine, that he might not pull down with one hand 
 what he built up with the other, so the Thessalonians, who observed 
 what manner of men they were among them, how their preaching and living 
 were all of a piece, showed a conscientious care to be followers of 
 them, or to imitate their good example. Herein they became also 
 followers of the Lord, who is the perfect example we must strive to 
 imitate; and we should be followers of others no further than they are 
 followers of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:1">1 Co. xi. 1</A>.

 The Thessalonians acted thus, notwithstanding their affliction, that
 much affliction which the apostles and themselves also were exposed to. 
 They were willing to share in the sufferings that attended the 
 embracing and professing of Christianity. They entertained the gospel,
 notwithstanding the troubles and hardships which attended the preachers 
 and professors of it too. Perhaps this made the word more precious, 
 being dear--bought; and the examples of the apostles shone very bright 
 under their afflictions; so that the Thessalonians embraced the word 
 cheerfully, and followed the example of the suffering apostles 
 joyfully, <I>with joy in the Holy Ghost</I>--such solid and spiritual 
 and lasting joy as the Holy Ghost is the author of, who, when our 
 afflictions abound, makes our consolations much more to abound.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their zeal prevailed to such a degree that they were themselves 
 examples to all about them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their example was very effectual to make good impressions upon many 
 others. They were <B><I>typoi</I></B>--<I>stamps,</I> or instruments to
 make impression with. They had themselves received good impressions 
 from the preaching and conversation of the apostles, and they made good 
 impressions, and their conversation had an influence upon others. Note, 
 Christians should be so good as by their example to influence 
 others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was very extensive, and reached beyond the confines of 
 Thessalonica, even to the believers of all Macedonia, and further, in 
 Achaia; the Philippians, and others who received the gospel before the 
 Thessalonians, were edified by their example. Note, Some who were last
 hired into the vineyard may sometimes outstrip those who come in before 
 them, and become examples to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It was very famous. The word of the Lord, or its wonderful effects 
 upon the Thessalonians, sounded, or was famous and well known, in the 
 regions round about that city, and <I>in every place;</I> not strictly 
 every where, but here and there, up and down in the world: so that, 
 from the good success of the gospel among them, many others were 
 encouraged to entertain it, and to be willing, when called, to suffer 
 for it. Their faith was spread abroad. 

 (1.) The readiness of their faith was famed abroad. These
 Thessalonians embraced the gospel as soon as it was preached to them; 
 so that every body took notice what manner of entering in among them 
 the apostles had, that there were no such delays as at Philippi, where 
 it was a great while before much good was done. 

 (2.) The effects of their faith were famous. 

 [1.] They quitted their idolatry; they turned from their idols, and 
 abandoned all the false worship they had been educated in.

 [2.] They gave themselves up to God, to the living and true God, and 
 devoted themselves to his service.

 [3.] They set themselves to wait for the Son of God from heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 And this is one of the peculiarities of our holy religion, to wait for 
 Christ's second coming, as those who believe he will come and hope he 
 will come to our joy. The believers under the Old Testament waited for 
 the coming of the Messiah, and believers now wait for his second 
 coming; he is yet to come. And there is good reason to believe he will 
 come, because God has raised him from the dead, which is full assurance 
 unto all men that he will come to judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:31">Acts xvii. 31</A>.

 And there is good reason to hope and wait for his coming, because he
 has delivered us from the wrath to come. He came to purchase salvation, 
 and will, when he comes again, bring salvation with him, full and final 
 deliverance from sin, and death, and hell, from that wrath which is yet 
 to come upon unbelievers, and which, when it has once come, will be yet 
 to come, because it is <I>everlasting fire</I> prepared for the devil 
 and his angels,
