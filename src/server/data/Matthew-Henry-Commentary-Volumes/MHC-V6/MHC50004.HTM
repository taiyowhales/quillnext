 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy
 and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, <I>my</I> dearly beloved.
 &nbsp; 2  I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the
 same mind in the Lord.
 &nbsp; 3  And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women
 which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and
 <I>with</I> other my fellowlabourers, whose names <I>are</I> in the book of
 life.
 &nbsp; 4  Rejoice in the Lord alway: <I>and</I> again I say, Rejoice.
 &nbsp; 5  Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord <I>is</I> at
 hand.
 &nbsp; 6  Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
 supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known
 unto God.
 &nbsp; 7  And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall
 keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
 &nbsp; 8  Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
 things <I>are</I> honest, whatsoever things <I>are</I> just, whatsoever
 things <I>are</I> pure, whatsoever things <I>are</I> lovely, whatsoever
 things <I>are</I> of good report; if <I>there be</I> any virtue, and if
 <I>there be</I> any praise, think on these things.
 &nbsp; 9  Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and
 heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with
 you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle begins the chapter with exhortations to divers Christian 
 duties.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To stedfastness in our Christian profession, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It is inferred from the close of the foregoing chapter: <I>Therefore 
 stand fast,</I> &c. Seeing our <I>conversation is in heaven,</I> and we 
 look for the Saviour to come thence and fetch us thither, <I>therefore 
 let us stand fast.</I> Note, The believing hope and prospect of eternal 
 life should engage us to be steady, even, and constant, in our 
 Christian course. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The compellations are very endearing: <I>My brethren, dearly beloved 
 and longed for, my joy and crown;</I> and again, <I>My dearly 
 beloved.</I> Thus he expresses the pleasure he took in them, the 
 kindness he had for them, to convey his exhortations to them with so 
 much the greater advantage. He looked upon them as his brethren, though 
 he was a great apostle. <I>All we are brethren.</I> There is difference 
 of gifts, graces, and attainments, yet, being renewed by the same 
 Spirit, after the same image, we are brethren; as the children of the 
 same parents, though of different ages, statures, and complexions. 
 Being brethren, 

 (1.) He loved them, and loved them dearly: <I>Dearly beloved;</I> and 
 again, <I>My dearly beloved.</I> Warm affections become ministers and 
 Christians towards one another. Brotherly love must always go along 
 with brotherly relation. 

 (2.) He loved them and longed for them, longed to see them and hear 
 from them, longed for their welfare and was earnestly desirous of it. 
 <I>I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:8"><I>ch.</I> i. 8</A>.

 (3.) He loved them and rejoiced in them. They were his joy; he had no
 greater joy than to hear of their spiritual health and prosperity. <I>I
 rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in the truth,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:4,3Jo+1:4">
 2 John 4; 3 John 4</A>.

 (4.) he loved them and gloried in them. They were his crown as well as
 his joy. Never was proud ambitious man more pleased with the ensigns of 
 honour than Paul was with the evidences of the sincerity of their faith 
 and obedience. All this is to prepare his way to greater regard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The exhortation itself: <I>So stand fast in the Lord.</I> Being in 
 Christ, they must stand fast in him, be even and steady in their walk 
 with him, and close and constant unto the end. Or, To <I>stand fast in 
 the Lord</I> is to stand fast in his strength and by his grace; not 
 trusting in ourselves, and disclaiming any sufficiency of our own. We 
 must be <I>strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:10">Eph. vi. 10</A>.

 "So stand fast, so as you have done hitherto, stand fast unto the end, 
 so as you are by beloved, and my joy and crown; so stand fast as those 
 in whose welfare and perseverance I am so nearly interested and 
 concerned."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He exhorts them to unanimity and mutual assistance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>):

 <I>I beseech Euodias and Syntyche that they be of the same mind in the 
 Lord.</I> This is directed to some particular persons. Sometimes there 
 is need of applying the general precepts of the gospel to particular 
 persons and cases. Euodias and Syntyche, it seems, were at variance, 
 either one with the other or with the church; either upon a civil 
 account (it may be they were engaged in a law-suit) or upon a religious 
 account--it may be they were of different opinions and sentiments.
 "Pray," says he, "desire them from me to be of the same mind in the 
 Lord, to keep the peace and live in love, to be of the same mind one 
 with another, not thwarting and contradicting, and to be of the same 
 mind with the rest of the church, not acting in opposition to them." 
 Then he exhorts to mutual assistance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and this exhortation he directs to particular persons: <I>I entreat 
 thee also, true yoke-fellow.</I> Who this person was whom he calls true 
 yoke-fellow is uncertain. Some think Epaphroditus, who is supposed to 
 have been one of the pastors of the church of the Philippians. Others 
 think it was some eminently good woman, perhaps Paul's wife, because he 
 exhorts his yoke-fellow to <I>help the women who laboured with him.</I> 
 Whoever was the yoke-fellow with the apostle must be a yoke-fellow too 
 with his friends. It seems, there were women who laboured with Paul in 
 the gospel; not in the public ministry (for the apostle expressly 
 forbids that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:12">1 Tim. ii. 12</A>,

 <I>I suffer not a woman to teach</I>), but by entertaining the 
 ministers, visiting the sick, instructing the ignorant, convincing the 
 erroneous. Thus women may be helpful to ministers in the work of the 
 gospel. Now, says the apostle, <I>do thou help them.</I> Those who help 
 others should be helped themselves when there is occasion. "<I>Help 
 them,</I> that is, join with them, strengthen their hands, encourage 
 them in their difficulties."--<I>With Clement also, and other my 
 fellow-labourers.</I> Paul had a kindness for all his fellow-labourers; 
 and, as he had found the benefit of their assistance, he concluded how 
 comfortable it would be to them to have the assistance of others. Of 
 his fellow-labourers he says, <I>Whose names are in the book of 
 life;</I> either they were chosen of God from all eternity, or 
 registered and enrolled in the corporation and society to which the 
 privilege of eternal life belongs, alluding to the custom among the 
 Jews and Gentiles of registering the inhabitants or the freemen of the 
 city. So we read of their <I>names being written in heaven</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:20">Luke x. 20</A>),

 <I>not blotting his name out of the book of life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:5">Rev. iii. 5</A>),

 and of <I>those who are written in the Lamb's book of life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:27">Rev. xxi. 27</A>.

 Observe, There is a book of life; there are names in that book and not
 characters and conditions only. We cannot search into that book, or 
 know whose names are written there; but we may, in a judgment of 
 charity, conclude that those who labour in the gospel, and are faithful 
 to the interest of Christ and souls, have their names in the book of 
 life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He exhorts to holy joy and delight in God: <I>Rejoice in the Lord 
 always, and again I say, Rejoice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 All our joy must terminate in God; and our thoughts of God must be 
 delightful thoughts. <I>Delight thyself in the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:4">Ps. xxxvii. 4</A>),

 <I>in the multitude of our thoughts within us</I> (grievous and
 afflicting thoughts) <I>his comforts delight our souls</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:19">Ps. xciv. 19</A>),
 
 and our <I>meditation of him is sweet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:34">Ps. civ. 34</A>.

 Observe, It is our duty and privilege to rejoice in God, and to rejoice 
 in him always; at all times, in all conditions; even when we suffer for 
 him, or are afflicted by him. We must not think the worse of him or of 
 his ways for the hardships we meet with in his service. There is enough 
 in God to furnish us with matter of joy in the worst circumstance on 
 earth. He had said it before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1</A>):
 
 <I>Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord.</I> Here he says it
 again, <I>Rejoice in the Lord always; and again I say Rejoice.</I> Joy 
 in God is a duty of great consequence in the Christian life; and 
 Christians need to be again and again called to it. If good men have 
 not a continual feast, it is their own fault.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We are here exhorted to candour and gentleness, and good temper 
 towards our brethren: "<I>Let your moderation be known to all men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 In things indifferent do not run into extremes; avoid bigotry and 
 animosity; judge charitably concerning one another." The word <B><I>to 
 epieikes</I></B> signifies a good disposition towards other men; and 
 this moderation is explained,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:1-23">Rom. xiv</A>.

 Some understand it of the patient bearing of afflictions, or the sober
 enjoyment of worldly good; and so it well agrees with the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:6">following verse</A>.

 The reason is, <I>the Lord is at hand.</I> The consideration of our
 Master's approach, and our final account, should keep us from smiting 
 our fellow-servants, support us under present sufferings, and moderate 
 our affections to outward good. "He will take vengeance on your 
 enemies, and reward your patience."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is a caution against disquieting perplexing care 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Be careful for nothing</I>--<B><I>meden merimnate</I></B>: the same 
 expression with that

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25">Matt. vi. 25</A>,

 <I>Take no thought for your life;</I> that is, avoid anxious care and
 distracting thought in the wants and difficulties of life. Observe, It 
 is the duty and interest of Christians to live without care. There is a 
 care of diligence which is our duty, and consists in a wise forecast 
 and due concern; but there is a care of diffidence and distrust which 
 is our sin and folly, and which only perplexes and distracts the mind. 
 "<I>Be careful for nothing,</I> so as by your care to distrust God, and 
 unfit yourselves for his service."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. As a sovereign antidote against perplexing care he recommends to us 
 constant prayer: <I>In every thing by prayer and supplication, with 
 thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.</I> Observe, 

 1. We must not only keep up stated times for prayer, but we must pray
 upon every particular emergency: <I>In every thing by prayer.</I> When
 any thing burdens our spirits, we must ease our minds by prayer; when
 our affairs are perplexed or distressed, we must seek direction and
 support. 

 2. We must join thanksgiving with our prayers and supplications. We
 must not only seek supplies of good, but own receipts of mercy. 
 Grateful acknowledgments of what we have argue a right disposition of 
 mind, and are prevailing motives for further blessings.

 3. Prayer is the offering up of our desires to God, or making them
 known to him: <I>Let your requests be made known to God.</I> Not that 
 God needs to be told either our wants or desires; for he knows them 
 better than we can tell him: but he will know them from us, and have us 
 show our regards and concern, express our value of the mercy and sense 
 of our dependence on him. 

 4. The effect of this will be the <I>peace of God keeping our
 hearts,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The <I>peace of God,</I> that is, the comfortable sense of our 
 reconciliation to God and interest in his favour, and the hope of the 
 heavenly blessedness, and enjoyment of God hereafter, <I>which passeth 
 all understanding,</I> is a greater good than can be sufficiently valued
 or duly expressed. <I>It has not entered into the heart of man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:9">1 Cor. ii. 9</A>.

 This peace will <I>keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus;</I>
 it will keep us from sinning under our troubles, and from sinking under
 them; keep us calm and sedate, without discomposure of passion, and
 with inward satisfaction. <I>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose
 mind is stayed on thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:3">Isa. xxvi. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. We are exhorted to get and keep a good name, a name for good 
 things with God and good men: <I>Whatsoever things are true and 
 honest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 a regard to truth in our words and engagements, and to decency and 
 becomingness in our behaviour, suitable to our circumstances and 
 condition of life. Whatsoever things are <I>just and 
 pure,</I>--agreeable to the rules of justice and righteousness in all 
 our dealings with men, and without the impurity or mixture of sin.
 Whatsoever things are <I>lovely and of good report,</I> that is, 
 amiable; that will render us beloved, and make us well spoken of, as 
 well as well thought of, by others. <I>If there is any virtue, if there 
 is any praise</I>--any thing really virtuous of any kind and worthy of 
 commendation. Observe,

 1. The apostle would have the Christians learn any thing which was good
 of their heathen neighbours: "<I>If there be any virtue, think of these 
 things</I>--imitate them in what is truly excellent among them, and let 
 not them outdo you in any instance of goodness." We should not be 
 ashamed to learn any good thing of bad men, or those who have not our 
 advantages. 

 2. Virtue has its praise, and will have. We should walk in all the ways
 of virtue, and abide therein; and then, whether our praise be of men or 
 no, it will be of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:29">Rom. ii. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these things he proposes himself to them for an example 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 <I>Those things which you have learned, and received, and heard and 
 seen in me, do.</I> Observe, Paul's doctrine and life were of a piece. 
 What they saw in him was the same thing with what they heard from him. 
 He could propose himself as well as his doctrine to their imitation. It 
 gives a great force to what we say to others when we can appeal to what 
 they have seen in us. And this is the way to have the <I>God of peace 
 with us</I>--to keep close to our duty to him. The <I>Lord is with us
 while we are with him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last
 your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also
 careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
 &nbsp; 11  Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
 whatsoever state I am, <I>therewith</I> to be content.
 &nbsp; 12  I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound:
 every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and
 to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
 &nbsp; 13  I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
 &nbsp; 14  Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate
 with my affliction.
 &nbsp; 15  Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the
 gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated
 with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
 &nbsp; 16  For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my
 necessity.
 &nbsp; 17  Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may
 abound to your account.
 &nbsp; 18  But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
 Epaphroditus the things <I>which were sent</I> from you, an odour of a
 sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
 &nbsp; 19  But my God shall supply all your need according to his
 riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have the thankful grateful acknowledgment which the 
 apostle makes of the kindness of the Philippians in sending him a 
 present for his support, now that he was a prisoner at Rome. And 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He takes occasion to acknowledge their former kindnesses to him, and 
 to make mention of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 Paul had a grateful spirit; for, though what his friends did for him 
 was nothing in comparison of what he deserved from them and the 
 obligations he had laid upon them, yet he speaks of their kindness as 
 if it had been a piece of generous charity, when it was really far 
 short of a just debt. If they had each of them contributed half their 
 estates to him, they had not given him too much, since they <I>owed to 
 him even their own souls;</I> and yet, when they send a small present 
 to him, how kindly does he take it, how thankfully does he mention it, 
 even in this epistle which was to be left upon record, and read in the 
 churches, through all ages; so that wherever this epistle shall be read 
 there shall this which they did to Paul be told for a memorial of them. 
 Surely never was present so well repaid. He reminds them that <I>in
 the beginning of the gospel no church communicated with him as to 
 giving and receiving but they only,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 They not only maintained him comfortably while he was with them, but 
 when <I>he departed from Macedonia</I> they sent tokens of their 
 kindness after him; and this when no other church did so. None besides 
 sent after him of their carnal things, in consideration of what they 
 had reaped of his spiritual things. In works of charity, we are ready 
 to ask what other people do. But the church of the Philippians never 
 considered that. It redounded so much the more to their honour that 
 they were the only church who were thus just and generous. <I>Even in 
 Thessalonica</I> (after he had departed from Macedonia) <I>you sent 
 once and again to my necessity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. It was but little which they sent; they sent only to his necessity, 
 just such things as he had need of; perhaps it was according to their 
 ability, and he did not desire superfluities nor dainties. 

 2. It is an excellent thing to see those to whom God has abounded in
 the gifts of his grace abounding in grateful returns to his people and 
 ministers, according to their own ability and their necessity: <I>You 
 sent once and again.</I> Many people make it an excuse for their 
 charity that they have given once; why should the charge come upon them 
 again? But the Philippians sent once and again; they often relieved and 
 refreshed him in his necessities. He makes this mention of their former 
 kindness, not only out of gratitude, but for their encouragement.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He excuses their neglect of late. It seems, for some time they had 
 not sent to enquire after him, or sent him any present; but <I>now at 
 the last their care of him flourished again</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 like a tree in the spring, which seemed all the winter to be quite 
 dead. Now, in conformity to the example of his great Master, instead of 
 upbraiding them for their neglect, he makes an excuse for them: 
 <I>Wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.</I> How 
 could they lack opportunity, if they had been resolved upon it? They 
 might have sent a messenger on purpose. But the apostle is willing to 
 suppose, in favour of them, that they would have done it if a fair 
 opportunity had offered. How contrary is this to the behaviour of many 
 to their friends, by whom neglects which really are excusable are 
 resented very heinously, when Paul excused that which he had reason 
 enough to resent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He commends their present liberality: <I>Notwithstanding, you have
 well done that you did communicate with my affliction,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. Here 
 see what is the nature of true Christian sympathy; not only to be 
 concerned for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to 
 help them. They <I>communicated with his affliction,</I> in relieving
 him under it. He who says, <I>Be you warmed, be you filled, and giveth 
 not those things they have need of, what doth it profit?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:16">Jam. ii. 16</A>.
 
 He rejoiced greatly in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 because it was an evidence of their affection to him and the success of 
 his ministry among them. When the fruit of their charity abounded 
 towards the apostle, it appeared that the fruit of his ministry 
 abounded among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He takes care to obviate the bad use some might make of his taking 
 so much notice of what was sent him. It did not proceed either from 
 discontent and distrust 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 or from covetousness and love of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 1. It did not come from discontent, or distrust of Providence: <I>Not 
 that I speak in respect of want</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 not in respect of any want he felt, nor of any want he feared. As to 
 the former, he was content with the little he had, and that satisfied 
 him; as to the latter, he depended upon the providence of God to 
 provide for him from day to day, and that satisfied him: so that he did 
 not speak in respect of want any way. <I>For I have learned, in
 whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.</I> We have here an 
 account of Paul's learning, not that which he got at the feet of 
 Gamaliel, but that which he got at the feet of Christ. He had learnt to 
 be content; and that was the lesson he had as much need to learn as 
 most men, considering the hardships and sufferings with which he was 
 exercised. He was in bonds, and imprisonments, and necessities, often; 
 but in all he had learnt to be content, that is, to bring his mind to 
 his condition, and make the best of it.--<I>I know both how to be 
 abased and I know how to abound,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This is a special act of grace, to accommodate ourselves to every 
 condition of life, and carry an equal temper of mind through all the 
 varieties of our state.

 (1.) To accommodate ourselves to an afflicted condition--to know how to 
 be abased, how to be hungry, how to suffer want, so as not to be 
 overcome by the temptations of it, either to lose our comfort in God or 
 distrust his providence, or to take any indirect course for our own 
 supply. 

 (2.) To a prosperous condition--to know how to abound, how to be full, 
 so as not to be proud, or secure, or luxurious. And this is as hard a 
 lesson as the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are 
 not less than those of affliction and want. But how must we learn it? 
 <I>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 We have need of strength from Christ, to enable us to perform not only 
 those duties which are purely Christian, but even those which are the 
 fruit of moral virtue. We need his strength to teach us to be content
 in every condition. The apostle had seemed to boast of himself, and of
 his own strength: <I>I know how to be abased</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 but here he transfers all the praise to Christ. "What do I talk of
 <I>knowing how to be abased, and how to abound?</I> It is only 
 <I>through Christ who strengthens me</I> that I can do it, not in my 
 own strength." So we are required to be <I>strong in the Lord, and in 
 the power of his might</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:10">Eph. vi. 10</A>),

 and to be <I>strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:1">2 Tim. ii. 1</A>);

 and we are <I>strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner
 man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:16">Eph. iii. 16</A>.

 The word in the original is a participle of the present tense, <B><I>en 
 to endynamounti me Christo,</I></B> and denotes a present and continued 
 act; as if he had said, "Through Christ, who is strengthening me, and 
 does continually strengthen me; it is by his constant and renewed 
 strength I am enabled to act in every thing; I wholly depend upon him 
 for all my spiritual power." 

 2. It did not come from covetousness, or an affection to worldly
 wealth: "<I>Not because I desired a gift</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 that is, I welcome your kindness, not because it adds to my enjoyments, 
 but because it adds to your account." He desired not so much for his 
 own sake, but theirs: <I>"I desire fruit that may abound to your 
 account,</I> that is, that you may be enabled to make such a good use 
 of your worldly possessions that you may give an account of them with 
 joy." It is not with any design to draw more from you, but to encourage 
 you to such an exercise of beneficence as will meet with a glorious 
 reward hereafter. "For my part," says he, "<I>I have all, and 
 abound,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 What can a man desire more than enough? I do not desire a gift for the 
 gift's sake, for <I>I have all, and abound.</I>" They sent him a small 
 token, and he desired no more; he was not solicitous for a present 
 superfluity, or a future supply: <I>I am full, having received from 
 Epaphroditus the things which were sent by you.</I> Note, A good man 
 will soon have enough of this world; not only of living in it, but of 
 receiving from it. A covetous worldling, if he has ever so much, would 
 still have more; but a heavenly Christian, though he has little, has 
 enough.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The apostle assures them that God did accept, and would recompense, 
 their kindness to him. 

 1. He did accept it: <I>It is an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice
 acceptable, well-pleasing to God.</I> Not a sacrifice of atonement, for 
 none makes atonement for sin but Christ; but a sacrifice of 
 acknowledgment, and <I>well-pleasing to God.</I> It was more acceptable 
 to God as it was the fruit of their grace than it was to Paul as it was 
 the supply of his want. <I>With such sacrifices God is well 
 pleased,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:16">Heb. xiii. 16</A>.

 2. He would recompense it: <I>But my God shall supply all your wants 
 according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He does as it were draw a bill upon the exchequer in heaven, and leaves 
 it to God to make them amends for the kindness they had shown him. "He 
 shall do it, not only as your God, but as my God, who takes what is 
 done to me as done to himself. You supplied my needs, according to your 
 poverty; and he shall supply yours, according to his riches." But still 
 it is by Christ Jesus; through him we have grace to do that which is 
 good, and through him we must expect the reward of it. Not of debt, but 
 of grace; for the more we do for God the more we are indebted to him, 
 because we receive the more from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle concludes the epistle in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. With praises to God: <I>Now unto God and our Father be glory for 
 ever and ever, Amen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Observe,

 (1.) God is to be considered by us as our Father: <I>Now unto God and 
 our Father.</I> It is a great condescension and favour in God to own 
 the relation of Father to sinners, and allow us to say to him, <I>Our 
 Father;</I> and it is a title peculiar to the gospel dispensation. It 
 is also a great privilege and encouragement to us to consider him as 
 our Father, as one so nearly related and who bears so tender an 
 affection towards us. We should look upon God, under all our weaknesses 
 and fears, not as a tyrant or an enemy, but as a Father, who is 
 disposed to pity us and help us. 

 (2.) We must ascribe glory to God as a Father, the glory of his own 
 excellence and of all his mercy unto us. We must thankfully own the
 receipt of all from him, and give the praise of all to him. And our 
 praise must be constant and perpetual; it must be <I>glory for ever and 
 ever.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. With salutations to his friends at Philippi: "<I>Salute every saint 
 in Christ Jesus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 give my hearty love to all the Christians in your parts." He desires 
 remembrances not only to the bishops and deacons, and the church in 
 general, but to every particular saint. Paul had a kind affection to 
 all good Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He sends salutations from those who were at Rome: "<I>The brethren 
 who are with me salute you;</I> the <I>ministers,</I> and all the 
 saints here, send their affectionate remembrances to you. <I>Chiefly 
 those who are of C&aelig;sar's household;</I> the Christian converts who
 belonged to the emperor's court." Observe, 

 (1.) There were saints in C&aelig;sar's household. Though Paul was 
 imprisoned at Rome, for preaching the gospel, by the emperor's command, 
 yet there were some Christians in his own family. The gospel early 
 obtained among some of the rich and great. Perhaps the apostle fared 
 the better, and received some favour, by means of his friends at court. 
 
 (2.) <I>Chiefly those,</I> &c. Observe, They, being bred at court,
 were more complaisant than the rest. See what an ornament to religion 
 sanctified civility is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The apostolical benediction, as usual: "<I>The grace of our Lord 
 Jesus Christ be with you all, Amen.</I> The free favour and good will 
 of Christ be your portion and happiness."</P>
