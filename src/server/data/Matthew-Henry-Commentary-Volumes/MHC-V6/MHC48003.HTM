 The apostle in this chapter, 

 I. Reproves the Galatians for their folly, in suffering themselves to
 be drawn away from the faith of the gospel, and endeavours, from
 several considerations, to impress them with a sense of it. 

 II. He proves the doctrine which he had reproved them for departing
 from--that of justification by faith without the works of the law, 
 
 1. From the example of Abraham's justification. 
 
 2. From the nature and tenour of the law. 
 
 3. From the express testimony of the Old Testament; and, 
 
 4. From the stability of the covenant of God with Abraham. Lest
 any should hereupon say, "Wherefore then serveth the law?" he answers,

 (1.) It was added because of transgressions. 

 (2.) It was given to convince the world of the necessity of a Saviour. 
 
 (3.) It was designed as a schoolmaster, to bring us to Christ. And then 
 he concludes the chapter by acquainting us with the privilege of 
 Christians under the gospel state.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should
 not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
 evidently set forth, crucified among you?
 &nbsp; 2  This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the
 works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
 &nbsp; 3  Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now
 made perfect by the flesh?
 &nbsp; 4  Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if <I>it be</I> yet in
 vain.
 &nbsp; 5  He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
 miracles among you, <I>doeth he it</I> by the works of the law, or by
 the hearing of faith?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle is here dealing with those who, having embraced the faith 
 of Christ, still continued to seek for justification by the works of 
 the law; that is, who depended upon their own obedience to the moral 
 precepts as their righteousness before God, and, wherein that was 
 defective, had recourse to the legal sacrifices and purifications to 
 make it up. These he first sharply reproves, and then endeavours, by 
 the evidence of truth, to convince them. This is the right method, when 
 we reprove any for a fault or an error, to convince them that it is an 
 error, that it is a fault.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He reproves them, and the reproof is very close and warm: he calls them 
 <I>foolish Galatians,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Though as Christians they were Wisdom's children, yet as corrupt 
 Christians they were foolish children. Yea, he asks, <I>Who hath 
 bewitched you?</I> whereby he represents them as enchanted by the arts 
 and snares of their seducing teachers, and so far deluded as to act 
 very unlike themselves. That wherein their folly and infatuation 
 appeared was that <I>they did not obey the truth;</I> that is, they did 
 not adhere to the gospel way of justification, wherein they had been 
 taught, and which they had professed to embrace. Note, It is not enough 
 to know the truth, and to say we believe it, but we must obey it too; 
 we must heartily submit to it, and stedfastly abide by it. Note, also,
 Those are spiritually bewitched who, when the truth as it is in Jesus 
 is plainly set before them, will not thus obey it. Several things 
 proved and aggravated the folly of these Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Jesus Christ had been evidently set forth as crucified among 
 them;</I> that is, they had had the doctrine of the cross preached to 
 them, and the sacrament of the Lord's supper administered among them, 
 in both which Christ crucified had been set before them. Now, it was 
 the greatest madness that could be for those who had acquaintance with 
 such sacred mysteries, and admittance to such great solemnities, not to 
 obey the truth which was thus published to them, and signed and sealed 
 in that ordinance. Note, The consideration of the honours and 
 privileges we have been admitted to as Christians should shame us out 
 of the folly of apostasy and backsliding.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He appeals to the experiences they had had of the working of the 
 Spirit upon their souls 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 he puts them in mind that, upon their becoming Christians, <I>they had 
 received the Spirit,</I> that many of them at least had been made 
 partakers not only of the sanctifying influences, but of the miraculous 
 gifts, of the Holy Spirit, which were eminent proofs of the truth of 
 the Christian religion and the several doctrines of it, and especially 
 of this, that justification is by Christ only, and not by the works of 
 the law, which was one of the peculiar and fundamental principles of 
 it. To convince them of the folly of their departing from this 
 doctrine, he desires to know how they came by these gifts and graces: 
 Was it <I>by the works of the law,</I> that is, the preaching of the 
 necessity of these in order to justification? This they could not say, 
 for that doctrine had not then been preached to them, nor had they, as 
 Gentiles, any pretence to justification in that way. Or was it by the 
 <I>hearing of faith,</I> that is, the preaching of the doctrine of 
 faith in Christ as the only way of justification? This, if they would 
 say the truth, they were obliged to own, and therefore must be very 
 unreasonable if they should reject a doctrine of the good effects of 
 which they had had such experience. Note, 

 (1.) It is usually by the ministry of the gospel that the Spirit is 
 communicated to persons. And, 

 (2.) Those are very unwise who suffer themselves to be turned away from 
 the ministry and doctrine which have been blessed to their spiritual 
 advantage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He calls upon them to consider their past and present conduct, and 
 thence to judge whether they were not acting very weakly and 
 unreasonably 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>):

 he tells them that <I>they had begun in the Spirit,</I> but now were 
 seeking <I>to be made perfect by the flesh;</I> they had embraced the 
 doctrine of the gospel, by means of which they had received the Spirit, 
 and wherein only the true way of justification is revealed. And thus 
 they had begun well; but now they were turning to the law, and expected 
 to be advanced to higher degrees of perfection by adding the observance 
 of it to faith in Christ, in order to their justification, which could 
 end in nothing but their shame and disappointment: for this, instead of 
 being an improvement upon the gospel, was really a perversion of it; 
 and, while they sought to be justified in this way, they were so far 
 from being more perfect Christians that they were more in danger of 
 becoming no Christians at all; hereby they were pulling down with one 
 hand what they had built with the other, and undoing what they had 
 hitherto done in Christianity. Yea, he further puts them in mind that 
 they had not only embraced the Christian doctrine, but suffered for it 
 too; and therefore their folly would be the more aggravated, if now 
 they should desert it: for in this case all that they had suffered 
 would be in vain--it would appear that they had been foolish in 
 suffering for what they now deserted, and their sufferings would be 
 altogether in vain, and of no advantage to them. Note, 

 (1.) It is the folly of apostates that they lose the benefit of all 
 they have done in religion, or suffered for it. And,

 (2.) It is very sad for any to live in an age of services and 
 sufferings, of sabbaths, sermons, and sacraments, in vain; in this case 
 former righteousness shall not be mentioned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He puts them in mind that they had had ministers among them (and 
 particularly himself) who came with a divine seal and commission; for 
 they had <I>ministered the Spirit to them, and wrought miracles among 
 them:</I> and he appeals to them whether they did it <I>by the works of 
 the law or by the hearing of faith,</I> whether the doctrine that was 
 preached by them, and confirmed by the miraculous gifts and operations 
 of the Spirit, was that of justification by the works of the law or by 
 the faith of Christ; they very well knew that it was not the former, 
 but the latter; and therefore must needs be inexcusable in forsaking a 
 doctrine which had been so signally owned and attested, and exchanging 
 it for one that had received no such attestations.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
 righteousness.
 &nbsp; 7  Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are
 the children of Abraham.
 &nbsp; 8  And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the
 heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham,
 <I>saying,</I> In thee shall all nations be blessed.
 &nbsp; 9  So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful
 Abraham.
 &nbsp; 10  For as many as are of the works of the law are under the
 curse: for it is written, Cursed <I>is</I> every one that continueth
 not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do
 them.
 &nbsp; 11  But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God,
 <I>it is</I> evident: for, The just shall live by faith.
 &nbsp; 12  And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them
 shall live in them.
 &nbsp; 13  Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being
 made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed <I>is</I> every one
 that hangeth on a tree:
 &nbsp; 14  That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
 through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the
 Spirit through faith.
 &nbsp; 15  Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though <I>it be</I>
 but a man's covenant, yet <I>if it be</I> confirmed, no man
 disannulleth, or addeth thereto.
 &nbsp; 16  Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith
 not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed,
 which is Christ.
 &nbsp; 17  And this I say, <I>that</I> the covenant, that was confirmed
 before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and
 thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the
 promise of none effect.
 &nbsp; 18  For if the inheritance <I>be</I> of the law, <I>it is</I> no more of
 promise: but God gave <I>it</I> to Abraham by promise.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle having reproved the Galatians for not obeying the truth, 
 and endeavoured to impress them with a sense of their folly herein, in 
 these verses he largely proves the doctrine which he had reproved them 
 for rejecting, namely, that of justification by faith without the works 
 of the law. This he does several ways.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. From the example of Abraham's justification. This argument the 
 apostle uses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:1-25">Rom. iv</A>.

 <I>Abraham believed God, and that was accounted to him for
 righteousness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 that is, his faith fastened upon the word and promise of God, and upon 
 his believing he was owned and accepted of God as a righteous man: as 
 on this account he is represented as the father of the faithful, so the 
 apostle would have us to know <I>that those who are of faith are the 
 children of Abraham</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 not according to the flesh, but according to the promise; and, 
 consequently, that they are justified in the same way that he was.
 Abraham was justified by faith, and so are they. To confirm this, the 
 apostle acquaints us that the promise made to Abraham 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:3">Gen. xii. 3</A>),
 
 <I>In thee shall all nations be blessed,</I> had a reference hereunto, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The scripture is said to <I>foresee,</I> because he that indited the 
 scripture did foresee, that God would justify the heathen world in the 
 way of faith; and therefore in Abraham, that is, in the seed of 
 Abraham, which is Christ, not the Jews only, but the Gentiles also, 
 should be blessed; not only blessed in the seed of Abraham, but blessed 
 as Abraham was, being justified as he was. This the apostle calls 
 <I>preaching the gospel to Abraham;</I> and thence infers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 that <I>those who are of faith,</I> that is, true believers, of what 
 nation soever they are, <I>are blessed with faithful Abraham.</I> They 
 are blessed with Abraham the father of the faithful, by the promise 
 made to him, and therefore by faith as he was. It was through faith in
 the promise of God that he was blessed, and it is only in the same way 
 that others obtain this privilege.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows that we cannot be justified but by faith fastening on the 
 gospel, because the law condemns us. If we put ourselves upon trial in 
 that court, and stand to the sentence of it, we are certainly cast, and 
 lost, and undone; <I>for as many as are of the works of the law are 
 under the curse,</I> as many as depend upon the merit of their own 
 works as their righteousness, as plead not guilty, and insist upon 
 their own justification, the cause will certainly go against them; 
 <I>for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all 
 things which are written in the book of the law, to do them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:10,De+27:26"><I>v.</I> 10, 
 and Deut. xxvii. 26</A>.

 The condition of life, by the law, is perfect, personal, and perpetual, 
 obedience; the language of it is, <I>Do this and live;</I> or, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>,

 <I>The man that doeth them shall live in them:</I> and for every 
 failure herein the law denounces a curse. Unless our obedience be
 universal, continuing in all things that are written in the book of the 
 law, and unless it be perpetual too (if in any instance at any time we 
 fail and come short), we fall under the curse of the law. The curse is 
 wrath revealed, and ruin threatened: it is a separation unto all evil, 
 and this is in full force, power, and virtue, against all sinners, and 
 therefore against all men; for all have sinned and become guilty before 
 God: and if, as transgressors of the law, we are under the curse of it, 
 it must be a vain thing to look for justification by it. But, though 
 this is not to be expected from the law, yet the apostle afterwards 
 acquaints us that there is a way open to our escaping this curse, and 
 regaining the favour of God, namely, through faith in Christ, who (as 
 he says,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 <I>hath redeemed us from the curse of the law,</I> &c. A strange
 method it was which Christ took to redeem us from the curse of the law; 
 it was <I>by his being himself made a curse for us.</I> Being made sin 
 for us, he was made a curse for us; not separated from God, but laid 
 for the present under that infamous token of the divine displeasure 
 upon which the law of Moses had put a particular brand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:22">Deut. xxi. 22</A>.

 The design of this was <I>that the blessing of Abraham might come on
 the Gentiles through Jesus Christ</I>--that all who believed on Christ, 
 whether Jews or Gentiles, might become heirs of Abraham's blessing, and 
 particularly of that great promise of the Spirit, which was peculiarly 
 reserved for the times of the gospel. Hence it appeared that it was not 
 by putting themselves under the law, but by faith in Christ, that they 
 become the people of God and heirs of the promise. Here note,

 1. The misery which as sinners we are sunk into--we are under the
 curse and condemnation of the law. 

 2. The love and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ towards us--he has 
 submitted to be made a curse for us, that he might redeem us from the 
 curse of the law. 

 3. The happy prospect which we now have through him, not only of 
 escaping the curse, but of inheriting the blessing. And, 

 4. That it is only through faith in him that we can hope to obtain
 this favour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. To prove that justification is by faith, and not by the works of 
 the law, the apostle alleges the express testimony of the Old 
 Testament, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The place referred to is 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:4">Habak. ii. 4</A>,

 where it is said, <I>The just shall live by faith;</I> it is again 
 quoted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:17,Heb+10:38">Rom. i. 17, and Heb. x. 38</A>.

 The design of it is to show that those only are just or righteous who 
 do truly live, who are freed from death and wrath, and restored into a 
 state of life in the favour of God; and that it is only through faith 
 that persons become righteous, and as such obtain this life and 
 happiness--that they are accepted of God, and enabled to live to him 
 now, and are entitled to an eternal life in the enjoyment of him 
 hereafter. Hence the apostle says, <I>It is evident that no man is 
 justified by the law in the sight of God.</I> Whatever he may be in the 
 account of others, yet he is not so in the sight of God; for <I>the law 
 is not of faith</I>--that says nothing concerning faith in the business 
 of justification, nor does it give life to those who believe; but the 
 language of it is, <I>The man that doeth them shall live in them,</I> 
 as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:5">Lev. xviii. 5</A>.

 It requires perfect obedience as the condition of life, and therefore 
 now can by no means be the rule of our justification. This argument of 
 the apostle's may give us occasion to remark that justification by 
 faith is no new doctrine, but what was established and taught in the 
 church of God long before the times of the gospel. Yea, it is the only 
 way wherein any sinners ever were, or can be, justified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. To this purpose the apostle urges the stability of the covenant 
 which God made with Abraham, which was not vacated nor disannulled by 
 the giving of the law to Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,

 &c. Faith had the precedence of the law, for Abraham was justified by
 faith. It was a promise that he built upon, and promises are the proper 
 objects of faith. God entered into covenant with Abraham 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and this covenant was firm and steady; even men's covenants are so, and 
 therefore much more his. When a deed is executed, or articles of 
 agreement are sealed, both parties are bound, and it is too late then 
 to settle things otherwise; and therefore it is not to be supposed that 
 by the subsequent law the covenant of God should be vacated. The 
 original word <B><I>diatheke</I></B> signifies both a covenant and a 
 testament. Now the promise made to Abraham was rather a testament than 
 a covenant. When a testament has become of force by the death of the
 testator, it is not capable of being altered; and therefore, the 
 promise that was given to Abraham being of the nature of a testament, 
 it remains firm and unalterable. But, if it should be said that a grant 
 or testament may be defeated for want of persons to claim the benefit 
 of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 he shows that there is no danger of that in this case. Abraham is
 dead, and the prophets are dead, but the covenant is made with Abraham 
 and his seed. And he gives us a very surprising exposition of this. We 
 should have thought it had been meant only of the people of the Jews.
 "Nay," says the apostle, "it is in the singular number, and points at a 
 single person--<I>that seed is Christ,</I>" So that the covenant is 
 still in force; for Christ abideth for ever in his person, and in his 
 spiritual seed, who are his by faith. And if it be objected that the 
 law which was given by Moses did disannul this covenant, because that 
 insisted so much upon works, and there was so little in it of faith or 
 of the promised Messiah, he answers that the subsequent law could not 
 disannul the previous covenant or promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>If the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise; but,</I> 
 says he, <I>God gave it to Abraham by promise,</I> and therefore it 
 would be inconsistent with his holiness, wisdom, and faithfulness, by 
 any subsequent act to set aside the promise, and so alter the way of 
 justification which he had thus established. If the inheritance was 
 given to Abraham by promise, and thereby entailed upon his spiritual 
 seed, we may be sure that God would not retract that promise; for he is 
 not a man that he should repent.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Wherefore then <I>serveth</I> the law? It was added because of
 transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was
 made; <I>and it was</I> ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
 &nbsp; 20  Now a mediator is not <I>a mediator</I> of one, but God is one.
 &nbsp; 21  <I>Is</I> the law then against the promises of God? God forbid:
 for if there had been a law given which could have given life,
 verily righteousness should have been by the law.
 &nbsp; 22  But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the
 promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that
 believe.
 &nbsp; 23  But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up
 unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
 &nbsp; 24  Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster <I>to bring us</I> unto
 Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
 &nbsp; 25  But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
 schoolmaster.
 &nbsp; 26  For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
 &nbsp; 27  For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have
 put on Christ.
 &nbsp; 28  There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor
 free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in
 Christ Jesus.
 &nbsp; 29  And if ye <I>be</I> Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and
 heirs according to the promise.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle having just before been speaking of the promise made to 
 Abraham, and representing that as the rule of our justification, and 
 not the law, lest they should think he did too much derogate from the 
 law, and render it altogether useless, he thence takes occasion to 
 discourse of the design and tendency of it, and to acquaint us for what 
 purposes it was given. It might be asked, "If that promise be 
 sufficient for salvation, wherefore then serveth the law? Or, Why did 
 God give the law by Moses?" To this he answers,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The law <I>was added because of transgressions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 It was not designed to disannul the promise, and to establish a 
 different way of justification from that which was settled by the 
 promise; but <I>it was added</I> to it, annexed on purpose to be 
 subservient to it, and it was so <I>because of transgressions.</I> The 
 Israelites, though they were chosen to be God's peculiar people, were 
 sinners as well as others, and therefore the law was given to convince 
 them of their sin, and of their obnoxiousness to the divine displeasure 
 on the account of it; <I>for by the law is the knowledge of sin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:20">Rom. iii. 20</A>),
 
 and <I>the law entered that sin might abound,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:20">Rom. v. 20</A>.

 And it was also intended to restrain them from the commission of sin,
 to put an awe upon their minds, and be a curb upon their lusts, that 
 they should not run into that excess of riot to which they were 
 naturally inclined; and yet at the same time it was designed to direct 
 them to the true and only way whereby sin was to be expiated, and 
 wherein they might obtain the pardon of it; namely, through the death 
 and sacrifice of Christ, which was the special use for which the law of 
 sacrifices and purifications was given.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle adds that the law was given for this purpose <I>till the 
 seed should come to whom the promise was made;</I> that is, either till 
 Christ should come (the principle seed referred to in the promise, as 
 he had before shown), or till the gospel dispensation should take 
 place, when Jews and Gentiles, without distinction, should, upon 
 believing, become the seed of Abraham. The law was added because of 
 transgressions, till this fulness of time, or this complete 
 dispensation, should come. But when the seed came, and a fuller 
 discovery of divine grace in the promise was made, then the law, as 
 given by Moses, was to cease; that covenant, being found faulty, was to 
 give place to another, and a better, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:7,8">Heb. viii. 7, 8</A>.

 And though the law, considered as the law of nature, is always in
 force, and still continues to be of use to convince men of sin and to 
 restrain them from it, yet we are now no longer under the bondage and 
 terror of that legal covenant. The law then was not intended to 
 discover another way of justification, different from that revealed by 
 the promise, but only to lead men to see their need of the promise, by 
 showing them the sinfulness of sin, and to point them to Christ, 
 through whom alone they could be pardoned and justified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As a further proof that the law was not designed to vacate the promise, 
 the apostle adds, <I>It was ordained by angels in the hand of a 
 mediator.</I> It was given to different persons, and in a different 
 manner from the promise, and therefore for different purposes. The 
 promise was made to Abraham, and all his spiritual seed, including 
 believers of all nations, even of the Gentiles as well as the Jews; but 
 the law was given to the Israelites as a peculiar people, and separated 
 from the rest of the world. And, whereas the promise was given 
 immediately by God himself, the law was given <I>by the ministry of 
 angels, and the hand of a mediator.</I> Hence it appeared that the law 
 could not be designed to set aside the promise; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>A mediator is not a mediator of one,</I> of one party only; <I>but 
 God is one,</I> but one party in the promise or covenant made with 
 Abraham: and therefore it is not to be supposed that by a transaction 
 which passed only between him and the nation of the Jews he should make 
 void a promise which he had long before made to Abraham and all his 
 spiritual seed, whether Jews or Gentiles. This would not have been 
 consistent with his wisdom, nor with his truth and faithfulness. Moses 
 was only a mediator between God and the spiritual seed of Abraham; and 
 therefore the law that was given by him could not affect the promise 
 made to them, much less be subversive of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The law was given to convince men of the necessity of a Saviour. 
 The apostle asks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 as what some might be willing to object, "<I>Is the law then against 
 the promises of God?</I> Do they really clash and interfere with each 
 other? Or do you not set the covenant with Abraham, and the law of 
 Moses, at variance with one another?" To this he answers, <I>God 
 forbid;</I> he was far from entertaining such a thought, nor could it 
 be inferred from what he had said. The law is by no means inconsistent 
 with the promise, but subservient to it, as the design of it is to 
 discover men's transgressions, and to show them the need they have of a 
 better righteousness than that of the law. That consequence would much 
 rather follow from their doctrine than from his; <I>for, if there had 
 been a law given that could have given life, verily righteousness would 
 have been by the law,</I> and in that case the promise would have been 
 superseded and rendered useless. But that in our present state could 
 not be, <I>for the scripture hath concluded all under sin</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 or declared that all, both Jew and Gentile, are in a state of guilt, 
 and therefore unable to attain to righteousness and justification by 
 the works of the law. The law discovered their wounds, but could not 
 afford them a remedy: it showed that they were guilty, because it 
 appointed sacrifices and purifications, which were manifestly 
 insufficient to take away sin: and therefore the great design of it was 
 <I>that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to those 
 that believe,</I> that being convinced of their guilt, and the 
 insufficiency of the law to effect a righteousness for them, they might 
 be persuaded to believe on Christ, and so obtain the benefit of the 
 promise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The law was designed for <I>a schoolmaster, to bring men to 
 Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 In the
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:23">foregoing verse</A>,

 the apostle acquaints us with the state of the Jews under the Mosaic
 economy, that <I>before faith came,</I> or before Christ appeared and
 the doctrine of justification by faith in him was more fully 
 discovered, <I>they were kept under the law,</I> obliged, under severe 
 penalties, to a strict observance of the various precepts of it; and at 
 that time they were shut up, held under the terror and discipline of 
 it, as prisoners in a state of confinement: the design of this was that 
 hereby they might be disposed more readily to embrace <I>the faith 
 which should afterwards be revealed,</I> or be persuaded to accept 
 Christ when he came into the world, and to fall in with that better 
 dispensation he was to introduce, whereby they were to be freed from 
 bondage and servitude, and brought into a state of greater light and 
 liberty. Now, in that state, he tells them, <I>the law was their 
 schoolmaster, to bring them to Christ, that they might be justified by 
 faith.</I> As it declared the mind and will of God concerning them, and 
 at the same time denounced a curse against them for every failure in 
 their duty, so it was proper to convince them of their lost and undone 
 condition in themselves, and to let them see the weakness and 
 insufficiency of their own righteousness to recommend them to God. And 
 as it obliged them to a variety of sacrifices, &c., which, though they 
 could not of themselves take away sin, were typical of Christ, and of 
 the great sacrifice which he was to offer up for the expiation of it, 
 so it directed them (though in a more dark and obscure manner) to him 
 as their only relief and refuge. And thus it was their schoolmaster, to 
 instruct and govern them in their state of minority, or, as the word 
 <B><I>paidagogos</I></B> most properly signifies, their <I>servant,</I> 
 to lead and conduct them to Christ (as children were wont to be led to 
 school by those servants who had the care of them); that they might be 
 more fully instructed by him as their schoolmaster, in the true way of 
 justification and salvation, which is only by faith in him, and of 
 which he was appointed to give the fullest and clearest discoveries. 
 But lest it should be said, If the law was of this use and service 
 under the Jewish, why may it not continue to be so under the Christian 
 state too, the apostle adds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)

 that <I>after faith has come,</I> and the gospel dispensation has taken 
 place, under which Christ, and the way of pardon and life through faith 
 in him, are set in the clearest light, <I>we are no longer under a 
 schoolmaster</I>--we have no such need of the law to direct us to him 
 as there was then. Thus the apostle acquaints us for what uses and 
 purposes the law served; and, from what he says concerning this matter, 
 we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The goodness of God to his people of old, in giving the law to them; 
 for though, in comparison of the gospel state, it was a dispensation of 
 darkness and terror, yet it furnished them with sufficient means and 
 helps both to direct them in their duty to God and to encourage their 
 hopes in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The great fault and folly of the Jews, in mistaking the design of 
 the law, and abusing it to a very different purpose from that which God 
 intended in the giving of it; for they expected to be justified by the 
 works of it, whereas it was never designed to be the rule of their 
 justification, but only a means of convincing them of their guilt and 
 of their need of a Saviour, and of directing them to Christ, and faith 
 in him, as the only way of obtaining this privilege. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:31,32,10:3,4">Rom. ix. 31, 32; x. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The great advantage of the gospel state above the legal, under which 
 we not only enjoy a clearer discovery of divine grace and mercy than 
 was afforded to the Jews of old, but are also freed from the state of 
 bondage and terror under which they were held. We are not now treated 
 as children in a state of minority, but as sons grown up to a full age, 
 who are admitted to greater freedoms, and instated in larger 
 privileges, than they were. This the apostle enlarges upon in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:26-29">following verses</A>.

 For, having shown for what intent the law was given, in the close of
 the chapter he acquaints us with our privilege by Christ, where he 
 particularly declares,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That <I>we are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 And here we may observe, 

 [1.] The great and excellent privilege which real Christians enjoy 
 under the gospel: <I>They are the children of God;</I> they are no 
 longer accounted servants, but <I>sons;</I> they are not now kept at 
 such a distance, and under such restraints, as the Jews were, but are 
 allowed a nearer and freer access to God than was granted to them; yea, 
 they are admitted into the number, and have a right to all the 
 privileges, of his children.

 [2.] How they come to obtain this privilege, and that is <I>by faith in 
 Christ Jesus.</I> Having accepted him as their Lord and Saviour, and 
 relying on him alone for justification and salvation, they are hereupon 
 admitted into this happy relation to God, and are entitled to the 
 privileges of it; for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:12">John i. 12</A>)

 <I>as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of 
 God, even to those that believe on his name.</I> And this faith in 
 Christ, whereby they became the children of God, he reminds us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),
 
 was what they professed in baptism; for he adds, <I>As many of you as 
 have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</I> Having in
 baptism professed their faith in him, they were thereby devoted to him, 
 and had, as it were, put on his livery, and declared themselves to be 
 his servants and disciples; and having thus become the members of 
 Christ, they were through him owned and accounted as the children of 
 God. Here note, <I>First,</I> Baptism is now the solemn rite of our 
 admission into the Christian church, as circumcision was into that of 
 the Jews. Our Lord Jesus appointed it to be so, in the commission he 
 gave to his apostles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:19">Matt. xxviii. 19</A>),

 and accordingly it was their practice to baptize those whom they had 
 discipled to the Christian faith; and perhaps the apostle might take 
 notice of their baptism here, and of their becoming the children of God 
 through faith in Christ, professed therein, to obviate a further 
 objection, which the false teachers might be apt to urge in favour of 
 circumcision. They might be ready to say, "Though it should be allowed 
 that the law, as given at mount Sinai, was abrogated by the coming of 
 Christ the promised seed, yet why should circumcision be set aside too, 
 when that was given to Abraham together with the promise, and long 
 before the giving of the law by Moses?" But this difficulty is 
 sufficiently removed when the apostle says, <I>Those who are baptized 
 into Christ have put on Christ;</I> for thence it appears that under 
 the gospel baptism comes in the room of circumcision, and that those 
 who by baptism are devoted to Christ, and do sincerely believe in him, 
 are to all intents and purposes as much admitted into the privileges of 
 the Christian state as the Jews were by circumcision into those of the 
 legal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:3">Phil. iii. 3</A>),

 and therefore there was no reason why the use of that should still be 
 continued. Note, <I>Secondly,</I> In our baptism we put on Christ; 
 therein we profess our discipleship to him, and are obliged to behave 
 ourselves as his faithful servants. Being baptized into Christ, we are 
 baptized into his death, that as he died and rose again, so, in 
 conformity thereunto, we should die unto sin, and walk in newness of 
 life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:3,4">Rom. vi. 3, 4</A>);

 it would be of great advantage to us did we oftener remember this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That this privilege of being the children of God, and of being by 
 baptism devoted to Christ, is now enjoyed in common by all real 
 Christians. The law indeed made a difference between Jew and Greek, 
 giving the Jews on many accounts the pre-eminence: that also made a 
 difference between <I>bond and free,</I> master and servant, and 
 between <I>male and female,</I> the males being circumcised. But it is 
 not so now; they all stand on the same level, <I>and are all one in 
 Christ Jesus;</I> as the one is not accepted on the account of any 
 national or personal advantages he may enjoy above the other, so 
 neither is the other rejected for the want of them; but all who 
 sincerely believe on Christ, of what nation, or sex, or condition, 
 soever they be, are accepted of him, and become the children of God 
 through faith in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That, <I>being Christ's, we are Abraham's seed, and heirs 
 according to the promise.</I> Their judaizing teachers would have them 
 believe that they must be circumcised and keep the law of Moses, or 
 they could not be saved: "No," says the apostle, "there is no need of 
 that; for <I>if you be Christ's,</I> if you sincerely believe on him, 
 who is the promised seed, in whom all the nations of the earth were to 
 be blessed, you therefore become the true <I>seed of Abraham,</I> the 
 father of the faithful, and as such <I>are heirs according to the 
 promise,</I> and consequently are entitled to the great blessings and 
 privileges of it." And therefore upon the whole, since it appeared that 
 justification was not to be attained by the works of the law, but only 
 by faith in Christ, and that the law of Moses was a temporary 
 institution and was given for such purposes as were only subservient to 
 and not subversive of the promise, and that now, under the gospel, 
 Christians enjoy much greater and better privileges than the Jews did 
 under that dispensation, it must needs follow that they were very 
 unreasonable and unwise, in hearkening to those who at once endeavoured 
 to deprive them of the truth and liberty of the gospel.</P>
