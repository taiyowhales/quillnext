 In this chapter we have an account, 

 I. Of the constancy of the apostle and his fellow-labourers in their
 work. Their constancy in declared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:1">ver. 1</A>),

 their sincerity is vouched

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:2">ver. 2</A>),

 an objection is obviated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>),

 and their integrity proved,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 II. Of their courage and patience under their sufferings. Where see
 what their sufferings were, together with their allays

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:8-12">ver. 8-12</A>),

 and what it was that kept them from sinking and fainting under them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:13-18">ver. 13, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received
 mercy, we faint not;
 &nbsp; 2  But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not
 walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully;
 but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every
 man's conscience in the sight of God.
 &nbsp; 3  But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
 &nbsp; 4  In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them
 which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of
 Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
 &nbsp; 5  For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
 ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.
 &nbsp; 6  For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
 hath shined in our hearts, to <I>give</I> the light of the knowledge
 of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
 &nbsp; 7  But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the
 excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle had, in the foregoing chapter, been <I>magnifying his 
 office,</I> upon the consideration of the excellency or glory of that 
 gospel about which he did officiate; and now in this chapter his design 
 is to vindicate their ministry from the accusation of false teachers, 
 who charged them as deceitful workers, or endeavoured to prejudice the 
 minds of the people against them on account of their sufferings. He 
 tells them, therefore, how they believed, and how they showed their 
 value for their office as ministers of the gospel. They were not puffed 
 up with pride, but spurred on to great diligence: "<I>Seeing we have 
 this ministry,</I> are so much distinguished and dignified, we do not 
 take state upon ourselves, nor indulge in idleness, but are excited to 
 the better performance of our duty."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Two things in general we have an account of:--Their constancy and
 sincerity in their work and labour, concerning which observe, 

 1. Their constancy and perseverance in their work are declared: "<I>We
 faint not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 under the difficulty of our work, nor do we desist from our labour." 
 And this their stedfastness was owing to the <I>mercy of God.</I> From 
 the same mercy and grace from which they received the apostleship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:5">Rom. i. 5</A>),

 they received strength to persevere in the work of that office. Note,
 As it is great mercy and grace to be called to be saints, and 
 especially to be <I>counted faithful, and be put into the ministry</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:12">1 Tim. i. 12</A>),

 so it is owing to the mercy and grace of God if we continue faithful 
 and persevere in our work with diligence. The best men in the world 
 would faint in their work, and under their burdens, if they did not 
 receive mercy from God. <I>By the grace of God I am what I am,</I> said 
 this great apostle in his former epistle to these Corinthians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:10"><I>ch.</I> xv. 10</A>.

 And that mercy which has helped us out, and helped us on, hitherto, we
 may rely upon to help us even to the end. 

 2. Their sincerity in their work is avouched

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 in several expressions: <I>We have renounced the hidden things of 
 dishonesty.</I> The things of dishonesty are hidden things, that will 
 not bear the light; and those who practise them are, or should be, 
 ashamed of them, especially when they are known. Such things the 
 apostle did not allow of, but did renounce and avoid with indignation: 
 <I>Not walking in craftiness,</I> or in disguise, acting with art and 
 cunning, but in great simplicity, and with open freedom. They had no 
 base and wicked designs covered with fair and specious pretences of 
 something that was good. Nor did they in their preaching <I>handle the 
 word of God deceitfully;</I> but, as he said before, they used <I>great 
 plainness of speech,</I> and did not make their ministry serve a turn, 
 or truckle to base designs. They had not cheated the people with 
 falsehood instead of truth. Some think the apostle alludes to the 
 deceit which treacherous gamesters use, or that of hucksters in the 
 market, who mix bad wares with good. The apostles acted not like such 
 persons, but they <I>manifested the truth to every man's 
 conscience,</I> declaring nothing but what in their own conscience they 
 believed to be true, and what might serve for the conviction of their 
 consciences who heard them, who were to judge for themselves, and to 
 give an account for themselves. And all this they did <I>as in the 
 sight of God,</I> desirous thus to commend themselves to God, and to 
 the consciences of men, by their undisguised sincerity. Note, A
 stedfast adherence to the truths of the gospel will commend ministers 
 and people; and sincerity or uprightness will preserve a man's 
 reputation, and the good opinion of wise and good men concerning 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An objection is obviated, which might be thus formed: "If it be 
 thus, how then does it come to pass, that the gospel is hid, and proves 
 ineffectual, as to some who hear it?" To which the apostle answers, by 
 showing that this was not the fault of the gospel, nor of the preachers 
 thereof. But the true reasons of this are, 

 1. <I>Those are lost souls</I> to whom the gospel is hid, or is
 ineffectual,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Christ came to <I>save that which was lost</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:11">Matt. xvii. 11</A>),

 and the gospel of Christ is sent to save such; and, if this do not find
 and save them, they are lost for ever; they must never expect any thing 
 else to save them, for there is no other method or means of salvation. 
 The hiding of the gospel therefore from souls is both an evidence and 
 cause of their ruin. 

 2. <I>The god of this world hath blinded their minds,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They are under the influence and power of the devil, who is here called 
 <I>the god of this world,</I> and elsewhere <I>the prince of this 
 world,</I> because of the great interest he has in this world, the 
 homage that is paid to him by multitudes in this world, and the great 
 sway that, by divine permission, he bears in the world, and in the 
 hearts of his subjects, or rather slaves. And as he is the prince of 
 darkness, and ruler of the darkness of this world, so he darkens the 
 understandings of men, and increases their prejudices, and supports his 
 interest by keeping them in the dark, blinding their minds with 
 ignorance, and error, and prejudices, that they should not <I>behold 
 the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of 
 God.</I> Observe,

 (1.) Christ's design by his gospel is to make a glorious discovery of 
 God to the minds of men. Thus, as the image of God, he demonstrates the 
 power and wisdom of God, and the grace and mercy of God for their 
 salvation. But, 

 (2.) The design of the devil is to keep men in ignorance; and, when he 
 cannot keep the light of the gospel out of the world, he makes it his 
 great business to keep it out of the hearts of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A proof of their integrity is given, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They made it their business to preach Christ, and not themselves: <I>We 
 preach not ourselves.</I> Self was not the matter nor the end of the 
 apostles' preaching: they did not give their own notions and private 
 opinions, nor their passions and prejudices, for the word and will of 
 God; nor did they seek themselves, to advance their own secular 
 interest or glory. But they <I>preached Christ Jesus the Lord;</I> and 
 thus it did become them and behove them to do, as being Christ's 
 servants. Their business was to make their Master known to the world as 
 the Messiah, or the Christ of God, and as Jesus, the only Saviour of 
 men, and as the rightful Lord, and to advance his honour and glory. 
 Note, All the lines of Christian doctrine centre in Christ; and in 
 preaching Christ we preach all we should preach. "As to 
 <I>ourselves,</I>" says the apostle, "<I>we preach,</I> or declare, 
 that <I>we are your servants for Jesus' sake.</I>" This was no 
 compliment, but a real profession of a readiness to do good to their 
 souls, and to promote their spiritual and eternal interest, and that 
 for <I>Jesus' sake;</I> not for their own sake or their own advantage, 
 but for Christ's sake, that they might imitate his great example, and 
 advance his glory. Note, Ministers should not be of proud spirits, 
 <I>lording it over God's heritage,</I> who are servants to the souls of 
 men: yet, at the same time, they must avoid the meanness of spirit 
 implied in becoming the servants of the humours or the lusts of men; if 
 they should thus <I>seek to please men, they would not be the servants 
 of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:10">Gal. i. 10</A>.

 And there was good reason, 

 1. Why they should preach Christ. For by gospel light we have the
 <I>knowledge of the glory of God,</I> which shines in the <I>face of 
 Jesus Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 And the light of this <I>Sun of righteousness</I> is more glorious than
 that light which God commanded to shine out of darkness. It is a 
 pleasant thing for the eye to behold the sun in the firmament; but it 
 is more pleasant and profitable when the gospel shines in the heart.
 Note, As light was the first-born of the first creation, so it is in 
 the new creation: the illumination of the Spirit is his first work upon 
 the soul. The grace of God created such a light in the soul that those 
 who <I>were sometimes darkness are made light in the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:8">Eph. v. 8</A>.

 2. Why they should not preach themselves: because they were but earthen
 vessels, things of little or no worth or value. Here seems to be an 
 allusion to the lamps which Gideon's soldiers carried in earthen 
 pitchers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:16">Jud. vii. 16</A>.

 The treasure of gospel light and grace is put into earthen vessels. The
 ministers of the gospel are weak and frail creatures, and <I>subject to 
 like passions</I> and infirmities as other men; they are mortal, and 
 soon broken in pieces. And God has so ordered it that the weaker the 
 vessels are the stronger his power may appear to be, that the treasure 
 itself should be valued the more. Note, There is an excellency of power 
 in the gospel of Christ, to enlighten the mind, to convince the 
 conscience, to convert the soul, and to rejoice the heart; but all this 
 power is from God the author, and not from men, who are but 
 instruments, so that God in all things must be glorified.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  <I>We are</I> troubled on every side, yet not distressed; <I>we are</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the apostle gives an account of their courage and 
 patience under all their sufferings, where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How their sufferings, and patience under them, are declared, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:8-12"><I>v.</I> 8-12</A>.

 The apostles were great sufferers; therein they followed their Master: 
 Christ had told them <I>that in the world they should have 
 tribulation,</I> and so they had; yet they met with wonderful support, 
 great relief, and many allays of their sorrows. "<I>We are,</I>" says 
 the apostle, "<I>troubled on every side,</I> afflicted many ways, and 
 we meet with almost all sorts of troubles; <I>yet not distressed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 We are not hedged in nor cooped up, because we can see help in God, and 
 help from God, and have liberty of access to God." Again, "We are 
 <I>perplexed,</I> often uncertain, and in doubt what will become of us, 
 and not always without anxiety in our minds on this account; <I>yet not 
 in despair</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 even in our greatest perplexities, knowing that God is able to support 
 us, and to deliver us, and in him we always place our trust and hope." 
 Again, "We are <I>persecuted</I> by men, pursued with hatred and 
 violence from place to place, as men not worthy to live; yet <I>not 
 forsaken</I> of God," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Good men may be sometimes forsaken of their friends, as well as 
 persecuted by their enemies; but God will never leave them nor forsake 
 them. Again, "We are sometimes dejected, or <I>cast down;</I> the enemy 
 may in a great measure prevail, and our spirits begin to fail us; there 
 may be fears within, as well as fightings without; yet we are <I>not 
 destroyed,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Still they were preserved, and kept their heads above water. Note,
 Whatever condition the children of God may be in, in this world, they 
 have a "<I>but not</I>" to comfort themselves with; their case 
 sometimes is bad, yea very bad, but not so bad as it might be. The 
 apostle speaks of their sufferings as constant, and as a counterpart of 
 the sufferings of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The sufferings of Christ were, after a sort, re-acted in the sufferings 
 of Christians; thus did they <I>bear about the dying of the Lord 
 Jesus</I> in their body, setting before the world the great example of 
 a suffering Christ, <I>that the life of Jesus might also be made 
 manifest,</I> that is, that people might see the power of Christ's 
 resurrection, and the efficacy of grace in and from the living Jesus, 
 manifested in and towards them, who did yet live, though they were 
 always <I>delivered to death</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and though <I>death worked in them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 they being exposed to death, and ready to be swallowed up by death 
 continually. So great were the sufferings of the apostles that, in 
 comparison with them, other Christians were, even at this time, in 
 prosperous circumstances: <I>Death worketh in us; but life in you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What it was that kept them from sinking and fainting under their 
 sufferings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:13-18"><I>v.</I> 13-18</A>.

 Whatever the burdens and troubles of good men may be, they have cause 
 enough not to faint.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Faith kept them from fainting: <I>We have the same spirit of 
 faith</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 that faith which is of the operation of the Spirit; the same faith by 
 which the saints of old did and suffered such great things. Note, The 
 grace of faith is a sovereign cordial, and an effectual antidote 
 against fainting-fits in troublous times. The spirit of faith will go 
 far to bear up the spirit of a man under his infirmities; and as the 
 apostle had David's example to imitate, who said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:10">Ps. cxvi. 10</A>),

 <I>I have believed, and therefore have I spoken,</I> so he leaves us 
 his example to imitate: <I>We also believe,</I> says he, <I>and 
 therefore speak.</I> Note, As we receive help and encouragement from 
 the good words and examples of others, so we should be careful to give 
 a good example to others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Hope of the resurrection kept them from sinking, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They knew that Christ was raised, and that his resurrection was an 
 earnest and assurance of theirs. This he had treated of largely in his 
 former epistle to these Corinthians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:1-58"><I>ch.</I> xv</A>.

 And therefore their hope was firm, being well grounded, that he who
 raised up Christ the head will also raise up all his members. Note, The 
 hope of the resurrection will encourage us in a suffering day, and set 
 us above the fear of death; for what reason has a good Christian to 
 fear death, that dies in hope of a joyful resurrection?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The consideration of the glory of God and the benefit of the church, 
 by means of their sufferings, kept them from fainting, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Their sufferings were for the church's advantage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:6"><I>ch.</I> i. 6</A>),

 and thus did redound to God's glory. For, when the church is edified,
 then God is glorified; and we may well afford to bear sufferings 
 patiently and cheerfully when we see others are the better for them--if 
 they are instructed and edified, if they are confirmed and comforted. 
 Note, The sufferings of Christ's ministers, as well as their preaching 
 and conversation, are intended for the good of the church and the glory 
 of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The thoughts of the advantage their souls would reap by the 
 sufferings of their bodies kept them from fainting: <I>Though our 
 outward man perish, our inward man is renewed day by day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Here note, 

 (1.) We have every one of us an outward and an inward man, a body and a 
 soul. 

 (2.) If the outward man perish, there is no remedy, it must and will be 
 so, it was made to perish. 

 (3.) It is our happiness if the decays of the outward man do contribute 
 to the renewing of the inward man, if afflictions outwardly are gain to 
 us inwardly, if when the body is sick, and weak, and perishing, the 
 soul is vigorous and prosperous. The best of men have need of further
 renewing of the inward man, even day by day. Where the good work is 
 begun there is more work to be done, for carrying it forward. And as in 
 wicked men things grow every day worse and worse, so in godly men they 
 grow better and better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The prospect of eternal life and happiness kept them from fainting, 
 and was a mighty support and comfort. As to this observe, 

 (1.) The apostle and his fellow-sufferers saw their afflictions working 
 towards heaven, and that they would end at last 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 whereupon they weighed things aright in the balance of the sanctuary; 
 they did as it were put the heavenly glory in one scale and their 
 earthly sufferings in the other; and, pondering things in their 
 thoughts, they found afflictions to be light, and the glory of heaven 
 to be <I>a far more exceeding weight.</I> That which sense was ready to 
 pronounce heavy and long, grievous and tedious, faith perceived to be 
 light and short, and but for a moment. On the other hand, the worth and 
 weight of the crown of glory, as they are exceedingly great in 
 themselves, so they are esteemed to be by the believing soul--far 
 exceeding all his expressions and thoughts; and it will be a special 
 support in our sufferings when we can perceive them appointed as the 
 way and preparing us for the enjoyment of the future glory. 

 (2.) Their faith enabled them to make this right judgment of things: 
 <I>We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which 
 are not seen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:18 "><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It is by faith that we see God, who is invisible

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:27">Heb. xi. 27</A>),

 and by this we look to an unseen heaven and hell, and faith is the 
 <I>evidence of things not seen.</I> Note, 

 [1.] There are unseen things, as well as things that are seen.

 [2.] There is this vast difference between them: unseen things are 
 eternal, seen things but temporal, or temporary only.

 [3.] By faith we not only discern these things, and the great
 difference between them, but by this also we take our aim at unseen 
 things, and chiefly regard them, and make it our end and scope, not to
