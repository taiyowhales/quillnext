 The book of the divine counsels being thus lodged in the hand of 
 Christ, he loses no time, but immediately enters upon the work of 
 opening the seals and publishing the contents; but this is done in such 
 a manner as still leaves the predictions very abstruse and difficult to 
 be understood. Hitherto the waters of the sanctuary have been as those 
 in Ezekiel's vision, only to the ankles, or to the knees, or to the 
 loins at least; but here they begin to be a river that cannot be passed 
 over. The visions which John saw, the epistles to the churches, the 
 songs of praise, in the two foregoing chapters, had some things dark 
 and hard to be understood; and yet they were rather milk for babes than 
 meat for strong men; but now we are to launch into the deep, and our 
 business is not so much to fathom it as to let down our net to take a 
 draught. We shall only hint at what seems most obvious. The prophecies 
 of this book are divided into seven seals opened, seven trumpets 
 sounding, and seven vials poured out. It is supposed that the opening 
 of the seven seals discloses those providences that concerned the 
 church in the first three centuries, from the ascension of our Lord and 
 Saviour to the reign of Constantine; this was represented in a book
 rolled up, and sealed in several places, so that, when one seal was
 opened, you might read so far of it, and so on, till the whole was
 unfolded. Yet we are not here told what was written in the book, but
 what John saw in figures enigmatical and hieroglyphic; and it is not
 for us to pretend to know "the times and seasons which the Father has
 put in his own power." In this chapter six of the seven seals are
 opened, and the visions attending them are related; the first seal in
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>,
 
 the second seal in

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard,
 as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying,
 Come and see.
 &nbsp; 2  And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him
 had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth
 conquering, and to conquer.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here,

 1. Christ, the Lamb, opens the first seal; he now enters upon the great 
 work of opening and accomplishing the purposes of God towards the 
 church and the world. 

 2. One of the ministers of the church calls upon the apostle, with a 
 voice like thunder, to come near, and observe what then appeared.

 3. We have the vision itself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 (1.) The Lord Jesus appears riding on <I>a white horse.</I> White
 horses are generally refused in war, because they make the rider a mark 
 for the enemy; but our Lord Redeemer was sure of the victory and a 
 glorious triumph, and he rides on the white horse of a pure but 
 despised gospel, with great swiftness through the world. 

 (2.) <I>He had a bow</I> in his hand. The convictions impressed by the 
 word of God are sharp arrows, they reach at a distance; and, though the 
 ministers of the word draw the bow at a venture, God can and will 
 direct it to the joints of the harness. This bow, in the hand of 
 Christ, abides in strength, and, like that of Jonathan, <I>never 
 returns empty.</I> 

 (3.) <I>A crown was given him,</I> importing that all who receive the 
 gospel must receive Christ as a king, and must be his loyal and 
 obedient subjects; he will be glorified in the success of the gospel. 
 When Christ was going to war, one would think a helmet had been more 
 proper than a crown; but a crown is given him as the earnest and emblem 
 of victory. 

 (4.) <I>He went forth conquering, and to conquer.</I> As long as the 
 church continues militant Christ will be conquering; when he has 
 conquered his enemies in one age he meets with new ones in another age; 
 men go on opposing, and Christ goes on conquering, and his former 
 victories are pledges of future victories. He conquers his enemies in
 his people; their sins are their enemies and his enemies; when Christ 
 comes with power into their soul he begins to conquer these enemies, 
 and he goes on conquering, in the progressive work of sanctification, 
 till he has gained us a complete victory. And he conquers his enemies 
 in the world, wicked men, some by bringing them to his foot, others by 
 making them his footstool. Observe, From this seal opened,

 [1.] The successful progress of the gospel of Christ in the world is a 
 glorious sight, worth beholding, the most pleasant and welcome sight 
 that a good man can see in this world.

 [2.] Whatever convulsions and revolutions happen in the states and 
 kingdoms of the world, the kingdom of Christ shall be established and 
 enlarged in spite of all opposition.

 [3.] A morning of opportunity usually goes before a night of calamity; 
 the gospel is preached before the plagues are poured forth.

 [4.] Christ's work is not all done at once. We are ready to think, when 
 the gospel goes forth, it should carry all the world before it, but it 
 often meets with opposition, and moves slowly; however, Christ will do 
 his own work effectually, in his own time and way.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second
 beast say, Come and see.
 &nbsp; 4  And there went out another horse <I>that was</I> red: and <I>power</I>
 was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth,
 and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto
 him a great sword.
 &nbsp; 5  And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third
 beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and
 he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.
 &nbsp; 6  And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A
 measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a
 penny; and <I>see</I> thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
 &nbsp; 7  And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of
 the fourth beast say, Come and see.
 &nbsp; 8  And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat
 on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given
 unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword,
 and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the
 earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The next three seals give us a sad prospect of great and desolating 
 judgments with which God punishes those who either refuse or abuse the 
 everlasting gospel. Though some understand them of the persecutions 
 that befel the church of Christ, and others of the destruction of the 
 Jews, they rather seem more generally to represent God's terrible 
 judgments, by which he avenges the quarrel of his covenant upon those 
 who make light of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Upon opening the second seal, to which John was called to attend, 
 <I>another horse</I> appears, of a different colour from the former, 
 <I>a red horse,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This signifies the desolating judgment of war; he that sat upon this 
 red horse had <I>power to take peace from the earth, and that</I> the 
 inhabitants of <I>the earth should kill one another.</I> Who this was 
 that sat upon the red horse, whether Christ himself, as Lord of hosts, 
 or the instruments that he raised up to conduct the war, is not clear; 
 but this is certain, 

 1. That those who will not submit to the bow of the gospel must expect
 to be cut in sunder by the sword of divine justice. 

 2. That Jesus Christ rules and commands, not only in the kingdom of
 grace, but of providence. And, 

 3. That the sword of war is a dreadful judgment; it takes away peace
 from the earth, one of the greatest blessings, and it puts men upon 
 killing one another. Men, who should love one another and help one 
 another, are, in a state of war, set upon killing one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Upon opening the third seal, which John was directed to observe, 
 another horse appears, different from the former, <I>a black horse,</I> 
 signifying famine, that terrible judgment; <I>and he that sat on the 
 horse had a pair of balances in his hand</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 signifying that men must now eat their bread by weight, as was 
 threatened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:26">Lev. xxvi. 26</A>),

 <I>They shall deliver your bread to you by weight.</I> That which 
 follows in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>,

 of the voice that cried, <I>A measure of wheat for a penny, and three 
 measures of barley for a penny, and see thou hurt not the oil and the 
 wine,</I> has made some expositors think this was not a vision of 
 famine, but of plenty; but if we consider the quantity of their 
 measure, and the value of their penny, at the time of this prophecy, 
 the objection will be removed; their measure was but a single quart, 
 and their penny was our sevenpence-halfpenny, and that is a large sum 
 to give for a quart of wheat. However, it seems this famine, as all 
 others, fell most severely upon the poor; whereas the oil and the wine, 
 which were dainties of the rich, were not hurt; but if bread, the staff 
 of life, be broken, dainties will not supply the place of it. Here
 observe, 

 1. When a people loathe their spiritual food, God may justly deprive
 them of their daily bread. 

 2. One judgment seldom comes alone; the judgment of war naturally draws 
 after it that of famine; and those who will not humble themselves under 
 one judgment must expect another and yet greater, for when God contends 
 he will prevail. The famine of bread is a terrible judgment; but the 
 famine of the word is more so, though careless sinners are not sensible 
 of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Upon opening the fourth seal, which John is commanded to observe, 
 there appears another horse, of a pale colour. Here observe, 

 1. The name of the rider--<I>Death,</I> the king of terrors; the
 pestilence, which is death in its empire, death reigning over a place 
 or nation, death on horseback, marching about, and making fresh 
 conquests every hour. 

 2. The attendants or followers of this king of terrors--<I>hell,</I> a 
 state of eternal misery to all those who die in their sins; and, in 
 times of such a general destruction, multitudes go down unprepared into 
 the valley of destruction. It is an awful thought, and enough to make 
 the whole world to tremble, that eternal damnation immediately follows 
 upon the death of an impenitent sinner. Observe,

 (1.) There is a natural as well as judicial connection between one 
 judgment and another: war is a wasting calamity, and draws scarcity and 
 famine after it; and famine, not allowing men proper sustenance, and 
 forcing them to take that which is unwholesome, often draws the 
 pestilence after it. 

 (2.) God's quiver is full of arrows; he is never at a loss for ways and 
 means to punish a wicked people. 

 (3.) In the book of God's counsels he has prepared judgments for 
 scorners as well as mercy for returning sinners. 

 (4.) In the book of the scriptures God has published threatenings 
 against the wicked as well as promises to the righteous; and it is our 
 duty to observe and believe the threatenings as well as the 
 promises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. After the opening of these seals of approaching judgments, and the 
 distinct account of them, we have this general observation, that God 
 <I>gave power to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with 
 the sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the 
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He gave them power, that is, those instruments of his anger, or those 
 judgments themselves; he who holds the winds in his hand has all public 
 calamities at his command, and they can only go when he sends them and 
 no further than he permits. To the three great judgments of war, 
 famine, and pestilence, is here added <I>the beasts of the earth,</I> 
 another of God's sore judgments, mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:21">Ezek. xiv. 21</A>,

 and mentioned here the last, because, when a nation is depopulated by
 the sword, famine, and pestilence, the small remnant that continue in a 
 waste and howling wilderness encourage the wild beasts to make head 
 against them, and they become easy prey. Others, by <I>the beasts of 
 the field,</I> understand brutish, cruel, savage men, who, having 
 divested themselves of all humanity, delight to be the instruments of 
 the destruction of others.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar
 the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for
 the testimony which they held:
 &nbsp; 10  And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord,
 holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them
 that dwell on the earth?
 &nbsp; 11  And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it
 was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little
 season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that
 should be killed as they <I>were,</I> should be fulfilled.
 &nbsp; 12  And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo,
 there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as
 sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
 &nbsp; 13  And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig
 tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty
 wind.
 &nbsp; 14  And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled
 together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their
 places.
 &nbsp; 15  And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich
 men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every
 bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in
 the rocks of the mountains;
 &nbsp; 16  And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us
 from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the
 wrath of the Lamb:
 &nbsp; 17  For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be
 able to stand?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the remaining part of this chapter we have the opening of the fifth 
 and the sixth seals.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The fifth seal. Here is no mention made of any one who called the 
 apostle to make his observation, probably because the decorum of the 
 vision was to be observed, and each of the four living creatures had 
 discharged its duty of a monitor before, or because the events here 
 opened lay out of the sight, and beyond the time, of the present 
 ministers of the church; or because it does not contain a new prophecy 
 of any future events, but rather opens a spring of support and 
 consolation to those who had been and still were under great 
 tribulation for the sake of Christ and the gospel. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sight this apostle saw at the opening of the fifth seal; it was 
 a very affecting sight 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>I saw under the altar the souls of those that were slain for the 
 word of God, and for the testimony which they held.</I> He saw the 
 souls of the martyrs. Here observe, 

 (1.) Where he saw them--<I>under the altar;</I> at the foot of the 
 altar of incense, in the most holy place; he saw them in heaven, at the 
 foot of Christ. Hence note, 

 [1.] Persecutors can only kill the body, and after that there is no 
 more that they can do; their souls live.

 [2.] God has provided a good place in the better world for those who 
 are faithful to death and are not allowed a place any longer on earth.

 [3.] Holy martyrs are very near to Christ in heaven, they have the
 highest place there. 

 [4.] It is not their own death, but the sacrifice of Christ, that gives 
 them a reception into heaven and a reward there; they do not wash their 
 robes in their own blood, but in the blood of the Lamb.

 (2.) What was the cause in which they suffered--<I>the word of God and
 the testimony which they held,</I> for believing the word of God, and 
 attesting or confessing the truth of it; this profession of their faith 
 they held fast without wavering, even though they died for it. A noble 
 cause, the best that any man can lay down his life for--faith in God's 
 word and a confession of that faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The cry he heard; it was a loud cry, and contained a humble 
 expostulation about the long delay of avenging justice against their 
 enemies: <I>How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and 
 avenge our blood on those that dwell on the earth?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Observe,

 (1.) Even <I>the spirits of just men made perfect</I> retain a proper 
 resentment of the wrong they have sustained by their cruel enemies; and 
 though they die in charity, praying, as Christ did, that God would 
 forgive them, yet they are desirous that, for the honour of God, and 
 Christ, and the gospel, and for the terror and conviction of others, 
 God will take a just revenge upon the sin of persecution, even while he 
 pardons and saves the persecutors. 

 (2.) They commit their cause to him to whom vengeance belongeth, and 
 leave it in his hand; they are not for avenging themselves, but leave 
 all to God. 

 (3.) There will be joy in heaven at the destruction of the implacable 
 enemies of Christ and Christianity, as well as at the conversion of 
 other sinners. When Babylon falls, it will be said, <I>Rejoice over 
 her, O thou heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God hath 
 avenged you on her,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:20"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He observed the kind return that was made to this cry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 both what was given to them and what was said to them. 

 (1.) What was given to them--<I>white robes,</I> the robes of victory 
 and of honour; their present happiness was an abundant recompence of 
 their past sufferings.

 (2.) What was said to them--that they should be satisfied, and easy in 
 themselves, for it would not be long ere the number of their 
 fellow-sufferers <I>would be fulfilled.</I> This is a language rather 
 suited to the imperfect state of the saints in this world than to the 
 perfection of their state in heaven; <I>there</I> is no impatience, no 
 uneasiness, no need of admonition; but in this world there is great 
 need of patience. Observe, 

 [1.] There is a number of Christians, known to God, who are appointed 
 as <I>sheep for the slaughter,</I> set apart to be God's witnesses.

 [2.] As the measure of the sin of persecutors is filling up, so is the 
 number of the persecuted martyred servants of Christ.

 [3.] When this number is fulfilled, God will take a just and glorious 
 revenge upon their cruel persecutors; he will recompense tribulation to 
 those who trouble them, and to those that are troubled full and 
 uninterrupted rest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have here the sixth seal opened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Some refer this to the great revolutions in the empire at Constantine's 
 time, the downfall of paganism; others, with great probability, to the 
 destruction of Jerusalem, as an emblem of the general judgment, and 
 destruction of the wicked, at the end of the world; and, indeed, the 
 awful characters of this event are so much the same with those signs 
 mentioned by our Saviour as foreboding the destruction of Jerusalem, as 
 hardly to leave any room for doubting but that the same thing is meant
 in both places, though some think that event was past already. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:29,30">Matt. xxiv. 29, 30</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The tremendous events that were hastening; and here are several 
 occurrences that contribute to make that day and dispensation very 
 dreadful:--

 (1.) <I>There was a great earthquake.</I> This may be taken in a
 political sense; the very foundations of the Jewish church and state 
 would be terribly shaken, though they seemed to be as stable as the 
 earth itself. 

 (2.) <I>The sun became black as sackcloth of hair,</I> either 
 naturally, by a total eclipse, or politically, by the fall of the chief 
 rulers and governors of the land. 

 (3.) <I>The moon</I> should <I>become as blood;</I> the inferior 
 officers, or their military men, should be all wallowing in their own 
 blood. 

 (4.) <I>The stars of heaven shall fall to the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and that <I>as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken 
 of a mighty wind.</I> The stars may signify all the men of note and 
 influence among them, though in lower spheres of activity; there should 
 be a general desolation. 

 (5.) <I>The heaven</I> should <I>depart as a scroll when it is rolled 
 together.</I> This may signify that their ecclesiastical state should 
 perish and be laid aside for ever. 

 (6.) <I>Every mountain and island shall be moved out of its place.</I> 
 The destruction of the Jewish nation should affect and affright all the 
 nations round about, those who were highest in honour and those who 
 seemed to be best secured; it would be a judgment that should astonish 
 all the world. This leads to,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The dread and terror that would seize upon all sorts of men in that 
 great and awful day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 No authority, nor grandeur, nor riches, nor valour, nor strength, would 
 be able to support men at that time; yea, the very poor slaves, who, 
 one would think, had nothing to fear, because they had nothing to lose, 
 would be all in amazement at that day. Here observe,

 (1.) The degree of their terror and astonishment: it should prevail so 
 far as to make them, like distracted desperate men, call <I>to the 
 mountains to fall upon them, and to the hills to cover them;</I> they 
 would be glad to be no more seen; yea, to have no longer any being. 
 
 (2.) The cause of their terror, namely, the angry countenance <I>of him 
 that sits on the throne, and the wrath of the Lamb.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] That which is matter of displeasure to Christ is so to God; they 
 are so entirely one that what pleases or displeases the one pleases or 
 displeases the other.

 [2.] Though God be invisible, he can make the inhabitants of this world 
 sensible of his awful frowns.

 [3.] Though Christ be a lamb, yet he can be angry, even to wrath, and 
 <I>the wrath of the Lamb</I> is exceedingly dreadful; for if the 
 Redeemer, that appeases the wrath of God, himself be our wrathful 
 enemy, where shall we have a friend to plead for us? Those perish 
 without remedy who perish by the wrath of the Redeemer.

 [4.] As men have their day of opportunity, and their seasons of grace, 
 so God has his day of righteous wrath; and, when that day shall come, 
 the most stout-hearted sinners will not be able to stand before him: 
 all these terrors actually fell upon the sinners in Judea and Jerusalem 
 in the day of their destruction, and they will all, in the utmost 
 degree, fall upon impenitent sinners, at the general judgment of the 
 last day.</P>
