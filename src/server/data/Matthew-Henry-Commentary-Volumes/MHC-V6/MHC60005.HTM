 In which the apostle gives particular directions, first to the elders, 
 how to behave themselves towards their flock 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>);

 then to the younger, to be obedient and humble, and to cast their care
 upon God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 He then exhorts all to sobriety, watchfulness against temptations, and
 stedfastness in the faith, praying earnestly for them; and so concludes 
 his epistle with a solemn doxology, mutual salutations, and his 
 apostolical benediction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an
 elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a
 partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
 &nbsp; 2  Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the
 oversight <I>thereof,</I> not by constraint, but willingly; not for
 filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
 &nbsp; 3  Neither as being lords over <I>God's</I> heritage, but being
 ensamples to the flock.
 &nbsp; 4  And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a
 crown of glory that fadeth not away.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The persons to whom this exhortation is given--to the presbyters,
 pastors, and spiritual guides of the church, elders by office, rather
 than by age, ministers of those churches to whom he wrote this
 epistle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The person who gives this exhortation--the apostle Peter: <I>I
 exhort;</I> and, to give force to this exhortation, he tells them he
 was their brother-presbyter or fellow-elder, and so puts nothing upon
 them but what he was ready to perform himself. He was also <I>a
 witness of the sufferings of Christ,</I> being with him in the garden,
 attending him to the palace of the high-priest, and very likely being a
 spectator of his suffering upon the cross, at a distance among the
 crowd, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:15">Acts iii. 15</A>.

 He adds that he was also <I>a partaker of the glory</I> that was in
 some degree revealed at the transfiguration 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:1-3">Matt. xvii. 1-3</A>),

 and shall be completely enjoyed at the second coming of Jesus Christ. 
 Learn, 

 1. Those whose office it is to teach others ought carefully to study
 their own duty, as well as teach the people theirs.

 2. How different the spirit and behaviour of Peter were from that of 
 his pretended successors! He does not command and domineer, but exhort.
 He does not claim sovereignty over all pastors and churches, nor style 
 himself <I>prince of the apostles, vicar of Christ,</I> or <I>head of 
 the church,</I> but values himself upon being an <I>elder.</I> All the 
 apostles were elders, though every elder was not an apostle. 

 3. It was the peculiar honour of Peter, and a few more, to be the
 witnesses of Christ's sufferings; but it is the privilege of all true 
 Christians to be partakers of the glory that shall be revealed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The pastor's duty described, and the manner in which that duty 
 ought to be performed. The pastoral duty is three-fold:--

 1. <I>To feed the flock,</I> by preaching to them the sincere word of
 God, and ruling them according to such directions and discipline as the 
 word of God prescribes, both which are implied in this expression, 
 <I>Feed the flock.</I> 

 2. The pastors of the church must <I>take the oversight thereof.</I> 
 The elders are exhorted to do the office of bishops (as the word 
 signifies), by personal care and vigilance over all the flock committed 
 to their charge. 

 3. They must be <I>examples to the flock,</I> and practise the
 holiness, self-denial, mortification, and all other Christian duties, 
 which they preach and recommend to their people. These duties must be
 performed, <I>not by constraint,</I> not because you must do them, not 
 from compulsion of the civil power, or the constraint of fear or shame, 
 but from a willing mind that takes pleasure in the work: <I>not for 
 filthy lucre,</I> or any emoluments and profits attending the place 
 where you reside, or any perquisite belonging to the office, <I>but of 
 a ready mind,</I> regarding the flock more than the fleece, sincerely 
 and cheerfully endeavouring to serve the church of God; <I>neither as 
 being lords over God's heritage,</I> tyrannizing over them by 
 compulsion and coercive force, or imposing unscriptural and human 
 inventions upon them instead of necessary duty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:25,26;2Co+1:24">Matt. xx. 25, 26; 2 Cor. i. 24</A>.
 
 Learn,

 (1.) The eminent dignity of the church of God, and all the true members
 of it. These poor, dispersed, suffering Christians were the flock of 
 God. The rest of the world is a brutal herd. These are an orderly 
 flock, redeemed to God by the great Shepherd, living in holy love and 
 communion one with another, <I>according to the will of God.</I> They 
 are also dignified with the title of God's <I>heritage</I> or 
 <I>clergy,</I> his peculiar lot, chosen out of the common multitude for 
 his own people, to enjoy his special favour and to do him special 
 service. The word is never restricted in the New Testament to the 
 ministers of religion. 

 (2.) The pastors of the church ought to consider their people as <I>the 
 flock of God, as God's heritage,</I> and treat them accordingly. They 
 are not theirs, to be lorded over at pleasure; but they are God's 
 people, and should be treated with love, meekness, and tenderness, for 
 the sake of him to whom they belong. 

 (3.) Those ministers who are either driven to the work by necessity or 
 drawn to it by filthy lucre can never perform their duty as they ought, 
 because they do not do it willingly, and with a ready mind. 

 (4.) The best way a minister can take to engage the respect of a people 
 is to discharge his own duty among them in the best manner that he can, 
 and to be a constant example to them of all that is good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. In opposition to that filthy lucre which many propose to themselves 
 as their principal motive in undertaking and discharging the pastoral 
 office, the apostle sets before them the crown of glory designed by the 
 great shepherd, Jesus Christ, for all his faithful ministers. Learn, 

 1. Jesus Christ is <I>the chief shepherd</I> of the whole flock and
 heritage of God. He bought them, and rules them; he defends and saves 
 them for ever. He is also the chief shepherd over all inferior 
 shepherds; they derive their authority from him, act in his name, and 
 are accountable to him at last. 

 2. This chief shepherd will appear, to judge all ministers and 
 under-shepherds, to call them to account, whether they have faithfully 
 discharged their duty both publicly and privately according to the 
 foregoing directions. 

 3. Those that are found to have done their duty shall have what is
 infinitely better than temporal gain; they shall receive from the grand 
 shepherd a high degree of everlasting glory, <I>a crown of glory that 
 fadeth not away.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea,
 all <I>of you</I> be subject one to another, and be clothed with
 humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
 humble.
 &nbsp; 6  Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God,
 that he may exalt you in due time:
 &nbsp; 7  Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having settled and explained the duty of the pastors or spiritual 
 guides of the church, the apostle comes now to instruct the flock,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How to behave themselves to their ministers and to one another. He 
 calls them <I>the younger,</I> as being generally younger than their 
 grave pastors, and to put them in mind of their inferiority, the term 
 younger being used by our Saviour to signify an inferior, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:26">Luke xxii. 26</A>.

 He exhorts those that are younger and inferior to <I>submit themselves
 to the elder,</I> to give due respect and reverence to their persons, 
 and to yield to their admonitions, reproof, and authority, enjoining 
 and commanding what the word of God requires, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:17">Heb. xiii. 17</A>.

 As to one another, the rule is that they should all <I>be subject one
 to another,</I> so far as to receive the reproofs and counsels one of 
 another, and be ready to <I>bear one another's burdens,</I> and perform 
 all the offices of friendship and charity one to another; and 
 particular persons should submit to the directions of the whole 
 society,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:21;Jam+5:16">Eph. v. 21; Jam. v. 16</A>.

 These duties of submission to superiors in age or office, and
 subjection to one another, being contrary to the proud nature and 
 selfish interests of men, he advises them to <I>be clothed with 
 humility.</I> "Let your minds, behaviour, garb, and whole frame, be 
 adorned with humility, as the most beautiful habit you can wear; this 
 will render obedience and duty easy and pleasant; but, if you be 
 disobedient and proud, God will set himself to oppose and crush you; 
 for <I>he resisteth the proud,</I> when he <I>giveth grace to the 
 humble.</I>" Observe,

 1. Humility is the great preserver of peace and order in all Christian
 churches and societies, consequently pride is the great disturber of 
 them, and the cause of most dissensions and breaches in the church.

 2. There is a mutual opposition between God and the proud, so the word
 signifies; they war against him, and he scorns them; <I>he resisteth
 the proud,</I> because they are like the devil, enemies to himself and
 to his kingdom among men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:34">Prov. iii. 34</A>.

 3. Where God giveth grace to be humble, he will give more grace, more
 wisdom, faith, holiness, and humility. Hence the apostle adds:
 <I>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he 
 may exalt you in due time,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 "Since God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble, 
 therefore humble yourselves, not only one to another, but to the great 
 God, whose judgments are coming upon the world, and must begin at the 
 house of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17"><I>ch.</I> iv. 17</A>);

 his hand is almighty, and can easily pull you down if you be proud, or
 exalt you if you be humble; and it will certainly do it, either in this 
 life, if he sees it best for you, or at the day of general 
 retribution." Learn, 

 (1.) The consideration of the omnipotent hand of God should make us 
 humble and submissive to him in all that he brings upon us. 

 (2.) Humbling ourselves to God under his hand is the next way to 
 deliverance and exaltation; patience under his chastisements, and 
 submission to his pleasure, repentance, prayer, and hope in his mercy, 
 will engage his help and release in due time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:7,10">Jam. iv. 7, 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle, knowing that these Christians were already under very 
 hard circumstances, rightly supposes that what he had foretold of 
 greater hardships yet a coming might excite in them abundance of care 
 and fear about the event of these difficulties, what the issue of them 
 would be to themselves, their families, and the church of God; 
 foreseeing this anxious care would be a heavy burden, and a sore 
 temptation, he gives them the best advice, and supports it with a 
 strong argument. His advice is to <I>cast all their care,</I> or <I>all 
 care of themselves, upon God.</I> "Throw your cares, which are so 
 cutting and distracting, which wound your souls and pierce your hearts, 
 upon the wise and gracious providence of God; trust in him with a firm 
 composed mind, <I>for he careth for you.</I> He is willing to release 
 you of your care, and take the care of you upon himself. He will either 
 avert what you fear, or support you under it. He will order all events 
 to you so as shall convince you of his paternal love and tenderness 
 towards you; and all shall be so ordered that no hurt, but good, shall 
 come unto you," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25;Ps+84:11;Ro+8:28">Matt. vi. 25;
 Ps. lxxxiv. 11; Rom. viii. 28</A>.
 
 Learn, 

 1. The best of Christians are apt to labour under the burden of anxious
 and excessive care; the apostle calls it, <I>all your care,</I> 
 intimating that the cares of Christians are various and of more sorts 
 than one: personal cares, family cares, cares for the present, cares 
 for the future, cares for themselves, for others, and for the church.

 2. The cares even of good people are very burdensome, and too often
 very sinful; when they arise from unbelief and diffidence, when they
 torture and distract the mind, unfit us for the duties of our place and
 hinder our delightful service of God, they are very criminal. 

 3. The best remedy against immoderate care is to <I>cast our care upon
 God,</I> and resign every event to the wise and gracious determination.
 A firm belief of the rectitude of the divine will and counsels calms 
 the spirit of man. <I>We ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be
 done,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
 roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
 &nbsp; 9  Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same
 afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the
 world.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle does three things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He shows them their danger from an enemy more cruel and restless 
 than even the worst of men, whom he describes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By his characters and names. 

 (1.) He is an adversary: "<I>That adversary of yours;</I> not a common 
 adversary, but an enemy that impleads you, and litigates against you in 
 your grand depending cause, and aims at your very souls." 

 (2.) <I>The devil, the grand accuser of all the brethren;</I> this 
 title is derived from a word which signifies to strike through, or to 
 stab. He would strike malignity into our natures and poison into our 
 souls. If he could have struck these people with passion and murmuring 
 in their sufferings, perhaps he might have drawn them to apostasy and 
 ruin. 

 (3.) He is <I>a roaring lion,</I> hungry, fierce, strong, and cruel, 
 the fierce and greedy pursuer of souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By his business: <I>He walks about, seeking whom he may devour;</I> 
 his whole design is to devour and destroy souls. To this end he is 
 unwearied and restless in his malicious endeavours; for he always, 
 night and day, goes about studying and contriving whom he may ensnare 
 to their eternal ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Hence he infers that it is their duty, 

 1. To <I>be sober,</I> and to govern both the outward and the inward
 man by the rules of temperance, modesty, and mortification. 

 2. To <I>be vigilant;</I> not secure or careless, but rather suspicious 
 of constant danger from this spiritual enemy, and, under that 
 apprehension, to be watchful and diligent to prevent his designs and 
 save our souls. 

 3. To resist him <I>stedfast in the faith.</I> It was the faith of
 these people that Satan aimed at; if he could overturn their faith, and 
 draw them into apostasy, then he knew he should gain his point, and 
 ruin their souls; therefore, to destroy their faith, he raises bitter 
 persecutions, and sets the grand potentates of the world against them.
 This strong trial and temptation they must resist, by being 
 well-grounded, resolute, and stedfast in the faith: to encourage them 
 to this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He tells them that their care was not singular, for they knew that 
 the like afflictions befel their brethren in all parts of the world, 
 and that all the people of God were their fellow-soldiers in this 
 warfare. Learn, 

 1. All the great persecutions that ever were in the world were raised,
 spirited up, and conducted, by the devil; he is the grand persecutor, 
 as well as <I>the deceiver and accuser, of the brethren;</I> men are 
 his willing spiteful instruments, but he is the chief adversary that 
 wars against Christ and his people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15;Re+12:12">Gen. iii. 15; Rev. xii. 12</A>.

 2. The design of Satan in raising persecutions against the faithful 
 servants of God is to bring them to apostasy, by reason of their 
 sufferings, and so to destroy their souls. 

 3. Sobriety and watchfulness are necessary virtues at all times, but
 especially in times of suffering and persecution. "You must moderate 
 your affection to worldly things, or else Satan will soon overcome 
 you." 

 4. "If you would overcome Satan, as a tempter, an accuser, or a
 persecutor, you must resist him stedfast in the faith; if your faith 
 give way, you are gone; therefore, <I>above all, take the shield of 
 faith,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:16">Eph. vi. 16</A>.

 5. The consideration of what others suffer is proper to encourage us
 to bear our own share in any affliction: <I>The same afflictions are 
 accomplished in your brethren.</I></P>

 while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle <I>you.</I>
 &nbsp; 11  To him <I>be</I> glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
 &nbsp; 12  By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I
 have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the
 true grace of God wherein ye stand.
 &nbsp; 13  The <I>church that is</I> at Babylon, elected together with
 <I>you,</I> saluteth you; and <I>so doth</I> Marcus my son.

 you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We come now to the conclusion of this epistle, which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle begins with a most weighty prayer, which he addresses to 
 God as <I>the God of all grace,</I> the author and finisher of every 
 heavenly gift and quality, acknowledging, on their behalf, that God had 
 already called them to be partakers of that eternal glory, which, being 
 his own, he had promised and settled upon them, through the merit and 
 intercession of Jesus Christ. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he prays for on their account; not that they might be excused 
 from sufferings, but that their sufferings might be moderate and short, 
 and, <I>after they had suffered awhile,</I> that God would restore them 
 to a settled and peaceable condition, and perfect his work in them--that
 he would establish them against wavering, either in faith or duty, that 
 he would strengthen those who were weak, and settle them upon Christ 
 the foundation, so firmly that their union with him might be 
 indissoluble and everlasting. Learn, 

 (1.) All grace is from God; it is he who restrains, converts, comforts, 
 and saves men by his grace. 

 (2.) All who are called into a state of grace are called to partake of 
 eternal glory and happiness. 

 (3.) Those who are called to be heirs of eternal life through Jesus 
 Christ must, nevertheless, suffer in this world, but their sufferings 
 will be but for a little while. 

 (4.) The perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and settling, of good 
 people in grace, and their perseverance therein, is so difficult a 
 work, that only the God of all grace can accomplish it; and therefore 
 he is earnestly to be sought unto by continual prayer, and dependence 
 upon his promises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His doxology, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 From this doxology we may learn that those who have obtained grace from 
 the God of all grace should and will ascribe glory, dominion, and 
 power, to him for ever and ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He recapitulates the design of his writing this epistle to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 which was, 

 1. To testify, and in the strongest terms to assure them, that the 
 doctrine of salvation, which he had explained and they had embraced, 
 was the true account of the grace of God, foretold by the prophets and 
 published by Jesus Christ. 

 2. To exhort them earnestly that, as they had embraced the gospel, they
 would continue stedfast in it, notwithstanding the arts of seducers, or 
 the persecutions of enemies.

 (1.) The main thing that ministers ought to aim at in their labours is 
 to convince their people of the certainty and excellency of the 
 Christian religion; this the apostles did <I>exhort and testify</I> 
 with all their might. 

 (2.) A firm persuasion that we are in the true way to heaven will be 
 the best motive to stand fast, and persevere therein.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He recommends <I>Silvanus,</I> the person by whom he sent them 
 this brief epistle, as a brother whom he esteemed faithful and friendly 
 to them, and hoped they would account him so, though he was a ministers 
 of the uncircumcision. Observe, An honourable esteem of the ministers 
 of religion tends much to the success of their labours. When we are 
 convinced they are faithful, we shall profit more by their ministerial 
 services. The prejudices that some of these Jews might have against 
 Silvanus, as a minister of the Gentiles, would soon wear off when they 
 were once convinced that he was a faithful brother.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He closes with salutations and a solemn benediction. Observe, 

 1. Peter, being at Babylon in Assyria, when he wrote this epistle
 (whither he travelled, as the apostle of the circumcision, to visit 
 that church, which was the chief of the dispersion), sends the 
 salutation of that church to the other churches to whom he wrote 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 telling them that God had <I>elected</I> or chosen the Christians at 
 Babylon out of the world, to be his church, and to partake of eternal 
 salvation through Christ Jesus, together with them and all other 
 faithful Christians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:2"><I>ch.</I> i. 2</A>.

 In this salutation he particularly joins Mark the evangelist, who was
 then with him, and who was his son in a spiritual sense, being begotten 
 by him to Christianity. Observe, All the churches of Jesus Christ ought 
 to have a most affectionate concern one for another; they should love 
 and pray for one another, and be as helpful one to another as they 
 possibly can. 

 2. He exhorts them to fervent love and charity one towards another, and
 to express this by giving <I>the kiss of peace</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 according to the common custom of those times and countries, and so
 concludes with a benediction, which he confines to those <I>that are in 
 Christ Jesus,</I> united to him by faith and sound members of his 
 mystical body. The blessing he pronounces upon them is <I>peace,</I> by 
 which he means all necessary good, all manner of prosperity; to this he
