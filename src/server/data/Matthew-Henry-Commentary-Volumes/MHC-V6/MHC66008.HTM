 We have already seen what occurred upon opening six of the seals; we 
 now come to the opening of the seventh, which introduced the sounding 
 of the seven trumpets; and a direful scene now opens. Most expositors 
 agree that the seven seals represent the interval between the apostle's 
 time and the reign of Constantine, but that the seven trumpets are 
 designed to represent the rise of antichrist, some time after the 
 empire became Christian. In this chapter we have, 

 I. The preface, or prelude, to the sounding of the trumpets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. The sounding of four of the trumpets,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
 heaven about the space of half a hour.
 &nbsp; 2  And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to
 them were given seven trumpets.
 &nbsp; 3  And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a
 golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he
 should offer <I>it</I> with the prayers of all saints upon the golden
 altar which was before the throne.
 &nbsp; 4  And the smoke of the incense, <I>which came</I> with the prayers
 of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.
 &nbsp; 5  And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the
 altar, and cast <I>it</I> into the earth: and there were voices, and
 thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
 &nbsp; 6  And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared
 themselves to sound.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have the prelude to the sounding of the trumpets in 
 several parts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The opening of the last seal. This was to introduce a new set of 
 prophetical iconisms and events; there is a continued chain of 
 providence, one part linked to another (where one ends another begins), 
 and, though they may differ in nature and in time, they all make up one 
 wise, well-connected, uniform design in the hand of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A profound <I>silence in heaven for the space of half an hour,</I> 
 which may be understood either, 

 1. Of the silence of peace, that for this time no complaints were sent
 up to the ear of the Lord God of sabaoth; all was quiet and well in the 
 church, and therefore all silent in heaven, for whenever the church on 
 earth cries, through oppression, that cry comes up to heaven and 
 resounds there; or, 

 2. A silence of expectation; great things were upon the wheel of 
 providence, and the church of God, both in heaven and earth, stood 
 silent, as became them, to see what God was doing, according to that of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:13">Zech. ii. 13</A>,

 <I>Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord, for he has risen up out of
 his holy habitation.</I> And elsewhere, <I>Be still, and know that I am 
 God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The trumpets were delivered to the angels who were to sound them. 
 Still the angels are employed as the wise and willing instruments of 
 divine Providence, and they are furnished with all their materials and 
 instructions from God our Saviour. As the angels of the churches are to 
 sound the trumpet of the gospel, the angels of heaven are to sound the 
 trumpet of Providence, and every one has his part given him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. To prepare for this, another angel must first offer incense, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 It is very probable that this other angel is the Lord Jesus, the high 
 priest of the church, who is here described in his sacerdotal office, 
 having a golden censer and much incense, a fulness of merit in his own 
 glorious person, and this incense he was to offer up, <I>with the 
 prayers of all the saints, upon the golden altar</I> of his divine 
 nature. Observe, 

 1. All the saints are a praying people; none of the children of God are
 born dumb, a Spirit of grace is always a Spirit of adoption and
 supplication, teaching us to cry, <I>Abba, Father.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:6">Ps. xxxii. 6</A>,

 <I>For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee.</I> 

 2. Times of danger should be praying times, and so should times of
 great expectation; both our fears and our hopes should put us upon 
 prayer, and, where the interest of the church of God is deeply 
 concerned, the hearts of the people of God in prayer should be greatly 
 enlarged. 

 3. The prayers of the saints themselves stand in need of the incense
 and intercession of Christ to make them acceptable and effectual, and
 there is provision made by Christ for that purpose; he has his incense,
 his censer, and his altar; he is all himself to his people. 

 4. The prayers of the saints come up before God in a cloud of incense;
 no prayer, thus recommended, was ever denied audience or acceptance. 

 5. These prayers that were thus accepted in heaven produced great
 changes upon earth in return to them; the same angel that in his censer 
 offered up the prayers of the saints in the same censer <I>took of the 
 fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth,</I> and this presently 
 caused strange commotions, <I>voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, 
 and an earthquake;</I> these were the answers God gave to the prayers 
 of the saints, and tokens of his anger against the world and that he 
 would do great things to avenge himself and his people of their 
 enemies; and now, all things being thus prepared, the angels discharge 
 their duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire
 mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the
 third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt
 up.
 &nbsp; 8  And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain
 burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of
 the sea became blood;
 &nbsp; 9  And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea,
 and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were
 destroyed.
 &nbsp; 10  And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star
 from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the
 third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
 &nbsp; 11  And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third
 part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the
 waters, because they were made bitter.
 &nbsp; 12  And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun
 was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part
 of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the
 day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.
 &nbsp; 13  And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of
 heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the
 inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the
 trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, I. <I>The first angel sounded</I> the first trumpet, and the 
 events which followed were very dismal: <I>There followed hail and fire 
 mingled with blood,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 There was a terrible storm; but whether it is to be understood of a
 storm of heresies, a mixture of monstrous errors falling on the church 
 (for in that age Arianism prevailed), or a storm or tempest of war 
 falling on the civil state, expositors are not agreed. Mr. Mede takes 
 it to be meant of the Gothic inundation that broke in upon the empire 
 in the year 395, the same year that Theodosius died, when the northern 
 nations, under Alaricus, king of the Goths, broke in upon the western 
 parts of the empire. However, here we observe, 

 1. It was a very terrible storm-fire, and hail, and blood: a strange
 mixture! 

 2. The limitation of it: it fell on <I>the third part of the trees,</I> 
 and on the third part of <I>the grass,</I> and blasted and burnt it up; 
 that is, say some, upon <I>the third part of the clergy</I> and <I>the 
 third part of the laity;</I> or, as others who take it to fall upon the 
 civil state, upon <I>the third part of the great men,</I> and upon 
 <I>the third part of the common people,</I> either upon the Roman 
 empire itself, which was a third part of the then known world, or upon 
 a third part of that empire. The most severe calamities have their 
 bounds and limits set them by the great God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>The second angel sounded,</I> and the alarm was followed, as in 
 the first, with terrible events: <I>A great mountain burning with fire 
 was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 By this mountain some understand the leader or leaders of the heretics; 
 others, as Mr. Mede, the city of Rome, which was five times sacked by 
 the Goths and Vandals, within the compass of 137 years; first by 
 Alaricus, in the year 410, with great slaughter and cruelty. In these 
 calamities, a third part of the people (called here the sea or 
 collection of waters) were destroyed: here was still a limitation to 
 the third part, for <I>in the midst of judgment God remembers 
 mercy.</I> This storm fell heavy upon the maritime and merchandizing 
 cities and countries of the Roman empire.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. <I>The third angel sounded,</I> and the alarm had the like effects 
 as before: <I>There fell a great star from heaven,</I> &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Some take this to be a political star, some eminent governor, and they
 apply it to Augustulus, who was forced to resign the empire to Odoacer, 
 in the year 480. Others take it to be an ecclesiastical star, some 
 eminent person in the church, compared to a <I>burning lamp,</I> and 
 they fix it upon Pelagius, who proved about this time a falling star, 
 and greatly corrupted the churches of Christ. Observe, 

 1. Where this star fell: <I>Upon a third part of the rivers, and upon
 the fountains of waters.</I> 

 2. What effect it had upon them; it turned those springs and streams 
 into wormwood, made them very bitter, that men were poisoned by them; 
 either the laws, which are springs of civil liberty, and property, and 
 safety, were poisoned by arbitrary power, or the doctrines of the 
 gospel, the springs of spiritual life, refreshment, and vigour to the 
 souls of men, were so corrupted and embittered by a mixture of 
 dangerous errors that the souls of men found their ruin where they 
 sought for their refreshment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. <I>The fourth angel sounded,</I> and the alarm was followed with 
 further calamities. Observe, 

 1. The nature of this calamity; it was darkness; it fell therefore upon
 the great luminaries of the heaven, that give light to the 
 world--<I>the sun, and the moon, and the stars,</I> either the guides 
 and governors of the church, or of the state, who are placed in higher 
 orbs than the people, and are to dispense light and benign influences 
 to them. 

 2. The limitation: it was confined to a third part of these luminaries; 
 there was some light both of the sun by day, and of the moon and stars 
 by night, but it was only a third part of what they had before. Without 
 determining what is matter of controversy in these points among learned 
 men, we rather choose to make these plain and practical remarks:--

 (1.) Where the gospel comes to a people, and is but coldly received,
 and has not its proper effects upon their hearts and lives, it is 
 usually followed with dreadful judgments. 

 (2.) God gives warning to men of his judgments before he sends them; he 
 sounds an alarm by the written word, by ministers, by men's own 
 consciences, and by the signs of the times; so that, if a people be 
 surprised, it is their own fault.

 (3.) The anger of God against a people makes dreadful work among them; 
 it embitters all their comforts, and makes even life itself bitter and 
 burdensome.

 (4.) God does not in this world stir up all his wrath, but sets bounds 
 to the most terrible judgments. 

 (5.) Corruptions of doctrine and worship in the church are themselves 
 great judgments, and the usual causes and tokens of other judgments 
 coming on a people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Before the other three trumpets are sounded here is solemn warning 
 given to the world how terrible the calamities would be that should 
 follow them, and how miserable those times and places would be on which 
 they fell, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 1. The messenger was <I>an angel flying in the midst of heaven,</I> as 
 in haste, and coming on an awful errand. 

 2. The message was a denunciation of further and greater woe and misery 
 than the world had hitherto endured. Here are three woes, to show how 
 much the calamities coming should exceed those that had been already, 
 or to hint how every one of the three succeeding trumpets should 
 introduce its particular and distinct calamity. If less judgments do 
 not take effect, but the church and the world grow worse under them, 
 they must expect greater. <I>God will be known by the judgments that
 he executes;</I> and he expects, when he comes to punish the world, the 
 inhabitants thereof should tremble before him.</P>
