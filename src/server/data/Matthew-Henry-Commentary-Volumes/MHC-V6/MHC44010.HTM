 It is a turn very new and remarkable which the story of this chapter 
 gives to the Acts of the apostles; hitherto, both at Jerusalem and 
 every where else where the ministers of Christ came, they preached the 
 gospel only to the Jews, or those Greeks that were circumcised and 
 proselyted to the Jews' religion; but now, "Lo, we turn to the 
 Gentiles;" and to them the door of faith is here opened: good news
 indeed to us sinners of the Gentiles. The apostle Peter is the man that 
 is first employed to admit uncircumcised Gentiles into the Christian 
 church; and Cornelius, a Roman centurion or colonel, is the first that 
 with his family and friends is so admitted. Now here we are told, 

 I. How Cornelius was directed by a vision to send for Peter, and did
 send for him accordingly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. How Peter was directed by a vision to go to Cornelius, though he
 was a Gentile, without making any scruple of it, and did go accordingly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:9-23">ver. 9-23</A>.

 III. The happy interview between Peter and Cornelius at Cesarea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:24-33">ver. 24-33</A>.

 IV. The sermon Peter preached in the house of Cornelius to him and to 
 his friends, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:34-43">ver. 34-43</A>.

 V. The baptizing of Cornelius and his friends with the Holy Ghost 
 first, and then with water,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 There was a certain man in C&aelig;sarea called Cornelius, a
 centurion of the band called the Italian <I>band,</I>
 &nbsp; 2 <I>A</I> devout <I>man,</I> and one that feared God with all his house,
 which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.
 &nbsp; 3 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day
 an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.
 &nbsp; 4 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is
 it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are
 come up for a memorial before God.
 &nbsp; 5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for <I>one</I> Simon, whose
 surname is Peter:
 &nbsp; 6 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea
 side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.
 &nbsp; 7 And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed,
 he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of
 them that waited on him continually;
 &nbsp; 8 And when he had declared all <I>these</I> things unto them, he
 sent them to Joppa.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The bringing of the gospel to the Gentiles, and the bringing of those 
 who had been strangers and foreigners to be fellow-citizens with the 
 saints, and of the household of God, were such a mystery to the 
 apostles themselves, and such a surprise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:3,6">Eph. iii. 3, 6</A>),

 that it concerns us carefully to observe all the circumstances of the 
 beginning of this great work, this part of the <I>mystery of 
 godliness--Christ preached to the Gentiles, and believed on in this
 world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16">1 Tim. iii. 16</A>.

 It is not unlikely that some Gentiles might before now have stepped
 into a synagogue of the Jews, and heard the gospel preached; but the 
 gospel was never yet designedly preached to the Gentiles, nor any of 
 them baptized--Cornelius was the first; and here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An account given us of this Cornelius, who and what he was, who was 
 the first-born of the Gentiles to Christ. We are here told that he was 
 a great man and a good man--two characters that seldom meet, but here
 they did; and where they do meet they put a lustre upon each other: 
 goodness makes greatness truly valuable, and greatness makes goodness 
 much more serviceable. 
 
 1. Cornelius was an officer of the army,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 He was at present quartered in Cesarea, a strong city, lately 
 re-edified and fortified by Herod the Great, and called <I>Cesarea</I> 
 in honour of Augustus C&aelig;sar. It lay upon the sea-shore, very
 convenient for the keeping up of a correspondence between Rome and its 
 conquests in those parts. The Roman governor or proconsul ordinarily
 resided here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:23,24,25:6"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 23, 24; xxv. 6</A>.

 Here there was a band, or cohort, or regiment, of the Roman army, which
 probably was the governor's life-guard, and is here called <I>the 
 Italian band,</I> because, that they might be the more sure of their 
 fidelity, they were all native Romans, or Italians. Cornelius had a 
 command in this part of the army. His name, <I>Cornelius</I> was much
 used among the Romans, among some of the most ancient and noble 
 families. He was an officer of considerable rank and figure, a 
 centurion. We read of one of that rank in our Saviour's time, of whom
 he gave a great commendation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:10">Matt. viii. 10</A>.

 When a Gentile must be pitched upon to receive the gospel first, it is 
 not a Gentile philosopher, much less a Gentile priest (who are bigoted 
 to their notions and worship, and prejudiced against the gospel of 
 Christ), but a Gentile soldier, who is a man of more free thought; and 
 he that truly is so, when the Christian doctrine is fairly set before 
 him, cannot but receive it and bid it welcome. Fishermen, unlearned and 
 ignorant men, were the first of the Jewish converts, but not so of the 
 Gentiles; for the world shall know that the gospel has that in it which 
 may recommend it to men of polite learning and a liberal education, as 
 we have reason to think this centurion was. Let not soldiers and 
 officers of the army plead that their employment frees them from the 
 restraints which some others are under, and, giving them an opportunity 
 of living more at large, may excuse them if they be not religious; for 
 here was an officer of the army that embraced Christianity, and yet was 
 neither turned out of his place nor turned himself out. And, 
 <I>lastly,</I> it was a mortification to the Jews that not only the 
 Gentiles were taken into the church, but that the first who was taken 
 in was an officer of the Roman army, which was to them <I>the 
 abomination of desolation.</I> 

 2. He was, according to the measure of the light he had, a religious
 man. It is a very good character that is given of him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He was no idolater, no worshipper of false gods or images, nor allowed 
 himself in any of those immoralities to which the greater part of the 
 Gentile world were given up, to punish them for their idolatry.

 (1.) He was possessed with a principle of regard to the true and living 
 God. He was <I>a devout man and one that feared God.</I> He believed in 
 one God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and had a reverence for his 
 glory and authority, and a dread of offending him by sin; and, though 
 he was a soldier, it was no diminution to the credit of his valour to 
 tremble before God. 

 (2.) He kept up religion in his family. He <I>feared God with all his 
 house.</I> He would not admit any idolaters under his roof, but took 
 care that not himself only, but all his, should serve the Lord. Every 
 good man will do what he can that those about him may be good too. 

 (3.) He was a very charitable man: He <I>gave much alms to the 
 people,</I> the people of the Jews, notwithstanding the singularities 
 of their religion. Though he was a Gentile, he was willing to 
 contribute to the relief of one that was a real object of charity, 
 without asking what religion he was of. 

 (4.) He was much in prayer: He <I>prayed to God always.</I> He kept up 
 stated times for prayer, and was constant to them. Note, Wherever the 
 fear of God rules in the heart, it will appear both in works of charity 
 and of piety, and neither will excuse us from the other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The orders given him from heaven, by the ministry of an angel, to 
 send for Peter to come to him, which he would never have done if he had 
 not been thus directed to do it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How, and in what way, these orders were given him. He had a vision, 
 in which an angel delivered them to him. It was about the <I>ninth hour 
 of the day,</I> at three of the clock in the afternoon, which is with 
 us an hour of business and conversation; but then, because it was in 
 the temple the time of offering the evening sacrifice, it was made by 
 devout people an <I>hour of prayer,</I> to intimate that all our 
 prayers are to be offered up in the virtue of the great sacrifice. 
 Cornelius was now at prayer: so he tells us himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 Now here we are told,

 (1.) That an angel of God <I>came in to him.</I> By the brightness of 
 his countenance, and the manner of his coming in, he knew him to be 
 something more than a man, and therefore nothing less than an angel, an 
 express from heaven. 

 (2.) That he <I>saw him evidently</I> with his bodily eyes, not in a 
 dream presented to his imagination, but in a vision presented to his 
 sight; for his greater satisfaction, it carried its own evidence along 
 with it.

 (3.) That he called him by his name, <I>Cornelius,</I> to intimate the 
 particular notice God took of him.

 (4.) That this put Cornelius for the present into some confusion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>When he looked on him he was afraid.</I> The wisest and best men 
 have been struck with fear upon the appearance of any extra-ordinary 
 messenger from heaven; and justly, for sinful man knows that he has no 
 reason to expect any good tidings thence. And therefore Cornelius 
 cries, "<I>What is it, Lord?</I> What is the matter?" This he speaks as 
 one afraid of something amiss, and longing to be eased of that fear, by 
 knowing the truth; or as one desirous to know the mind of God, and 
 ready to comply with it, as Joshua: <I>What saith my Lord unto his 
 servant?</I> And Samuel: <I>Speak, for thy servant heareth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the message was that was delivered to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He is assured that God accepts him in walking according to the 
 light he had 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before 
 God.</I> Observe, Prayers and alms must go together. We must follow our 
 prayers with alms; for the fast that God hath chosen is to <I>draw out 
 the soul to the hungry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:6,7">Isa. lviii. 6, 7</A>.

 It is not enough to pray that what we have may be sanctified to us, but
 we must <I>give alms of such things as we have;</I> and then, behold, 
 all things are clean to us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:41">Luke xi. 41</A>.

 And we must follow our alms with our prayers that God would graciously
 accept them, and that they may be blessed to those to whom they are 
 given. Cornelius prayed, and gave alms, not as the Pharisees, <I>to be 
 seen of men,</I> but in sincerity, as unto God; and he is here told 
 that they were <I>come up for a memorial before God.</I> They were upon 
 record in heaven, in the book of remembrance that is written there for 
 all that fear God, and shall be remembered to his advantage: "Thy 
 prayers shall be answered, and thine alms recompensed." The sacrifices 
 under the law are said to be <I>for a memorial.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+2:9,16,5:12,6:15">Lev. ii. 9, 16; v. 12; vi. 15</A>.

 And prayers and alms are our spiritual offerings, which God is pleased 
 to take cognizance of, and have regard to. The divine revelation 
 communicated to the Jews, as far as the Gentiles were concerned in it, 
 not only as it directed and improved the light and law of nature, but 
 as it promised a Messiah to come, Cornelius believed and submitted to. 
 What he did he did in that faith, and was accepted of God in it; for 
 the Gentiles, to whom the law of Moses came, were not obliged to become 
 circumcised Jews, as those to whom the gospel of Christ comes are to 
 become baptized Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He is appointed to enquire after a further discovery of divine 
 grace, now lately made to the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 He must <I>send</I> forthwith <I>to Joppa, and enquire for one Simon 
 Peter; he lodgeth at the house of one Simon a tanner; his house is by 
 the sea side,</I> and, if he be sent for, he will come; and <I>when he 
 comes he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do,</I> in answer to thy 
 question, <I>What is it, Lord?</I> Now here are two things very 
 surprising, and worthy our consideration--

 [1.] Cornelius prays and gives alms in the fear of God, is religious 
 himself and keeps up religion in his family, and all this so as to be 
 accepted of God in it, and yet there is something further that he ought 
 to do--he ought to embrace the Christian religion, now that God has
 established it among men. Not, He may do it if he pleases; it will be 
 an improvement and entertainment to him. But, He must do it; it is 
 indispensably necessary to his acceptance with God for the future, 
 though he has been accepted in his services hitherto. He that believed
 the promise of the Messiah must now believe the performance of that 
 promise. Now that God has given a further record concerning his Son 
 than what had been given in the Old-Testament prophecies he requires 
 that we receive this when it is brought to us; and now neither our 
 prayers nor our alms can come up for a memorial before God unless we 
 believe in Jesus Christ, for it is that further which we ought to do. 
 <I>This is his commandment, that we believe.</I> Prayers and alms are 
 accepted from those that believe that the Lord is God, and have not 
 opportunity of knowing more; but, from those to whom it is preached 
 that Jesus is Christ, it is necessary to the acceptance of their 
 persons, prayers, and alms, that they believe this, and rest upon him 
 alone for acceptance. 

 [2.] Cornelius has now an angel from heaven talking to him, and yet he 
 must not receive the gospel of Christ from this angel, nor be told by 
 him what he ought to do, but all that the angel has to say is, "Send 
 for Peter, and he shall tell thee." As the former observation puts a 
 mighty honour upon the gospel, so does this upon the gospel ministry: 
 it was not to the highest of angels, but to those who were less that 
 the least of all saints, that this grace was given, <I>to preach among 
 the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:8">Eph. iii. 8</A>),

 that the excellency of the power might be of God, and the dignity of an 
 institution of Christ supported; for <I>unto the angels hath he not put 
 in subjection the world to come</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:5">Heb. ii. 5</A>),

 but to the Son of man as the sovereign, and the sons of men as his 
 agents and ministers of state, whose <I>terrors shall not make us 
 afraid, nor their hand be heavy upon us,</I> as this angel's now was to 
 Cornelius. And as it was an honour to the apostle that he must preach 
 that which an angel might not, so it was a further honour that an angel 
 was despatched on purpose from heaven to order him to be sent for. To 
 bring a faithful minister and a willing people together is a work 
 worthy of an angel, and what therefore the greatest of men should be 
 glad to be employed in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His immediate obedience to these orders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 He sent with all speed to Joppa, to fetch Peter to him. Had he himself 
 only been concerned, he would have gone to Joppa to him. But he had a 
 family, and kinsmen, and friends

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 a little congregation of them, that could not go with him to Joppa, and 
 therefore he sends for Peter. Observe, 

 1. When he sent: As soon as ever the <I>angel which spoke unto him had
 departed,</I> without dispute or delay, he was obedient to the heavenly 
 vision. He perceived, by what the angel said, he was to have some 
 further work prescribed him, and he longed to have it told him. He made 
 haste, and delayed not, to do this commandment. In any affair wherein 
 our souls are concerned it is good for us not to lose time.

 2. Whom he sent: <I>Two of his household servants,</I> who all feared
 God, <I>and a devout soldier,</I> one of those <I>that waited on him 
 continually.</I> Observe, a devout centurion had devout soldiers. A 
 little devotion commonly goes a great way with soldiers, but there 
 would be more of it in the soldiers if there were but more of it in the 
 commanders. Officers in an army, that have such a great power over the
 soldiers, as we find the centurion had

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:9">Matt. viii. 9</A>),

 have a great opportunity of promoting religion, at least of restraining 
 vice and profaneness, in those under their command, if they would but 
 improve it. Observe, When this centurion had to choose some of his 
 soldiers to attend his person, and to be always about him, he pitched 
 upon such of them as were devout; they shall be preferred and 
 countenanced, to encourage others to be so. He went by David's rule 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:6">Ps. ci. 6</A>),

 <I>Mine eye shall be upon the faithful in the land, that they may dwell 
 with me.</I> 
 
 3. What instructions he gave them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>He declared all these things unto them,</I> told them of the vision 
 he had, and the orders given him to send for Peter, because Peter's 
 coming was a thing in which they were concerned, for they had souls to 
 save as well as he. Therefore he does not only tell them where to find
 Peter (which he might have thought it enough to do--the <I>servant knows
 not what his Lord doeth</I>), but he tells them on what errand he was 
 to come, that they might importune him.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh
 unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the
 sixth hour:
 &nbsp; 10 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while
 they made ready, he fell into a trance,
 &nbsp; 11 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto
 him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and
 let down to the earth:
 &nbsp; 12 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth,
 and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
 &nbsp; 13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
 &nbsp; 14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any
 thing that is common or unclean.
 &nbsp; 15 And the voice <I>spake</I> unto him again the second time, What
 God hath cleansed, <I>that</I> call not thou common.
 &nbsp; 16 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again
 into heaven.
 &nbsp; 17 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he
 had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from
 Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before
 the gate,
 &nbsp; 18 And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed
 Peter, were lodged there.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Cornelius had received positive orders from heaven to send for Peter, 
 whom otherwise he had not heard of, or at least not heeded; but here is 
 another difficulty that lies in the way of bringing them together--the
 question is whether Peter will come to Cornelius when he is sent for; 
 not as if he thought it below him to come at a beck, or as if he were 
 afraid to preach his doctrine to a polite man as Cornelius was: but it 
 sticks at a point of conscience. Cornelius is a very worthy man, and 
 has many good qualities, but he is a Gentile, he is not circumcised; 
 and, because God in his law had forbidden his people to associate with 
 idolatrous nations, they would not keep company with any but those of 
 their own religion, though they were ever so deserving, and they 
 carried the matter so far that they made even the involuntary touch of 
 a Gentile to contract a ceremonial pollution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:28">John xviii. 28</A>.

 Peter had not got over this stingy bigoted notion of his countrymen,
 and therefore will be shy of coming to Cornelius. Now, to remove this
 difficulty, he has a vision here, to prepare him to receive the message 
 sent him by Cornelius, as Ananias had to prepare him to go to Paul. The 
 scriptures of the Old Testament had spoken plainly of the bringing in 
 of the Gentiles into the church. Christ had given plain intimations of 
 it when he ordered them to <I>teach all nations;</I> and yet even Peter 
 himself, who knew so much of his Master's mind, could not understand 
 it, till it was here revealed by vision, <I>that the Gentiles should be 
 fellow-heirs,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:6">Eph. iii. 6</A>.

 Now here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The circumstances of this vision.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was when the messengers sent from Cornelius were now <I>nigh the 
 city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Peter knew nothing of their approach, and they knew nothing of his 
 praying; but he that knew both him and them was preparing things for 
 the interview, and facilitating the end of their negotiation. To all 
 God's purposes <I>there is a time,</I> a proper time; and he is pleased 
 often to bring things to the minds of his ministers, which they had not 
 thought of, just then when they have occasion to use them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was when <I>Peter went up upon the house-top to pray,</I> about 
 noon. 

 (1.) Peter was much in prayer, much in secret prayer, though he had a 
 great deal of public work upon his hands. 

 (2.) He prayed <I>about the sixth hour,</I> according to David's 
 example, who, not only <I>morning and evening,</I> but <I>at noon,</I> 
 addressed himself to God by prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:17">Ps. lv. 17</A>.

 From morning to night we should think to be too long to be without
 meat; yet who thinks it is too long to be without prayer?

 (3.) He prayed <I>upon the house-top;</I> thither he retired for 
 privacy, where he could neither hear nor be heard, and so might avoid 
 both distraction and ostentation. There, upon the roof of the house,
 he had a full view of the heavens, which might assist his pious 
 adoration of the God he prayed to; and there he had also a full view of 
 the city and country, which might assist his pious compassion of the 
 people he prayed for. 

 (4.) He had this vision immediately after he had prayed, as an answer 
 to his prayer for the spreading of the gospel, and because the ascent 
 of the heart to God in prayer is an excellent preparative to receive 
 the discoveries of the divine grace and favour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It was when he became <I>very hungry,</I> and was waiting for his 
 dinner

 probably he had not that day eaten before, though doubtless he had 
 prayed before; and now <I>he would have eaten,</I> <B><I>ethele 
 geusasthai</I></B>--<I>he would have tasted,</I> which intimates his
 great moderation and temperance in eating. When he was very hungry, yet 
 he would be content with a little, with a taste, and would not <I>fly 
 upon the spoil.</I> Now this hunger was a proper inlet to the vision 
 about meats, as Christ's hunger in the wilderness was to Satan's 
 temptation to turn stones into bread.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The vision itself, which was not so plain as that to Cornelius, but 
 more figurative and enigmatical, to make the deeper impression. 

 1. He <I>fell into a trance or ecstasy,</I> not of terror, but of
 contemplation, with which he was so entirely swallowed up as not only 
 not to be regardful, but not to be sensible, of external things. He 
 quite lost himself to this world, and so had his mind entirely free for 
 converse with divine things; as Adam in innocency, when the deep sleep 
 fell upon him. The more clear we get of the world, the more near we get 
 to heaven: whether Peter was now <I>in the body or out of the body</I> 
 he could not himself tell, much less can we, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:2,3">2 Cor. xii. 2, 3</A>.
 
 See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:12,Ac+22:17">Gen. xv. 12; Acts xxii. 17</A>.

 2. He <I>saw heaven opened,</I> that he might be sure that his
 authority to go to Cornelius was indeed from heaven--that it was a
 divine light which altered his sentiments, and a divine power which 
 gave him his commission. The opening of the heavens signified the 
 opening of a mystery that had been hid, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:25">Rom. xvi. 25</A>.

 3. He saw <I>a great sheet full of all manner of living creatures,
 which descended from heaven, and was let down to him to the earth,</I> 
 that is, to the roof of the house where he now was. Here were not only 
 beasts of the earth, but fowls of the air, which might have flown away, 
 laid at his feet; and not only tame beasts, but wild. Here were no 
 fishes of the sea, because there were none of them in particular 
 unclean, but whatever had fins and scales was allowed to be eaten. Some 
 make this sheet, thus filled, to represent the church of Christ. It 
 comes down from heaven, from heaven opened, not only to send it down

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:2">Rev. xxi. 2</A>),
 
 but to receive souls sent up from it. It is knit at the four corners, 
 to receive those from all parts of the world that are willing to be 
 added to it; and to retain and keep those safe that are taken into it, 
 that they may not fall out; and in this we find some of all countries, 
 nations, and languages, without any distinction of Greek or Jew, or any 
 disadvantage put upon Barbarian or Scythian, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:11">Col. iii. 11</A>.

 The net of the gospel encloses all, both bad and good, those that
 before were clean and unclean. Or it may be applied to the bounty of 
 the divine Providence, which, antecedently to the prohibitions of the 
 ceremonial law, had given to man a liberty to use all the creatures, to 
 which by the cancelling of that law we are now restored. By this vision 
 we are taught to see all the benefit and service we have from the 
 inferior creatures coming down to us from heaven; it is the gift of God 
 who made them, made them fit for us, and then gave to man a right to 
 them, and dominion over them. Lord, what is man that he should be thus 
 magnified!
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:4-8">Ps. viii. 4-8</A>.

 How should it double our comfort in the creatures, and our obligations
 to serve God in the use of them, to see them thus let down to us out of 
 heaven!

 4. He was ordered by a voice from heaven to make use of this plenty and
 variety which God had sent him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 "<I>Rise, Peter, kill and eat:</I> without putting any difference 
 between clean and unclean, take which thou hast most mind to." The 
 distinction of meats which the law made was intended to put a 
 difference between Jew and Gentile, that it might be difficult to them 
 to dine and sup with a Gentile, because they would have that set before 
 them which they were not allowed to eat; and now the taking off of that 
 prohibition was a plain allowance to converse with the Gentiles, and to 
 be free and familiar with them. Now they might fare as they fared, and 
 therefore might eat with them, and be fellow-commoners with them. 

 5. He stuck to his principles, and would by no means hearken to the
 motion, though he was hungry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Not so, Lord.</I> Though hunger will break through stone walls, 
 God's laws should be to us a stronger fence than stone walls, and not 
 so easily broken through. And he will adhere to God's laws, though he 
 has a countermand by a voice from heaven, not knowing at first but that 
 <I>Kill, and eat,</I> was a command of trial whether he would adhere to 
 the more sure word, the written law; and if so his answer had been very 
 good, <I>Not so, Lord.</I> Temptations to eat forbidden fruit must not 
 be parleyed with, but peremptorily rejected; we must startle at the 
 thought of it: <I>Not so, Lord.</I> The reason he gives is, "<I>For I 
 have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean;</I> hitherto I 
 have kept my integrity in this matter, and will still keep it." If God, 
 by his grace, has preserved us from gross sin unto this day, we should 
 use this as an argument with ourselves to abstain <I>from all 
 appearance of evil.</I> So strict were the pious Jews in this matter, 
 that the seven brethren, those glorious martyrs under Antiochus, choose 
 rather to be tortured to death in the most cruel manner that ever was 
 than to eat swine's flesh, because it was forbidden by the law. No 
 wonder then that Peter says it with so much pleasure, that his 
 conscience could witness for him that he had never gratified his 
 appetite with any forbidden food. 

 6. God, by a second voice from heaven, proclaimed the repeal of the law
 in this case

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>What God hath cleansed, that call thou not common.</I> He that made 
 the law might alter it when he pleased, and reduce the matter to its 
 first state. God had, for reasons suited to the Old-Testament 
 dispensation, restrained the Jews from eating such and such meats, to 
 which, while that dispensation lasted, they were obliged in conscience 
 to submit; but he has now, for reasons suited to the New-Testament 
 dispensation, taken off that restraint, and set the matter at 
 large--has cleansed that which was before polluted to us, and we ought
 to make use of, and <I>stand fast in, the liberty wherewith Christ has 
 made us free,</I> and not call that common or unclean which God has now 
 declared clean. Note, We ought to welcome it as a great mercy that by
 the gospel of Christ we are freed from the distinction of meats, which 
 was made by the law of Moses, and that now <I>every creature of God is 
 good, and nothing to be refused;</I> not so much because hereby we gain 
 the use of swine's flesh, hares, rabbits, and other pleasant and 
 wholesome food for our bodies, but chiefly because conscience is hereby 
 freed from a yoke in things of this nature, <I>that we might serve God 
 without fear.</I> Though the gospel has made duties which were not so 
 by the law of nature, yet it has not, like the law of Moses, made sins 
 that were not so. Those who command to abstain from some kinds of meat 
 at some times of the year, and place religion in it, call that common 
 which God hath cleansed, and in that error, more than in any truth, are 
 the successors of Peter. 
 
 7. <I>This was done thrice,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The sheet was drawn up a little way, and let down again the second 
 time, and so the third time, with the same call to him, to kill, and 
 eat, and the same reason, that what God hath cleansed we must not call 
 common; but whether Peter's refusal was repeated the second and third 
 time is not certain; surely it was not, when his objection had the 
 first time received such a satisfactory answer. The trebling of Peter's 
 vision, like the doubling of Pharaoh's dream, was to show that <I>the 
 thing was certain,</I> and engage him to take so much the more notice 
 of it. The instructions given us in the things of God, whether by the 
 ear in the preaching of the word, or by the eye in sacraments, need to 
 be often repeated; <I>precept must be upon precept, and line upon 
 line.</I> But at last <I>the vessel was received up into heaven.</I> 
 Those who make this vessel to represent the church, including both Jews 
 and Gentiles, as this did both clean and unclean creatures, make this 
 very aptly to signify the admission of the believing Gentiles into the 
 church, and into heaven too, into the Jerusalem above. Christ <I>has 
 opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers,</I> and there we shall 
 find, besides <I>those that are sealed out of all the tribes of 
 Israel,</I> an <I>innumerable company out of every nation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>);

 but they are such as God has cleansed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The providence which very opportunely explained this vision, and 
 gave Peter to understand the intention of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 1. What Christ did, Peter knew not just then

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:7">John xiii. 7</A>):

 <I>He doubted within himself what this vision which he had seen should 
 mean.</I> He had no reason to doubt the truth of it, that it was a 
 heavenly vision; all his doubt was concerning the meaning of it. Note, 
 Christ reveals himself to his people by degrees, and not all at once; 
 and leaves them to doubt awhile, to ruminate upon a thing, and debate 
 it to and fro in their own minds, before he clears it up to them. 

 2. Yet he was made to know presently, for <I>the men who were sent
 from Cornelius</I> were just now come to <I>the house,</I> and were at 
 <I>the gate enquiring whether Peter lodged there;</I> and by their 
 errand it will appear what was the meaning of this vision. Note, God 
 knows what services are before us, and therefore how to prepare us; and 
 we then better know the meaning of what he has taught us when we find 
 what occasion we have to make use of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,
 Behold, three men seek thee.
 &nbsp; 20 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them,
 doubting nothing: for I have sent them.
 &nbsp; 21 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him
 from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what <I>is</I>
 the cause wherefore ye are come?
 &nbsp; 22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one
 that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the
 Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee into
 his house, and to hear words of thee.
 &nbsp; 23 Then called he them in, and lodged <I>them.</I> And on the morrow
 Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa
 accompanied him.
 &nbsp; 24 And the morrow after they entered into C&aelig;sarea. And
 Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen
 and near friends.
 &nbsp; 25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down
 at his feet, and worshipped <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a
 man.
 &nbsp; 27 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that
 were come together.
 &nbsp; 28 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful
 thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one
 of another nation; but God hath showed me that I should not call
 any man common or unclean.
 &nbsp; 29 Therefore came I <I>unto you</I> without gainsaying, as soon as I
 was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for
 me?
 &nbsp; 30 And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this
 hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a
 man stood before me in bright clothing,
 &nbsp; 31 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are
 had in remembrance in the sight of God.
 &nbsp; 32 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose
 surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of <I>one</I> Simon a
 tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto
 thee.
 &nbsp; 33 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well
 done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present
 before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the meeting between Peter the apostle, and Cornelius the 
 centurion. Though Paul was designed to be the apostle of the Gentiles, 
 and to gather in the harvest among them, and Peter to be the apostle of 
 the circumcision, yet it is ordered that Peter shall break the ice, and 
 reap the first-fruits of the Gentiles, that the believing Jews, who 
 retained too much of the old leaven of ill-will to the Gentiles, might 
 be the better reconciled to their admission into the church, when they 
 were first brought in by their own apostle, which Peter urges against 
 those that would have imposed circumcision upon the Gentile converts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:7"><I>ch.</I> xv. 7</A>),

 <I>You know that God made choice among us that the Gentiles by my mouth
 should hear the word of the gospel.</I> Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Peter is directed by the Spirit to go along with Cornelius's 
 messengers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>),

 and this is the exposition of the vision; now the riddle is unriddled: 
 <I>While Peter thought on the vision;</I> he was musing upon it, and 
 then it was opened to him. Note, Those that would be taught the things 
 of God must think on those things; those that would understand the 
 scriptures must meditate in them day and night. He was at a loss about 
 it, and then had it explained, which encourages us, when we know not 
 what to do, to have our eyes up unto God for direction. Observe, 

 1. Whence he had the direction. The Spirit said to him what he should
 do. It was not spoken to him by an angel, but spoken in him by the
 Spirit, secretly whispering it in his ear as it were, as God spoke to 
 Samuel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:15">1 Sam. ix. 15</A>),

 or impressing it powerfully upon his mind, so that he knew it to be a 
 divine afflatus or inspiration, according to the promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:13">John xvi. 13</A>.

 2. What the direction was.

 (1.) He is told, before any of the servants could come up to tell him, 
 that three men below want to speak with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and he must arise from his musings, leave off thinking of the vision, 
 and go down to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Those that are searching into the meaning of the words of God, and the 
 visions of the Almighty, should not be always poring, no, nor always 
 praying, but should sometimes look abroad, look about them, and they 
 may meet with that which will be of use to them in their enquiries; for 
 the scripture is in the fulfilling every day.

 (2.) He is ordered to <I>go along with the messengers to Cornelius,</I> 
 though he was a Gentile, <I>doubting nothing.</I> He must not only go, 
 but go cheerfully, without reluctance or hesitation, or any scruple 
 concerning the lawfulness of it; not doubting whether he might go, no, 
 nor whether he ought to go; for it was his duty "<I>Go with them, for I 
 have sent them:</I> and I will bear thee out in going along with them, 
 however thou mayest be censured for it." Note, When we see our call 
 clear to any service, we should not suffer ourselves to be perplexed 
 with doubts and scruples concerning it arising from former prejudices 
 or pre-possessions, or a fear of men's censure. <I>Let every man be
 fully persuaded in his own mind, and prove his own work.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He receives both them and their message: <I>He went down to 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 So far was he from going out of the way, or refusing to be spoken with, 
 as one that was shy of them, or making them tarry, as one that took 
 state upon him, that he went to them himself, told them he was the 
 person they were enquiring for. And 

 1. He favourably receives their message; with abundance of openness and
 condescension he asks what their business is, what they have to say to 
 him: <I>What is the cause wherefore you are come?</I> and they tell him 
 their errand

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>Cornelius,</I> an officer of the Roman army, a very honest 
 gentleman, and one who has more religion than most of his neighbours, 
 <I>who fears God above many</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:2">Neh. vii. 2</A>),

 who, though he is not a Jew himself, has carried it so well that he is 
 <I>of good report among all the people of the Jews</I>--they will all
 give him a good word, for a conscientious, sober, charitable man, so 
 that it will be no discredit to thee to be seen in his company--he
 <I>was warned from God,</I>" <B><I>echrematisthe</I></B>--"<I>he had an
 oracle from God,</I> sent to him by an angel" (and the lively oracles 
 of the law of Moses were given by the disposition of angels), "by which 
 he was ordered to send for thee to his house (where he is expecting 
 thee, and ready to bid thee welcome), <I>and to hear words of thee:</I> 
 they know not what words, but they are such as he may hear from thee, 
 and not from any one else so well." <I>Faith comes by hearing.</I> When 
 Peter repeats this, he tells us more fully, they are <I>words whereby 
 thou and all thy house shall be saved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:14"><I>ch.</I> xi. 14</A>.

 "Come to him, for an angel bade him send for thee: come to him, for he
 is ready to hear and receive the saving words thou hast to bring to 
 him." 
 
 2. He kindly entertained the messengers
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>He called them in, and lodged them.</I> He did not bid them go and 
 refresh and repose themselves in an inn at their own charge, but was 
 himself at the charge of entertaining them in his own quarters. What 
 was getting ready for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 they should be welcome to share in; he little thought what company he 
 should have when he bespoke his dinner, but God foresaw it. Note, It 
 becomes Christians and ministers to be hospitable, and ready, according 
 as their ability is, and there is occasion for it, <I>to entertain 
 strangers.</I> Peter lodged them, though they were Gentiles, to show 
 how readily he complied with the design of the vision in eating with 
 Gentiles; for he immediately took them to eat with him. Though they
 were two of them servants, and the other a common soldier, yet Peter 
 thought it not below him to take them into his house. Probably he did
 it that he might have some talk with them about Cornelius and his 
 family; for the apostles, though they had instructions from the Spirit, 
 yet made use of other information, as they had occasion for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He <I>went with them</I> to Cornelius, whom he found ready to 
 receive and entertain him. 

 1. Peter, when he went with them, was <I>accompanied by certain
 brethren from Joppa,</I> where he now was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Six of them went along with him, as we find,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:12"><I>ch.</I> xi. 12</A>.

 Either Peter desired their company, that they might be witnesses of his
 proceeding cautiously with reference to the Gentiles, and of the good 
 ground on which he went, and therefore he invited them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:12"><I>ch.</I> xi. 12</A>),

 or they offered their service to attend him, and desired they might
 have the honour and happiness of being his fellow travellers. This was 
 one way in which the primitive Christians very much showed their 
 respect to their ministers: they accompanied them in their journeys, to 
 keep them in countenance, to be their guard, and, as there was 
 occasion, to minister to them; with a further prospect not only of 
 doing them service, but of being edified by their converse. It is a 
 pity that those who have skill and will to do good to others by their 
 discourse should want an opportunity for it by travelling alone. 

 2. Cornelius, when he was ready to receive him, <I>had got some
 friends together of Cesarea.</I> It seems, it was above a day's 
 journey, nearly two, from Joppa to Cesarea; for it was <I>the day 
 after</I> they set out that <I>they entered into Cesarea</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 and the afternoon of that day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 It is probable that they travelled on foot; the apostles generally did 
 so. Now when they came into the house of Cornelius Peter found,

 (1.) That he was expected, and this was an encouragement to him.
 <I>Cornelius waited for them,</I> and such a guest was worth waiting 
 for; nor can I blame him if he waited with some impatience, longing to 
 know what that mighty thing was which an angel bade him expect to hear 
 from Peter. 

 (2.) That he was expected by many, and this was a further encouragement 
 to him. As Peter brought some with him to partake of the spiritual gift 
 he had now to dispense, so <I>Cornelius had called together,</I> not 
 only his own family, but <I>kinsmen and near friends,</I> to partake 
 with him of the heavenly instructions he expected from Peter, which 
 would give Peter a larger opportunity of doing good. Note, We should 
 not covet to eat our spiritual morsels alone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:17">Job xxxi. 17</A>.

 It ought to be both given and taken as a piece of kindness and respect
 to our kindred and friends to invite them to join with us in religious 
 exercises, to go with us to hear a sermon. What Cornelius ought to do 
 he thought his kinsmen and friends ought to do too; and therefore let 
 them come and hear it at the first hand, that it may be no surprise to 
 them to see him change upon it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is the first interview between Peter and Cornelius, in which 
 we have, 

 1. The profound and indeed undue respect and honour which Cornelius
 paid to Peter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>He met him as he was coming in,</I> and instead of taking him in his 
 arms, and embracing him as a friend, which would have been very 
 acceptable to Peter, <I>he fell down at his feet, and worshipped 
 him;</I> some think, as a prince and a great man, according to the 
 usage of the eastern countries; others think, as an incarnate deity, or 
 as if he took him to be the Messiah himself. His worshipping a man was 
 indeed culpable; but, considering his present ignorance, it was 
 excusable, nay, and it was an evidence of something in him that was 
 very commendable--and that was a great veneration for divine and
 heavenly things: no wonder if, till he was better informed, he took him 
 to be the Messiah, and therefore worshipped him, whom he was ordered to 
 send for by an angel from heaven. But the worshipping of his pretended 
 successor, who is not only a man, but a sinful man, the man of sin 
 himself, is altogether inexcusable, and such an absurdity as would be 
 incredible if we were not told before that all <I>the world would 
 worship the beast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:4">Rev. xiii. 4</A>.

 2. Peter's modest and indeed just and pious refusal of this honour that 
 was done him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>He took him up</I> into his arms, with his own hands (though time
 was when he little thought he should ever either receive so much 
 respect from or show so much affection to an uncircumcised Gentile), 
 <I>saying, "Stand up, I myself also am a man,</I> and therefore not to 
 be worshipped thus." The good angels of the churches, like the good 
 angels of heaven, cannot bear to have the least of that honour shown to 
 them which is due to God only. <I>See thou do it not,</I> saith the 
 angel to John 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:10,22:9">Rev. xix. 10; xxii. 9</A>),

 and in like manner the apostle to Cornelius. How careful was Paul 
 <I>that no man should think of him above what he saw in him!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:6">2 Cor. xii. 6</A>.

 Christ's faithful servants could better bear to be vilified than to be
 deified. Peter did not entertain a surmise that his great respect for 
 him, though excessive, might contribute to the success of his 
 preaching, and therefore if he will be deceived let him be deceived; 
 no, let him know that Peter is a man, that <I>the treasure is in 
 earthen vessels,</I> that he may value the treasure for its own 
 sake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The account which Peter and Cornelius give to each other, and to the 
 company, of the hand of Heaven in bringing them together: <I>As he 
 talked with him</I>--<B><I>synomilon auto,</I></B> <I>he went in,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Peter went in, talking familiarly with Cornelius, endeavouring, by the 
 freedom of his converse with him, to take off something of that dread 
 which he seemed to have of him; and, when he came in, <I>he found many 
 that were come together,</I> more than he expected, which added 
 solemnity, as well as opportunity of doing good, to this service.
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Peter declares the direction God gave to him to come to those 
 Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.

 They knew it had never been allowed by the Jews, but always looked upon 
 as an <I>unlawful thing,</I> <B><I>athemiton</I></B>--<I>an
 abomination, for a man that is a Jew,</I> a native Jew as I am, <I>to 
 keep company or come unto one of another nation,</I> a stranger, an 
 uncircumcised Gentile. It was not made so by the law of God, but by the 
 decree of their wise men, which they looked upon to be no less binding. 
 They did not forbid them to converse or traffic with Gentiles in the 
 street or shop, or upon the exchange, but to eat with them. Even in 
 Joseph's time, the Egyptians and Hebrews could not eat together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+43:32">Gen. xliii. 32</A>.

 The three children <I>would not defile themselves with the king's 
 meat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:8">Dan. i. 8</A>.

 They might not come into the house of a Gentile, for they looked upon
 it to be ceremonially polluted. Thus scornfully did the Jews look upon 
 the Gentiles, who were not behindhand with them in contempt, as appears 
 by many passages in the Latin poets. "<I>But now,</I>" saith Peter,
 "<I>God hath shown me,</I> by a vision, <I>that I should not call any 
 man common or unclean,</I> nor refuse to converse with any man for the 
 sake of his country." Peter, who had taught his new converts to <I>save 
 themselves from the untoward generation of wicked men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:40"><I>ch.</I> ii. 40</A>),

 is now himself taught to join himself with the towardly generation of 
 devout Gentiles. Ceremonial characters were abolished, that more regard 
 might be had to moral ones. Peter thought it necessary to let them know 
 how he came to change his mind in this matter, and that it was by a 
 divine revelation, lest he should be upbraided with it as having used 
 lightness. God having thus taken down the partition-wall, 

 (1.) He assures them of his readiness to do them all the good offices 
 he could; that, when he kept at a distance, it was not out of any 
 personal disgust to them, but only because he wanted leave from heaven, 
 and, having now received permission, he was at their service: 
 "<I>Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent 
 for,</I> ready to preach the same gospel to you that I have preached to 
 the Jews." The disciples of Christ could not but have some notion of 
 the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, but they imagined it must 
 be only to those Gentiles that were first proselyted to the Jewish 
 religion, which mistake Peter acknowledges was not rectified. 

 (2.) He enquires wherein he might be serviceable to them: "<I>I ask, 
 therefore, for what intent you have sent for me?</I> What do you expect 
 from me, or what business have you with me?" Note, Those that desire 
 the help of God's ministers ought to look well to it that they propose 
 right ends to themselves in it, and do it with a good intention.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Cornelius declares the directions God gave to him to send for Peter, 
 and that it was purely in obedience to those directions that he had 
 sent for him. Then we are right in our aims, in sending for and 
 attending on a gospel-ministry, when we did it with a regard to the 
 divine appointment instituting that ordinance and requiring us to make 
 use of it. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Cornelius gives an account of the angel's appearing to him, and 
 ordering him to send for Peter; not as glorying in it, but as that 
 which warranted his expectation of a message from heaven by Peter. 

 [1.] He tells how this vision found him employed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>Four days ago I was fasting until this hour,</I> this hour of the 
 day that it is now when Peter came, about the middle of the afternoon. 
 By this it appears that religious fasting, in order to the greater 
 seriousness and solemnity of praying, was used by devout people who 
 were not Jews; <I>the king of Nineveh proclaimed a fast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:5">Jonah iii. 5</A>.
 
 Some give these words another sense: <I>From four days ago I have been
 fasting until this hour;</I> as if he had eaten no meat, or at least no 
 meal, from that time to this. But it comes in as an introduction to the 
 story of the vision; and therefore the former must be the meaning. 
 <I>He was at the ninth hour praying in his house,</I> not in the 
 synagogue, but at home. <I>I will that men pray</I> wherever they 
 dwell. His praying in his house intimates that it was not a secret 
 prayer in his closet, but in a more public room of his house, with his 
 family about him; and perhaps after prayer he retired, and had this 
 vision. Observe, <I>At the ninth hour of the day,</I> three of the 
 clock in the afternoon, most people were travelling or trading, working 
 in the fields, visiting their friends, taking their pleasure, or taking 
 a nap after dinner; yet then Cornelius was at his devotions, which 
 shows how much he made religion his business; and then it was that he 
 had this message from heaven. Those that would hear comfortably from 
 God must be much in speaking to him. 

 [2.] He describes the messenger that brought him this message from 
 heaven: <I>There stood a man before me in bright clothing,</I> as 
 Christ's was when he was transfigured, and that of the two angels who 
 appeared at Christ's resurrection

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:4">Luke xxiv. 4</A>),
 
 and at his ascension

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:10"><I>ch.</I> i. 10</A>),
 
 showing their relation to the world of light.
 
 [3.] He repeats the message that was sent to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>),

 just as we had it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>.

 Only here it is said, <I>thy prayer is heard.</I> We are not told what 
 his prayer was; but if this message was an answer to it, and it should 
 seem it was, we may suppose that finding the deficiency of natural 
 light, and that it left him at a loss how to obtain the pardon of his 
 sin and the favour of God, he prayed that God would make some further 
 discoveries of himself and of the way of salvation to him. "Well," 
 saith the angel, "<I>send for Peter,</I> and he shall give thee such a 
 discovery."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He declares his own and his friends' readiness to receive the 
 message Peter had to deliver 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>Immediately therefore I sent to thee,</I> as I was directed, <I>and 
 thou hast well done that thou hast come</I> to us, though we are 
 Gentiles. Note, Faithful ministers do well to come to people that are
 willing and desirous to receive instruction from them; to come when 
 they are sent for; it is as good a deed as they can do. Well, Peter is 
 come to do his part; but will they do theirs? Yes. "Thou art here 
 prepared to speak, and we are here prepared to hear," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:9,10">1 Sam. iii. 9, 10</A>.
 
 Observe,

 [1.] Their religious attendance upon the word: "<I>We are all here 
 present before God;</I> we are here in a religious manner, are here as 
 worshippers" (they thus compose themselves into a serious solemn frame 
 of spirit): "<I>therefore,</I> because thou art come to us by such a 
 warrant, on such an errand, because we have such a price in our hand as 
 we never had before and perhaps may never have again, we are ready now 
 at this time of worship, here in this place of worship" (though it was 
 in a private house): "<I>we are present,</I> 
 <B><I>paresmen</I></B>--<I>we are at the business,</I> and are ready to
 come at a call." If we would have God's special presence at an 
 ordinance, we must be there with a special presence, an ordinance 
 presence: <I>Here I am. "We are all present,</I> all that were invited; 
 we, and all that belong to us; we, and all that is within us." The 
 whole of the man must be present; not the body here, and the heart, 
 with the fool's eyes, in the ends of the earth. But that which makes it 
 indeed a religious attendance is, <I>We are present before God.</I> In 
 holy ordinances we present ourselves unto the Lord, and we must be as 
 before him, as those that see his eye upon us. 

 [2.] The intention of this attendance: "<I>We are present to hear all 
 things that are commanded thee of God,</I> and given thee in charge to 
 be delivered to us." Observe, <I>First,</I> Peter was there to preach 
 all things that were commanded him of God; for, as he had an ample 
 commission to preach the gospel, so he had full instructions what to 
 preach. <I>Secondly,</I> They were ready to hear, not whatever he
 pleased to say, but what he was commanded of God to say. The truths of 
 Christ were not communicated to the apostles to be published or stifled 
 as they thought fit, but entrusted with them to be published to the 
 world. "We are ready to hear <I>all,</I> to come at the beginning of 
 the service and stay to the end, and be attentive all the while, else 
 how can we hear all? We are desirous to hear all that thou art 
 commissioned to preach, though it be ever so displeasing to flesh and 
 blood, and ever so contrary to our former notions or present secular 
 interests. We are ready to hear all, and therefore let nothing be kept 
 back that is profitable for us."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>34 Then Peter opened <I>his</I> mouth, and said, Of a truth I
 perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
 &nbsp; 35 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh
 righteousness, is accepted with him.
 &nbsp; 36 The word which <I>God</I> sent unto the children of Israel,
 preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)
 &nbsp; 37 That word, <I>I say,</I> ye know, which was published throughout
 all Jud&aelig;a, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John
 preached;
 &nbsp; 38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
 with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were
 oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
 &nbsp; 39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the
 land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on
 a tree:
 &nbsp; 40 Him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly;
 &nbsp; 41 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of
 God, <I>even</I> to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose
 from the dead.
 &nbsp; 42 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to
 testify that it is he which was ordained of God <I>to be</I> the Judge
 of quick and dead.
 &nbsp; 43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
 whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Peter's sermon preached to Cornelius and his friends: that 
 is, an abstract or summary of it; for we have reason to think that he 
 did with many other words testify and exhort to this purport. It is 
 intimated that he expressed himself with a great deal of solemnity and 
 gravity, but with freedom and copiousness, in that phrase, <I>he opened 
 his mouth, and spoke,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 <I>O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open to you,</I> saith Paul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:11">2 Cor. vi. 11</A>.

 "You shall find us communicative, if we but find you inquisitive." 
 Hitherto the mouths of the apostles had been shut to the uncircumcised 
 Gentiles, they had nothing to say to them; but now God gave unto them, 
 as he did to Ezekiel, <I>the opening of the mouth.</I> This excellent 
 sermon of Peter's is admirably suited to the circumstances of those to 
 whom he preached it; for it was a new sermon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Because they were Gentiles to whom he preached. He shows that, 
 notwithstanding this, they were interested in the gospel of Christ, 
 which he had to preach, and entitled to the benefit of it, upon an 
 equal footing with the Jews. It was necessary that this should be 
 cleared, or else with what comfort could either he preach or they hear? 
 He therefore lays down this as an undoubted principle, <I>that God is 
 no respecter of persons; doth not know favour in judgment,</I> as the 
 Hebrew phrase is; which magistrates are forbidden to do 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:17,16:19,Pr+24:23">Deut. i. 17; xvi. 19; 
 Prov. xxiv. 23</A>),
 
 and are blamed for doing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:2">Ps. lxxxii. 2</A>.
 
 And it is often said of God that he doth not respect persons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+10:17,2Ch+19:7,Job+34:19,Ro+2:11,Col+3:25,1Pe+1:17">Deut. x. 17; 
 2 Chron. xix. 7; Job xxxiv. 19; Rom. ii. 11; Col. iii. 25; 1 Pet. i. 17</A>.

 He doth not give judgment in favour of a man for the sake of any 
 external advantage foreign to the merits of the cause. God never 
 perverts judgment upon personal regards and considerations, nor 
 countenances a wicked man in a wicked thing for the sake of his beauty, 
 or stature, his country, parentage, relations, wealth, or honour in the 
 world. God, as a benefactor, gives favours arbitrarily and by 
 sovereignty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7,8,9:5,6,Mt+20:10">Deut. vii. 7, 8; ix. 5, 6;
 Matt. xx. 10</A>);

 but he does not, as a judge, so give sentence; <I>but in every 
 nation,</I> and under ever denomination, <I>he that fears God and works 
 righteousness is accepted of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 The case is plainly thus--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God never did, nor ever will, justify and save a wicked Jew that 
 lived and died impenitent, though he was <I>of the seed of Abraham,</I> 
 and a <I>Hebrew of the Hebrews,</I> and had all the honour and 
 advantages that attended circumcision. He does and will render 
 <I>indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of 
 man that doeth evil;</I> and <I>of the Jew first,</I> whose privileges 
 and professions, instead of screening him from the judgment of God, 
 will but aggravate his guilt and condemnation. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:3,8,9,17">Rom. ii. 3, 8, 9, 17</A>.
 
 Though God has favoured the Jews, above other nations, with the
 dignities of visible church-membership, yet he will not therefore 
 accept of any particular persons of that dignity, if they allow 
 themselves in immoralities contradictory to their profession; and 
 particularly in persecution, which was now, more than any other, the 
 national sin of the Jews.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He never did, nor ever will, reject or refuse an honest Gentile, 
 who, though he has not the privileges and advantages that the Jews 
 have, yet, like Cornelius, fears God, and worships him, and works 
 righteousness, that is, is just and charitable towards all men, who 
 lives up to the light he has, both in a sincere devotion and in a 
 regular conversation. Whatever nation he is of, though ever so far 
 remote from kindred to the seed of Abraham, though ever so despicable, 
 nay, though in ever so ill a name, that shall be no prejudice to him. 
 God judges of men by their hearts, not by their country or parentage; 
 and, wherever he finds an upright man, he will be found an upright God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:25">Ps. xviii. 25</A>.

 Observe, <I>Fearing God, and working righteousness,</I> must go
 together; for, as righteousness towards men is a branch of true 
 religion, so religion towards God is a branch of universal 
 righteousness. Godliness and honesty must go together, and neither will 
 excuse for the want of the other. But, where these are predominant, no 
 doubt is to be made of acceptance with God. Not that any man, since the 
 fall, can obtain the favour of God otherwise than through the mediation 
 of Jesus Christ, and by the grace of God in him; but those that have 
 not the knowledge of him, and therefore cannot have an explicit regard 
 to him, may yet receive grace from God for his sake, <I>to fear God and 
 to work righteousness;</I> and wherever God gives grace to do so, as he 
 did to Cornelius, he will, through Christ, accept the work of his own 
 hands. Now,

 (1.) This was always a truth, before Peter perceived it, <I>that God 
 respecteth no man's person;</I> it was the fixed rule of judgment from 
 the beginning: <I>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And, 
 if not well, sin,</I> and the punishment of it, <I>lie at the door,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:7">Gen. iv. 7</A>.

 God will not ask in the great day what country men were of, but what
 they were, what they did, and how they stood affected towards him and 
 towards their neighbours; and, if men's personal characters received 
 neither advantage nor disadvantage from the great difference that 
 existed between Jews and Gentiles, much less from any less difference 
 of sentiments and practices that may happen to be among Christians 
 themselves, as those <I>about meats and days,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:1-23">Rom. xiv</A>.

 It is certain <I>the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but
 righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost;</I> and he that in 
 these things serveth Christ is accepted of God, and ought to be 
 approved of men; for dare we reject those whom God doth not? 

 (2.) Yet now it was made more clear than it had been; this great truth 
 had been darkened by the covenant of peculiarity made with Israel, and 
 the badges of distinction put upon them; the ceremonial law was a wall 
 of partition between them and other nations; it is true that in it 
 <I>God favoured that nation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:1,2,9:4">Rom. iii. 1, 2; ix. 4</A>),

 and thence particular persons among them were ready to infer that they 
 were sure of God's acceptance, though they lived as they listed, and 
 that no Gentile could possibly be accepted of God. God had said a great 
 deal by the prophets to prevent and rectify this mistake, but now at 
 length he doth it effectually, by abolishing the covenant of 
 peculiarity, repealing the ceremonial law, and so setting the matter at 
 large, and placing both Jew and Gentile upon the same level before God; 
 and Peter is here made to perceive it, by comparing the vision which he 
 had with that which Cornelius had. Now <I>in Christ Jesus,</I> it is 
 plain, <I>neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor 
 uncircumcision,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:6,Col+3:11">Gal. v. 6; Col. iii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Because they were Gentiles inhabiting a place within the confines 
 of the land of Israel, he refers them to what they themselves could not 
 but know concerning the life and doctrine, the preaching and miracles, 
 the death and sufferings of our Lord Jesus: for these were things the 
 report of which spread into every corner of the nation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>,

 &c. It facilitates the work of ministers, when they deal with such as
 have some knowledge of the things of God, to which they may appeal, and 
 on which they may build.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They knew in general, <I>the word,</I> that is, the gospel, <I>which 
 God sent to the children of Israel: That word, I say, you know,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Though the Gentiles were not admitted to hear it (Christ and his 
 disciples were <I>not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of 
 Israel</I>), yet they could not but hear of it: it was all the talk 
 both of city and country. We are often told in the gospels how the fame 
 of Christ went into all parts of Canaan, when he was on earth, as 
 afterwards the fame of his gospel went into all parts of the world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:18">Rom. x. 18</A>.

 That word, that divine word, that word of power and grace, <I>you 
 know.</I>

 (1.) What the purport of this word was. God by it <I>published the glad
 tidings of peace by Jesus Christ,</I> so it should be 
 read--<B><I>euangelizomenos eirenev.</I></B> It is God himself that
 proclaims <I>peace,</I> who justly might have proclaimed war. He lets 
 the world of mankind know that he is willing to be at peace with them 
 through Jesus Christ; in him he was <I>reconciling the world to 
 himself.</I> 

 (2.) To whom it was sent--to the children of Israel, in the first place.
 The prime offer is made to them; this all their neighbours heard of, 
 and were ready to envy them those advantages of the gospel, more than 
 they ever envied them those of their law. <I>Then said they among the 
 heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:2">Ps. cxxvi. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They knew the several matters of fact relating to this word of the 
 gospel sent to Israel. 

 (1.) They knew the baptism of repentance which John preached by way of 
 introduction to it, and in which the gospel first began, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:1">Mark i. 1</A>.

 They knew what an extraordinary man John was, and what a direct
 tendency his preaching had to <I>prepare the way of the Lord.</I> They 
 knew what great flocking there was to his baptism, what an interest he 
 had, and what he did.

 (2.) They knew that immediately after John's baptism the gospel of 
 Christ, that word of <I>peace, was published throughout all Judea,</I> 
 and that it took its rise from Galilee. The twelve apostles, and 
 seventy disciples, and our Master himself, published these glad tidings 
 in all parts of the land; so that we may suppose there was not a town 
 or village in all the land of Canaan but had had the gospel preached in 
 it. 

 (3.) They knew that Jesus of Nazareth, when he was here upon earth, 
 <I>went about doing good.</I> They knew what a benefactor he was to 
 that nation, both to the souls and the bodies of men; how he made it 
 his business to do good to all, and never did hurt to any. He was not 
 idle, but still doing; not selfish, but doing good; did not confine 
 himself to one place, nor wait till people came to him to seek his 
 help, but went to them, went about from place to place, and wherever he 
 came he was doing good. Hereby he showed <I>that he was sent of God, 
 who is good and does good;</I> and does good because he is good: and 
 who hereby <I>left not himself without witness</I> to the world, <I>in 
 that he did good,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:17"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 17</A>.

 And in this he hath set us an example of indefatigable industry in
 serving God and our generation; for we came into the world that we 
 might do all the good we can in it; and therein, like Christ, we must 
 always abide and abound. 

 (4.) They knew more particularly that he <I>healed all that were 
 oppressed of the devil,</I> and helped them from under his oppressing 
 power. By this it appeared not only that he was sent of God, as it was 
 a kindness to men, but that he was sent to <I>destroy the works of the 
 devil;</I> for thus he obtained many a victory over him. 

 (5.) They knew that the Jews put him to death; they <I>slew</I> him by 
 <I>hanging him on a tree.</I> When Peter preached to the Jews, he said 
 <I>whom you slew;</I> but now that he preached to the Gentiles it is 
 whom <I>they</I> slew; they, to whom he had done and designed so much 
 good. All this they knew; but lest they should think it was only a
 report, and was magnified, as reports usually are, more than the truth, 
 Peter, for himself and the rest of the apostles, attested it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):
 
 <I>We are witnesses,</I> eye-witnesses, of <I>all things which he 
 did;</I> and ear-witnesses of the doctrine which he preached, <I>both 
 in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem,</I> in city and country.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They did know, or might know, by all this, that he had a commission 
 from heaven to preach and act as he did. This he still harps upon in 
 his discourse, and takes all occasions to hint it to them. Let them 
 know, 

 (1.) That this Jesus <I>is Lord of all;</I> it comes in in a 
 parenthesis, but is the principal proposition intended to be proved, 
 that Jesus Christ, by whom peace is made between God and man, <I>is 
 Lord of all;</I> not only as <I>God over all blessed for evermore,</I> 
 but as Mediator, <I>all power both in heaven and on earth</I> is put 
 into his hand, and all judgment committed to him. He is Lord of angels; 
 they are all his humble servants. He is Lord of the powers of darkness, 
 for he hath triumphed over them. He is king of nations, has a power 
 over all flesh. He is king of saints, all the children of God are his 
 scholars, his subjects, his soldiers. 

 (2.) That <I>God anointed him with the Holy Ghost and with power;</I> 
 he was both authorized and enabled to do what he did by a divine 
 anointing, whence he was called <I>Christ--the Messiah, the anointed
 One.</I> The Holy Ghost descended upon him at his baptism, and he was 
 full of power both in preaching and working miracles, which was the 
 seal of a divine mission. 

 (3.) That <I>God was with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 His works were wrought in God. God not only sent him, but was present 
 with him all along, owned him, stood by him, and carried him on in all 
 his services and sufferings. Note, Those whom God anoints he will 
 accompany; he will himself be with those to whom he has given his 
 Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Because they had had no more certain information concerning this 
 Jesus, Peter declares to them his resurrection from the dead, and the 
 proofs of it, that they might not think that when he was slain there 
 was an end of him. Probably, they had heard at Cesarea some talk of his 
 having risen from the dead; but the talk of it was soon silenced by 
 that vile suggestion of the Jews, that <I>his disciples came by night 
 and stole him away.</I> And therefore Peter insists upon this as the 
 main support of that word which preacheth peace by Jesus Christ. 

 1. The power by which he arose is incontestably divine

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 <I>Him God raised up the third day,</I> which not only disproved all 
 the calumnies and accusations he was laid under by men, but effectually 
 proved God's acceptance of the satisfaction he made for the sin of man 
 by the blood of his cross. He did not break prison, but had a legal 
 discharge. <I>God raised him up.</I>

 2. The proofs of his resurrection were incontestably clear; for God
 <I>showed him openly. He gave him to be made manifest</I>--<B><I>edoken
 auton emphane genesthai,</I></B> to be visible, evidently so; so he 
 appears, as that it appears beyond contradiction to be him, and not 
 another. It was such a showing of him as amounted to a demonstration of 
 the truth of his resurrection. He showed him not publicly indeed (it 
 was not open in this sense), but evidently; <I>not to all the 
 people,</I> who had been the witnesses of his death. By resisting all 
 the evidences he had given them of his divine mission in his miracles, 
 they had forfeited the favour of being eye-witnesses of this great 
 proof of it. Those who immediately forged and promoted that lie of his 
 being stolen away were justly given up to strong delusions to believe 
 it, and not suffered to be undeceived by his being shown to all the 
 people; and so much the greater shall be the blessedness of those 
 <I>who have not seen, and yet have believed--Nec ille se in vulgus
 edixit, ne impii errore, liberarentur; ut et fides non pr&aelig;mio 
 mediocri destinato difficultate constaret--He showed not himself to the
 people at large, lest the impious among them should have been forthwith 
 loosed from their error, and that faith, the reward of which is so 
 ample, might be exercised with a degree of difficulty.</I>--Tertul.
 Apol. cap. 11. But, though all the people did not see him, a sufficient 
 number saw him to attest the truth of his resurrection. The testator's 
 declaring his last will and testament needs not to be before all the 
 people; it is enough that it be done before a competent number of 
 credible witnesses; so the resurrection of Christ was proved before 
 sufficient witnesses.

 (1.) They were not so by chance, but they were <I>chosen before of 
 God</I> to be witnesses of it, and, in order to this, had their 
 education under the Lord Jesus, and intimate converse with him, that, 
 having known him so intimately before, they might the better be assured 
 it was he. 

 (2.) They had not a sudden and transient view of him, but a great deal 
 of free conversation with him: <I>They did eat and drink with him after 
 he rose from the dead.</I> This implies that they saw him eat and 
 drink, witness their dining with him at the sea of Tiberias, and the 
 two disciples supping with him at Emmaus; and this proved that he had a 
 true and real body. But this was not all; they saw him without any
 terror or consternation, which might have rendered them incompetent 
 witnesses, for they saw him so frequently, and he conversed with them 
 so familiarly, that <I>they did eat and drink with him.</I> It is 
 brought as a proof of the clear view which the nobles of Israel had of 
 the glory of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:11">Exod. xxiv. 11</A>),

 that <I>they saw God, and did eat and drink.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He concludes with an inference from all this, that therefore that
 which they all ought to do was to believe in this Jesus: he was sent to 
 tell Cornelius what he must do, and it is this; his praying and his 
 giving alms were very well, but one thing he lacked, he must believe in 
 Christ. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Why he must believe in him. Faith has reference to a testimony, and 
 the Christian faith is <I>built upon the foundation of the apostles and 
 prophets,</I> it is built upon the testimony given by them. 

 (1.) By the apostles. Peter as foreman speaks for the rest, that <I>God 
 commanded them,</I> and gave them in charge, to <I>preach to the 
 people, and to testify</I> concerning Christ; so that their testimony 
 was not only credible, but authentic, and what we may venture upon. 
 Their testimony is God's testimony; and they are his witnesses to the 
 world. They do not only say it as matter of news, but testify it as 
 matter of record, by which men must be judged. 

 (2.) By the prophets of the Old Testament, whose testimony beforehand, 
 not only concerning his sufferings, but concerning the design and 
 intention of them, very much corroborates the apostles' testimony 
 concerning them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>To him give all the prophets witness.</I> We have reason to think 
 that Cornelius and his friends were no strangers to the writings of the 
 prophets. Out of the mouth of these two clouds of witnesses, so exactly 
 agreeing, <I>this word is established.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What they must believe concerning him. 

 (1.) That we are all accountable to Christ as our Judge; this the
 apostles were commanded to testify to the world, that this Jesus is 
 <I>ordained of God to be the Judge of the quick and dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 He is empowered to prescribe the terms of salvation, that rule by which 
 we must be judged, to give laws both to <I>quick and dead,</I> both to 
 Jew and Gentile; and he is appointed to determine the everlasting 
 condition of all the children of men at the great day, of those that 
 shall be found alive and of those that shall be raised from the dead. 
 He hath assured us of this, <I>in that he hath raised him from the 
 dead</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:31"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 31</A>),

 so that it is the great concern of every one of us, in the belief of
 this, to seek his favour, and to make him our friend. 

 (2.) That if we believe in him we shall all be justified by him as our 
 righteousness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 The prophets, when they spoke of the death of Christ, did witness this, 
 <I>that through his name,</I> for his sake, and upon the account of his 
 merit, <I>whosoever believeth in him,</I> Jew or Gentile, <I>shall 
 receive remission of sins.</I> This is the great thing we need, without 
 which we are undone, and which the convinced conscience is most 
 inquisitive after, which the carnal Jews promised themselves from their 
 ceremonial sacrifices and purifications, yea, and the heathen too from 
 their atonements, but all in vain; it is to be had only through the 
 name of Christ, and only by those that believe in his name; and those 
 that do so may be assured of it; their sins shall be pardoned, and 
 there shall be no condemnation to them. And the remission of sins lays 
 a foundation for all other favours and blessings, by taking that out of 
 the way which hinders them. If sin be pardoned, all is well, and shall 
 end everlastingly well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on
 all them which heard the word.
 &nbsp; 45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished,
 as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was
 poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.
 &nbsp; 46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.
 Then answered Peter,
 &nbsp; 47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized,
 which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?
 &nbsp; 48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the
 Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the issue and effect of Peter's sermon to Cornelius and 
 his friends. He did not labour in vain among them, but they were all 
 brought home to Christ. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God's owning Peter's word, by conferring the Holy Ghost upon the 
 hearers of it, and immediately upon the hearing of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):

 <I>While Peter was yet speaking these words,</I> and perhaps designed 
 to say more, he was happily superseded by visible indications that 
 <I>the Holy Ghost,</I> even in his miraculous gifts and powers, <I>fell 
 on all those who heard the word,</I> even as he did on the apostles at 
 first; so Peter saith,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:15"><I>ch.</I> xi. 15</A>.

 Therefore some think it was with a rushing mighty wind, and in cloven
 tongues, as that was. Observe, 

 1. When the Holy Ghost fell upon them--while Peter was preaching. Thus
 God bore witness to what he said, and accompanied it with a divine 
 power. Thus were the <I>signs of an apostle wrought among them,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:12">2 Cor. xii. 12</A>.

 Though Peter could not give the Holy Ghost, yet the Holy Ghost being
 given along with the word of Peter, by this it appeared he was sent of 
 God. The Holy Ghost fell upon others after they were baptized, for 
 their confirmation; but upon these Gentiles before they were baptized: 
 as Abraham was justified by faith, being yet in uncircumcision, to show 
 that God is not tied to a method, nor confines himself to external 
 signs. The Holy Ghost fell upon those that were neither circumcised nor 
 baptized; for <I>it is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth 
 nothing.</I> 

 2. How it appeared that the Holy Ghost had fallen upon them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>):

 <I>They spoke with tongues</I> which they never learned, perhaps the 
 Hebrew, the holy tongue; as the preachers were enabled to speak the 
 vulgar tongues, that they might communicate the doctrine of Christ to 
 the hearers, so, probably, the hearers were immediately taught the 
 sacred tongue, that they might examine the proofs which the preachers 
 produced out of the Old Testament in the original. Or their being 
 enabled to speak with tongues intimated that they were all designed for 
 ministers, and by this first descent of the Spirit upon them were 
 qualified to preach the gospel to others, which they did but now 
 receive themselves. But, observe, when they spoke with tongues, they
 <I>magnified God,</I> they spoke of Christ and the benefits of 
 redemption, which Peter had been preaching to the glory of God. Thus 
 did they on whom the Holy Ghost first descended, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:11"><I>ch.</I> ii. 11</A>.

 Note, Whatever gift we are endued with, we ought to honour God with it,
 and particularly the gift of speaking, and all the improvements of it.

 3. What impression it made upon the believing Jews that were present

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>):

 <I>Those of the circumcision who believed were astonished</I>--those
 six that came along with Peter; it surprised them exceedingly, and 
 perhaps gave them some uneasiness, because <I>upon the Gentiles also 
 was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost,</I> which they thought had 
 been appropriated to their own nation. Had they understood the 
 scriptures of the Old Testament, which pointed at this, it would not 
 have been such an astonishment to them; but by our mistaken notions of 
 things we create difficulties to ourselves in the methods of divine 
 providence and grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Peter's owning God's work in baptizing those on whom the Holy Ghost 
 fell. Observe, 

 1. Though they had received the Holy Ghost, yet it was requisite they 
 should be baptized; though God is not tied to instituted ordinances, we 
 are; and no extraordinary gifts set us above them, but rather oblige us 
 so much the more to conform to them. Some in our days would have argued 
 "These are baptized with the <I>Holy Ghost</I> and therefore what need 
 have they to be baptized with <I>water?</I> It is below them." No; it 
 is not below them, while water-baptism is an ordinance of Christ, and 
 the door of admission into the visible church, and a seal of the new 
 covenant. 

 2. Though they were Gentiles, yet, having received the Holy Ghost, they
 might be admitted to baptism

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>):

 <I>Can any man,</I> though ever so rigid a Jew, <I>forbid water, that 
 these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost as well 
 as we?</I> The argument is conclusive; can we deny the sign to those 
 who have received the thing signified? Are not those on whom God has 
 bestowed the grace of the covenant plainly entitled to the seals of the 
 covenant? Surely those that have <I>received the Spirit as well as 
 we</I> ought to receive baptism as well as we; for it becomes us to 
 follow God's indications, and to take those into communion with us whom 
 he hath taken into communion with himself. God hath promised to pour 
 his Spirit upon the seed of the faithful, upon their offspring; and who 
 then can forbid water, that they should not be baptized, who have 
 <I>received the promise of the Holy Ghost as well as we?</I> Now it 
 appears why the Spirit was given them before they were baptized--because
 otherwise Peter could not have persuaded himself to baptize them, any 
 more than to have preached to them, if he had not been ordered to do it 
 by a vision; at least he could not have avoided the censure of <I>those 
 of the circumcision that believed.</I> Thus is there one unusual step 
 of divine grace taken after another to bring the Gentiles into the 
 church. How well is it for us that the grace of a good God is so much
 more extensive than the charity of some good men! 

 3. Peter did not baptize them himself, but <I>commanded them to be
 baptized,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.
 
 It is probable that some of the brethren who came with him did it by 
 his order, and that he declined it for the same reason that Paul 
 did--lest those that were baptized by him should think the better of
 themselves for it, or he should seem to <I>have baptized in his own 
 name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:15">1 Cor. i. 15</A>.

 The apostles received the commission to <I>go and disciple all nations
 by baptism.</I> But is was to prayer and the ministry of the word that 
 they were to <I>give</I> themselves. And Paul says that he was sent, 
 <I>not to baptize but to preach,</I> which was the more noble and 
 excellent work. The business of baptizing was therefore ordinarily 
 devolved upon the inferior ministers; these acted by the orders of the 
 apostles, who might therefore be said to do it. <I>Qui per alterum
 facit, per seipsum facere dicitur--What a man does by another, he may
 be said to do by himself.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Their owning both Peter's word and God's work in their desire for 
 further advantage by Peter's ministry: <I>They prayed him to tarry 
 certain days.</I> They could not press him to reside constantly among 
 them--they knew that he had work to do in other places, and that for the
 present he was expected at Jerusalem; yet they were not willing he 
 should go away immediately, but earnestly begged he would stay for some 
 time among them, that they might be further instructed by him in the 
 things pertaining to the kingdom of God. Note, 

 1. Those who have some acquaintance with Christ cannot but covet more.
 
 2. Even those that have received the Holy Ghost must see their need of
 the ministry of the word.</P>
