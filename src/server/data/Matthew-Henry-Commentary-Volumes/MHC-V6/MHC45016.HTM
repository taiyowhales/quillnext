 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Paul is now concluding this long and excellent epistle, and he does it
 with a great deal of affection. As in the main body of the epistle he
 appears to have been a very knowing man, so in these appurtenances of
 it he appears to have been a very loving man. So much knowledge and so
 much love are a very rare, but (where they exist) a very excellent and
 amiable--composition; for what is heaven but knowledge and love made
 perfect? It is observable how often Paul speaks as if he were
 concluding, and yet takes fresh hold again. One would have thought that
 solemn benediction which closed the foregoing chapter should have ended
 the epistle; and yet here he begins again, and in this chapter he
 repeats the blessing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:20">ver. 20</A>),

 "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, Amen." And yet he has
 something more to say; nay, again he repeats the blessing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:24">ver. 24</A>),

 and yet has not done; an expression of his tender love. These repeated 
 benedictions, which stand for valedictions, speak Paul loth to part.
 Now, in this closing chapter, we may observe, 

 I. His recommendation of one friend to the Roman Christians, and his 
 particular salutation of several among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:1-16">ver. 1-16</A>.

 II. A caution to take heed of those who caused divisions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>.
 
 III. Salutations added from some who were with Paul,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:21-24">ver. 21-24</A>.

 IV. He concludes with a solemn celebration of the glory of God,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:25-27">ver. 25-27</A>.</P>

 &nbsp; 4  Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not
 only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

 &nbsp; 16  Salute one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ
 salute you.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Such remembrances as these are usual in letters between friends; and 
 yet Paul, by the savouriness of his expressions, sanctifies these 
 common compliments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the recommendation of a friend, by whom (as some think) this 
 epistle was sent--one <I>Phebe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 It should seem that she was a person of quality and estate, who had 
 business which called her to Rome, where she was a stranger; and 
 therefore Paul recommends her to the acquaintance of the Christians 
 there: an expression of his true friendship to her. Paul was as well 
 skilled in the art of obliging as most men. True religion, rightly 
 received, never made any man uncivil. Courtesy and Christianity agree
 well together. It is not in compliment to her, but in sincerity, 
 that,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He gives a very good character of her. 

 (1.) As a sister to Paul: <I>Phebe our sister;</I> not in nature, but 
 in grace; not in affinity or consanguinity, but in pure Christianity: 
 his own sister in the faith of Christ, loving Paul, and beloved of him, 
 with a pure and chaste and spiritual love, as a sister; for there is 
 neither male nor female, but all are one in Christ Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:28">Gal. iii. 28</A>.
 
 Both Christ and his apostles had some of their best friends among the
 devout (and upon that account honourable) women. 

 (2.) As a <I>servant to the church at Cenchrea:</I> 
 <B><I>diakonon,</I></B> a servant by office, a stated servant, not to 
 preach the word (that was forbidden to women), but in acts of charity 
 and hospitality. Some think she was one of the widows that ministered 
 to the sick and were taken into the church's number, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:9">1 Tim. v. 9</A>.

 But those were old and poor, whereas Phebe seems to have been a person
 of some account; and yet it was no disparagement to her to be a servant 
 to the church. Probably they used to meet at her house, and she 
 undertook the care of entertaining the ministers, especially strangers. 
 Every one in his place should strive to serve the church, for therein 
 he serves Christ, and it will turn to a good account another day. 
 Cenchrea was a small sea-port town adjoining to Corinth, about twelve 
 furlongs distant. Some think there was a church there, distinct from 
 that at Corinth, though, being so near, it is very probable that the 
 church of Corinth is called <I>the church of Cenchrea,</I> because 
 their place of meeting might be there, on account of the great 
 opposition to them in the city

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:12">Acts xviii. 12</A>),

 as at Philippi they met out of the city by the water-side,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:13">Acts xvi. 13</A>.

 So the reformed church of Paris might be called <I>the church at 
 Charenton,</I> where they formerly met, out of the city. 

 (3.) As a <I>succourer of many,</I> and particularly of Paul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 She relieved many that were in want and distress--a good copy for women 
 to write after that have ability. she was kind to those that needed 
 kindness, intimated in her succouring them; and her bounty was 
 extensive, she was a succourer of many. Observe the gratitude of Paul 
 in mentioning her particular kindness to him: <I>And to myself
 also.</I> Acknowledgment of favours is the least return we can make. It 
 was much to her honour that Paul left this upon record; for wherever 
 this epistle is read her kindness to Paul is told for a memorial of 
 her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He recommends her to their care and kindness, as one worthy to be 
 taken notice of with peculiar respect. 

 (1.) "<I>Receive her in the Lord.</I> Entertain her; bid her welcome." 
 This pass, under Paul's hand, could not but recommend her to any 
 Christian church. "<I>Receive her in the Lord,</I>" that is, "for the 
 Lord's sake; receive her as a servant and friend of Christ." <I>As it 
 becometh saints</I> to receive, who love Christ, and therefore love all 
 that are his for his sake; or, as <I>becometh saints</I> to be 
 received, with love and honour and the tenderest affection. There may 
 be occasion sometimes to improve our interest in our friends, not only 
 for ourselves, but for others also, <I>interest</I> being a price in 
 the hand for doing good. 

 (2.) <I>Assist her in whatsoever business she has need of you.</I> 
 Whether she had business of trade, or law-business at the court, is not 
 material; however being a woman, a stranger, a Christian, she had need 
 of help: and Paul engaged them to be assistant to her. It becomes 
 Christians to be helpful one to another in their affairs, especially to 
 be helpful to strangers; for we are members one of another and we know 
 not what need of help we may have ourselves. Observe, Paul bespeaks
 help for one that had been so helpful to many; he that watereth shall 
 be watered also himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are commendations to some particular friends among those to 
 whom he wrote, more than in any other of the epistles. Though the care 
 of all the churches came upon Paul daily, enough to distract an 
 ordinary head, yet he could retain the remembrance of so many; and his 
 heart was so full of love and affection as to send salutations to each 
 of them with particular characters of them, and expressions of love to 
 them and concern for them. <I>Greet</I> them, <I>salute</I> them; it is 
 the same word, <B><I>aspasasthe.</I></B> "Let them know that I remember 
 them, and love them, and wish them well." There is something observable 
 in several of these salutations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning Aquila and Priscilla, a famous couple, that Paul had a 
 special kindness for. They were originally of Rome, but were banished 
 thence by the edict of Claudius, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:2">Acts xviii. 2</A>.

 At Corinth, Paul became acquainted with them, wrought with them at the
 trade of tent-making; after some time, when the edge of that edict was 
 rebated, they returned to Rome, and thither he now sends commendations 
 to them. He calls them his <I>helpers in Christ Jesus,</I> by private 
 instructions and converse furthering the success of Paul's public 
 preaching, one instance of which we have in their instructing Apollos,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:26">Acts xviii. 26</A>.
 
 Those are helpers to faithful ministers that lay out themselves in
 their families and among their neighbours to do good to souls. Nay,
 they did not only do much, but they ventured much, for Paul: They have
 <I>for my life laid down their own necks.</I> They exposed themselves
 to secure Paul, hazarded their own lives for the preservation of his,
 considering how much better they might be spared than he. Paul was in a
 great deal of danger at Corinth, while he sojourned with them; but they
 sheltered him, though they thereby made themselves obnoxious to the
 enraged multitudes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:12,17">Acts xviii. 12, 17</A>.

 It was a good while ago that they had done Paul this kindness; and yet
 he speaks as feelingly of it as if it had been but yesterday. <I>To 
 whom</I> (says he) <I>not only I give thanks, but also all the churches 
 of the Gentiles;</I> who were all beholden to these good people for 
 helping to save the life of him that was the apostle of the Gentiles. 
 Paul mentions this, to engage the Christians at Rome to be the more 
 kind to Aquila and Priscilla. He sends likewise greeting to the 
 <I>church in their house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It seems then, a church in a house is no such absurd thing as some make 
 it to be. Perhaps there was a congregation of Christians that used to 
 meet at their house at stated times; and then, no doubt, it was, like 
 the house of Obed-Edom, blessed for the ark's sake. Others think that 
 the church was no more than a religious, pious, well-governed family, 
 that kept up the worship of God. Religion, in the power of it, reigning 
 in a family, will turn a house into a church. And doubtless it had a 
 good influence upon this that Priscilla the good wife of the family was 
 so very eminent and forward in religion, so eminent that she is often 
 named first. A virtuous woman, that looks well to the ways of her 
 household, may do much towards the advancement of religion in a family.
 When Priscilla and Aquila were at Ephesus, though but sojourners there, 
 yet there also they had a church in their house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:19">1 Cor. xvi. 19</A>.

 A truly godly man will be careful to take religion along with him
 wherever he goes. When Abraham removed his tent, he renewed his altar,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:18">Gen. xiii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Concerning Epenetus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He calls him his <I>well-beloved.</I> Where the law of love is in the 
 heart the law of kindness will be in the tongue. Endearing language 
 should pass among Christians to express love, and to engage love. So he 
 calls Amplias, <I>beloved in the Lord,</I> with true Christian love for 
 Christ's sake; and Stachys, his <I>beloved:</I> a sign that Paul had 
 been in the third heaven, he was so much made up of love. Of Epenetus 
 it is further said that he was the <I>first-fruit of Achaia unto 
 Christ;</I> not only one of the most eminent believers in that country, 
 but one of the first that was converted to the faith of Christ: one 
 that was offered up to God by Paul, as the first-fruits of his ministry 
 there; an earnest of a great harvest; for in Corinth, the chief city of 
 Achaia, God had much people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:10">Acts xviii. 10</A>.

 Special respect is to be paid to those that set out early, and come to
 work in the vineyard at the first hour, at the first call. The 
 <I>household of Stephanas</I> is likewise said to be the 
 <I>first-fruits of Achaia,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:15">1 Cor. xvi. 15</A>.
 
 Perhaps Epenetus was one of that household; or, at least, he was one of
 the <I>first three;</I> not the first alone, but one of the first 
 fleece of Christians, that the region of Achaia afforded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Concerning Mary, and some others who were laborious in that which is 
 good, industrious Christians: <I>Mary,</I> who <I>bestowed much labour 
 on us.</I> True love never sticks at labour, but rather takes a 
 pleasure in it; where there is much love there will be much labour. 
 Some think this Mary had been at some of those places where Paul was, 
 though now removed to Rome, and had personally ministered to him; 
 others think Paul speaks of her labour as bestowed upon him because it 
 was bestowed upon his friends and fellow-labourers, and he took what 
 was done to them as done to himself. He says of Tryphena and Tryphosa, 
 two useful women in their places, that they laboured in the Lord 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and of the beloved Persis, another good woman, that she laboured much
 in the Lord, more than others, abounding more in the work of the 
 Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Concerning Andronicus and Junia, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Some take them for a man and his wife, and the original will well 
 enough bear it; and, considering the name of the latter, this is more 
 probable than that they should be two men, as others think, and 
 brethren. Observe,

 (1.) They were Paul's <I>cousins,</I> akin to him; so was Herodion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Religion does not take away, but rectifies, sanctifies, and improves, 
 our respect to our kindred, engaging us to lay out ourselves most for 
 their good, and to rejoice in them the more, when we find them related 
 to Christ by faith.

 (2.) They were his fellow-prisoners. Partnership in suffering
 sometimes does much towards the union of souls and the knitting of 
 affections. We do not find in the story of the Acts any imprisonment of 
 Paul before the writing of this epistle, but that at Philippi, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:23">Acts xvi. 23</A>.
 
 But Paul was <I>in prisons more frequent</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:23">2 Cor. xi. 23</A>),

 in some of which, it seems, he met with his friends Andronicus and 
 Junia, yoke-fellows, as in other things, so in suffering for Christ and 
 bearing his yoke. 

 (3.) They were <I>of note among the apostles,</I> not so much perhaps 
 because they were persons of estate and quality in the world as because 
 they were eminent for knowledge, and gifts, and graces, which made them 
 famous among the apostles, who were competent judges of those things, 
 and were endued with a spirit of discerning not only the sincerity, but 
 the eminency, of Christians.

 (4.) <I>Who also were in Christ before me,</I> that is, were converted 
 to the Christian faith. In time they had the start of Paul, though he 
 was converted the next year after Christ's ascension. How ready was 
 Paul to acknowledge in others any kind of precedency!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Concerning Apelles, who is here said to be <I>approved in Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 a high character! He was one of known integrity and sincerity in his 
 religion, one that had been tried; his friends and enemies had tried 
 him, and he was as gold. He was of approved knowledge and judgment,
 approved courage and constancy; a man that one might trust and repose a 
 confidence in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Concerning Aristobulus and Narcissus; notice is taken of their 
 household, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 Those of their household who <I>are in the Lord</I> (as it is limited,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 that were Christians. How studious was Paul to leave none out of his 
 salutations that he had any knowledge of or acquaintance with!
 Aristobulus and Narcissus themselves, some think, were absent, or 
 lately dead; others think they were unbelievers, and such as did not 
 themselves embrace Christianity; so Pareus: and some think this 
 Narcissus was the same with one of that name who is frequently 
 mentioned in the life of Claudius, as a very rich man that had a great 
 family, but was very wicked and mischievous. It seems, then, there were 
 some good servants, or other retainers, even in the family of a wicked 
 man, a common case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:1,Ro+16:2">1 Tim. vi. 1.
 Compare <I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The poor servant is called, and chosen, and faithful, while the rich
 master is passed by, and left to perish in unbelief. Even so, Father, 
 because it seemed good unto thee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. Concerning Rufus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>chosen in the Lord.</I> He was a choice Christian, whose gifts and 
 graces evinced that he was eternally chosen in Christ Jesus. He was one 
 of a thousand for integrity and holiness.--<I>And his mother and 
 mine,</I> his mother by nature and mine by Christian love and spiritual 
 affection; as he calls Phebe his sister, and teaches Timothy to treat 
 the elder women as mothers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:2">1 Tim. v. 2</A>.

 This good woman, upon some occasion or other, had been as a mother to
 Paul, in caring for him, and comforting him; and Paul here gratefully 
 owns it, and calls her mother.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. Concerning the rest this is observable, that he salutes the 
 <I>brethren who are with them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and the <I>saints who are with them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 with them in family-relations, with them in the bond of Christian 
 communion. It is the good property of saints to delight in being 
 together; and Paul thus joins them together in his salutations to 
 endear them one to another. Lest any should find themselves aggrieved,
 as if Paul had forgotten them, he concludes with the remembrance of the 
 rest, as brethren and saints, though not named. In Christian
 congregations there should be smaller societies linked together in love 
 and converse, and taking opportunities of being often together. Among 
 all those to whom Paul sends greeting here is not a word of Peter, 
 which gives occasion to suspect that he was not bishop of Rome, as the 
 Papists say he was; for, if he was, we cannot but suppose him resident, 
 or at least how could Paul write so long an epistle to the Christians 
 there, and take no notice of him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> He concludes with the recommendation of them to the love 
 and embraces one of another: <I>Salute one another with a holy 
 kiss.</I> Mutual salutations, as they express love, so they increase 
 and strengthen love, and endear Christians one to another: therefore
 Paul here encourages the use of them, and only directs that they may be
 holy--a chaste kiss, in opposition to that which is wanton and
 lascivious; a sincere kiss, in opposition to that which is treacherous 
 and dissembling, as Judas's, when he betrayed Christ with a kiss. He 
 adds, in the close, a general salutation to them all, in the name of 
 the churches of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>The churches of Christ salute you;</I> that is, the churches which 
 I am with, and which I am accustomed to visit personally, as knit 
 together in the bonds of the common Christianity, desire me to testify 
 their affection to you and good wishes for you." This is one way of 
 maintaining the communion of saints.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions
 and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and
 avoid them.
 &nbsp; 18  For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
 their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the
 hearts of the simple.
 &nbsp; 19  For your obedience is come abroad unto all <I>men.</I> I am glad
 therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that
 which is good, and simple concerning evil.
 &nbsp; 20  And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
 shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <I>be</I> with you. Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The apostle having endeavoured by his endearing salutations to unite 
 them together, it was not improper to subjoin a caution to take heed of 
 those whose principles and practices were destructive to Christian 
 love. And we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The caution itself, which is given in the most obliging manner that 
 could be: <I>I beseech you, brethren.</I> He does not will and command, 
 as one that lorded it over God's heritage, but for love's sake 
 beseeches. How earnest, how endearing, are Paul's exhortations! He 
 teaches them, 

 1. To see their danger: Mark those who cause divisions <I>and
 offences.</I> Our Master had himself foretold that divisions and 
 offences would come, but had entailed a woe on those by whom they come

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:7">Matt. xviii. 7</A>),

 and against such we are here cautioned. Those who burden the church 
 with dividing and offending impositions, who uphold and enforce those 
 impositions, who introduce and propagate dividing and offending 
 notions, which are erroneous or justly suspected, who out of pride, 
 ambition, affectation of novelty, or the like, causelessly separate 
 from their brethren, and by perverse disputes, censures, and evil 
 surmisings, alienate the affections of Christians one from 
 another--these cause divisions and offences, contrary to, or different 
 from (for that also is implied, it is <B><I>para ten didachen</I></B>), 
 the <I>doctrine which we have learned.</I> Whatever varies from the 
 form of sound doctrine which we have in the scriptures opens a door to 
 divisions and offences. If truth be once deserted, unity and peace will 
 not last long. Now, <I>mark</I> those that thus cause divisions, 
 <B><I>skopein.</I></B> Observe them, the method they take, the end they 
 drive at. There is need of a piercing watchful eye to discern the 
 danger we are in from such people; for commonly the pretences are 
 plausible, when the projects are very pernicious. Do not look only at 
 the divisions and offences, but run up those streams to the fountain, 
 and mark those that cause them, and especially that in them which 
 causes these divisions and offences, those lusts on each side whence 
 come these wars and fightings. A danger discovered is half prevented.
 
 2. To shun it: "<I>Avoid them.</I> Shun all necessary communion and
 communication with them, lest you be leavened and infected by them. Do 
 not strike in with any dividing interests, nor embrace any of those 
 principles or practices which are destructive to Christian love and 
 charity, or to the truth which is according to godliness.--<I>Their 
 word will eat as doth a canker.</I>" Some think he especially warns 
 them to take heed of the judaizing teachers, who, under convert of the 
 Christian name, kept up the Mosaical ceremonies, and preached the 
 necessity of them, who were industrious in all places to draw disciples 
 after them, and whom Paul in most of his epistles cautions the churches 
 to take heed of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reasons to enforce this caution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Because of the pernicious policy of these seducers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The worse they are, the more need we have to watch against them. Now 
 observe his description of them, in two things:--

 (1.) The master they serve: not <I>our Lord Jesus Christ.</I> Though
 they call themselves Christians, they do not serve Christ; do not aim
 at his glory, promote his interest, nor do his will, whatever they
 pretend. How many are there who call Christ Master and Lord, that are
 far from serving him! But they <I>serve their own belly</I>--their
 carnal, sensual, secular interests. It is some base lust or other that
 they are pleasing; pride, ambition, covetousness, luxury,
 lasciviousness, these are the designs which they are really carrying
 on. Their <I>God is their belly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:19">Phil. iii. 19</A>.

 What a base master do they serve, and how unworthy to come in
 competition with Christ, that serve their own bellies, that make gain
 their godliness, and the gratifying of a sensual appetite the very
 scope and business of their lives, to which all other purposes and
 designs must truckle and be made subservient. 

 (2.) The method they take to compass their design: <I>By good words and 
 fair speeches they deceive the hearts of the simple.</I> Their words 
 and speeches have a show of holiness and zeal for God (it is an easy 
 thing to be godly from the teeth outward), and show of kindness and 
 love to those into whom they instil their corrupt doctrines, accosting 
 them courteously when they intend them the greatest mischief. Thus by 
 good words and fair speeches the serpent beguiled Eve. Observe, They 
 corrupt their heads by deceiving their hearts, pervert their judgments 
 by slyly insinuating themselves into their affections. We have a great 
 need therefore to keep our hearts with all diligence, especially when 
 seducing spirits are abroad.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Because of the peril we are in, through our proneness and aptness to 
 be inveigled and ensnared by them: "For <I>your obedience has come 
 abroad unto all men</I>--you are noted in all the churches for a
 willing, tractable, complying people." And, 

 (1.) Therefore, because it was so, these seducing teachers would be the 
 more apt to assault them. The devil and his agents have a particular
 spite against flourishing churches and flourishing souls. The ship that 
 is known to be richly laden is most exposed to privateers. The 
 adversary and enemy covets such a prey, therefore look to yourselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:8">2 John <I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 "The false teachers hear that you are an obedient people, and therefore
 they will be likely to come among you, to see if you will be obedient 
 to them." It has been the common policy of seducers to set upon those 
 who are softened by convictions, and begin to enquire what they shall 
 do, because such do most easily receive the impressions of their 
 opinions. Sad experience witnesses how many who have begun to ask the
 way to Zion, with their faces thitherward, have fatally split upon this 
 rock, which proves it to be much the duty of ministers, with a double 
 care, to feed the lambs of the flock, to lay a good foundation, and 
 gently to lead those that are with young.

 (2.) Though it were so, yet they were in danger from these seducers. 
 This Paul suggests with a great deal of modesty and tenderness; not as 
 one suspicious of them, but as one solicitous for them: "You 
 <I>obedience has come abroad unto all men;</I> we grant this and 
 rejoice in it: <I>I am glad therefore on your behalf.</I>" Thus does he 
 insinuate their commendation, the better to make way for the caution. A 
 holy jealousy of our friends may very well comport with a holy joy in 
 them. "You think yourselves a very happy people, and so do I too: but 
 for all that you must not be secure: <I>I would have you wise unto that 
 which is good, and simple concerning evil.</I> You are a willing 
 good-natured people, but you had best take heed of being imposed upon 
 by those seducers." A pliable temper is good when it is under good 
 government; but otherwise it may be very ensnaring; and therefore he 
 gives two general rules:--

 [1.] To be <I>wise unto that which is good,</I> that is, to be skilful
 and intelligent in the truths and ways of God. "Be wise to try the 
 spirits, to prove all things, and then to hold fast that only which is 
 good." There is need of a great deal of wisdom in our adherence to good 
 truths, and good duties, and good people, lest in any of these we be 
 imposed upon and deluded. <I>Be ye therefore wise as serpents</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:16">Matt. x. 16</A>),

 wise to discern that which is really good and that which is 
 counterfeit; wise to distinguish things that differ, to improve 
 opportunities. While we are in the midst of so many deceivers, we have 
 great need of that wisdom of the prudent which is to understand his 
 way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+14:8">Prov. xiv. 8</A>.

 [2.] To be <I>simple concerning evil</I>--so wise as not to be
 <I>deceived,</I> and yet so simple as not to be deceivers. It is a holy
 simplicity, not to be able to contrive, nor palliate, nor carry on, any
 evil design; <B><I>akeraious</I></B>--<I>harmless,</I> unmixed,
 inoffensive. <I>In malice be you children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:20">1 Cor. xiv. 20</A>.

 The wisdom of the serpent becomes Christians, but not the subtlety of 
 the old serpent. We must withal <I>be harmless as doves.</I> That is a 
 wisely simple man that knows not how to do any thing against the truth.
 Now Paul was the more solicitous for the Roman church, that it might 
 preserve its integrity, because it was so famous; it was a city upon a 
 hill, and many eyes were upon the Christians there, so that an error 
 prevailing there would be a bad precedent, and have an ill influence 
 upon other churches: as indeed it has since proved in fact, the great 
 apostasy of the latter days taking its rise from that capital city. The 
 errors of leading churches are leading errors. When the bishop of Rome 
 fell as a <I>great star</I> from heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:10">Rev. viii. 10</A>),

 <I>his tail drew a third part of the stars</I> after him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:4">Rev. xii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Because of the promise of God, that we shall have victory at last, 
 which is given to quicken and encourage, not to supersede, our watchful 
 cares and vigorous endeavours. It is a very sweet promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 
 <I>The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The titles he gives to God: <I>The God of peace,</I> the author 
 and giver of all good. When we come to God for spiritual victories, we 
 must not only eye him as the Lord of hosts, whose all power is, but as 
 the God of peace, a God at peace with us, speaking peace to us, working 
 peace in us, creating peace for us. Victory comes from God more as the 
 God of peace than as the God of war; for, in all our conflicts, peace 
 is the thing we must contend for. God, as the God of peace, will 
 restrain and vanquish all those that cause divisions and offences, and 
 so break and disturb the peace of the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The blessing he expects from God--a victory over Satan. If he mean
 primarily those false doctrines and seducing spirits spoken of before, 
 of which Satan was the prime founder and author, yet doubtless, it 
 comprehends all the other designs and devices of Satan against souls, 
 to defile, disturb, and destroy them, all his attempts to keep us from 
 the purity of heaven, the peace of heaven here, and the possession of 
 heaven hereafter. Satan tempting and troubling, acting as a deceiver 
 and as a destroyer, the <I>God of peace</I> will <I>bruise under our 
 feet.</I> He had cautioned them before against simplicity: now they, 
 being conscious of their own great weakness and folly, might think, 
 "How shall we evade and escape these snares that are laid for us? Will
 not these adversaries of our souls be at length too hard for us?" "No," 
 says he, "fear not; though you cannot overcome in your own strength and 
 wisdom, yet the God of peace will do it for you; and through him that 
 loved us we shall be more than conquerors." 

 [1.] The victory shall be complete: <I>He shall bruise Satan under your 
 feet,</I> plainly alluding to the first promise the Messiah made in 
 paradise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>),
 
 that the seed of the woman should break the serpent's head, which is in 
 the fulfilling every day, while the saints are enabled to resist and 
 overcome the temptations of Satan, and will be perfectly fulfilled 
 when, in spite of all the powers of darkness, all that belong to the 
 election of grace shall be brought triumphantly to glory. When Joshua
 had conquered the kings of Canaan, he called the captains of Israel to 
 set their feet upon the necks of those kings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:24">Josh. x. 24</A>),

 so will Christ, our Joshua, enable all his faithful servants and 
 soldiers to set their feet upon Satan's neck, to trample upon, and 
 triumph over, their spiritual enemies. Christ hath overcome for us; 
 disarmed the strong man armed, broken his power, and we have nothing to 
 do but to pursue the victory and divide the spoil. Let this quicken us 
 to our spiritual conflict, to fight the good fight of faith--we have to 
 do with a conquered enemy, and the victory will be perfect shortly. 
 
 [2.] The victory shall be speedy: He shall do it <I>shortly.</I> Yet a 
 little while, and he that shall come will come. He hath said it, 
 <I>Behold, I come quickly.</I> When Satan seems to have prevailed, and 
 we are ready to give up all for lost, then will the God of peace cut 
 the work short in righteousness. It will encourage soldiers when they 
 know the war will be at an end quickly, in such a victory. Some refer 
 it to the happy period of their contentions in true love and unity; 
 others to the period of the church's persecutions in the conversion of 
 the powers of the empire to Christianity, when the bloody enemies of 
 the church were subdued and trampled on by Constantine, and the church 
 under his government. It is rather to be applied to the victory which 
 all the saints shall have over Satan when they come to heaven, and 
 shall be for ever out of his reach, together with the present victories 
 which through grace they obtain in earnest of that. Hold out therefore, 
 faith and patience, yet a little while; when we have once got through 
 the Red Sea, we shall see our spiritual enemies dead on the shore, and 
 triumphantly sing the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb. To this 
 therefore he subjoins the benediction, <I>The grace of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ be with you</I>--the good-will of Christ towards you, the good 
 work of Christ in you. This will be the best preservative against the 
 snares of heretics, and schismatics, and false teachers. If the grace 
 of Christ be with us, who can be against us so as to prevail? <I>Be 
 strong therefore in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</I> Paul, not 
 only as a friend, but as a minister and an apostle, who had received 
 grace for grace, thus with authority blesses them with this blessing, 
 and repeats it,

 As the Apostle had before sent his own salutations to many of this 
 church, and that of the churches round him to them all, he here adds an 
 affectionate remembrance of them from some particular persons who were 
 now with him, the better to promote acquaintance and fellowship among 
 distant saints, and that the subscribing of these worthy names, known 
 to them, might the more recommend this epistle. He mentions, 

 1. Some that were his particular friends, and probably known to the
 Roman Christians: <I>Timotheus my work-fellow.</I> Paul sometimes calls 
 Timothy his son, as an inferior; but here he styles him his 
 work-fellow, as one equal with him, such a respect does he put upon 
 him: and <I>Lucius,</I> probably Lucius of Cyrene, a noted man in the 
 church of Antioch

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:1">Acts xiii. 1</A>),

 as Jason was at Thessalonica, where he suffered for entertaining Paul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:5,6">Acts xvii. 5, 6</A>):

 and <I>Sosipater,</I> supposed to be the same with Sopater of Berea, 
 mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:4">Acts xx. 4</A>.

 These Paul calls his kinsmen; not only more largely, as they were Jews, 
 but as they were in blood or affinity nearly allied to him. It seems, 
 Paul was of a good family, that he met with so many of his kindred in 
 several places. It is a very great comfort to see the holiness and 
 usefulness of our kindred. 
 
 2. One that was Paul's amanuensis
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 
 <I>I Tertius, who wrote this epistle.</I> Paul made use of a scribe, 
 not out of state nor idleness, but because he wrote a bad hand, which 
 was not very legible, which he excuses, when he writes to the Galatians 
 with his own hand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:11">Gal. vi. 11</A>):

 <B><I>pelikois grammasi</I></B>--<I>with what kind of letters.</I> 
 Perhaps this Tertius was the same with Silas; for Silas (as some think) 
 signifies <I>the third</I> in Hebrew, as <I>Tertius</I> in Latin.
 Tertius either wrote as Paul dictated, or transcribed it fairly over 
 out of Paul's foul copy. The least piece of service done to the church, 
 and the ministers of the church, shall not pass without a remembrance 
 and a recompence. It was an honour to Tertius that he had a hand, 
 though but as a scribe, in writing this epistle. 

 3. Some others that were of note among the Christians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Gaius my host.</I> It is uncertain whether this was Gaius of Derbe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:4">Acts xx. 4</A>),
 
 or Gaius of Macedonia 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:29">Acts xix. 29</A>),

 or rather Gaius of Corinth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:14">1 Cor. i. 14</A>),

 and whether any of these was he to whom John wrote his 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:1">third epistle</A>.

 However, Paul commends him for his great hospitality; not only my host, 
 but of the <I>whole church</I>--one that entertained them all as there 
 was occasion, opened his doors to their church-meetings, and eased the 
 rest of the church by his readiness to treat all Christian stranger 
 that came to them. <I>Erastus, the chamberlain of the city</I> is
 another; he means the city of Corinth, whence this epistle was dated.
 It seems he was a person of honour and account, one in public place, 
 steward or treasurer. Not many mighty, not many noble, are called, but 
 some are. His estate, and honour, and employment, did not take him off
 from attending on Paul and laying out himself for the good of the 
 church, it should seem, in the work of the ministry; for he is joined 
 with Timothy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:22">Acts xix. 22</A>),
 
 and is mentioned 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:20">2 Tim. iv. 20</A>.

 It was no disparagement to the chamberlain of the city to be a preacher 
 of the gospel of Christ. <I>Quartus</I> is likewise mentioned, and
 called a brother; for as one is our Father, even Christ, so all we are 
 brethren.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle solemnly closes his epistle with a magnificent 
 ascription of glory to the blessed God, as one that terminated all in 
 the praise and glory of God, and studied to return all to him, seeing 
 all is of him and from him. He does, as it were, breathe out his soul 
 to these Romans in the praise of God, choosing to make that the end of 
 his epistle which he made the end of his life. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A description of the gospel of God, which comes in in a parenthesis; 
 having occasion to speak of it as the means by which the power of God 
 establishes souls, and the rule of that establishment: <I>To establish 
 you according to my gospel.</I> Paul calls it his gospel, because he 
 was the preacher of it and because he did so much glory in it. Some 
 think he means especially that declaration, explication, and 
 application, of the doctrine of the gospel, which he had now made in 
 this epistle; but it rather takes in all the preaching and writing of 
 the apostles, among whom Paul was a principal labourer. Through their 
 word 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:20">John xvii. 20</A>),

 the word committed to them. Ministers are the ambassadors, and the 
 gospel is their embassy. Paul had his head and heart so full of the 
 gospel that he could scarcely mention it without a digression to set 
 forth the nature and excellency of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is the <I>preaching of Jesus Christ.</I> Christ was the preacher 
 of it himself; it began to be spoken by the Lord, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:3">Heb. ii. 3</A>.

 So pleased was Christ with his undertaking for our salvation that he
 would himself be the publisher of it. Or, Christ is the subject-matter 
 of it; the sum and substance of the whole gospel is Jesus Christ and 
 him crucified. We preach not ourselves, says Paul, but Christ Jesus the 
 Lord. That which establishes souls is the plain preaching of Jesus 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>It is the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since 
 the world began, and by the scriptures of the prophets made known.</I> 
 The subject-matter of the gospel is a mystery. Our redemption and 
 salvation by Jesus Christ, in the foundation, method, and fruits of it, 
 are, without controversy, a great mystery of godliness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16">1 Tim. iii. 16</A>.
 
 This bespeaks the honour of the gospel; it is no vulgar common thing,
 hammered out by any human wit, but it is the admirable product of the 
 eternal wisdom and counsel of God, and has in it such an inconceivable 
 height, such an unfathomable depth, as surpass knowledge. It is a 
 mystery which the angels desire to look into, and cannot find the 
 bottom of. And yet, blessed be God, there is as much of this mystery 
 made plain as will suffice to bring us to heaven, if we do not wilfully 
 neglect so great salvation. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This mystery was kept secret since the world began: <B><I>chronois 
 aioniois sesigemenou.</I></B> It was <I>wrapped up in silence from 
 eternity;</I> so some--<I>a temporibus &aelig;ternis;</I> it is no new and
 upstart notion, no late invention, but took rise from the days of 
 eternity and the purposes of God's everlasting love. Before the 
 foundation of the world was laid, the mystery was hid in God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:9">Eph. iii. 9</A>.
 
 Or, <I>since the world began,</I> so we translate it. During all the
 times of the Old-Testament this mystery was comparatively kept secret 
 in the types and shadows of the ceremonial law, and the dark 
 predictions of the prophets, which pointed at it, but so that they 
 could not stedfastly look to the end of those things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13">2 Cor. iii. 13</A>.

 Thus it was hid from ages and generations, even among the Jews, much
 more among the Gentiles that sat in darkness and had no notices at all 
 of it. Even the disciples of Christ themselves, before his resurrection 
 and ascension, were very much in the dark about the mystery of 
 redemption, and their notion of it was very much clouded and confused; 
 such a secret was it for many ages. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is now made manifest. The veil is rent, the shadows of the 
 evening are done away, and life and immortality are brought to light by 
 the gospel, and the Sun of righteousness has risen upon the world. Paul 
 does not pretend to have the monopoly of this discovery, as if he alone 
 knew it; no, it is made manifest to many others. But how is it made 
 manifest by the scriptures of the prophets? Surely, because now the 
 event has given the best exposition to the prophecies of the Old 
 Testament. Being accomplished, they are explained. The preaching of the 
 prophets, as far as it related to this mystery, was in a great measure 
 dark and unintelligible in the ages wherein they lived; but the 
 scriptures of the prophets, the things which they left in writing, are 
 now not only made plain in themselves, but by them this mystery is made 
 known to all nations. The Old Testament does not only borrow light 
 from, but return light to, the revelation of the New Testament. If the 
 New Testament explains the Old, the Old Testament, by way of requital, 
 very much illustrates the New. Thus the Old-Testament prophets prophesy 
 again, now their prophecies are fulfilled, <I>before many people, and 
 nations, and tongues.</I> I refer to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:11">Rev. x. 11</A>,

 which this explains. Now Christ appears to have been the treasure hid
 in the field of the Old Testament. To him bear <I>all the prophets 
 witness.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:27">Luke xxiv. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It is manifested <I>according to the commandment of the 
 everlasting God</I>--the purpose, counsel, and decree of God from
 eternity, and the commission and appointment given first to Christ and 
 then to the apostles, in the fulness of time. They received commandment 
 from the Father to do what they did in preaching the gospel. Lest any 
 should object, "Why was this mystery kept secret so long, and why made 
 manifest now?"--he resolves it into the will of God, who is an absolute
 sovereign, and gives not an account of any of his matters. The 
 commandment of the everlasting God was enough to bear out the apostles 
 and ministers of the gospel in their preaching. <I>The everlasting 
 God.</I> This attribute of eternity is here given up to God very 
 emphatically.

 [1.] He is from everlasting, which intimates that though he had kept 
 this mystery secret since the world began, and had but lately revealed 
 it, yet he had framed and contrived it from everlasting, before the 
 worlds were. The oaths and covenants in the written word are but the 
 copy of the oath and covenant which were between the Father and the Son 
 from eternity: those the extracts, these the original. And, 

 [2.] He is to everlasting, intimating the eternal continuance to us. We 
 must never look for any new revelation, but abide by this, for this is 
 according to the commandment of the everlasting God. Christ, in the 
 gospel, is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) It is <I>made known to all nations for the obedience of faith.</I> 
 The extent of this revelation he often takes notice of; that whereas 
 hitherto in Judah only God was known, now Christ is salvation to the 
 ends of the earth, to all nations. And the design of it is very 
 observable; it is for the obedience of faith--that they may believe and
 obey it, receive it and be rules by it. The gospel is revealed, not to 
 be talked of and disputed about, but to be submitted to. The obedience 
 of faith is that obedience which is paid to the word of faith (see that 
 phrase, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:7">Acts vi. 7</A>),

 and which is produced by the grace of faith. See here what is the right 
 faith--even that which works in obedience; and what is the right 
 obedience--even that which springs from faith; and what is the design 
 of the gospel--to bring us to both.</P>

 II. A doxology to that God whose gospel it is, ascribing glory to him 
 for ever 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 acknowledging that he is a glorious God, and adoring him accordingly, 
 with the most awful affections, desiring and longing to be at this work 
 with the holy angels, where we shall be doing it to eternity. This is 
 praising God, ascribing glory to him for ever. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The matter of this praise. In thanking God, we fasten upon his 
 favours to us; in praising and adoring God, we fasten upon his 
 perfections in himself. Two of his principal attributes are here taken 
 notice of:--

 (1.) His power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>To him that is of power to establish you.</I> It is no less than a 
 divine power that establishes the saints. Considering the disposition
 there is in them to fall, the industry of their spiritual enemies that 
 seek to overthrow them, and the shaking times into which their lot is 
 cast, no less than an almighty power will establish them. That power of 
 God which is put forth for the establishment of the saints is and ought 
 to be the matter of our praise, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:24">Jude 24</A>,

 <I>To him that is able to keep you from falling.</I> In giving God the
 glory of this power we may, and must, take to ourselves the comfort of
 it--that whatever our doubts, and difficulties, and fears, may be, our
 God, whom we serve, is of power to establish us. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:5,Joh+10:29">1 Pet. i. 5; John x. 29</A>.

 (2.) His wisdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>To God only wise.</I> Power to effect without wisdom to contrive, 
 and wisdom to contrive without power to effect, are alike vain and 
 fruitless; but both together, and both infinite, make a perfect being.
 He is only wise; not the Father only wise, exclusive of the Son, but 
 Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three persons and one God, only wise, 
 compared with the creatures. Man; the wisest of all the creatures in 
 the lower world, is born like a wild ass's colt; nay, the angels 
 themselves are charged with folly, in comparison with God. He only is 
 perfectly and infallibly wise; he only is originally wise, in and of 
 himself; for he is the spring and fountain of all the wisdom of the 
 creatures, the Father of all the lights of wisdom that any creature can 
 pretend to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:17">James i. 17</A>):

 with him are strength and wisdom, the deceived and deceiver are 
 his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The Mediator of this praise: <I>Through Jesus Christ. To God only 
 wise through Jesus Christ;</I> so some. It is in and through Christ 
 that God is manifested to the world as the only wise God; for he is the 
 wisdom of God, and the power of God. Or rather, as we read it, <I>glory
 through Jesus Christ.</I> All the glory that passes from fallen man to 
 God, so as to be accepted of him, must go through the hands of the Lord 
 Jesus, in whom alone it is that our persons and performances are, or 
 can be, pleasing to God. Of his righteousness therefore we must make 
 mention, even of his only, who, as he is the Mediator of all our 
 prayers, so he is, and I believe will be to eternity, the Mediator of 
 all our praises.</P>
