 Between the promise of the Messiah (even the latest of those promises)
 and his coming many ages intervened; but between the promise of the 
 Spirit and his coming there were but a few days; and during those days 
 the apostles, though they had received orders to preach the gospel to 
 every creature, and to begin at Jerusalem, yet lay perfectly 
 wind-bound, incognito--concealed, and not offering to preach. But in
 this chapter the north wind and the south wind awake, and then they 
 awake, and we have them in the pulpit presently. Here is, 

 I. The descent of the Spirit upon the apostles, and those that were
 with them, on the day of pentecost, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. The various speculations which this occasioned among the people
 that were now met in Jerusalem from all parts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:5-13">ver. 5-13</A>.

 III. The sermon which Peter preached to them hereupon, wherein he shows
 that this pouring out of the Spirit was the accomplishment of an
 Old-Testament promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:14-21">ver. 14-21</A>),

 that it was a confirmation of Christ's being the Messiah, which was
 already proved by his resurrection

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:22-32">ver. 22-32</A>),

 and that is was a fruit and evidence of his ascension into heaven,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:33-36">ver. 33-36</A>.

 IV. The good effect of this sermon in the conversion of many to the
 faith of Christ, and their addition to the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:37-41">ver. 37-41</A>.

 V. The eminent piety and charity of those primitive Christians, and
 the manifest tokens of God's presence with them, and power in them,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all
 with one accord in one place.
 &nbsp; 2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
 mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
 &nbsp; 3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,
 and it sat upon each of them.
 &nbsp; 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to
 speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the 
 disciples of Christ. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When, and where, this was done, which are particularly noted, for 
 the greater certainty of the thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was <I>when the day of pentecost was fully come,</I> in which 
 there seems to be a reference to the manner of the expression in the 
 institution of this feast, where it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:15">Lev. xxiii. 15</A>),

 <I>You shall count unto you seven sabbaths complete,</I> from the day
 of the offering of the first-fruits, which was the next day but one 
 after the passover, the sixteenth day of the month Abib, which was the 
 day that Christ arose. This day was <I>fully come,</I> that is, the 
 night preceding, with a part of the day, was fully past. 

 (1.) The Holy Ghost came down at the time of a solemn feast, because 
 there was then a great concourse of people to Jerusalem from all parts 
 of the country, and the proselytes from other countries, which would 
 make it the more public, and the fame of it to be spread the sooner and 
 further, which would contribute much to the propagating of the gospel 
 into all nations. Thus now, as before at the passover, the Jewish 
 feasts served to toll the bell for gospel services and entertainments. 
 
 (2.) This feast of pentecost was kept in remembrance of the giving of 
 the law upon mount Sinai, whence the incorporating of the Jewish church 
 was to be dated, which Dr. Lightfoot reckons to be just one thousand 
 four hundred and forty-seven years before this. Fitly, therefore, is 
 the Holy Ghost given at that feast, in fire and in tongues, for the 
 promulgation of the evangelical law, not as that to one nation, but to 
 every creature.

 (3.) This feast of pentecost happened on the <I>first day of the 
 week,</I> which was an additional honour put on that day, and a 
 confirmation of it to be the Christian sabbath, <I>the day which the 
 Lord hath made,</I> to be a standing memorial in his church of those 
 two great blessings--the resurrection of Christ, and the pouring out of
 the Spirit, both on that day of the week. This serves not only to 
 justify us in observing that day under the style and title of <I>the 
 Lord's day,</I> but to direct us in the sanctifying of it to give God 
 praise particularly for those two great blessings; every Lord's day in 
 the year, I think, there should be a full and particular notice taken 
 in our prayers and praises of these two, as there is by some churches 
 of the one once a year, upon Easter-day, and of the other once a year, 
 upon Whit-sunday. Oh! that we may do it with suitable affections!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was when <I>they were all with one accord in one place.</I> What 
 place it was we are not told particularly, whether in the temple, where 
 they attended at public times 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:53">Luke xxiv. 53</A>),

 or whether in their own upper room, where they met at other times. But 
 it was at Jerusalem, because this had been the place which God chose, 
 to put his name there, and the prophecy was that thence the word of the 
 Lord should go forth to all nations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3">Isa. ii. 3</A>.

 It was now the place of the general rendezvous of all devout people:
 here God had promised to meet them and bless them; here therefore he 
 meets them with this blessing of blessings. Though Jerusalem had done 
 the utmost dishonour imaginable to Christ, yet he did this honour to 
 Jerusalem, to teach his remnant in all places; he had this in 
 Jerusalem. Here the disciples were in one place, and they were not as 
 yet so many but that one place, and no large one, would hold them all. 
 And here they were <I>with one accord.</I> We cannot forget how often, 
 while their Master was with them, there were <I>strifes among them, who 
 should be the greatest;</I> but now all these strifes were at an end, 
 we hear no more of them. What they had received already of the Holy 
 Ghost, when Christ breathed on them, had in a good measure rectified 
 the mistakes upon which those contests were grounded, and had disposed 
 them to holy love. They had prayed more together of late than usual

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:14"><I>ch.</I> i. 14</A>),

 and this made them love one another better. By his grace he thus
 prepared them for the gift of the Holy Ghost; for that blessed dove 
 comes not where there is noise and clamour, but moves upon the face of 
 the still waters, not the rugged ones. Would we have the Spirit 
 <I>poured out upon us from on high?</I> Let us be all of one accord, 
 and, notwithstanding variety of sentiments and interests, as no doubt 
 there was among those disciples, let us agree to love one another; for, 
 where <I>brethren dwell together in unity,</I> there it is that <I>the 
 Lord commands his blessing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How, and in what manner, the Holy Ghost came upon them. We often 
 read in the old Testament of God's coming down in a cloud; as when he 
 took possession first of the tabernacle, and afterwards of the temple, 
 which intimates the darkness of that dispensation. And Christ went up 
 to heaven in a cloud, to intimate how much we are kept in the dark 
 concerning the upper world. But the Holy Ghost did not descend in a 
 cloud; for he was to dispel and scatter the clouds that overspread 
 men's minds, and to bring light into the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is an audible summons given them to awaken their expectations 
 of something great, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 It is here said,

 (1.) That it came <I>suddenly,</I> did not rise gradually, as common 
 winds do, but was at the height immediately. It came sooner than they 
 expected, and startled even those that were now together waiting, and 
 probably employed in some religious exercises. 

 (2.) It was <I>a sound from heaven,</I> like a thunder-clap, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:1">Rev. vi. 1</A>.
 
 God is said to <I>bring the winds out of his treasuries</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:7">Ps. cxxxv. 7</A>),

 and <I>to gather them in his hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:4">Prov. xxx. 4</A>.

 From him this sound came, like the voice of one crying, <I>Prepare ye 
 the way of the Lord.</I>

 (3.) It was the sound of a wind, for the way of the Spirit is like that 
 of the wind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:3">John iii. 3</A>),

 <I>thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it comes 
 nor whither it goes.</I> When the Spirit of life is to enter into the 
 dry bones, the prophet is told to <I>prophecy unto the wind: Come from 
 the four winds, O breath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:9">Ezek. xxxvii. 9</A>.

 And though it was not <I>in the wind</I> that the Lord came to Elijah,
 yet this prepared him to receive his discovery of himself in the 
 <I>still small voice,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:11,12">1 Kings xix. 11, 12</A>.

 <I>God's way is in the whirlwind and the storm</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:3">Nah. i. 3</A>),

 and out of the whirlwind he spoke to Job.

 (4.) It was a <I>rushing mighty wind;</I> it was strong and violent, 
 and came not only with a great noise, but with great force, as if it 
 would bear down all before it. This was to signify the powerful
 influences and operations of the Spirit of God upon the minds of men, 
 and thereby upon the world, that they should be <I>mighty through God, 
 to the casting down of imaginations.</I> 

 (5.) <I>It filled</I> not only the room, but <I>all the house where 
 they were sitting.</I> Probably it alarmed the whole city, but, to show 
 that it was supernatural, presently fixed upon that particular house: 
 as some think the wind that was sent to arrest Jonah affected only the 
 ship that he was in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:4">Jon. i. 4</A>),

 and as the wise men's star stood over the house where the child was. 
 This would direct the people who observed it whither to go to enquire 
 the meaning of it. This wind filling the house would strike an awe
 upon the disciples, and help to put them into a very serious, reverent, 
 and composed frame, for the receiving of the Holy Ghost. Thus the 
 convictions of the Spirit make way for his comforts; and the rough 
 blasts of that blessed wind prepare the soul for its soft and gentle 
 gales.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is a visible sign of the gift they were to receive. They saw 
 <I>cloven tongues, like as of fire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and <I>it sat</I>--<B><I>ekathise</I></B>, not <I>they</I> sat, those
 cloven tongues, but he, that is the Spirit (signified thereby), rested 
 upon each of them, as he is said to rest upon the prophets of old. Or, 
 as Dr. Hammond describes it, "There was an appearance of something like 
 flaming fire lighting on every one of them, which divided asunder, and 
 so formed the resemblance of tongues, with that part of them that was 
 next their heads divided or cloven." The flame of a candle is somewhat 
 like a tongue; and there is a meteor which naturalists call <I>ignis 
 lambens--a gentle flame,</I> not a devouring fire; such was this.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) There was an outward sensible sign, for the confirming of the 
 faith of the disciples themselves, and for the convincing of others. 
 Thus the prophets of old had frequently their first mission confirmed 
 by signs, that all Israel might know them to be established 
 prophets.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The sign given was fire, that John Baptist's saying concerning 
 Christ might be fulfilled, <I>He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost 
 and with fire;</I> with the Holy Ghost as with fire. They were now, in 
 the feast of pentecost, celebrating the memorial of the giving of the 
 law upon mount Sinai; and as that was given in fire, and therefore is
 called a fiery law, so is the gospel. Ezekiel's mission was confirmed
 by a vision of <I>burning coals of fire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:13"><I>ch.</I> i. 13</A>),

 and Isaiah's by <I>a coal of fire</I> touching his lips,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:7"><I>ch.</I> vi. 7</A>.

 The Spirit, like fire, melts the heart, separates and burns up the
 dross, and kindles pious and devout affections in the soul, in which,
 as in the fire upon the altar, the spiritual sacrifices are offered up.
 This is that fire which Christ came to send upon the earth. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:49">Luke xii. 49</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) This fire appeared in cloven tongues. The operations of the Spirit 
 were many; that of speaking with divers tongues was one, and was 
 singled out to be the first indication of the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
 and to that this sign had a reference. 

 [1.] They were tongues; for from the Spirit we have the word of God, 
 and by him Christ would speak to the world, and he gave the Spirit to 
 the disciples, not only to endue them with knowledge, but to endue them 
 with a power to publish and proclaim to the world what they knew; for 
 <I>the dispensation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit 
 withal.</I> 

 [2.] These tongues were cloven, to signify that God would hereby divide 
 unto all nations the knowledge of his grace, as he is said to have 
 divided to them by his providence the light of the heavenly bodies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19">Deut. iv. 19</A>.

 The tongues were divided, and yet they still continued all of one
 accord; for there may be a sincere unity of affections where yet there 
 is a diversity of expression. Dr. Lightfoot observes that the dividing 
 of tongues at Babel was the casting off of the heathen; for when they 
 had lost the language in which alone God was spoken of and preached, 
 they utterly lost the knowledge of God and religion, and fell into 
 idolatry. But now, after above two thousand years, God, by another 
 dividing of tongues, restores the knowledge of himself to the 
 nations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) This fire sat upon them for some time, to denote the constant 
 residence of the Holy Ghost with them. The prophetic gifts of old were 
 conferred sparingly and but at some times, but the disciples of Christ 
 had the gifts of the Spirit always with them, though the sign, we may 
 suppose, soon disappeared. Whether these flames of fire passed from one 
 to another, or whether there were as many flames as there were persons, 
 is not certain. But they must be strong and bright flames that would be 
 visible in the day-light, as it now was, for the day was fully 
 come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What was the immediate effect of this? 

 1. <I>They were all filled with the Holy Ghost,</I> more plentifully
 and powerfully than they were before. They were filled with the graces 
 of the Spirit, and were more than ever under his sanctifying 
 influences--were now holy, and heavenly, and spiritual, more weaned
 from this world and better acquainted with the other. They were more 
 filled with the comforts of the Spirit, rejoiced more than ever in the 
 love of Christ and the hope of heaven, and in it all their griefs and 
 fears were swallowed up. They were also, for the proof of this, filled 
 with the gifts of the Holy Ghost, which are especially meant here; they 
 were endued with miraculous powers for the furtherance of the gospel. 
 It seems evident to me that not only the twelve apostles, but all the 
 hundred and twenty disciples were <I>filled with the Holy Ghost</I> 
 alike at this time--all the seventy disciples, who were apostolic men,
 and employed in the same work, and all the rest too that were to preach 
 the gospel; for it is said expressly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8,11">Eph. iv. 8, 11</A>),
 
 <I>When Christ ascended on high</I> (which refers to this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 <I>he gave gifts unto men,</I> not only <I>some apostles</I> (such were
 the twelve), but <I>some prophets</I> and <I>some evangelists</I> (such 
 were many of the seventy disciples, itinerant preachers), and some 
 <I>pastors and teachers</I> settled in particular churches, as we may 
 suppose some of these afterwards were. The <I>all</I> here must refer
 to the <I>all</I> that were together,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1;Ac+1:14,15 "><I>v.</I> 1; <I>ch.</I> i. 14, 15</A>.

 2. <I>They began to speak with other tongues,</I> besides their native
 language, though they had never learned any other. They spoke not
 matters of common conversation, but the word of God, and the praises of 
 his name, <I>as the Spirit gave them utterance,</I> or gave them to 
 speak <B><I>apophthengesthai</I></B>--<I>apophthegms,</I> substantial
 and weighty sayings, worthy to be had in remembrance. It is probable 
 that it was not only one that was enabled to speak one language, and 
 another another (as it was with the several families that were 
 dispersed from Babel), but that every one was enabled to speak divers 
 languages, as he should have occasion to use them. And we may suppose 
 that they understood not only themselves but one another too, which the 
 builders of Babel did not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+11:7">Gen. xi. 7</A>.

 They did not speak here and there a word of another tongue, or stammer
 out some broken sentences, but spoke it as readily, properly, and 
 elegantly, as if it had been their mother-tongue; for whatever was 
 produced by miracle was the best of the kind. They spoke not from any 
 previous thought or meditation, but <I>as the Spirit gave them 
 utterance;</I> he furnished them with the matter as well as the 
 language. Now this was,

 (1.) A very great miracle; it was a miracle upon the mind (and so had
 most of the nature of a gospel miracle), for in the mind words are 
 framed. They had not only never learned these languages, but had never 
 learned any foreign tongue, which might have facilitated these; nay, 
 for aught that appears, they had never so much as heard these languages 
 spoken, nor had any idea of them. They were neither scholars nor 
 travellers, nor had had any opportunity of learning languages either by 
 books or conversation. Peter indeed was forward enough to speak in his
 own tongue, but the rest of them were no spokesmen, nor were they quick 
 of apprehension; yet now not only <I>the heart of the rash understands 
 knowledge, but the tongue of the stammerers is ready to speak 
 eloquently,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:4">Isa. xxxii. 4</A>.

 When Moses complained, <I>I am slow of speech,</I> God said, <I>I will 
 be with thy mouth,</I> and <I>Aaron shall be thy spokesman.</I> But he 
 did more for these messengers of his: he that made man's mouth new-made 
 theirs.

 (2.) A very proper, needful, and serviceable miracle. The language the
 disciples spoke was Syriac, a dialect of the Hebrew; so that it was 
 necessary that they should be endued with the gift, for the 
 understanding both of the original Hebrew of the Old Testament, in 
 which it was written, and of the original Greek of the New Testament, 
 in which it was to be written. But this was not all; they were
 commissioned to <I>preach the gospel to every creature, to disciple all 
 nations.</I> But here is an insuperable difficulty at the threshold.
 How shall they master the several languages so as to speak intelligibly 
 to all nations? It will be the work of a man's life to learn their 
 languages. And therefore, to prove that Christ could give authority to 
 preach to the nations, he gives ability to preach to them in their own 
 language. And it should seem that this was the accomplishment of that 
 promise which Christ made to his disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:12">John xiv. 12</A>),

 <I>Greater works than these shall you do.</I> For this may well be 
 reckoned, all things considered, a greater work than the miraculous 
 cures Christ wrought. Christ himself did not speak with other tongues, 
 nor did he enable his disciples to do so while he was with them: but it 
 was the first effect of the <I>pouring out of the Spirit</I> upon them. 
 And archbishop Tillotson thinks it probable that if the conversion of 
 infidels to Christianity were now sincerely and vigorously attempted, 
 by men of honest minds, God would extraordinarily countenance such an 
 attempt with all fitting assistance, as he did the first publication of 
 the gospel.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
 every nation under heaven.
 &nbsp; 6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together,
 and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in
 his own language.
 &nbsp; 7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to
 another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galil&aelig;ans?
 &nbsp; 8 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were
 born?
 &nbsp; 9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in
 Mesopotamia, and in Jud&aelig;a, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
 &nbsp; 10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya
 about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,
 &nbsp; 11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues
 the wonderful works of God.
 &nbsp; 12 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
 another, What meaneth this?
 &nbsp; 13 Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the public notice that was taken of this 
 extraordinary gift with which the disciples were all on a sudden 
 endued. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The great concourse of people that there was now at Jerusalem, it 
 should seem more than was usual at the feast of pentecost. <I>There 
 were dwelling</I> or abiding <I>at Jerusalem</I> Jews that were 
 <I>devout men,</I> disposed to religion, and that had the fear of God 
 before their eyes (so the word properly signifies), some of them 
 <I>proselytes of righteousness,</I> that were circumcised, and admitted 
 members of the Jewish church, others only <I>proselytes of the 
 gate,</I> that forsook idolatry, and gave up themselves to the worship 
 of the true God, but not to the ceremonial law; some of those that were 
 at Jerusalem now, <I>out of every nation under heaven,</I> whither the 
 Jews were dispersed, or whence proselytes were come. The expression is 
 hyperbolical, denoting that there were some from most of the then known 
 parts of the world; as much as ever Tyre was, or London is, the 
 rendezvous of trading people from all parts, Jerusalem at that time was 
 of religious people from all parts. Now, 

 1. We may here see what were some of those countries whence those
 strangers came

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>),

 some from the eastern countries, as the <I>Parthians, Medes, Elamites, 
 and dwellers in Mesopotamia,</I> the posterity of Shem; thence we come 
 in order to Judea, which ought to be mentioned, because, though the 
 language of those in Judea was the same with that which the disciples 
 spoke, yet, before, they spoke it with the north-country tone and 
 dialect (<I>Thou art a Galilean, and thy speech betrays thee</I>), but 
 now they spoke it as correctly as the inhabitants of Judea themselves 
 did. Next come the inhabitants of Cappadocia, Pontus, and that country 
 about Propontis which was particularly called <I>Asia,</I> and these 
 were the countries in which those strangers were scattered to whom St.
 Peter writes. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1">1 Pet. i. 1</A>.

 Next come the dwellers in <I>Phrygia and Pamphylia,</I> which lay
 westward, the posterity of Japhet, as were also the <I>strangers of 
 Rome;</I> there were some also that dwelt in the southern parts of 
 <I>Egypt, in the parts of Libya about Cyrene;</I> there were also some 
 from the island of Crete, and some from the deserts of Arabia; but they 
 were all either Jews originally, dispersed into those countries; or 
 <I>proselytes</I> to the Jewish religion, but natives of those 
 countries. Dr. Whitby observes that the Jewish writers about this time, 
 as Philo and Josephus, speak of the Jews as <I>dwelling every where 
 through the whole earth;</I> and that <I>there is not a people upon 
 earth among whom some Jews do not inhabit.</I> 

 2. We may enquire what brought all those Jews and proselytes together
 to Jerusalem at this time: not to make a transient visit thither to the 
 feast of pentecost, for they are said to dwell there. They took 
 lodgings there, because there was at this time a general expectation of 
 the appearing of the Messiah; for Daniel's weeks had just now expired, 
 the sceptre had departed from Judah, and it was then generally thought 
 that <I>the kingdom of God would immediately appear,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:11">Luke xix. 11</A>.
 
 This brought those who were most zealous and devout to Jerusalem, to
 sojourn there, that they might have an early share in the kingdom of 
 the Messiah and the blessings of that kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The amazement with which these strangers were seized when they 
 heard the disciples speak in their own tongues. It should seem, the 
 disciples spoke in various languages before the people of those 
 languages came to them; for it is intimated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 that the spreading of the report of this abroad was that which 
 <I>brought the multitude together,</I> especially those of different 
 countries, who seem to have been more affected with this work of wonder 
 than the inhabitants of Jerusalem themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They observe that the speakers are all Galileans, that know no other 
 than their mother tongue 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 they are despicable men, from whom nothing learned nor polite is to be 
 expected. God chose the weak and foolish things of the world to 
 confound the wise and mighty. Christ was thought to be a Galilean, and 
 his disciples really were so, unlearned and ignorant men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They acknowledge that they spoke intelligibly and readily their own 
 language (which they were the most competent judges of), so correctly 
 and fluently that none of their own countrymen could speak it better: 
 <I>We hear every man in our own tongue wherein we were born</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 that is, we hear one or other of them speak our native language. The 
 Parthians hear one of them speak their language, the Medes hear another 
 of them speak theirs; and so of the rest; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>,

 <I>We do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</I> 
 Their respective languages were not only unknown at Jerusalem, but 
 probably despised and undervalued, and therefore it was not only a 
 surprise, but a pleasing surprise, to them to hear the language of 
 their own country spoken, as it naturally is to those that are 
 strangers in a strange land.

 (1.) The things they heard the apostles discourse of were the 
 <I>wonderful works of God,</I> <B><I>megaleia tou 
 Theou</I></B>--<I>Magnalia Dei, the great things of God.</I> It is
 probable that the apostles spoke of Christ, and redemption by him, and 
 the grace of the gospel; and these are indeed the <I>great things of 
 God,</I> which will be for ever <I>marvellous in our eyes.</I> 

 (2.) They heard them both praise God for these great things and 
 instruct the people concerning these things, <I>in their own 
 tongue,</I> according as they perceived the language of their hearers, 
 or those that enquired of them, to be. Now though, perhaps, by dwelling 
 some time at Jerusalem, they were got to be so much masters of the 
 Jewish language that they could have understood the meaning of the 
 disciples if they had spoken that language, yet, 

 [1.] This was more strange, and helped to convince their judgment, that 
 this doctrine was of God; for <I>tongues were for a sign</I> to those 
 that believed not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:22">1 Cor. xiv. 22</A>.

 [2.] It was more kind, and helped to engage their affections, as it was
 a plain indication of the favour intended to the Gentiles, and that the 
 knowledge and worship of God should no longer be confined to the Jews, 
 but the partition-wall should be broken down; and this is to us a plain 
 intimation of the mind and will of God, that the sacred records of 
 God's wonderful works should be preserved by all nations <I>in their 
 own tongue;</I> that the scriptures should be read, and public worship 
 performed, in the vulgar languages of the nations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They wonder at it, and look upon it as an astonishing thing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 <I>They were all amazed,</I> they were in an <I>ecstacy,</I> so the 
 word is; and they were in doubt what the meaning of it was, and whether 
 it was to introduce the kingdom of the Messiah, which they were big 
 with the expectation of; they asked themselves and one another <B><I>ti 
 an theloi touto einai</I></B>;--<I>Quid hoc sibi vult?--What is the
 tendency of this?</I> Surely it is to dignify, and so to distinguish, 
 these men as messengers from heaven; and therefore, like Moses at the 
 bush, they will <I>turn aside, and see this great sight.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The scorn which some made of it who were natives of Judea and 
 Jerusalem, probably the scribes and Pharisees, and chief priests, who 
 always resisted the Holy Ghost; they said, <I>These men are full of new 
 wine,</I> or <I>sweet wine;</I> they have drunk too much this 
 festival-time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Not that they were so absurd as to think that wine in the head would 
 enable men to speak languages which they never learned; but these, 
 being native Jews, knew not, as the others did, that what was spoken 
 was really the languages of other nations, and therefore took it to be 
 gibberish and nonsense, such as drunkards, those <I>fools in 
 Israel,</I> sometimes talk. As when they resolved not to believe the 
 finger of the Spirit in Christ's miracles, they turned it off with 
 this, "He casteth out devils by compact with the prince of the devils;" 
 so, when they resolved not to believe the voice of the Spirit in the 
 apostles' preaching, they turned it off with this, <I>These men are 
 full of new wine.</I> And, if they called the Master of the house a 
 wine-bibber, no marvel if they so call those of his household.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice,
 and said unto them, Ye men of Jud&aelig;a, and all <I>ye</I> that dwell at
 Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:
 &nbsp; 15 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is <I>but</I>
 the third hour of the day.
 &nbsp; 16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;
 &nbsp; 17 And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I
 will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your
 daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions,
 and your old men shall dream dreams:
 &nbsp; 18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in
 those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:
 &nbsp; 19 And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the
 earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:
 &nbsp; 20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into
 blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:
 &nbsp; 21 And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> whosoever shall call on
 the name of the Lord shall be saved.
 &nbsp; 22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
 approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs,
 which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also
 know:
 &nbsp; 23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and
 foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have
 crucified and slain:
 &nbsp; 24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death:
 because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.
 &nbsp; 25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
 before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be
 moved:
 &nbsp; 26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad;
 moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
 &nbsp; 27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt
 thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
 &nbsp; 28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make
 me full of joy with thy countenance.
 &nbsp; 29 Men <I>and</I> brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the
 patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his
 sepulchre is with us unto this day.
 &nbsp; 30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn
 with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to
 the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;
 &nbsp; 31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ,
 that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see
 corruption.
 &nbsp; 32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
 &nbsp; 33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
 received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath
 shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.
 &nbsp; 34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith
 himself, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
 &nbsp; 35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.
 &nbsp; 36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that
 God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord
 and Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the first-fruits of the Spirit in the sermon which Peter 
 preached immediately, directed, not to those of other nations in a 
 strange language (we are not told what answer he gave to those that 
 were amazed, and said, <I>What meaneth this?</I>) but to the Jews in 
 the vulgar language, even to those that mocked; for he begins with the 
 notice of that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and addresses his discourse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 <I>to the men of Judea and the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</I> but we 
 have reason enough to think that the other disciples continued to speak 
 to those who understood them (and therefore flocked about them), in the 
 languages of their respective countries, <I>the wonderful works of 
 God.</I> And it was not by Peter's preaching only, but that of all, or 
 most, of the rest of the hundred and twenty, <I>that three thousand 
 souls were</I> that day converted, and added to the church; but Peter's 
 sermon only is recorded, to be an evidence for him that he was 
 thoroughly recovered from his fall, and thoroughly restored to the 
 divine favour. He that had sneakingly denied Christ now as courageously 
 confesses him. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His introduction or preface, wherein he craves the attention of the 
 auditory, or demands it rather: <I>Peter stood up</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 to show that he was not drunk, <I>with the eleven,</I> who concurred 
 with him in what he said, and probably in their turns spoke likewise to 
 the same purport; those that were of greatest authority stood up to 
 speak to the scoffing Jews, and to confront those who contradicted and 
 blasphemed, but left the seventy disciples to speak to the willing 
 proselytes from other nations, who were not so prejudiced, in their own 
 language. Thus among Christ's ministers, some of greater gifts are 
 called out to instruct those that oppose themselves, to take hold of 
 sword and spear; others of meaner abilities are employed in instructing 
 those that resign themselves, and to be vine-dressers and husband-men.
 <I>Peter lifted up his voice,</I> as one that was both well assured of 
 and much affected with what he said, and was neither afraid nor ashamed 
 to own it. He applied himself to <I>the men of Judea,</I> <B><I>andres 
 Ioudaioi</I></B>--<I>the men that were Jews;</I> so it should be read;
 "and you especially <I>that dwell at Jerusalem,</I> who were accessory 
 to the death of Jesus, <I>be this known unto you,</I> which you did not 
 know before, and which you are concerned to know now, <I>and hearken to 
 my words,</I> who would draw you to Christ, and not to the words of the 
 scribes and Pharisees, that would draw you from him. My Master is gone, 
 whose words you have often heard in vain, and shall hear no more as you 
 have done, but he speaks to you by us; hearken now to our words."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His answer to their blasphemous calumny 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>These men are not drunken, as you suppose.</I> These disciples of 
 Christ, that now <I>speak with other tongues,</I> speak good sense, and 
 know what they say, and so do those they speak to, who are led by their 
 discourses into the knowledge of <I>the wonderful works of God.</I> You 
 cannot think they are drunk, for <I>it is but the third hour of the 
 day,</I>" nine of the clock in the morning; and before this time, on 
 the sabbaths and solemn feasts, the Jews did not eat nor drink: nay, 
 ordinarily, <I>those that are drunk are drunk in the night,</I> and not 
 in the morning; those are besotted drunkards indeed who, <I>when they 
 awake,</I> immediately <I>seek it yet again,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:35">Prov. xxiii. 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His account of the miraculous effusion of the Spirit, which is 
 designed to awaken them all to embrace the faith of Christ, and to join 
 themselves to his church. Two things he resolves it into:--that it was
 the fulfilling of the scripture, and the fruit of Christ's resurrection 
 and ascension, and consequently the proof of both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That it was the accomplishment of the prophecies of the Old 
 Testament which related to the kingdom of the Messiah, and therefore an 
 evidence that this kingdom is come, and the other predictions of it are 
 fulfilled. He specifies one, that of <I>the prophet Joel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:28"><I>ch.</I> ii. 28</A>.

 It is observable that though Peter <I>was filled with the Holy Ghost,
 and spoke with tongues as the Spirit gave him utterance,</I> yet he did 
 not set aside the scriptures, nor think himself above them; nay, much 
 of his discourse is quotation out of the Old Testament, to which he 
 appeals, and with which he proves what he says. Christ's scholars never 
 learn above their Bible; and the Spirit is given not to supersede the 
 scriptures, but to enable us to understand and improve the scriptures. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The text itself that Peter quotes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:17-21"><I>v.</I> 17-21</A>.

 It refers to <I>the last days,</I> the times of the gospel, which are 
 called <I>the last days</I> because the dispensation of God's kingdom 
 among men, which the gospel sets up, is the last dispensation of divine 
 grace, and we are to look for no other than the continuation of this to 
 the end of time. Or, <I>in the last days,</I> that is, a great while 
 after the ceasing of prophecy in the Old-Testament church. Or, in the 
 days immediately preceding the destruction of the Jewish nation, in the 
 last days of that people, just before <I>that great and notable day of 
 the Lord</I> spoken of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 "It was prophesied of and promised, and therefore you ought to expect 
 it, and not to be surprised at it; to desire it, and bid it welcome, 
 and not to dispute it, as not worth taking notice of." The apostle 
 quotes the whole paragraph, for it is good to take scripture entire; 
 now it was foretold,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That there should be a more plentiful and extensive effusion of 
 the Spirit of grace from on high than had ever yet been. The prophets 
 of the Old Testament had been <I>filled with the Holy Ghost,</I> and it 
 was said of the people of Israel <I>that God gave them his good Spirit
 to instruct them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:20">Neh. ix. 20</A>.

 But now <I>the Spirit shall be poured out,</I> not only upon the Jews,
 but <I>upon all flesh,</I> Gentiles as well as Jews, though yet Peter 
 himself did not understand it so, as appears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:17"><I>ch.</I> xi. 17</A>.

 Or, <I>upon all flesh,</I> that is, upon some of all ranks and 
 conditions of men. The Jewish doctors taught that the Spirit came only 
 upon wise and rich men, and such as were of the seed of Israel; but God 
 will not tie himself to their rules.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That the Spirit should be in them a Spirit of prophecy; by the 
 Spirit they should be enabled to foretel things to come, and to 
 <I>preach the gospel to every creature.</I> This power shall be given 
 without distinction of sex--now only <I>your sons,</I> but <I>your
 daughters shall prophesy;</I> without distinction of age--both <I>your
 young men and your old men shall see visions, and dream dreams,</I> and 
 in them receive divine revelations, to be communicated to the church; 
 and without distinction of outward condition--even the <I>servants and
 handmaids</I> shall receive of <I>the Spirit, and shall prophesy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 or, in general, men and women, whom God calls his servants and his 
 handmaids. In the beginning of the age of prophecy in the Old Testament 
 there were <I>schools of the prophets,</I> and, before that, <I>the 
 Spirit of prophecy</I> came upon <I>the elders of Israel</I> that were 
 appointed to the government; but now the Spirit shall be poured out 
 upon persons of inferior rank, and such as were not brought up in the 
 schools of the prophets, for the kingdom of the Messiah is to be purely 
 spiritual. The mention of <I>the daughters</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 and <I>the handmaidens</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 would make one think that <I>the women</I> who were taken notice of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:14"><I>ch.</I> i. 14</A>)

 received the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost, as well as the men.
 Philip, the evangelist, had <I>four daughters who did prophesy</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:9"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 9</A>),

 and St. Paul, finding abundance of the gifts both of tongues and
 prophecy in the church of Corinth, saw it needful to prohibit women's
 use of those gifts in public,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:26,34">1 Cor. xiv. 26, 34</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] That one great thing which they should prophesy of should be the
 judgment that was coming upon the Jewish nation, for this was the chief
 thing that Christ himself had foretold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:1-51">Matt. xxiv.</A>)

 at his entrance into Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:41">Luke xix. 41</A>);

 and when he was going to die 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:29">Luke xxiii. 29</A>);

 and these judgments were to be brought upon them to punish for their 
 contempt of the gospel, and their opposition to it, though it came to 
 them thus proved. Those that would not submit to the power of God's 
 grace, in this wonderful effusion of his Spirit, should fall and lie 
 under the pourings out of the vials of his wrath. Those shall break 
 that will not bend. <I>First,</I> The destruction of Jerusalem, which
 was about forty years after Christ's death, is here called <I>that 
 great and notable day of the Lord,</I> because it put a final period to 
 the Mosaic economy; the Levitical priesthood and the ceremonial law 
 were thereby for ever abolished and done away. The desolation itself 
 was such as was never brought upon any place or nation, either before 
 or since. It was <I>the day of the Lord,</I> for it was the day of his 
 vengeance upon that people for crucifying Christ, and persecuting his 
 ministers; it was <I>the year of recompences for that controversy;</I> 
 yea, and for all the blood of the saints and martyrs, <I>from the blood 
 of righteous Abel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35">Matt. xxiii. 35</A>.

 It was a little day of judgment; it was a <I>notable day:</I> in Joel
 it is called a <I>terrible day,</I> for so it was to men on earth; but 
 here <B><I>epiphane</I></B> (after the Septuagint), <I>a glorious, 
 illustrious</I> day, for so it was to Christ in heaven; it was the 
 epiphany, his appearing, so he himself spoke of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:30">Matt. xxiv. 30</A>.

 The destruction of the Jews was the deliverance of the Christians, who 
 were hated and persecuted by them; and therefore that day was often 
 spoken of by the prophets of that time, for the encouragement of 
 suffering Christians, <I>that the Lord was at hand, the coming of the 
 Lord drew nigh, the Judge stood before the door,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:8,9">James v. 8, 9</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> The terrible presages of that destruction are here
 foretold: <I>There shall be wonders in heaven above, the sun turned 
 into darkness and the moon into blood; and signs</I> too <I>in the 
 earth beneath, blood and fire.</I> Josephus, in his preface to his 
 history of the wars of the Jews, speaks of the signs and prodigies that 
 preceded them, terrible thunders, lightnings, and earthquakes; there 
 was a fiery comet that hung over the city for a year, and a flaming 
 sword was seen pointing down upon it; a light shone upon the temple and 
 the altar at midnight, as if it had been noon-day. Dr. Lightfoot gives
 another sense of these presages: <I>The blood of the Son of God, the 
 fire of the Holy Ghost</I> now appearing, the vapour of the smoke in 
 which Christ ascended, <I>the sun darkened, and the moon made 
 blood,</I> at the time of Christ's passion, were all loud warnings 
 given to that unbelieving people to prepare for the judgments coming 
 upon them. Or, it may be applied, and very fitly, to the previous 
 judgments themselves by which that desolation was brought on. <I>The
 blood</I> points at the wars of the Jews with the neighbouring nations, 
 with the Samaritans, Syrians, and Greeks, in which abundance of blood 
 was shed, as there was also in their civil wars, and the struggles of 
 the <I>seditious</I> (as they called them), which were very bloody; 
 there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in. <I>The 
 fire and vapour of smoke,</I> here foretold, literally came to pass in 
 the burning of their cities, and towns, and synagogues, and temple at 
 last. And this turning of <I>the sun into darkness, and the moon into 
 blood,</I> bespeaks the dissolution of their government, civil and 
 sacred, and the extinguishing of all their lights. <I>Thirdly,</I> The
 signal preservation of the Lord's people is here promised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):
 
 <I>Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord Jesus</I> (which is
 the description of a true Christian, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:2">1 Cor. i. 2</A>)

 <I>shall be saved,</I> shall escape that judgment which shall be a type 
 and earnest of everlasting salvation. In the destruction of Jerusalem 
 by the Chaldeans, there was a remnant sealed to be hid in <I>the day of 
 the Lord's anger;</I> and in the destruction by the Romans not one 
 Christian perished. Those that distinguish themselves by singular piety 
 shall be distinguished by special preservation. And observe, the saved 
 remnant are described by this, that they are a praying people: <I>they 
 call on the name of the Lord,</I> which intimates that they are not 
 saved by any merit or righteousness of their own, but purely by the 
 favour of God, which must be sued out by prayer. It is <I>the name of 
 the Lord</I> which <I>they call upon</I> that is <I>their strong 
 tower.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The application of this prophecy to the present event 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 
 <I>This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</I> it is the 
 accomplishment of that, it is the full accomplishment of it. This is 
 that effusion of the Spirit upon all flesh which should come, and we 
 are to look for no other, no more than we are to look for another 
 Messiah; for as our Messiah ever lives in heaven, reigning and 
 interceding for his church on earth, so this Spirit of grace, the 
 Advocate, or Comforter, that was given now, according to the promise, 
 will, according to the same promise, continue with the church on earth 
 to the end, and will work all its works in it and for it, and every 
 member of it, ordinary and extraordinary, by means of the scriptures 
 and the ministry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That it was the gift of Christ, and the product and proof of his 
 resurrection and ascension. From this <I>gift of the Holy Ghost,</I> he 
 takes occasion to preach unto them Jesus; and this part of his sermon 
 he introduces with another solemn preface 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>You men of Israel, hear these words.</I> It is a mercy that you are 
 within hearing of them, and it is your duty to give heed to them." 
 Words concerning Christ should be acceptable words to the men of 
 Israel. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) An abstract of the history of the life of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 He calls him <I>Jesus of Nazareth,</I> because by that name he was 
 generally known, but (which was sufficient to roll away that reproach) 
 he was <I>a man approved of God among you,</I> censured and condemned 
 by men, but approved of God: God testified his approbation of his 
 doctrine by the power he gave him to work miracles: <I>a man marked out 
 by God,</I> so Dr. Hammond reads it; "signalized and made remarkable 
 among you that now hear me. He was sent to you, set up, a glorious 
 light in your land; you yourselves are witnesses how he became famous 
 by <I>miracles, wonders, and signs,</I> works above the power of 
 nature, out of its ordinary course, and contrary to it, <I>which God 
 did by him;</I> that is, which he did by that divine power with which 
 he was clothed, and in which God plainly went along with him; <I>for no 
 man could do such works unless God were with him.</I>" See what a 
 stress Peter lays upon Christ's miracles.

 [1.] The matter of fact was not to be denied: "They were done <I>in the 
 midst of you,</I> in the midst of your country, your city, your solemn 
 assemblies, <I>as you yourselves also know.</I> You have been 
 eyewitnesses of his miracles; I appeal to yourselves whether you have 
 any thing to object against them or can offer any thing to disprove 
 them." 

 [2.] The inference from them cannot be disputed; the reasoning is as 
 strong as the evidence; if he did those miracles, certainly God 
 approved him, <I>declared him to be,</I> what he declared himself to 
 be, <I>the Son of God</I> and <I>the Saviour of the world;</I> for the 
 God of truth would never set his seal to a lie.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) An account of his death and sufferings which they were witness of 
 also but a few weeks ago; and this was the greatest miracle of all, 
 that a man approved of God should thus seem to be abandoned of him; and 
 a man thus approved among the people, and in the midst of them, should 
 be thus abandoned by them too. But both these mysteries are here 
 explained 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and his death considered, 

 [1.] As God's act; and in him it was an act of wonderful grace and 
 wisdom. He <I>delivered him to death;</I> not only permitted him to be 
 put to death, but gave him up, devoted him: this is explained 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:32">Rom. viii. 32</A>,

 <I>He delivered him up for us all.</I> And yet he was approved of God,
 and there was nothing in this that signified the disapproving of him; 
 for it was done by <I>the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of 
 God,</I> in infinite wisdom, and for holy ends, which Christ himself 
 concurred in, and in the means leading to them. Thus divine justice 
 must be satisfied, sinners saved, God and man brought together again, 
 and Christ himself glorified. It was not only according to the will of 
 God, but according <I>to the counsel of his will,</I> that he suffered 
 and died; according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered.
 This reconciled him to the cross: <I>Father, thy will be done;</I> and 
 <I>Father, glorify thy name;</I> let thy purpose take effect, and let 
 the great end of it be attained.

 [2.] As the people's act; and in them it was an act of prodigious sin 
 and folly; it was fighting against God to persecute one whom he 
 approved as the darling of heaven; and fighting against their own 
 mercies to persecute one that was the greatest blessing of this earth. 
 Neither God's designing it from eternity, nor his bringing good out of 
 it to eternity, would in the least excuse their sin; for it was their 
 voluntary act and deed, from a principle morally evil, and therefore 
 "they were <I>wicked hands with which you have crucified and slain</I> 
 him." It is probable that some of those were here present who had 
 cried, <I>Crucify him, crucify him,</I> or had been otherwise aiding 
 and abetting in the murder; and Peter knew it. However, it was justly 
 looked upon as a national act, because done both by the vote of the 
 great council and by the voice of the great crowd. It is a rule, 
 <I>Refertur ad universos quod publice fit per majorem paretm--That
 which is done publicly by the greater part we attribute to all.</I> He 
 charges it particularly on them as parts of the nation on which it 
 would be visited, the more effectually to bring them to faith and 
 repentance, because that was the only way to distinguish themselves 
 from the guilty and discharge themselves from the guilt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) An attestation of his resurrection, which effectually wiped away 
 the reproach of his death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Whom God raised up;</I> the same that delivered him <I>to death</I> 
 delivers him <I>from death,</I> and thereby gave a higher approbation 
 of him than he had done by any other of <I>the signs and wonders 
 wrought by him,</I> or by all put together. This therefore he insists
 most largely upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He describes his resurrection: God <I>loosed the pains of death, 
 because it was impossible that he should be holden of it;</I> 
 <B><I>odinas</I></B>--<I>the sorrows of death;</I> the word is used for
 <I>travailing pains,</I> and some think it signifies <I>the trouble and 
 agony</I> of his soul, in which <I>it was exceedingly sorrowful, even 
 to the death;</I> from <I>these pains and sorrows of soul, this travail 
 of soul, the Father loosed him</I> when at his death he said, <I>It is 
 finished.</I> Thus Dr. Godwin understands it: "Those terrors which made 
 Heman's soul lie like <I>the slain</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:5,15">Ps. lxxxviii. 5, 15</A>)

 had hold of Christ; but he was too strong for them, and broke through 
 them; this was <I>the resurrection of his soul</I> (and it is a great 
 thing to bring a soul <I>out of the depths</I> of spiritual agonies); 
 this was not leaving his soul in hell; as that which follows, <I>that 
 he should not see corruption,</I> speaks of the resurrection of his 
 body; and both together make up the great resurrection." Dr. Lightfoot 
 gives another sense of this: "Having <I>dissolved the pains of
 death,</I> in reference to all that believe in him, God raised up 
 Christ, and by his resurrection <I>broke all the power of death,</I> 
 and destroyed its pangs upon his own people. He <I>has abolished 
 death,</I> has altered the property of it, and, because <I>it was not 
 possible that he should be</I> long <I>holden of it, it is not possible 
 that they should be</I> for ever holden." But most refer this to the 
 resurrection of Christ's body. And death (says Mr. Baxter) is by 
 privation a penal state, though not dolorous by positive evil. But Dr. 
 Hammond shows that the Septuagint, and from them the apostle here, uses 
 the word for <I>cords</I> and <I>bands</I> (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:4">Ps. xviii. 4</A>),

 to which the metaphor of loosing and being held best agrees. Christ was 
 imprisoned for our debt, was thrown into the bands of death; but, 
 divine justice being satisfied, it was not possible he should be 
 detained there, either by right or by force; for he had life in 
 himself, and in his own power, and had conquered the prince of 
 death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He attests the truth of his resurrection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>God hath raised him up, whereof we all are witnesses</I>--we
 apostles, and others our companions, that were intimately acquainted 
 with him before his death, were intimately conversant with him after 
 his resurrection, <I>did eat and drink with him.</I> They <I>received 
 power,</I> by <I>the descent of the Holy Ghost upon them,</I> on 
 purpose that they might be skilful, faithful, and courageous witnesses 
 of this thing, notwithstanding their being charged by his enemies as 
 having stolen him away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] He showed it to be the fulfilling of the scripture, and, because
 the scripture had said that he must rise again before he saw 
 corruption, therefore <I>it was impossible that he should be holden</I> 
 by <I>death</I> and <I>the grave; for David speaks</I> of his being 
 raised, so it comes in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 The scripture he refers to is that of David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:8-11">Ps. xvi. 8-11</A>),

 which, though in part applicable to David as a saint, yet refers 
 chiefly to Jesus Christ, of whom David was a type. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The text quoted at large 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:25-28"><I>v.</I> 25-28</A>),

 for it was all fulfilled in him, and shows us, 

 1. The constant regard that our Lord Jesus had to his Father in his
 whole undertaking: <I>I foresaw the Lord before me continually.</I> He 
 set before him his Father's glory as his end in all--<I>for he saw</I>
 that his sufferings would redound abundantly to the honour of God, and 
 would issue in his own joy; these were <I>set before him,</I> and these 
 he had an eye to, in all he did and suffered; and with the prospect of 
 these he was borne up and carried on,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:31,32,17:4,5">John xiii. 31, 32; xvii. 4, 5</A>.

 2. The assurance he had of his Father's presence and power going along 
 with him: "<I>He is on my right hand,</I> the hand of action, 
 strengthening, guiding, and upholding that, <I>that I should not be 
 moved,</I> nor driven off from my undertaking, notwithstanding the 
 hardships I must undergo." This was an article of the covenant of 
 redemption

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:21">Ps. lxxxix. 21</A>),

 <I>With him my hand shall be established, my arm also shall strengthen
 him;</I> and therefore he is confident the work shall not miscarry in 
 his hand. If God be at our right hand we shall not be moved. 

 3. The cheerfulness with which our Lord Jesus went on in his work,
 notwithstanding the sorrows he was to pass through: "Being satisfied 
 <I>that I shall not be moved,</I> but the good pleasure of the Lord 
 shall prosper in my hand, therefore <I>doth my heart rejoice, and my 
 tongue is glad,</I> and the thought of my sorrow is as nothing to me." 
 Note, It was a constant pleasure to our Lord Jesus to look <I>to the 
 end of his work,</I> and to be sure that the issue would be glorious; 
 so well pleased is he with his undertaking that it does his heart good 
 to think how the issue would answer the design. <I>He rejoiced in 
 spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:21">Luke x. 21</A>.
 
 <I>My tongue was glad.</I> In the psalm it is, <I>My glory 
 rejoiceth;</I> which intimates that our tongue is our glory, the 
 faculty of speaking is an honour to us, and never more so than when it 
 is employed in praising God. Christ's <I>tongue was glad,</I> for when 
 he was just entering upon his sufferings, in the close of his last 
 supper, he <I>sang a hymn.</I> 

 4. The pleasing prospect he had of the happy issue of his death and
 sufferings; it was this that carried him, not only with courage, but 
 with cheerfulness, through them; he was putting off the body, but <I>my 
 flesh shall rest;</I> the grave shall be to the body, while it lies 
 there, a bed of repose, and hope shall give it a sweet repose; <I>it 
 shall rest in hope,</I> <B><I>hoti,</I></B> <I>that thou wilt no leave 
 my soul in hell;</I> what follows is the matter of his hope, or 
 assurance rather,

 (1.) That the soul shall not continue in a state of separation from the 
 body; for, besides that this is some uneasiness to a human soul made 
 for its body, it would be the continuance of death's triumph over him 
 who was in truth a conqueror over death: "<I>Thou wilt not leave my 
 soul in hell</I>" (in <I>hades,</I> in <I>the invisible state,</I> so 
 <I>hades</I> properly signifies); "but, though thou suffer it for a 
 time to remove thither, and to remain there, yet thou wilt remand it; 
 <I>thou wilt not leave it</I> there, as thou dost the souls of other 
 men." 

 (2.) That the body shall lie but a little while in the grave: <I>Thou 
 wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption;</I> the body shall not 
 continue dead so long as to begin to putrefy or become noisome; and 
 therefore it must return to life on or before the third day after its 
 death. Christ was God's <I>Holy One,</I> sanctified and set apart to 
 his service in the work of redemption; he must die, for he must be 
 <I>consecrated by his own blood;</I> but he must <I>not see 
 corruption,</I> for his death was to be unto God <I>of a sweet smelling 
 savour.</I> This was typified by the law concerning the sacrifice, 
 <I>that no part of the flesh of the sacrifice which was to be eaten 
 should be kept till the third day,</I> for fear it should see 
 corruption and begin to putrefy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:15-18">Lev. vii. 15-18</A>.

 (3.) That his death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to
 all his, an inlet to a blessed immortality: "<I>Thou has made known to 
 me the ways of life,</I> and by me made them known to the world, and 
 laid them open." When <I>the Father gave to the Son to have life in 
 himself, a power to lay down his life and to take it again,</I> then he 
 showed him <I>the way of life,</I> both to and fro; <I>the gates of 
 death were open to him and the doors of the shadow of death</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:17">Job xxxviii. 17</A>),

 to pass and repass through them, as his occasion led him, for man's 
 redemption.

 (4.) That all his sorrows and sufferings should end in perfect and 
 perpetual felicity: <I>Thou shalt make me full of joy with thy 
 countenance.</I> The reward set before him was <I>joy,</I> a <I>fulness 
 of joy,</I> and that in God's <I>countenance,</I> in the countenance he 
 gave to his undertaking, and to all those, for his sake, that should 
 believe in him. The smiles with which the Father received him, when, at 
 his ascension, he was <I>brought to the Ancient of days,</I> filled him 
 <I>with joy unspeakable,</I> and that is <I>the joy of our Lord,</I> 
 into which all his shall enter, and in which they shall be for ever 
 happy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The comment upon this text, especially so much of it 
 as relates to the resurrection of Christ. He addresses himself to them 
 with a title of respect, <I>Men and brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 "You are men, and therefore should be ruled by reason; you are 
 brethren, and therefore should take kindly what is said to you by one 
 who, being nearly related to you, is heartily concerned for you, and 
 wishes you well. Now, give me leave <I>freely to speak to you 
 concerning the patriarch David,</I> and let it be no offence to you if 
 I tell you that David cannot be understood here as speaking of himself, 
 but of the Christ to come." David is here called a patriarch, because 
 he was the father of the royal family, and a man of great note and 
 eminency in his generation, and whose name and memory were justly very 
 precious. Now when we read that psalm of his, we must consider, 

 1. That he could not say <I>that of himself,</I> for <I>he died, and
 was buried, and his sepulchre remained in Jerusalem till now,</I> when 
 Peter spoke this, and his bones and ashes in it. Nobody ever pretended 
 that he had risen, and therefore he could never say of himself that he 
 <I>should not see corruption;</I> for it was plain he did see 
 corruption. St. Paul urges this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:35-37"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 35-37</A>.

 Though he <I>was a man after God's own heart, yet he went the way of
 all the earth,</I> as he saith himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:2">1 Kings ii. 2</A>),

 both in death and burial. 

 2. Therefore certainly he spoke <I>it as a prophet,</I> with an eye to 
 the Messiah, whose sufferings the prophets testified beforehand, and 
 with them <I>the glory that should follow;</I> so did David in that 
 psalm, as Peter here plainly shows.

 (1.) David knew that the Messiah should descend from his loins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),
 
 <I>that God had sworn to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according 
 to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne.</I> He 
 promised him a Son, <I>the throne of whose kingdom should be 
 established for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:12">2 Sam. vii. 12</A>.
 
 And it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:11">Ps. cxxxii. 11</A>),
 
 <I>God swore it in truth unto David.</I> When our Lord Jesus was born,
 it was promised <I>that the Lord God would give him the throne of his
 father David,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32">Luke i. 32</A>.

 And all Israel knew that the Messiah was to be the Son of David, that
 is, that, <I>according to the flesh,</I> he should be so by his human 
 nature; for otherwise, <I>according to the spirit,</I> and by his 
 divine nature, he was <I>to be David's Lord,</I> not his son. God 
 having sworn to David that the Messiah, promised to his fathers, should 
 be his son and successor, the fruit of his loins, and heir to his 
 throne, he kept this in view, in penning his psalms. 

 (2.) Christ being <I>the fruit of his loins,</I> and consequently in 
 his loins when he penned that psalm (as Levi is said to be in Abraham's 
 loins when he paid <I>tithes to Melchizedek</I>), if what he says, as 
 in his own person, be not applicable to himself (as it is plain that it 
 is not), we must conclude it points to that son of his that was then in 
 his loins, in whom his family and kingdom were to have their perfection 
 and perpetuity; and therefore, when he says that <I>his soul should not 
 be left in its separate state, nor his flesh see corruption,</I> 
 without doubt he must be understood to speak of the resurrection of 
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 And as <I>Christ died,</I> so <I>he rose again, according to the 
 scriptures;</I> and <I>that he did so we are witnesses.</I>

 (3.) Here is a glance at his ascension too. As David did not rise from 
 the dead, so neither did he <I>ascend into the heavens,</I> bodily, as 
 Christ did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 And further, to prove that when he spoke of the resurrection he meant 
 it of Christ, he observes that when in another psalm he speaks of the 
 next step of his exaltation he plainly shows that he spoke of another 
 person, and such another as was his Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>):

 "<I>The Lord said unto my Lord,</I> when he had raised him from the 
 dead, <I>Sit thou at my right hand,</I> in the highest dignity and 
 dominion there; be thou entrusted with the administration of the 
 kingdom both of providence and grace; <I>sit there</I> as king, 
 <I>until I make thy foes</I> either thy friends or <I>thy 
 footstool,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Christ rose from the grave to rise higher, and therefore it must be of
 his resurrection that David spoke, and not his own, in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:1-11">
 16th Psalm</A>;

 for there was no occasion for him to rise out of his grave who was not 
 to ascend to heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The application of this discourse concerning the death, 
 resurrection, and ascension of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] This explains the meaning of the present wonderful effusion of the 
 Spirit in those extraordinary gifts. Some of the people had asked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>What meaneth this?</I> I will tell you the meaning of it, says 
 Peter. <I>This Jesus being exalted to the right hand of God,</I> so 
 some read it, to sit there; <I>exalted by the right hand of God,</I> so 
 we read it, by his power and authority--it comes all to one; and
 <I>having received of the Father,</I> to whom he has ascended, <I>the 
 promise of the Holy Ghost,</I> he hath given what he received 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:18">Ps. lxviii. 18</A>),

 and <I>hath shed forth this which you now see and hear;</I> for the 
 Holy Ghost was to be given when Jesus was glorified, and not before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:39">John vii. 39</A>.

 You see and hear us speak with tongues that we never learned; probably 
 there was an observable change in the air of their countenances, which 
 they saw, as well as heard the change of their voice and language; now 
 this is from the Holy Ghost, whose coming is an evidence that Jesus is 
 exalted, and he has <I>received this gift from the Father,</I> to 
 confer it upon the church, which plainly bespeaks him to be the 
 Mediator, or middle person between God and the church. <I>The gift of
 the Holy Ghost</I> was, <I>First,</I> A performance of divine promises 
 already made; here it is called <I>the promise of the Holy Ghost;</I> 
 many <I>exceedingly great and precious promises</I> the divine power 
 has given us, but this is <I>the promise,</I> by way of eminency, as 
 that of the Messiah had been, and this is the promise that includes all 
 the rest; hence God's giving <I>the Holy Spirit to those that ask 
 him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:13">Luke xi. 13</A>)

 is his giving them all <I>good things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:11">Matt. vii. 11</A>.

 Christ received <I>the promise of the Holy Ghost,</I> that is, the 
 promised gift of the Holy Ghost, and has given it to us; for all <I>the 
 promises are yea and amen in him. Secondly,</I> It was a pledge of all 
 divine favours further intended; what you now see and hear is but an 
 earnest of greater things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] This proves what you are all bound to believe, that Christ Jesus 
 is the true Messiah and Saviour of the world; this he closes his sermon 
 with, as <I>the conclusion of the whole matter,</I> the <I>quod erat 
 demonstrandum--the truth to be demonstrated</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly</I> that this 
 truth has now received its full confirmation, and we our full 
 commission to publish it, <I>That God has made that same Jesus whom you 
 have crucified both Lord and Christ.</I> They were charged to <I>tell 
 no man that he was Jesus the Christ</I> till after his resurrection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:20,17:9">Matt. xvi. 20; xvii. 9</A>);

 but now it must be <I>proclaimed on the housetops, to all the house of 
 Israel; he that hath ears to hear, let him hear it.</I> It is not 
 proposed as probable, but deposed as certain: <I>Let them know it 
 assuredly,</I> and know that it is their duty to receive it as <I>a 
 faithful saying, First,</I> That God has glorified him <I>whom they 
 have crucified.</I> This aggravates their wickedness, that they 
 crucified one whom God designed to glorify, and put him to death as a 
 deceiver who had given such pregnant proofs of his divine mission; and 
 it magnifies the wisdom and power of God that though they crucified 
 him, and thought thereby to have put him under an indelible mark of 
 infamy, yet God had glorified him, and the indignities they had done 
 him served as a foil to his lustre. <I>Secondly,</I> That he has 
 glorified him to such a degree as to make him <I>both Lord and 
 Christ:</I> these signify the same; he is <I>Lord of all,</I> and he is 
 not a usurper, but is <I>Christ, anointed</I> to be so. He is <I>one 
 Lord to the Gentiles,</I> who had had lords many; and <I>to the Jews he 
 is Messiah,</I> which includes all his offices. He is <I>the king 
 Messiah,</I> as the Chaldee paraphrast calls him; or, as the angel to 
 Daniel, <I>Messiah the prince,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25">Dan. ix. 25</A>.

 This is the great truth of the gospel which we are to believe, <I>that
 that same Jesus,</I> the very same <I>that was crucified at 
 Jerusalem,</I> is he to whom we owe allegiance, and from whom we are to 
 expect protection, as <I>Lord and Christ.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>37 Now when they heard <I>this,</I> they were pricked in their
 heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men
 <I>and</I> brethren, what shall we do?
 &nbsp; 38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one
 of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and
 ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
 &nbsp; 39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to
 all that are afar off, <I>even</I> as many as the Lord our God shall
 call.
 &nbsp; 40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying,
 Save yourselves from this untoward generation.
 &nbsp; 41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and
 the same day there were added <I>unto them</I> about three thousand
 souls.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have seen the wonderful effect of the pouring out of the Spirit, in 
 its influence upon the preachers of the gospel. Peter, in all his life, 
 never spoke at the rate that he had done now, with such fulness, 
 perspicuity, and power. We are now to see another blessed fruit of the
 pouring out of the Spirit in its influence upon the hearers of the
 gospel. From the first delivery of that divine message, it appeared
 that there was a divine power going along with it, and <I>it was
 mighty, through God,</I> to do wonders: thousands were immediately
 brought by it to the <I>obedience of faith;</I> it was <I>the rod of
 God's strength sent out of Zion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:2,3">Ps. cx. 2, 3</A>.

 We have here the first-fruits of that vast harvest of souls which by it 
 were gathered in to Jesus Christ. Come and see, in these verses, the 
 exalted Redeemer riding forth, in these chariots of salvation, 
 <I>conquering and to conquer,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2">Rev. vi. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we find the word of God the means of beginning and 
 carrying on a good work of grace in the hearts of many, <I>the Spirit 
 of the Lord working by it.</I> Let us see the method of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They were startled, and convinced, and put upon a serious enquiry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 <I>When they heard,</I> or <I>having heard,</I> having patiently heard 
 Peter out, and not given him the interruption they had been used to 
 give to Christ in his discourses (this was one good point gained, that 
 they were become attentive to the word), <I>they were pricked to the 
 heart,</I> or <I>in the heart,</I> and, under a deep concern and 
 perplexity, applied themselves to the preachers with this question, 
 <I>What shall we do?</I> It was very strange that such impressions 
 should be made upon such hard hearts all of a sudden. They were Jews, 
 bred up in the opinion of the sufficiency of their religion to save 
 them, had lately seen this Jesus crucified in weakness and disgrace, 
 and were told by their rulers that he was a deceiver. Peter had charged 
 them with having a hand, a <I>wicked hand,</I> in his death, which was 
 likely to have exasperated them against him; yet, when they heard this 
 plain scriptural sermon, they were much affected with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It put them in pain: <I>They were pricked in their hearts.</I> We 
 read of those that were <I>cut to the heart</I> with indignation at the 
 preacher 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:54"><I>ch.</I> vii. 54</A>),

 but these were <I>pricked to the heart</I> with indignation at
 themselves for having been accessory to the death of Christ. Peter, 
 charging it upon them, awakened their consciences, touched them to the 
 quick, and the reflection they now made upon it was as <I>a sword in 
 their bones,</I> it pierced them as they had pierced Christ. Note, 
 Sinners, when their eyes are opened, cannot but be <I>pricked to the 
 heart</I> for sin, cannot but experience an inward uneasiness; this is 
 having the <I>heart rent</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:13">Joel ii. 13</A>),

 <I>a broken and contrite heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:17">Ps. li. 17</A>.

 Those that are truly sorry for their sins, and ashamed of them, and 
 afraid of the consequences of them, are <I>pricked to the heart.</I> A 
 prick in the heart is mortal, and under those commotions (says Paul) I 
 died, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:9">Rom. vii. 9</A>.

 "All my good opinion of myself and confidence in myself failed me."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It put them upon enquiry. <I>Our of the abundance of the heart,</I> 
 thus pricked, <I>the mouth spoke.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To whom they thus addressed themselves: <I>To Peter and to the
 rest of the apostles,</I> some to one and some to another; to them they 
 opened their case; by them they had been convinced, and therefore by 
 them they expect to be counselled and comforted. They do not appeal 
 from them to the scribes and Pharisees, to justify them against the 
 apostles' charge, but apply to them, as owning the charge, and 
 referring the case to them. They call them <I>men</I> and 
 <I>brethren,</I> as Peter had called them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 it is a style of friendship and love, rather than a title of honour: 
 "You are men, look upon us with humanity; you are brethren, look upon 
 us with brotherly love." Note, Ministers are spiritual physicians; they 
 should be advised with by those whose consciences are wounded; and it 
 is good for people to be free and familiar with those ministers, as men 
 and their brethren, who deal for their souls as for their own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What the address is: <I>What shall we do?</I> 

 [1.] They speak as men at a stand, that did not know what to do; in a 
 perfect surprise: "<I>Is that Jesus</I> whom we have crucified both 
 <I>Lord and Christ?</I> Then what will become of us who crucified him? 
 We are all undone!" Note, No way of being happy but by seeing ourselves 
 miserable. When we find ourselves in danger of being lost for ever,
 there is hope of our being made for ever, and not till then. 

 [2.] They speak as men at a point, that were resolved to do any thing 
 they should be directed to immediately; they are not for taking time to 
 consider, nor for adjourning the prosecution of their convictions to a 
 more convenient season, but desire now to be told what they must do to 
 escape the misery they were liable to. Note, Those that are convinced 
 of sin would gladly know the way to peace and pardon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:6,16:30"><I>ch.</I> ix. 6; xvi. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Peter and the other apostles direct them in short what they must 
 do, and what in so doing they might expect, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:38,39"><I>v.</I> 38, 39</A>.

 Sinners convinced must be encouraged; and that which is broken must be 
 bound up

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:16">Ezek. xxxiv. 16</A>);

 they must be told that though their case is sad it is not desperate, 
 there is hope for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He here shows them the course they must take. 

 (1.) <I>Repent;</I> this is a plank after shipwreck. "Let the sense of 
 this horrid guilt which you have brought upon yourselves by putting 
 Christ to death awaken you to a penitent reflection upon all your other 
 sins (as the demand of some one great debt brings to light all the 
 debts of a poor bankrupt) and to bitter remorse and sorrow for them" 
 This was the same duty that John the Baptist and Christ had preached, 
 and now that the Spirit is poured out is it still insisted on: 
 "<I>Repent, repent;</I> change your mind, change your way; admit an 
 after-thought." 

 (2.) <I>Be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ;</I> 
 that is, "firmly believe the doctrine of Christ, and submit to his 
 grace and government; and make an open solemn profession of this, and 
 come under an engagement to abide by it, by submitting to the ordinance 
 of baptism; be proselyted to Christ and to his holy religion, and 
 renounce your infidelity." They must be baptized <I>in the name of 
 Jesus Christ.</I> They did believe in the Father and the Holy Ghost 
 speaking by the prophets; but they must also believe in the name of 
 Jesus, that he is the Christ, the Messias promised to the fathers. 
 "Take Jesus for your king, and by baptism swear allegiance to him; take 
 him for your prophet, and hear him; take him for your priest, to make 
 atonement for you," which seems peculiarly intended here; for they must 
 be baptized <I>in his name</I> for the <I>remission of sins</I> upon 
 the score of his righteousness. 

 (3.) This is pressed upon each particular person: <I>Every one of 
 you.</I> "Even those of you that have been the greatest sinners, if 
 they repent and believe, are welcome to be baptized; and those who 
 think they have been the greatest saints have yet need to repent, and 
 believe, and be baptized. There is grace enough in Christ for every one 
 of you, be you ever so many, and grace suited to the case of every one. 
 Israel of old were baptized unto Moses in the camp, the whole body of 
 the Israelites together, when they passed <I>through the cloud</I> and 
 <I>the sea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:1,2">1 Cor. x. 1, 2</A>),

 for the covenant of peculiarity was national; but now <I>every one of 
 you</I> distinctly must be <I>baptized in the name of the Lord 
 Jesus,</I> and transact for himself in this great affair." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:28">Col. i. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives them encouragement to take this course:--

 (1.) "It shall be for <I>the remission of sins.</I> Repent of your sin, 
 and it shall not be your ruin; be baptized into the faith of Christ, 
 and in truth you shall be justified, which you could never be by the 
 law of Moses. Aim at this, and depend upon Christ for it, and this you 
 shall have. As the cup in the Lord's supper is the New Testament in the 
 blood of Christ for the remission of sins, so baptism is in the name of 
 Christ for the remission of sins. Be washed, and you shall be washed." 
 
 (2.) "You shall <I>receive the gift of the Holy Ghost</I> as well as 
 we; for it is designed for a general blessing: some of you shall 
 receive these external gifts, and each of you, if you be sincere in 
 your faith and repentance, shall receive his internal graces and 
 comforts, shall be <I>sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise.</I>" 
 Note, All that receive the remission of sins <I>receive the gift of the 
 Holy Ghost.</I> All that are justified are sanctified. 

 (3.) "Your children shall still have, as they have had, an interest in 
 the covenant, and a title to the external seal of it. Come over to 
 Christ, to receive those inestimable benefits; for the promise of the 
 remission of sins, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, is <I>to you and to 
 your children,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.
 
 It was very express
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:3">Isa. xliv. 3</A>):

 <I>I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed.</I> And 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:21">Isa. lix. 21</A>),

 <I>My Spirit and my word shall not depart from thy seed, and thy seed's 
 seed.</I> When God took Abraham into covenant, he said, <I>I will be a 
 God to thee, and to thy seed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:7">Gen. xvii. 7</A>);

 and, accordingly, every Israelite had his son circumcised at eight days 
 old. Now it is proper for an Israelite, when he is by baptism to come
 into a new dispensation of this covenant, to ask, "What must be done 
 with my children? Must they be thrown out, or taken in with me?" "Taken 
 in" (says Peter) "by all means; for the promise, that great promise of 
 God's being to you a God, is as much to you and to your children now as 
 ever it was." 

 (4.) "Though the promise is still extended to your children as it has 
 been, yet it is not, as it has been, confined to you and them, but the 
 benefit of it is <I>designed</I> for <I>all that are afar off;</I>" we 
 may add, <I>and their children,</I> for the blessing of Abraham comes 
 upon the Gentiles, through Jesus Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:14">Gal. iii. 14</A>.

 The promise had long pertained to the Israelites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Rom. ix. 4</A>);

 but now it is sent to <I>those that are afar off,</I> the remotest 
 nations of the Gentiles, and <I>every one</I> of them too, <I>all that 
 are afar off.</I> To this general the following limitation must refer, 
 <I>even as many of them,</I> as many particular persons in each nation, 
 <I>as the Lord our God shall call</I> effectually into the fellowship 
 of Jesus Christ. Note, God can make his call to reach those that are
 ever so far off, and none come but those whom he calls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. These directions are followed with a needful caution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):
 
 <I>With many other words,</I> to the same purport, <I>did he 
 testify</I> gospel truths, and exhort to gospel duties; now that the 
 word began to work he followed it; he had said much in a little 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:38,39"><I>v.</I> 38, 39</A>),

 and that which, one would think, included all, and yet he had more to 
 say. When we have heard those words which have done our souls good, we 
 cannot but wish to hear more, to hear many more such words. Among other 
 things he said (and it should seem inculcated it), <I>Save yourselves 
 from this untoward generation. Be you free</I> from them. The
 unbelieving Jews were an untoward generation, perverse and obstinate; 
 they walked contrary to God and man 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15">1 Thess. ii. 15</A>),

 wedded to sin and marked for ruin. Now as to them, 

 1. "Give diligence to save yourselves from their ruin, that you may not 
 be involved in that, and may <I>escape all those things</I>" (as the 
 Christians did): "<I>Repent, and be baptized;</I> and then you shall 
 not be sharers in destruction with those with whom you have been 
 sharers in sin." <I>O gather not my soul with sinners.</I> 

 2. "In order to this continue not with them in their sin, persist not
 with them in infidelity. <I>Save yourselves,</I> that is, separate 
 yourselves, distinguish yourselves, from this <I>untoward generation. 
 Be not rebellious like this rebellious house;</I> partake not with them 
 in their sins, that you share not with them in their plagues." Note, To 
 separate ourselves from wicked people is the only way to save ourselves 
 from them; though we hereby expose ourselves to their rage and enmity, 
 we really save ourselves from them; for, if we consider whither they 
 are hastening, we shall see it is better to have the trouble of 
 swimming against their stream than the danger of being carried down 
 their stream. Those that repent of their sins, and give up themselves 
 to Jesus Christ, must evidence their sincerity by breaking off all 
 intimate society with wicked people. <I>Depart from me, ye evil
 doers,</I> is the language of one that determines to keep <I>the 
 commandments of his God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:115">Ps. cxix. 115</A>.

 We must <I>save ourselves</I> from them, which denotes avoiding them
 with dread and holy fear, as we would save ourselves from an enemy that 
 seeks to destroy us, or from a house infected with the plague.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is the happy success and issue of this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 The Spirit wrought with the word, and wrought wonders by it. These same 
 persons that had many of them been eye-witnesses of the death of 
 Christ, and the prodigies that attended it, and were not wrought upon 
 by them, were yet wrought upon by the preaching of the word, for it is 
 this that is the <I>power of God unto salvation.</I> 

 1. They received the word; and <I>then</I> only the word does us good,
 when we do receive it, embrace it, and bid it welcome. They admitted 
 the conviction of it, and accepted the offers of it. 

 2. They gladly received it. Herod <I>heard</I> the word gladly, but
 these gladly <I>received</I> it, were not only glad that they had it to 
 receive, but glad that by the grace of God they were enabled to receive 
 it, though it would be a humbling changing word to them, and would 
 expose them to the enmity of their countrymen. 

 3. They were baptized; believing with the heart, they made confession
 with the mouth, and enrolled themselves among the disciples of Christ 
 by that sacred rite and ceremony which he had instituted. And though 
 Peter had said, "Be baptized in the name of <I>the Lord Jesus</I>" 
 (because the doctrine of Christ was the present truth), yet we have 
 reason to think that, in baptizing them, the whole form Christ 
 prescribed was used, <I>in the name of the Father, the Son, and the 
 Holy Ghost.</I> Note, Those that receive the Christian covenant ought 
 to receive the Christian baptism.

 4. Hereby there were added to the disciples to the number of about
 <I>three thousand souls that same day.</I> All those that had received 
 the Holy Ghost had their tongues at work to preach, and their hands at 
 work to baptize; for it was time to be busy, when such a harvest was to 
 be gathered in. The conversion of these three thousand with these words 
 was a <I>greater work</I> than the feeding of four or five thousand 
 with a few loaves. Now Israel began to multiply after the death of our 
 Joseph. They are said to be <I>three thousand souls</I> (which word is 
 generally used for persons when women and children are included with 
 men, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:21">Gen. xiv. 21</A>,
 
 <I>margin, Give me the souls;</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:27">Gen. xlvi. 27</A>,

 <I>seventy souls</I>), which intimates that those that were here
 baptized were not so many men, but so many heads of families as, with 
 their children and servants baptized, might make up <I>three thousand 
 souls.</I> These were <I>added to them.</I> Note, Those who are joined 
 to Christ are added to the disciples of Christ, and join with them. 
 When we take God for our God, we must take his people to be our 
 people.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and
 fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.
 &nbsp; 43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs
 were done by the apostles.
 &nbsp; 44 And all that believed were together, and had all things
 common;
 &nbsp; 45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all
 <I>men,</I> as every man had need.
 &nbsp; 46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple,
 and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with
 gladness and singleness of heart,
 &nbsp; 47 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the
 Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We often speak of the primitive church, and appeal to it, and to the 
 history of it; in these verses we have the history of the <I>truly 
 primitive church,</I> of the <I>first days</I> of it, its state of 
 infancy indeed, but, like that, the state of its greatest 
 <I>innocence.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They kept close to holy ordinances, and abounded in all instances of 
 piety and devotion, for Christianity, admitted in the power of it, will 
 dispose the soul to communion with God in all those ways wherein he has 
 appointed us to meet him and promised to meet us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were diligent and constant inn their attendance upon the 
 <I>preaching of the word.</I> They <I>continued in the apostles' 
 doctrine,</I> and never disowned nor deserted it; or, as it may be 
 read, <I>they continued constant to the apostles' teaching</I> or 
 <I>instruction;</I> by <I>baptism</I> they were discipled to be taught, 
 and they were willing to be taught. Note, Those who have given up their 
 names to Christ must make conscience of hearing his word; for thereby 
 we give honour to him, and build up ourselves in our most holy 
 faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They kept up the <I>communion of saints.</I> They continued <I>in 
 fellowship</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>),

 and <I>continued daily with one accord in the temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.

 They not only had a mutual affection to each other, but a great deal of 
 mutual conversation with each other; they were much together. When they 
 withdrew from <I>the untoward</I> generation, they did not turn 
 hermits, but were very intimate with one another, and took all 
 occasions to meet; wherever you saw one disciple, you would see more, 
 like <I>birds of a feather.</I> See how these Christians love one 
 another. They were concerned for one another, sympathized with one 
 another, and heartily espoused one another's interests. They had 
 fellowship with one another in religious worship. They met <I>in the 
 temple:</I> there was their rendezvous; for joint-fellowship with God 
 is the best fellowship we can have with one another,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3">1 John i. 3</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) They were daily in the temple, not only on the days of the
 sabbaths and solemn feasts, but on other days, every day. Worshipping
 God is to be our daily work, and, where there is opportunity, the 
 oftener it is done publicly the better. God loves the gates of Zion, 
 and so must we. 

 (2.) They were <I>with one accord;</I> not only no discord nor strife, 
 but a great deal of holy love among them; and they heartily joined in 
 their public services. Though they met with the Jews in the courts of 
 the temple, yet the Christians kept together by themselves, and were 
 unanimous in their separate devotions.</P>

 3. They frequently joined in the ordinance of the Lord's supper. They 
 continued <I>in the breaking of bread,</I> in celebrating that memorial 
 of their Master's death, as those that were not ashamed to own their 
 relation to, and their dependence upon, Christ and him crucified. They 
 could not forget the death of Christ, yet they kept up this memorial of 
 it, and made it their constant practice, because it was an institution 
 of Christ, to be transmitted to the succeeding ages of the church. They 
 broke bread <I>from house to house;</I> <B><I>kat 
 oikon</I></B>--<I>house by house;</I> they did not think fit to
 celebrate the eucharist in the temple, for that was peculiar to the 
 Christian institutes, and therefore they administered that ordinance in 
 private houses, choosing such houses of the converted Christians as 
 were convenient, to which the neighbours resorted; and they went from 
 one to another of these little synagogues or domestic chapels, houses 
 that had churches in them, and there celebrated the eucharist with 
 those that usually met there to worship God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They continued <I>in prayers. After</I> the Spirit was poured out, 
 as well as before, while they were waiting for him, they continued 
 instant in prayer; for prayer will never be superseded till it comes to 
 be swallowed up in everlasting praise. <I>Breaking of bread</I> comes
 in between the <I>work</I> and <I>prayer,</I> for it has reference to 
 both, and is a help to both. The Lord's supper is a sermon to the eye, 
 and a confirmation of God's word to us; and it is an encouragement to 
 our prayers, and a solemn expression of the ascent of our souls to 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They abounded in thanksgiving; were continually <I>praising God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 This should have a part in every prayer, and not be crowded into a 
 corner. Those that have received the gift of the Holy Ghost will be 
 much in praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They were loving one to another, and very kind; their charity was 
 as eminent as their piety, and their joining together in holy 
 ordinances knit their hearts to each other, and very much endeared them 
 to one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They had frequent meetings for Christian converse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):

 <I>All that believed were together;</I> not all those thousands in one 
 place (this was impracticable); but, as Dr. Lightfoot explains it, they 
 kept together in several companies or congregations, according as their 
 languages, nations, or other associations, brought them and kept them 
 together. And thus joining together, because it was apart from those 
 that believed not, and because it was in the same profession and 
 practice of the duties of religion, they are said to be together, 
 <B><I>epi to auto</I></B>. They associated together, and so both 
 expressed and increased their mutual love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They had <I>all things common;</I> perhaps they had common tables 
 (as the Spartans of old), for familiarity, temperance and freedom of 
 conversation; they <I>ate together,</I> that those who had much might 
 have the less, and so be kept from the temptations of abundance; and 
 they who had little might have the more, and so be kept from the 
 temptations of want and poverty. Or, There was such a concern for one 
 another, and such a readiness to help one another as there was 
 occasion, that it might be said, They had <I>all things common,</I> 
 according to the law of friendship; one wanted not what another had; 
 for he might have it for the asking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They were very cheerful, and very generous in the use of what they 
 had. Besides the religion that was in their sacred feasts (their 
 <I>breaking bread from house to house</I>) a great deal of it appeared 
 in their common meals; they did <I>eat their meat with gladness and 
 singleness of heart.</I> They brought the comforts of <I>God's 
 table</I> along with them to <I>their own,</I> which had two good 
 effects upon them:--

 (1.) It made them very pleasant, and enlarged their hearts with holy 
 joy; they did eat their bread with joy, and <I>drank their wine with a 
 merry heart,</I> as knowing that <I>God now accepted their works.</I> 
 None have such cause to be cheerful as good Christians have; it is a 
 pity but that they should always have hearts to be so.

 (2.) It made them very liberal to their poor brethren, and enlarged 
 their hearts in charity. They did <I>eat their meat with singleness of 
 heart,</I> <B><I>en apheloteti kardias</I></B>--<I>with liberality of
 heart;</I> so some: they did not eat their morsels alone, but bade the 
 poor welcome to their table, not grudgingly, but with all the hearty 
 freedom imaginable. Note, It becomes Christians to be open-hearted and 
 open-handed, and in every good work to sow plentifully, as those on 
 whom God hath sown plentifully, and who hope to reap so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They raised a fund for charity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>):

 They <I>sold their possessions and goods;</I> some sold their lands and 
 houses, others their stocks and the furniture of their houses, and 
 <I>parted</I> the money to their brethren, <I>as every man had 
 need.</I> This was to destroy, not property (as Mr. Baxter says), but 
 selfishness. Herein, probably, they had an eye to the command which 
 Christ gave to the rich man, as a test of his sincerity, <I>Sell that 
 thou hast, and give to the poor.</I> Not that this was intended for an 
 example to be a constant binding rule, as if all Christians in all 
 places and ages were bound to sell their estates, and give away the 
 money in charity. For St. Paul's epistles, after this, often speak of 
 the distinction of rich and poor, and Christ hath said that <I>the poor 
 we always have with us,</I> and shall have, and the rich must be always 
 doing them good out of the rents, issues, and profits, of their 
 estates, which they disable themselves to do, if they sell them, and 
 give all away at once. But here the case was extraordinary 

 (1.) They were under no obligation of a divine command to do this, as 
 appears by what Peter said to Ananias

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:4"><I>ch.</I> v. 4</A>):

 <I>Was it not in thine own power?</I> But it was a very commendable
 instance of their raisedness above the world, their contempt of it, 
 their assurance of another world, their love to their brethren, their 
 compassion to the poor, and their great zeal for the encouraging of 
 Christianity, and the nursing of it in its infancy. The apostles left 
 all to follow Christ, and were to give themselves wholly to the word 
 and prayer, and something must be done for their maintenance; so that 
 this extraordinary liberality was like that of Israel in the wilderness 
 towards the building of the tabernacle, which needed to be restrained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+36:5,6">Exod. xxxvi. 5, 6</A>.

 Our rule is, to give according as God has blessed us; yet, in such an
 extraordinary case as this, those are to be praised who give <I>beyond 
 their power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:3">2 Cor. viii. 3</A>.

 (2.) They were Jews that did this, and those who believed Christ must
 believe that the Jewish nation would shortly be destroyed, and an end 
 put to the possession of estates and goods in it, and, in the belief of 
 this, they sold them for the present service of Christ and his 
 church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God owned them, and gave them signal tokens of his presence with 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>Many wonders and signs were done by the apostles</I> of divers 
 sorts, which confirmed their doctrine, and incontestably proved that it 
 was from God. Those that could work miracles could have maintained 
 themselves and the poor that were among them miraculously, as Christ 
 fed thousands with a little food; but it was as much for the glory of 
 God that it should be done by a miracle of grace (inclining people to 
 sell their estates, to do it) as if it had been done by a miracle in 
 nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But the Lord's giving them power to work miracles was not all he did 
 for them; he <I>added to the church daily.</I> The word in their mouths 
 <I>did wonders,</I> and God blessed their endeavours for the increase 
 of the number of believers. Note, It is God's work to add souls to the 
 church; and it is a great comfort both to ministers and Christians to 
 see it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The people were influenced by it; those that were without, the 
 standers by, that were spectators. 

 1. They <I>feared them,</I> and had a veneration for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>Fear came upon every soul,</I> that is, upon very many who saw the 
 <I>wonders</I> and <I>signs</I> done by the apostles, and were afraid 
 lest their not being respected as they should be would bring desolation 
 upon their nation. The common people stood in awe of them, as Herod 
 feared John. Though they had nothing of external pomp to command 
 external respect, as the <I>scribes' long robes</I> gained them the 
 <I>greetings in the market-places,</I> yet they had abundance of 
 spiritual gifts that were truly honourable, which possessed men with an 
 inward reverence for them. Fear came upon <I>every soul;</I> the 
 <I>souls</I> of people were strangely influenced by their awful 
 preaching and living. 

 2. They <I>favoured them.</I> Though we have reason to think there were
 those that despised them and hated them (we are sure the Pharisees and 
 chief priests did), yet far the greater part of the common people had a 
 kindness for them--they <I>had favour with all the people.</I> Christ
 was so violently run upon and run down by a <I>packed mob,</I> which 
 cried, <I>Crucify him, crucify him,</I> that one would think his 
 doctrine and followers were never likely to have an interest in the 
 common people any more. And yet here we find them <I>in favour with 
 them all,</I> by which it appears that their prosecuting Christ was a 
 sort of force put upon them by the artifices of the priests; now they 
 returned to their wits, to their right mind. Note, Undissembled piety 
 and charity will command respect; and cheerfulness in serving God will 
 recommend religion to those that are without. Some read it, <I>They had 
 charity to all the people</I>--<B><I>charin echontes pros holon ton
 laon</I></B>; they did not confine their charity to those of their own 
 community, but it was <I>catholic</I> and <I>extensive;</I> and this 
 recommended them very much.

 3. They <I>fell over</I> to them. Some or other were daily coming in,
 though not so many as the first day; and they were such as <I>should be 
 saved.</I> Note, Those that God has designed for eternal salvation 
 shall one time or other be effectually brought to Christ: and those 
 that are brought to Christ are <I>added to the church</I> in a holy 
 covenant by baptism, and in holy communion by other ordinances.</P>
