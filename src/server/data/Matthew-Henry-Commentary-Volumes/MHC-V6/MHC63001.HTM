 The apostle here salutes an honourable matron and her children, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 Recommends to them faith and love,

 Warns them of deceivers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:7">ver. 7</A>),

 and to take heed to themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:8">ver. 8</A>.
 
 Teaches how to treat those who bring not the doctrine of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 And, referring other things to personal discourse, concludes the
 epistle,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love
 in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known
 the truth;
 &nbsp; 2  For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with
 us for ever.
 &nbsp; 3  Grace be with you, mercy, <I>and</I> peace, from God the Father,
 and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth
 and love.
 &nbsp; 4  I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in
 truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Ancient epistles began, as here, with salutation and good wishes: 
 religion consecrates, as far as may be, old forms, and turns 
 compliments into real expressions of life and love. Here we have, as 
 usually,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The saluter, not expressed by name, but by a chosen character: 
 <I>The elder.</I> The expression, and style, and love, intimate that 
 the penman was the same with that of the foregoing epistle; he is now 
 <I>the elder,</I> emphatically and eminently so; possibly the oldest 
 apostle now living, the chief elder in the church of God. An elder in 
 the ancient house of Israel was reverend, or to be reverenced, much
 more he who is so in the gospel Israel of God. An old disciple is
 honourable; an old apostle and leader of disciples is more so. He was
 now old in holy service and experience, had seen and tasted much of 
 heaven, and was much nearer than when at first he believed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The saluted--a noble Christian matron, and her children: <I>To the
 elect lady and her children.</I> A lady, a person of eminent quality 
 for birth, education, and estate. It is well that the gospel has got
 among such. It is a pity but lords and ladies should be acquainted with 
 the Lord Christ and his religion. They owe more to him than others do; 
 though usually <I>not many noble are called.</I> Here is a pattern for 
 persons of quality of the same sex. <I>The elect lady;</I> not only a 
 choice one, but one chosen of God. It is lovely and beautiful to see 
 ladies, by holy walking, demonstrate their election of God. <I>And her 
 children;</I> probably the lady was a widow; she <I>and her 
 children</I> then are the principal part of the family, and so this may 
 be styled an economical epistle. Families may well be written to and 
 encouraged, and further directed in their domestic love, and order, and 
 duties. We see that children may well be taken notice of in Christian 
 letters, and they should know it too; it may avail to their 
 encouragement and caution. Those who love and commend them will be apt 
 to enquire after them. This <I>lady and her children</I> are further 
 notified by the respect paid them, and that, 

 1. By the apostle himself: <I>Whom I love in the truth,</I> or in
 truth, whom I sincerely and heartily love. He who was the beloved 
 disciple had learnt the art or exercise of love; and he especially 
 loved those who loved him, that Lord who loved him. 

 2. By all her Christian acquaintance, all the religious who knew her: 
 <I>And not I only, but also all those that have known the truth.</I>
 Virtue and goodness in an elevated sphere shine brightly. Truth demands
 acknowledgment, and those who see the evidences of pure religion should 
 confess and attest them; it is a good sign and great duty to love and 
 value religion in others. The ground of this love and respect thus paid 
 to this lady and her children was their regard to the truth: <I>For the 
 truth's sake</I> (or true religion's sake) <I>which dwelleth in us, and 
 shall be with us for ever.</I> Christian love is founded upon the 
 appearance of vital religion. Likeness should beget affection. Those
 who love truth and piety in themselves should love it in others too, or 
 love others upon the account of it. The apostle and the other 
 Christians loved this lady, not so much for her honour as her holiness; 
 not so much for her bounty as her serious Christianity. We should not 
 be religious merely by fits and starts, in certain moods and moons; but 
 religion should still dwell within us, in our minds and hearts, in our 
 faith and love. It is to be hoped that where religion once truly dwells 
 it will abide for ever. The Spirit of Christianity, we may suppose, 
 will not be totally extinguished: <I>Which shall be with us for 
 ever.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The salutation, which is indeed an apostolical benediction: 
 <I>Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and from 
 the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Sacred love pours out blessings upon this honourable Christian family; 
 to those who have shall more be given. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. From whom these blessings are craved, 

 (1.) <I>From God the Father,</I> the God of all grace. He is the 
 fountain of blessedness, and of all the blessings that must bring us 
 thither. 

 (2.) <I>From the Lord Jesus Christ.</I> He is also author and 
 communicator of these heavenly blessings, and he is distinguished by 
 this emphatic character--<I>the Son of the Father;</I> such a Son as 
 none else can be; such a Son as is <I>the brightness of the Father's 
 glory, and the express image of his person,</I> who, with the Father, 
 is also <I>eternal life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:2">1 John i. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the apostle craves from these divine persons. 

 (1.) <I>Grace</I>--divine favour and good-will, the spring of all good 
 things: it is grace indeed that any spiritual blessing should be 
 conferred on sinful mortals. 

 (2.) <I>Mercy</I>--free pardon and forgiveness; those who are already 
 rich in grace have need of continual forgiveness. 

 (3.) <I>Peace</I>--tranquility of spirit and serenity of conscience, in 
 an assured reconciliation with God, together with all safe and 
 sanctified outward prosperity. And these are desired <I>in truth and 
 love,</I> either by sincere and ardent affection in the saluter (in 
 faith and love he prays them <I>from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus 
 Christ</I>), or as productive of continued truth and love in the 
 saluted; these blessings will continually preserve true faith and love 
 <I>in the elect lady and her children;</I> and may they do so!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The congratulation upon the prospect of the exemplary behaviour of 
 other children of this excellent lady. Happy parent, who was blessed 
 with such a numerous religious offspring! <I>I rejoiced greatly that I 
 found of thy children walking in the truth, as we have received 
 commandment from the Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Possibly the lady's sons travelled abroad, either for accomplishment 
 and acquaintance with the world, or on the account of their own 
 business or the common affairs of the family, and in their travels 
 might come to Ephesus, where the apostle is supposed to have now 
 resided, and might there happily converse with him. See how good it is 
 to be trained up to early religion! Though religion is not to be 
 founded upon education, yet education may be and often is blessed, and 
 is the way to fortify youth against irreligious infection. Hence too 
 let young travellers learn to carry their religion along with them, and 
 not either leave it at home or learn the ill customs of the countries 
 where they come. It may be observed, also, that sometimes election runs 
 in a direct line; here we have an <I>elect lady, and her elect 
 children;</I> children may be beloved for their parents' sake, but both 
 by virtue of free grace. From the apostle's joy herein we may observe 
 that it is pleasant to see children treading in good parent's steps; 
 and those who see this may well congratulate their parents thereupon, 
 and that both to excite their thankfulness to God for, and to enlarge 
 their comfort in, so great a blessing. How happy a lady was this, who 
 had brought forth so many children for heaven and for God! And how 
 great a joy must it be to her ladyship to hear so good an account of 
 them from so good a judge! And we may further see that it is joyful to
 good old ministers, and accordingly to other good old disciples, to see 
 a hopeful rising generation, who may serve God and support religion in 
 the world when they are dead and gone. We see here also the rule of 
 true walking: <I>the commandment of the Father.</I> Then is our walk 
 true, our converse right, when it is managed by the word of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
 commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning,
 that we love one another.
 &nbsp; 6  And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This
 is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye
 should walk in it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We come now more into the design and substance of the epistle; and here 
 we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The apostle's request: <I>Now, I beseech thee, lady.</I> Considering 
 what it is that he entreats, the way of address is very remarkable; it 
 is not any particular boon or bounty to himself, but common duty and 
 observance of divine command. Here he might command or charge; but 
 harsher measures are worse than needless where milder will prevail; and 
 the apostolical spirit is, of all other, the most tender and endearing. 
 Whether out of deference to her ladyship, or apostolical meekness, or 
 both, he condescends to beseech: <I>And now I beseech thee, lady.</I> 
 He may be supposed speaking as another apostle does to a certain master 
 to whom he writes: <I>Wherefore, though I might be very bold in 
 Christ</I> (and according to the power with which Christ hath entrusted 
 me) <I>to enjoin thee that which is convenient, yet, for love's sake I 
 rather beseech thee, being such a one as the aged, the elder.</I> Love 
 will avail where authority will not; and we may often see that the more 
 authority is urged the more it is slighted. The apostolical minister 
 will love and beseech his friends into their duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The thing requested of <I>the lady and her children</I>--Christian
 sacred love: <I>That we love one another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Those that are eminent in any Christian virtue have yet room to grow 
 therein. <I>But, as touching brotherly love, you need not that I write 
 unto you; for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another. But 
 we beseech you, brethren</I> (and sisters), <I>that you increase more 
 and more,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:9,10">1 Thess. iv. 9, 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This love is recommended, 

 (1.) From the obligation thereto--<I>the commandment.</I> Divine 
 command should sway our mind and heart. 

 (2.) From the antiquity of the obligation: <I>Not as though I wrote a 
 new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the 
 beginning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This commandment of mutual Christian love may be said to be a 
 <I>new</I> one in respect of its new enaction and sanction by the Lord 
 Christ; but yet, as to the matter of it (mutual holy love), it is as 
 old as natural, Jewish, or Christian religion. This commandment must 
 every where attend Christianity, that the disciples of it must love one 
 another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Then this love is illustrated from the fruitful nature of it: <I>And 
 this is love, that we walk after his commandments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This is the test of our love to God, our obedience to him. This is love 
 to ourselves, to our own souls, that we walk in obedience to divine 
 commands. <I>In keeping them there is great reward.</I> This is love to 
 one another, to engage one another to walk in holiness; and this is the 
 evidence of our sincere, mutual, Christian love--that we (in other 
 things) walk after God's commands. There may be mutual love that is not 
 religious and Christian; but we know ours to be so, by our attendance 
 to all other commands besides that of mutual love. Universal obedience 
 is the proof of the goodness and sincerity of Christian virtues; and 
 those that aim at all Christian obedience will be sure to attend to 
 Christian love. This is a fundamental duty in the gospel-charter: 
 <I>This is the commandment, that, as you have heard from the beginning, 
 you should walk in it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 that is, walk in this love. The foresight of the decay of this love, as 
 well as of other apostasy, might engage the apostle to inculcate this 
 duty, and this primordial command, the more frequently, the more 
 earnestly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess
 not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver
 and an antichrist.
 &nbsp; 8  Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we
 have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.
 &nbsp; 9  Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
 Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ,
 he hath both the Father and the Son.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this principal part of the epistle we find,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The ill news communicated to the lady-seducers are abroad: <I>For 
 many deceivers have entered into the world.</I> This report is 
 introduced by a particle that bespeaks a reason of the report. "You 
 have need to maintain your love, <I>for</I> there are destroyers of it 
 in the world. Those who subvert the faith destroy the love; the common 
 faith is one ground of the common love;" or, "You must secure your walk 
 according to the commands of God; this will secure you. Your stability 
 is likely to be tried, <I>for many deceivers have entered into the 
 world.</I>" Sad and saddening news may be communicated to our Christian 
 friends; not that we should love to make them sorry, but to fore-warn 
 is the way to fore-arm them against their trials. Now here is, 

 1. The description of the deceiver and his deceit--he <I>confesses not
 that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 he brings some error or other concerning the person of the Lord Jesus; 
 he either confesses not that Jesus Christ is the same person, or that 
 Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ, the anointed of God, the Messiah 
 promised of old for the redemption of Israel, or that the promised 
 Messiah and Redeemer has come in the flesh, or into the flesh, into our 
 world and into our nature; such a one pretends that he is yet to be 
 expected. Strange that after such evidence any should deny that the
 Lord Jesus is the Son of God and Saviour of the world! 

 2. The aggravation of the case--such a one is <I>a deceiver and an
 antichrist</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 he deludes souls and undermines the glory and kingdom of the Lord 
 Christ. He must be an impostor, a wilful deceiver, after all the light
 that has been afforded, and all the evidence that Christ has given 
 concerning himself, and the attestation God has given concerning his 
 Son; and he is a wilful opposer of the person, and honour, and interest 
 of the Lord Christ, and as such shall be reckoned with when the Lord 
 Christ comes again. Let us not think it strange that there are 
 deceivers and opposers of the Lord Christ's name and dignity now, for 
 there were such of old, even in the apostle's times.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The counsel given to this elect household hereupon. Now care and 
 caution are needful: <I>Look to yourselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The more deceivers and deceits abound, the more watchful the disciples 
 must be. Delusions may so prevail that even the elect may be
 endangered thereby. Two things they must beware of:--

 1. <I>That they lose not what they have wrought</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 what they have done or what they have gained. It is a pity that any 
 religious labour should be in vain; some begin well, but at last lose 
 all their pains. The hopeful gentleman, who had kept the commands of 
 the second table from his youth up, lost all for want of less love to 
 the world and more love to Christ. Professors should take care not to 
 lose what they have gained. Many have not only gained a fair reputation 
 for religion, but much light therein, much conviction of the evil of 
 sin, the vanity of the world, the excellency of religion, and the power 
 of God's word. They have even <I>tasted of the powers of the world to 
 come,</I> and the gifts of the Holy Spirit; and yet at last lose all.
 <I>You did run well, who hindered you, that you should not obey</I> (or 
 not go on to obey) <I>the truth?</I> Sad it is that fair and splendid 
 attainments in the school of Christ should all be lost at last. 

 2. That they lose not their reward, none of it, no portion of that 
 honour, or praise, or glory that they once stood fair for. <I>That 
 we</I> (or you, as in some copies) <I>receive a full reward.</I> 
 "Secure you as full a reward as will be given to any in the church of 
 God; if there are degrees of glory, lose none of that grace (that 
 light, or love, or peace) which is to prepare you for the higher 
 elevation in glory. <I>Hold fast that which thou hast</I> (in faith,
 and hope, and a good conscience), <I>that no man take thy crown,</I> 
 that thou neither lose it nor any jewel out of it,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:11">Rev. iii. 11</A>.

 The way to attain the full reward is to abide true to Christ, and 
 constant in religion to the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The reason of the apostle's counsel, and of their care and caution 
 about themselves, which is twofold:--

 1. The danger and evil of departure from gospel light and revelation;
 it is in effect and reality a departure from God himself: <I>Whosoever 
 transgresseth</I> (transgresseth at this dismal rate), <I>and abideth 
 not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.</I> It is the doctrine of 
 Christ that is appointed to guide us to God; it is that whereby God 
 draws souls to salvation and to himself. Those who revolt thence, in so 
 doing revolt from God. 

 2. The advantage and happiness of firm adherence to Christian truth; it 
 unites us to Christ (the object or subject-matter of that truth), and 
 thereby to the Father also; for they are one. <I>He that abideth</I> 
 (rooted and grounded) <I>in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the 
 Father and the Son.</I> By the doctrine of Christ we are enlightened in 
 the knowledge of the Father and the Son; by it we are sanctified for 
 the Father and the Son; thereupon we are enriched with holy love to the 
 Father and the Son; and thereby prepared for the endless enjoyment of 
 the Father and the Son. <I>Now you are clean through the word which I
 have spoken to you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:3">John xv. 3</A>.

 This purity makes meet for heaven. The great God, as he has set his
 seal to the doctrine of Christ, so he puts a value upon it. We must 
 retain that holy doctrine in faith and love, as we hope or desire to 
 arrive at blessed communion with the Father and the Son.</P>

 deeds.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, I. Upon due warning given concerning seducers, the apostle gives 
 direction concerning the treatment of such. They are not to be 
 entertained as the ministers of Christ. The Lord Christ will 
 distinguish them from such, and so would he have his disciples. The 
 direction is negative. 

 1. "Support them not: <I>If there come any unto you, and bring not this 
 doctrine</I> (concerning Christ as the Son of God, the Messiah and 
 anointed of God for our redemption and salvation), <I>receive him not 
 into your house.</I>" Possibly this lady was like Gaius, of whom we 
 read in the next epistle, a generous housekeeper, and hospitable 
 entertainer of travelling ministers and Christians. These deceivers 
 might possibly expect the same reception with others, or with the best 
 who came there (as the blind are often bold enough), but the apostle 
 allows it not: "Do not welcome them into your family." Doubtless such 
 may be relieved in their pressing necessities, but not encouraged for 
 ill service. Deniers of the faith are destroyers of souls; and it is 
 supposed that even ladies themselves should have good understanding in 
 the affairs of religion. 

 2. "Bless not their enterprises: <I>Neither bid him God speed.</I> 
 Attend not their service with your prayers and good wishes." Bad work 
 should not be consecrated or recommended to the divine benediction. God 
 will be no patron of falsehood, seduction, and sin. We ought to bid God 
 speed to evangelical ministration; but the propagation of fatal error, 
 if we cannot prevent, we must not dare to countenance. Then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the reason of such direction, forbidding the support and 
 patronage of the deceiver: <I>For he that biddeth him God speed is 
 partaker of his evil deeds.</I> Favour and affection partake of the 
 sin. We may be sharers in the iniquities of others. How judicious and 
 how cautious should the Christian be! There are many ways of sharing 
 the guilt of other people's transgressions; it may be done by culpable 
 silence, indolence, unconcernedness, private contribution, public 
 countenance and assistance, inward approbation, open apology and 
 defence. The Lord pardon our guilt of other persons' sins!</P>

 The apostle concludes this letter, 

 1. With an adjournment of many things to personal conference: <I>Having

 I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be 
 full.</I> Here it is supposed that some things are better spoken than 
 written. The use of pen and ink may be a mercy and a pleasure; but a 
 personal interview may be more so. The apostle was not yet too old for
 travel, nor consequently for travelling service. The communion of
 saints should be by all methods maintained; and their communion should 
 tend to their mutual joy. Excellent ministers may have their joy
 advanced by their Christian friends. <I>That I may be comforted 
 together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me,</I>

 2. With the presentation of service and salutation from some near
 relations to the lady: <I>The children of thy elect sister greet 
 thee.</I> Grace was abundant towards this family; here are two elect 
 sisters, and probably their elect children. How will they admire this 
 grace in heaven! The apostle condescends to insert the nieces' duty (as 
 we should call it), or dutiful salutation, to their aunt. The duty of 
 inferior relations is to be cherished. Doubtless the apostle was easy 
 of access, and would admit all friendly and pious communication, and 
 was ready to enhance the good lady's joy in her nieces as well as in 
 her children. May there by many such gracious ladies rejoicing in their 
 gracious descendants and other relations! <I>Amen.</I></P>
