 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter, 

 I. Paul with great solemnity and earnestness presses Timothy to the
 diligent and conscientious discharge of his work and office as an 
 evangelist; and the charge given to him all gospel ministers are to 
 take to themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. The reason of his concern in this case, Why must Timothy now be
 instant in season, &c., in a particular manner? Because the church was 
 likely to be deprived of the apostle's labours, for his departure was 
 at hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.

 III. Divers particular matters, with a hint and caution, about
 Alexander the coppersmith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:9-15">ver. 9-15</A>.

 IV. He informs him of what befel him at his first answer; though men
 forsook him, the Lord stood by him, and this encouraged him to hope for
 future deliverance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>)

 And then he concludes with salutations and a benediction,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:19-22">ver. 19, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I charge <I>thee</I> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus
 Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing
 and his kingdom;
 &nbsp; 2  Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;
 reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
 &nbsp; 3  For the time will come when they will not endure sound
 doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves
 teachers, having itching ears;
 &nbsp; 4  And they shall turn away <I>their</I> ears from the truth, and
 shall be turned unto fables.
 &nbsp; 5  But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work
 of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
 &nbsp; 6  For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my
 departure is at hand.
 &nbsp; 7  I have fought a good fight, I have finished <I>my</I> course, I
 have kept the faith:
 &nbsp; 8  Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
 which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day:
 and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his
 appearing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 I. How awfully this charge is introduced 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge 
 the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom.</I> Observe, 
 The best of men have need to be awed into the discharge of their duty. 
 The work of a minister is not an indifferent thing, but absolutely 
 necessary. Woe be to him if he preach not the gospel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:16">1 Cor. ix. 16</A>.

 To induce him to faithfulness, he must consider, 

 1. That the eye of God and Jesus Christ was upon him: <I>I charge thee
 before God and the Lord Jesus Christ;</I> that is, "as thou tenderest 
 the favour of God and Jesus Christ; as thou wilt approve thyself to God 
 and Jesus Christ, by the obligations both of natural and revealed 
 religion; as thou wilt make due returns to the God who made thee and 
 the Lord Jesus Christ who redeemed thee." 

 2. He charges him as he will answer it at the great day, reminding him
 of the judgment to come, which is committed to the Lord Jesus. He shall 
 judge the quick and the dead <I>at his appearing and his kingdom,</I> 
 that is, when he appears in his kingdom. It concerns all, both 
 ministers and people, seriously to consider the account that they must 
 shortly give to Jesus Christ of all the trusts reposed in them. Christ 
 shall <I>judge the quick and the dead,</I> that is, those that at the 
 last day shall be found alive, and those who shall be raised to life 
 out of the grave. Note,

 (1.) The Lord Jesus Christ shall judge the quick and the dead. <I>God 
 hath committed all judgment unto the Son,</I> and hath appointed him 
 the Judge of quick and dead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:42">Acts x. 42</A>.

 (2.) He will appear; he will come the second time, and it will be a
 glorious appearance, as the word <B><I>epiphaneia</I></B> signifies. 
 
 (3.) Then his kingdom shall appear in its glory: <I>At his appearing 
 and kingdom;</I> for he will then appear in his kingdom, sitting on a 
 throne, to judge the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What is the matter of the charge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:2-5"><I>v.</I> 2-5</A>.

 He is charged,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To <I>preach the word.</I> This is ministers' business; a 
 dispensation is committed to them. It is not their own notions and 
 fancies that they are to preach, but the pure plain word of God; and 
 they must not corrupt it, but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the 
 sight of God, they speak in Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:17">2 Cor. ii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To urge what he preached, and to press it with all earnestness upon 
 his hearers: "<I>Be instant in season and out of season, reprove, 
 rebuke, exhort;</I> do this work with all fervency of spirit. Call upon 
 those under thy charge to take heed of sin, to do their duty: call upon 
 them to repent, and believe, and live a holy life, and this both in 
 season and out of season. <I>In season,</I> when they are at leisure to 
 hear thee, when some special opportunity offers itself of speaking to 
 them with advantage. Nay, do it <I>out of season,</I> even when there 
 is not that apparent probability of fastening something upon them, 
 because thou dost not know but the Spirit of God may fasten upon them; 
 for the wind bloweth where it listeth; and <I>in the morning we must 
 sow our seed, and in the evening not withhold our hand,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:6">Eccl. xi. 6</A>.

 We must do it in season, that is, let slip no opportunity; and do it
 out of season, that is, not shift off the duty, under pretence that it 
 is out of season.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He must tell people of their faults: "<I>Reprove them, rebuke
 them.</I> Convince wicked people of the evil and danger of their wicked 
 courses. Endeavour, by dealing plainly with them, to bring them to 
 repentance. Rebuke them with gravity and authority, in Christ's name, 
 that they may take thy displeasure against them as an indication of 
 God's displeasure."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He must direct, encourage, and quicken those who began well. 
 "<I>Exhort them</I> (persuade them to hold on, and endure to the end) 
 and this <I>with all long-suffering and doctrine.</I>" 

 (1.) He must do it very patiently: <I>With all long-suffering.</I> "If 
 thou do not see the effect of thy labours presently, yet do not 
 therefore give up the cause; be not weary of speaking to them." While 
 God shows to them all long-suffering, let ministers exhort with all 
 long-suffering. 

 (2.) He must do it rationally, not with passion, but <I>with 
 doctrine,</I> that is, "In order to the reducing of them to good 
 practices, instil into them good principles. Teach them the truth as it 
 is in Jesus, reduce them to a firm belief of it, and this will be a 
 means both to reclaim them from evil and to bring them to good." 
 Observe, 

 [1.] A minister's work has various parts: he is to <I>preach the 
 word,</I> to <I>reprove, rebuke,</I> and <I>exhort.</I>

 [2.] He is to be very diligent and careful; he must be <I>instant in 
 season and out of season;</I> he must spare no pains nor labour, but 
 must be urgent with them to take care of their souls and their eternal 
 concerns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He must <I>watch in all things.</I> "Seek an opportunity of doing 
 them a kindness; let no fair occasion slip, through thy negligence. 
 Watch to thy work; watch against the temptations of Satan, by which 
 thou mayest be diverted from it; watch over the souls of those who are 
 committed to thy charge."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He must count upon afflictions, and endure them, make the best of 
 them. <B><I>Kakopatheson,</I></B> endure <I>patiently.</I> "Be not
 discouraged by the difficulties thou meetest with, but bear them with 
 an evenness of spirit. Inure thyself to hardships."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. He must remember his office, and discharge its duties: <I>Do the 
 work of an evangelist.</I> The office of the evangelist was, as the 
 apostles' deputies, to water the churches that they planted. They were 
 not settled pastors, but for some time resided in, and presided over, 
 the churches that the apostles had planted, till they were settled 
 under a standing ministry. This was Timothy's work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. He must fulfil his ministry: <I>Make full proof of it.</I> It was a 
 great trust that was reposed in him, and therefore he must answer it, 
 and perform all the parts of his office with diligence and care. 
 Observe, 

 (1.) A minister must expect afflictions in the faithful discharge of 
 his duty. 
 
 (2.) He must endure them patiently, like a Christian hero. 
 
 (3.) These must not discourage him in his work, for he must do his 
 work, and fulfil his ministry. 

 (4.) The best way to make full proof of our ministry is to fulfil it, 
 to fill it up in all its parts with proper work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The reasons to enforce the charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Because errors and heresies were likely to creep into the church, by 
 which the minds of many professing Christians would be corrupted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>):

 "<I>For the time will come when they will not endure sound 
 doctrine.</I> Therefore improve the present time, when they will endure 
 it. Be busy now, for it is seedtime; when the fields are white unto the 
 harvest, put in the sickle, for the present gale of opportunity will be 
 soon over. <I>They will not endure sound doctrine.</I> There will be 
 those who will <I>heap to themselves corrupt teachers, and will turn 
 away their ears from the truth;</I> and therefore secure as many as 
 thou canst, that, when these storms and tempests do arise, they may be 
 well fixed, and their apostasy may be prevented." People must hear, and 
 ministers must preach, for the time to come, and guard against the 
 mischiefs that are likely to arise hereafter, though they do not yet 
 arise. They will <I>turn away their ears from the truth;</I> they will 
 grow weary of the old plain gospel of Christ, and then they will be 
 greedy of fables, and take pleasure in them, and God will give them up 
 to those strong delusions, because they received not the truth in the 
 love of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:11,12">2 Thess. ii. 11, 12</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 (1.) These teachers were of their own heaping up, and not of God's
 sending; but they chose them, to gratify their lusts, and to please
 their itching ears. 

 (2.) People do so when they will not endure sound doctrine, that 
 preaching which is searching, plain, and to the purpose; then they will 
 have teachers of their own. 

 (3.) There is a wide difference between the word of God and the word of 
 such teachers; the one is sound doctrine, the word of truth, the other 
 is only fables.

 (4.) Those that are turned unto fables first turn away their ears from 
 the truth, for they cannot hear and mind both, any more than they can 
 serve two masters. Nay, further, it is said, <I>They shall be turned 
 unto fables.</I> God justly suffers those to turn to fables who grow 
 weary of the truth, and gives them up to be led aside from the truth by 
 fables.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Because Paul for his part had almost done his work: <I>Do thou make 
 full proof of thy ministry, for I am now ready to be offered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 And,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) "Therefore there will be the more occasion for thee." When 
 labourers are removed out of the vineyard, it is no time for those to 
 loiter that are left behind, but to double their diligence. The fewer 
 hands there are to work the more industrious those hands must be that 
 are at work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) "I have done the work of my day and generation; do thou in like 
 manner do the work of thy day and generation."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The comfort and cheerfulness of Paul, in the prospect of his 
 approaching departure, might encourage Timothy to the utmost industry, 
 and diligence, and seriousness in his work. Paul was an old soldier of 
 Jesus Christ, Timothy was but newly enlisted. "Come," says Paul, "I 
 have found our Master kind and the cause good; I can look back upon my 
 warfare with a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction; and therefore 
 be not afraid of the difficulties thou must meet with. The crown of 
 life is as sure to thee as if it were already upon thy head; and 
 therefore endure afflictions, and make full proof of thy ministry." The 
 courage and comfort of dying saints and ministers, and especially dying 
 martyrs, are a great confirmation of the truth of the Christian 
 religion, and a great encouragement to living saints and ministers in 
 their work. Here the apostle looks forward, upon his death approaching: 
 <I>I am now ready to be offered.</I> The Holy Ghost witnessed in every 
 city that bonds and afflictions did abide him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:23">Acts xx. 23</A>.

 He was now at Rome, and it is probable that he had particular
 intimations from the Spirit that there he should seal the truth with 
 his blood; and he looks upon it now as near at hand: I am <I>already 
 poured out;</I> so it is in the original, <B><I>ede spendomai;</I></B> 
 that is, I am already a martyr in affection. It alludes to the pouring 
 out of the drink-offerings; for the blood of the martyrs, though it was 
 not a sacrifice of atonement, was a sacrifice of acknowledgment to the 
 honour of the grace of God and his truths. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] With what pleasure he speaks of dying. He calls it his departure; 
 though it is probable that he foresaw he must die a violent bloody 
 death, yet he calls it his departure, or his release. Death to a good 
 man is his release from the imprisonment of this world and his 
 departure to the enjoyments of another world; he does not cease to be, 
 but is only removed from one world to another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] With what pleasure he looks back upon the life he had lived 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course,</I> &c. He
 did not fear death, because he had the testimony of his conscience that 
 by the grace of God he had in some measure answered the ends of living. 
 As a Christian, as a minister, he had fought a good fight. He had done 
 the service, gone through the difficulties of his warfare, and had been 
 instrumental in carrying on the glorious victories of the exalted 
 Redeemer over the powers of darkness. His life was a course, and he had 
 now finished it; as his warfare was accomplished, so his race was run. 
 "<I>I have kept the faith.</I> I have kept the doctrines of the gospel, 
 and never betrayed any of them." Note, <I>First,</I> The life of a 
 Christian, but especially of a minister, is a warfare and a race, 
 sometimes compared to the one in the scripture, and sometimes to the 
 other. <I>Secondly,</I> It is a good fight, a good warfare; the cause 
 is good, and the victory is sure, if we continue faithful and 
 courageous. <I>Thirdly,</I> We must fight this good fight; we must 
 fight it out, and finish our course; we must not give over till we are 
 made more than conquerors through him who hath loved us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:37">Rom. viii. 37</A>.

 <I>Fourthly,</I> It is a great comfort to a dying saint, when he can 
 look back upon his past life and say with our apostle, "<I>I have 
 fought,</I> &c. I have kept the faith, the doctrine of faith and the 
 grace of faith." Towards the end of our days to be able to speak in 
 this manner, what comfort, unspeakable comfort, will it afford! Let it 
 then be our constant endeavour, by the grace of God, that we may finish 
 our course with joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:24">Acts xx. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] With what pleasure he looks forward to the life he was to live 
 hereafter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,</I> &c. 
 He had lost for Christ, but he was sure he should not lose by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:8">Phil. iii. 8</A>.

 Let this encourage Timothy to endure hardness as a good soldier of 
 Jesus Christ that there is a crown of life before us, the glory and joy 
 of which will abundantly recompense all the hardships and toils of our 
 present warfare. Observe, It is called <I>a crown of righteousness,</I> 
 because it will be the recompence of our services, which <I>God is not 
 unrighteous to forget;</I> and because our holiness and righteousness 
 will there be perfected, and will be our crown. God will give it as 
 <I>a righteous Judge,</I> who will let none love by him. And yet this 
 crown of righteousness was not peculiar to Paul, as if it belonged only 
 to apostles and eminent ministers and martyrs, but <I>to all those also 
 that love his appearing.</I> Observe, It is the character of all the 
 saints that they love the appearing of Jesus Christ: they loved his 
 first appearing, when he appeared to take away sin by the sacrifice of 
 himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:26">Heb. ix. 26</A>);

 they love to think of it; they love his second appearing at the great 
 day; love it, and long for it: and, with respect to those who love the 
 appearing of Jesus Christ, he shall appear to their joy; there is a 
 crown of righteousness reserved for them, which shall then be given 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:28">Heb. ix. 28</A>.

 We learn hence, <I>First,</I> The Lord is the righteous Judge, for his 
 judgment is according to truth. <I>Secondly,</I> The crown of
 believers is a crown of righteousness, purchased by the righteousness 
 of Christ, and bestowed as the reward of the saints' righteousness. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> This crown, which believers shall wear, is laid up for 
 them; they have it not at present, for here they are but heirs; they 
 have it not in possession, and yet it is sure, for it is laid up for 
 them. <I>Fourthly,</I> The righteous Judge will give it to all who
 love, prepare, and long for his appearing. <I>Surely I come quickly. 
 Amen, even so come, Lord Jesus.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are divers particular matters which Paul mentions to Timothy, now 
 at the closing of the epistle. 

 1. He bids him hasten to him, if possible

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>So thy diligence to come shortly to me.</I> For Timothy was an 
 evangelist, one who was not a fixed pastor of any one place, but 
 attended the motions of the apostles, to build upon their foundation. 
 Paul wanted Timothy's company and help; and the reason he gives is 
 because several had left him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 one from an ill principle, namely, <I>Demas,</I> who abides under an 
 ill name for it: <I>Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present 
 world.</I> He quitted Paul and his interest, either for fear of 
 suffering (because Paul was now a prisoner, and he was afraid of coming
 into trouble upon his account) or being called off from his ministry by
 secular affairs, in which he entangled himself; his first love to
 Christ and his gospel was forsaken and forgotten, and he fell in love
 with the world. Note, Love to this present world is often the cause of
 apostasy from the truths and ways of Jesus Christ. He has gone off, has
 <I>departed to Thessalonica,</I> called thither perhaps by trade, or by
 some other worldly business. <I>Crescens</I> had gone one way and
 <I>Titus</I> another way. <I>Luke</I> however remained with Paul
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>),

 and was not this enough? Paul did not think it so; he loved the company 
 of his friends.

 2. He speaks respectfully concerning <I>Mark: He is profitable to me 
 for the ministry.</I> It is supposed that this Mark was he about whom 
 Paul and Barnabas had contended, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:39">Acts xv. 39</A>.

 Paul would not take him with him to the work, because he had once 
 flinched and drawn back: but now, says he, <I>Take Mark, and bring him 
 with thee.</I> By this it appears that Paul was now reconciled to Mark, 
 and had a better opinion of him than he had had formerly. This teaches 
 us to be of a forgiving spirit; we must not therefore disclaim for ever 
 making use of those that are profitable and useful, though they may 
 have done amiss. 

 3. Paul orders Timothy to come to him, bids him as he came through
 Troas to bring with him thence those things which he had left behind 
 him there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 the cloak he had left there, which, it may be, Paul had the more 
 occasion for in a cold prison. It is probable that it was the habit 
 Paul usually wore, a plain dress. Some read it, the <I>roll of 
 parchment I left at Troas;</I> others, the <I>desk</I> that I left.
 Paul was guided by divine inspiration, and yet he would have his books 
 with him. Whereas he had exhorted Timothy to give attendance to 
 reading, so he did himself, though he was now ready to be offered. As 
 long as we live, we must be still learning. <I>But especially the 
 parchments,</I> which some think were the originals of his epistles; 
 others think they were the skins of which he made his tents, whereby he 
 obtained a livelihood, working with his own hands. 

 4. He mentions <I>Alexander,</I> and the mischief that he had done
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.
 
 This is he who is spoken of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:33">Acts xix. 33</A>.

 It should seem, he had been a professor of the Christian religion, a 
 forward professor, for he was there particularly maligned by the 
 worshippers of Diana, and yet he did Paul much evil. Paul was in as 
 much danger from false brethren

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:26">2 Cor. xi. 26</A>)

 as from open enemies. Paul foretels that God would reckon with him. It
 is a prophetical denunciation of the just judgment of God that would 
 befal him: The Lord <I>will reward him according to his works.</I> He 
 cautions Timothy to take heed of him: "<I>Of whom be thou aware 
 also,</I> that he do not, under pretence of friendship, betray thee to 
 mischief." It is dangerous having any thing to do with those who would 
 be enemies to such a man as Paul. Observe, 

 (1.) Some who were once Paul's hearers and admirers did not give him 
 reason to remember them with much pleasure; for one forsook him, and 
 another did him much evil, and greatly withstood his words. Yet, 

 (2.) At the same time he mentions some with pleasure; the badness of 
 some did not make him forget the goodness of others; such as 
 <I>Timothy, Titus, Mark,</I> and <I>Luke.</I> 

 (3.) The apostle has left a brand on the names and memory of two 
 persons; the one is <I>Demas,</I> who forsook him, having loved the 
 present world, and the other is <I>Alexander,</I> who greatly withstood 
 his words. 

 (4.) God will reward evil-doers, particularly apostates, according to 
 their works. 

 (5.) Of such as are of Alexander's spirit and temper we should beware; 
 for they will do us no good, but all the mischief that is in their 
 power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. He gives Timothy an account of his own present circumstances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He had lately been called to appear before the emperor, upon his 
 appeal to C&aelig;sar; and then <I>no man stood with him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 to plead his cause, to bear testimony for him, or so much as to keep 
 him in countenance, but <I>all men forsook him.</I> This was strange, 
 that so good a man as Paul should have nobody to own him, even at Rome, 
 where there were many Christians, whose faith was spoken of throughout 
 the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:8">Rom. i. 8</A>.

 But men are but men. The Christians at Rome were forward to go and meet 
 him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:1-31">Acts xxviii.</A>);

 but when it came to the pinch, and they would be in danger of suffering
 with him, then they all forsook him. He prays that God would not lay it 
 to their charge, intimating that it was a great fault, and God might 
 justly be angry with them, but he prays God to forgive them. See what a 
 distinction is put between sins of presumption and sins of infirmity. 
 Alexander the coppersmith, who maliciously withstood Paul, he prays 
 against: <I>The Lord reward him according to his works;</I> but 
 respecting these Christians, who through weakness shrunk from Paul in 
 time of trial, he says, <I>The Lord lay it not to their charge.</I> 
 Observe, 

 (1.) Paul had his trials in his friends' forsaking him in a time of 
 danger as well as in the opposition made by enemies: all forsook him. 
 
 (2.) It was their sin not to appear for the good apostle, especially at 
 his first answer; but it was a sin of weakness, and therefore the more 
 excusable. Yet,

 (3.) God might lay it to their charge, but Paul endeavours to prevent 
 it by his earnest prayers: <I>Let it not be laid to their 
 charge.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>Notwithstanding this God stood by him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 gave him extraordinary wisdom and courage, to enable him to speak so 
 much the better himself. When he had nobody to keep him in countenance, 
 God made his face to shine.--<I>That by me the preaching might be fully 
 known,</I> that is, "God brought me out from that difficulty that I 
 might preach the gospel, which is my business." Nay, it should seem, 
 that he might preach the gospel at that time; for Paul knew how to 
 preach at the bar as well as in the pulpit. <I>And that all the 
 Gentiles might hear;</I> the emperor himself and the great men who 
 would never have heard Paul preach if he had not been brought before 
 them. <I>And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion,</I> that is, 
 of Nero (as some think) or some other judge. Some understand it only as 
 a proverbial form of speech, to signify that he was in imminent danger.
 <I>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work.</I> See how Paul 
 improved his experiences: "<I>He that delivered doth deliver, and we 
 trust he will yet deliver,</I> will deliver me <I>from every evil 
 work,</I> from any ill done to me by others. <I>And shall preserve me 
 to his heavenly kingdom.</I>" And for this he gives glory to God, 
 rejoicing in hope of the glory of God. Observe,

 (1.) If the Lord stand by us, he will strengthen us, in a time of 
 difficulty and danger, and his presence will more than supply every 
 one's absence. 

 (2.) When the Lord preserves his servants from great and imminent 
 danger, it is for eminent work and service. Paul was preserved that by 
 him the preaching might be fully known, &c. 

 (3.) Former deliverances should encourage future hopes. 

 (4.) There is a heavenly kingdom, to which the Lord will preserve his 
 faithful witnessing or suffering servants.

 (5.) We ought to give God the glory of all past, present, and future 
 deliverances: <I>To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He sends salutations to <I>Aquila, and Priscilla, and the household 
 of Onesiphorus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He mentions his leaving <I>Trophimus sick at Miletum</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 by which it appears that though the apostles healed all manner of 
 diseases miraculously, for the confirmation of their doctrine, yet they 
 did not exert that power upon their own friends, lest it should have 
 looked like a collusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He hastens Timothy to <I>come to him before winter</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 because he longed to see him, and because in the winter the journey or 
 voyage would be more dangerous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He sends commendations to him from <I>Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, 
 Claudia,</I> and all the <I>brethren.</I> One of the heathen writers at 
 this time mentions one Pudens and his wife Claudia, and says the 
 Claudia was a Briton, whence some have gathered that it was this 
 Pudens, and that Claudia here was his wife, and that they were eminent 
 Christians at Rome.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He concludes with a prayer, that the <I>Lord Jesus would be with his 
 spirit.</I> We need no more to make us happy than to have the Lord 
 Jesus Christ with our spirits; for in him all spiritual blessings are 
 summed up. And it is the best prayer we can put up for our friends, 
 that the Lord Jesus Christ may be with their spirits, to sanctify and 
 save them, and at last to receive them to himself; as Stephen the 
 proto-martyr prayed, <I>Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:59">Acts vii. 59</A>.

 "Lord Jesus, receive that spirit which thou hast been with while it was 
 united to the body; do not now leave it in its separate state." 
 <I>Grace be with you. Amen.</I> This was our apostle's token in every 
 epistle; so he wrote. <I>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you 
 all. Amen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:17,18">2 Thess. iii. 17, 18</A>.

 And if grace be with us here to convert and change us, to make us holy,
 to keep us humble, and to enable us to persevere to the end, glory will
 crown us hereafter: <I>for the Lord is a sun, and a shield; the Lord
 will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from
 those that walk uprightly. O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that
 trusteth in thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:11,12">Ps. lxxxiv. 11, 12</A>.

 <I>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God
 our Saviour, be honour and glory for ever and ever.</I> Amen.</P>
