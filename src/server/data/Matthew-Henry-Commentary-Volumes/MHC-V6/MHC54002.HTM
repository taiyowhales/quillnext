 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications,
 prayers, intercessions, <I>and</I> giving of thanks, be made for all
 men;
 &nbsp; 2  For kings, and <I>for</I> all that are in authority; that we may
 lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
 &nbsp; 3  For this <I>is</I> good and acceptable in the sight of God our
 Saviour;
 &nbsp; 4  Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the
 knowledge of the truth.
 &nbsp; 5  For <I>there is</I> one God, and one mediator between God and men,
 the man Christ Jesus;
 &nbsp; 6  Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due
 time.
 &nbsp; 7  Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak
 the truth in Christ, <I>and</I> lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in
 faith and verity.
 &nbsp; 8  I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy
 hands, without wrath and doubting.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A charge given to Christians to pray for all men in general, and 
 particularly for all in authority. Timothy must take care that this be 
 done. Paul does not send him any prescribed form of prayer, as we have 
 reason to think he would if he had intended that ministers should be 
 tied to that way of praying; but, in general, that they should make 
 <I>supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks:</I> 
 supplications for the averting of evil, prayers for the obtaining of 
 good, intercessions for others, and thanksgivings for mercies already 
 received. Paul thought it enough to give them general heads; they, 
 having the scripture to direct them in prayer and the Spirit of prayer 
 poured out upon them, needed not any further directions. Observe, The
 design of the Christian religion is to promote prayer; and the 
 disciples of Christ must be praying people. Pray <I>always with all 
 prayer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:18">Eph. vi. 18</A>.

 There must be prayers for ourselves in the first place; this is implied
 here. We must also pray <I>for all men,</I> for the world of mankind in 
 general, for particular persons who need or desire our prayers. See how 
 far the Christian religion was from being a sect, when it taught men 
 this diffusive charity, to pray, not only for those of their own way, 
 but for all men. Pray for kings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 though the kings at this time were heathens, enemies to Christianity, 
 and persecutors of Christians, yet they must pray for them, because it 
 is for the public good that there should be civil government, and 
 proper persons entrusted with the administration of it, for whom 
 therefore we ought to pray, yea, though we ourselves suffer under them. 
 <I>For kings, and all that are in authority,</I> that is, inferior 
 magistrates: we must pray for them, and we must give thanks for them, 
 pray for their welfare and for the welfare of their kingdoms, and 
 therefore must not plot against them, that in the peace thereof we may 
 have peace, and give thanks for them and for the benefit we have under 
 their government, that <I>we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all 
 godliness and honesty.</I> Here see what we must desire for kings, that 
 God will so turn their hearts, and direct them and make use of them, 
 that we under them may lead a quiet and peaceable life. He does not 
 say, "that we may get preferments under them, grow rich, and be in 
 honour and power under them;" no, the summit of the ambition of a good 
 Christian is to lead a quiet and peaceable life, to get through the 
 world unmolested in a low private station. We should desire that we and 
 others may lead a peaceable life <I>in all godliness and honesty,</I> 
 implying that we cannot expect to be kept quiet and peaceable unless we 
 keep in all godliness and honesty. Let us mind our duty, and then we 
 may expect to be taken under the protection both of God and the 
 government. <I>In all godliness and honesty.</I> Here we have our duty 
 as Christians summed up in two words: godliness, that is, the right 
 worshipping of God; and honesty, that is, a good conduct towards all 
 men. These two must go together; we are not truly honest if we are not
 godly, and do not render to God his due; and we are not truly godly if 
 we are not honest, for God hates robbery for burnt-offering. Here we 
 may observe, 

 1. Christians are to be men much given to prayer: they ought to abound
 herein, and should use themselves to prayers, supplications, &c.

 2. In our prayers we are to have a generous concern for others as well
 as for ourselves; we are to pray for all men, and to give thanks for
 all men; and must not confine our prayers nor thanksgiving to our own
 persons or families. 

 3. Prayer consists of various parts, of supplications, intercessions,
 and thanksgivings; for we must pray for the mercies we want, as well as
 be thankful for mercies already received; and we are to deprecate the
 judgments which our own sins or the sins of others have deserved. 

 4. All men, yea, kings themselves, and those who are in authority, are
 to be prayed for. They want our prayers, for they have many
 difficulties to encounter, many snares to which their exalted stations 
 expose them.

 5. In praying for our governors, we take the most likely course to lead
 a peaceable and quiet life. The Jews at Babylon were commanded to seek
 the peace of the city whither the Lord had caused them to be carried 
 captives, and to pray to the Lord for it; for in the peace thereof they 
 should have peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:7">Jer. xxix. 7</A>.

 6. If we would lead a peaceable and quiet life, we must live in all 
 godliness and honesty; we must do our duty to God and man. <I>He that 
 will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from 
 evil, and his lips that they speak no guile; let him eschew evil, and 
 do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:10,11">1 Pet. iii. 10, 11</A>.

 Now the reason he gives for this is <I>because this is good in the
 sight of God our Saviour;</I> that is, the gospel of Christ requires 
 this. That which is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour we 
 should do, and should abound in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As a reason why we should in our prayers concern ourselves for all 
 men, he shows God's love to mankind in general, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. One reason why all men are to be prayed for is because there is one 
 God, and that God bears a good will to all mankind. There is one God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and one only, there is no other, there can be no other, for there can 
 be but one infinite. This one God <I>will have all men to be saved;</I> 
 he desires not the death and destruction of any 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:11">Ezek. xxxiii. 11</A>),

 but the welfare and salvation of all. Not that he has decreed the 
 salvation of all, for then all men would be saved; but he has a good 
 will to the salvation of all, and none perish but by their own fault,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>.

 He will have all to be saved, <I>and to come to the knowledge of the 
 truth,</I> to be saved in the way that he has appointed and not 
 otherwise. It concerns us to get the knowledge of the truth, because 
 that is the way to be saved; <I>Christ is the way and the truth, and so 
 he is the life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There is one Mediator, and that mediator gave himself a ransom for 
 all. As the mercy of God extends itself to all his works, so the 
 mediation of Christ extends itself thus far to all the children of men 
 that he paid a price sufficient for the salvation of all mankind; he 
 brought mankind to stand upon new terms with God, so that they are not 
 now under the law as a covenant of works, but as a rule of life. They 
 are under grace; not under the covenant of innocence, but under a new 
 covenant: <I>He gave himself a ransom.</I> Observe, The death of Christ 
 was a ransom, a counter-price. We deserved to have died. Christ died 
 for us, to save us from death and hell; he gave himself a ransom 
 voluntarily, a ransom for all; so that all mankind are put in a better 
 condition than that of devils. He died to work out a common salvation: 
 in order hereunto, he put himself into the office of Mediator between 
 God and man. A mediator supposes a controversy. Sin had made a quarrel 
 between us and God; Jesus Christ is a Mediator who undertakes to make 
 peace, to bring God and man together, in the nature of an umpire or
 arbitrator, a days-man who lays his hand upon u both, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:33">Job ix. 33</A>.

 He is a ransom that <I>was to be testified in due time;</I> that is, in 
 the Old-Testament times, his sufferings and the glory that should 
 follow were spoken of as things to be revealed in the last times,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10,11">1 Pet. i. 10, 11</A>.

 And they are accordingly revealed, Paul himself having been ordained a
 preacher and an apostle, to publish to the Gentiles the glad tidings of 
 redemption and salvation by Jesus Christ. This doctrine of Christ's 
 mediation Paul was entrusted to preach to every creature,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:15">Mark xvi. 15</A>.

 He was appointed to be a teacher of the Gentiles; besides his general
 call to the apostleship, he was commissioned particularly to preach to 
 the Gentiles, <I>in faith and truth,</I> or faithfully and truly. Note,

 (1.) It is good and acceptable in the sight of God and our Saviour that
 we pray for kings and for all men, and also that we lead a peaceable 
 and quiet life; and this is a very good reason why we should do the one 
 as well as the other. 

 (2.) God has a good will to the salvation of all; so that it is not so 
 much the want of a will in God to save them as it is a want of will in 
 themselves to be saved in God's way. Here our blessed Lord charges the 
 fault: <I>You will not come unto me that you may have life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:40">John v. 40</A>.

 <I>I would have gathered you, and you would not.</I>

 (3.) Those who are saved must come to the knowledge of the truth, for
 this is God's appointed way to save sinners. Without knowledge the 
 heart cannot be good; if we do not know the truth, we cannot be ruled 
 by it. 

 (4.) It is observable that the unity of God is asserted, and joined 
 with the unity of the Mediator; and the church of Rome might as well 
 maintain a plurality of gods as a plurality of mediators. 

 (5.) He that is a Mediator in the New-Testament sense, gave himself a 
 ransom. Vain then is the pretence of the Romanists that there is but
 one Mediator of satisfaction, but many of intercession; for, according 
 to Paul, Christ's giving himself a ransom was a necessary part of the 
 Mediator's office; and indeed this lays the foundation for his 
 intercession. 

 (6.) Paul was ordained a minister, to declare this to the Gentiles, 
 that Christ is the one Mediator between God and men, who gave himself a 
 ransom for all. This is the substance of which all ministers are to 
 preach, to the end of the world; and Paul magnified his office, as he 
 was the apostle of the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:13">Rom. xi. 13</A>.

 (7.) Ministers must preach the truth, what they apprehend to be so, and
 they must believe it themselves; they are, like our apostle, to preach 
 in faith and verity, and they must also be faithful and trusty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A direction how to pray, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 1. Now, under the gospel, prayer is not to be confined to any one 
 particular house of prayer, but men must pray every where: no place is 
 amiss for prayer, no place more acceptable to God than another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:21">John iv. 21</A>.

 <I>Pray every where.</I> We must pray in our closets, pray in our
 families, pray at our meals, pray when we are on journeys, and pray in
 the solemn assemblies, whether more public or private. 

 2. It is the will of God that in prayer we should lift up holy hands:
 <I>Lifting up holy hands,</I> or pure hands, pure from the pollution of 
 sin, washed in the fountain opened for sin and uncleanness. <I>I will 
 wash my hands,</I> &c.,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:6">Ps. xxvi. 6</A>.

 3. We must pray in charity: <I>Without wrath,</I> or malice, or anger
 at any person. 

 4. We must pray in faith <I>without doubting</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:6">Jam. i. 6</A>),

 or, as some read it, <I>without disputing,</I> and then it falls under 
 the head of charity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest
 apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair,
 or gold, or pearls, or costly array;
 &nbsp; 10  But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good
 works.
 &nbsp; 11  Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
 &nbsp; 12  But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority
 over the man, but to be in silence.
 &nbsp; 13  For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
 &nbsp; 14  And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was
 in the transgression.
 &nbsp; 15  Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they
 continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a charge, that women who profess the Christian religion 
 should be modest, sober, silent, and submissive, as becomes their 
 place. 

 1. They must be very modest in their apparel, not affecting gaudiness, 
 gaiety, or costliness (you may read the vanity of a person's mind in 
 the gaiety and gaudiness of his habit), because they have better 
 ornaments with which they should <I>adorn themselves, with good 
 works.</I> Note, Good works are the best ornament; these are, in the 
 sight of God, of great price. Those that profess godliness should, in
 their dress, as well as other things, act as becomes their profession; 
 instead of laying out their money on fine clothes, they must lay it out 
 in works of piety and charity, which are properly called good works.
 
 2. Women must learn the principles of their religion, learn Christ,
 learn the scriptures; they must not think that their sex excuses them 
 from that learning which is necessary to salvation. 

 3. They must be silent, submissive, and subject, and not usurp
 authority. The reason given is because <I>Adam was first formed, then 
 Eve</I> out of him, to denote her subordination to him and dependence 
 upon him; and that she was made for him, to be a help-meet for him. And 
 as she was last in the creation, which is one reason for her 
 subjection, so she was first in the transgression, and that is another 
 reason. <I>Adam was not deceived,</I> that is, not first; the serpent 
 did not immediately set upon him, but the woman was first in the 
 transgression

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:3">2 Cor. xi. 3</A>),
 
 and it was part of the sentence, <I>Thy desire shall be to thy husband, 
 and he shall rule over thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:16">Gen. iii. 16</A>.
 
 But it is a word of comfort
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 that those who continue in sobriety shall be <I>saved in 
 child-bearing,</I> or <I>with</I> child-bearing--the Messiah, who was
 born of a woman, should break the serpent's head 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>);

 or the sentence which they are under for sin shall be no bar to their 
 acceptance with Christ, <I>if they continue in faith, and charity, and 
 holiness, with sobriety.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here observe, 

 1. The extensiveness of the rules of Christianity; they reach not only
 to men, but to women, not only to their persons, but also to their
 dress, which must be modest, like their sex; and to their outward
 deportment and behaviour, it must be in silence, with all subjection.
 
 2. Women are to profess godliness as well as men; for they are
 baptized, and thereby stand engaged to exercise themselves to
 godliness; and, to their honour be it spoken, many of them were eminent
 professors of Christianity in the days of the apostles, as the book of
 Acts will inform us. 

 3. Women being more in danger of exceeding in their apparel, it was
 more necessary to caution them in this respect.

 4. The best ornaments for professors of godliness are good works.

 5. According to Paul, women must be learners, and are not allowed to
 be public teachers in the church; for teaching is an office of 
 authority, and the woman must not usurp authority over the man, but is 
 to be in silence. But, notwithstanding this prohibition, good women may 
 and ought to teach their children at home the principles of religion.
 Timothy from a child had known the holy scriptures; and who should 
 teach him but his mother and grandmother?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:15">2 Tim. iii. 15</A>.

 Aquila and his wife Priscilla expounded unto Apollos the way of God 
 more perfectly; but then they did it privately, for <I>they took him 
 unto them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:26">Acts xviii. 26</A>.

 6. Here are two very good reasons given for the man's authority over
 the woman, and her subjection to the man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Adam was first formed, then Eve; she was created for the man, and not 
 the man for the woman

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:9">1 Cor. xi. 9</A>);

 then she was deceived, and brought the man into the transgression. 

 7. Though the difficulties and dangers of childbearing are many and
 great, as they are part of the punishment inflicted on the sex for 
 Eve's transgression, yet here is much for her support and 
 encouragement: <I>Notwithstanding she shall be saved,</I> &c. Though in 
 sorrow, yet she shall bring forth, and be a living mother of living 
 children; with this proviso, that they continue in faith, and charity, 
 and holiness, with sobriety: and women, under the circumstance of 
 child-bearing should by faith lay hold of this promise for their 
 support in the needful time.</P>
