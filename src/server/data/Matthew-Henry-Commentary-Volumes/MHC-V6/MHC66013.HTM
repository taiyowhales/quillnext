 We have, in this chapter, a further discovery and description of the
 church's enemies: not other enemies than are mentioned before, but
 described after another manner, that the methods of their enmity may
 more fully appear. They are represented as two beasts; the first you
 have an account of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>)

 the second, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:11-18">ver. 11</A>,

 &c. By the first some understand Rome pagan, and by the second Rome
 papal; but others understand Rome papal to be represented by both these 
 beasts, by the first in its secular power, by the second in its 
 ecclesiastical.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up
 out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his
 horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
 &nbsp; 2  And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his
 feet were as <I>the feet</I> of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of
 a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and
 great authority.
 &nbsp; 3  And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and
 his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the
 beast.
 &nbsp; 4  And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the
 beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who <I>is</I> like unto
 the beast? who is able to make war with him?
 &nbsp; 5  And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things
 and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty
 <I>and</I> two months.
 &nbsp; 6  And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to
 blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in
 heaven.
 &nbsp; 7  And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
 overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and
 tongues, and nations.
 &nbsp; 8  And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose
 names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from
 the foundation of the world.
 &nbsp; 9  If any man have an ear, let him hear.
 &nbsp; 10  He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he
 that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here
 is the patience and the faith of the saints.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the rise, figure, and progress of the first 
 beast; and observe, 

 1. From what situation the apostle saw this monster. He seemed to
 himself to stand upon <I>the sea-shore,</I> though it is probable he 
 was still in a rapture; but he took himself to be in <I>the island 
 Patmos,</I> but whether in the body or out of the body he could not 
 tell. 

 2. Whence this beast came--<I>out of the sea;</I> and yet, by the 
 description of it, it would seem more likely to be a land-monster; but 
 the more monstrous every thing about it was the more proper an emblem 
 it would be to set forth the mystery of iniquity and tyranny. 

 3. What was the form and shape of this beast. It was for the most part
 <I>like a leopard,</I> but its <I>feet were like the feet of a bear and 
 its mouth as the mouth of a lion;</I> it had <I>seven heads, and ten 
 horns, and upon its heads the name of blasphemy:</I> the most horrid 
 and hideous monster! In some part of this description here seems to be 
 an allusion to Daniel's vision of the four beasts, which represented 
 the four monarchies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:1-3">Dan. vii. 1-3</A>,

 &c. One of these beasts was like a lion, another like a bear, and
 another like a leopard; this beast was a sort of composition of those 
 three, with the fierceness, strength, and swiftness, of them all; the 
 seven heads and the ten horns seem to design its several powers; the 
 ten crowns, its tributary princes; the word blasphemy on its forehead 
 proclaims its direct enmity and opposition to the glory of God, by 
 promoting idolatry. 

 4. The source and spring of his authority--<I>the dragon; he gave him
 his power, and seat, and great authority.</I> He was set up by the 
 devil, and supported by him to do his work and promote his interest; 
 and the devil lent him all the assistance he could. 

 5. A dangerous wound given him, and yet unexpectedly healed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Some think that by this wounded head we are to understand the 
 abolishing of pagan idolatry; and by the healing of the wound the 
 introducing of the popish idolatry, the same in substance with the 
 former, only in a new dress, and which as effectually answers the 
 devil's design as that did.

 6. The honour and worship paid to this infernal monster: <I>All the
 world wondered after the beast;</I> they all admired his power, and 
 policy, and success, and <I>they worshipped the dragon</I> that <I>gave 
 power to the beast,</I> and <I>they worshipped the beast;</I> they paid 
 honour and subjection to the devil and his instruments, and thought 
 there was no power able to withstand them: so great were the darkness, 
 degeneracy, and madness of the world!

 7. How he exercised his infernal power and policy: He had <I>a mouth,
 speaking great things, and blasphemies; he blasphemed God, the name of 
 God, the tabernacle of God, and all those that dwell in heaven; and he 
 made war with the saints, and overcame them,</I> and gained a sort of 
 universal empire in the world. His malice was principally levelled at 
 the God of heaven, and his heavenly attendants--at God, in making 
 images of him that is invisible, and in worshipping them;--at the 
 tabernacle of God, that is, say some, at the human nature of the Lord 
 Jesus Christ, in which God dwells as in a tabernacle; this is 
 dishonoured by their doctrine of transubstantiation, which will not 
 suffer his body to be a true body, and will put it into the power of 
 every priest to prepare a body for Christ;--and <I>against those that 
 dwell in heaven,</I> the glorified saints, by putting them into the 
 place of the pagan demons, and praying to them, which they are so far 
 from being pleased with that they truly judge themselves wronged and 
 dishonoured by it. Thus the malice of the devil shows itself against 
 heaven and the blessed inhabitants of heaven. These are above the reach 
 of his power. All he can do is to blaspheme them; but the saints on 
 earth are more exposed to his cruelty, and he sometimes is permitted to 
 triumph over them and trample upon them. 

 8. The limitation of the devil's power and success, and that both as to
 time and persons. He is limited in point of time; his reign is <I>to 
 continue forty-and-two months</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 suitable to the other prophetical characters of the reign of 
 antichrist. He is also limited as to the persons and people that he 
 shall entirely subject his will and power; it will be only those 
 <I>whose names are not written in the Lamb's book of life.</I> Christ 
 had a chosen remnant, <I>redeemed by his blood, recorded in his book, 
 sealed by his Spirit;</I> and though the devil and antichrist might 
 overcome their bodily strength, and take away their natural life, they 
 could never conquer their souls, nor prevail with them to forsake their 
 Saviour and revolt to his enemies. 

 9. Here is a demand of attention to what is here discovered of the
 great sufferings and troubles of the church, and an assurance given 
 that when God has accomplished his work on mount Zion, his refining 
 work, then he will turn his hand against the enemies of his people, and 
 those who have killed with the sword shall themselves fall by the sword

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and those who led the people of God into captivity shall themselves be 
 made captives. Here now is that which will be proper exercise for 
 <I>the patience and faith of the saints</I>--patience under the prospect
 of such great sufferings, and faith in the prospect of so glorious a 
 deliverance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and
 he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
 &nbsp; 12  And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before
 him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to
 worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
 &nbsp; 13  And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down
 from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,
 &nbsp; 14  And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by <I>the means of</I>
 those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the
 beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should
 make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and
 did live.
 &nbsp; 15  And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast,
 that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as
 many as would not worship the image of the beast should be
 killed.
 &nbsp; 16  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor,
 free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
 foreheads:
 &nbsp; 17  And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the
 mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
 &nbsp; 18  Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the
 number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his
 number <I>is</I> Six hundred threescore <I>and</I> six.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those who think the first beast signifies Rome pagan by this second 
 beast would understand Rome papal, which promotes idolatry and tyranny, 
 but in a more soft and lamb-like manner: those that understand the 
 first beast of the secular power of the papacy take the second to 
 intend its spiritual and ecclesiastical powers, which act under the 
 disguise of religion and charity to the souls of men. Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The form and shape of this second beast: <I>He had two horns like a 
 lamb,</I> but a mouth that <I>spoke like the dragon.</I> All agree that 
 this must be some great impostor, who, under a pretence of religion, 
 shall deceive the souls of men. The papists would have it to be 
 Apollonius Tyran&aelig;us; but Dr. More has rejected that opinion, and fixes
 it upon the ecclesiastical powers of the papacy. The pope shows the 
 horns of a lamb, pretends to be the vicar of Christ upon earth, and so 
 to be vested with his power and authority; but his speech betrays him, 
 for he gives forth those false doctrines and cruel decrees which show 
 him to belong to the dragon, and not to the Lamb.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The power which he exercises: <I>All the power of the former 
 beast</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:12">v. 12</A>);

 he promotes the same interest, pursues the same design in substance, 
 which is, to draw men off from worshipping the true God to worshipping 
 those who by nature are no gods, and subject the souls and consciences 
 of men to the will and authority of men, in opposition to the will of 
 God. This design is promoted by the popery as well as by paganism, and 
 by the crafty arts of popery as well as by the secular arm, both 
 serving the interests of the devil, though in a different manner.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The methods by which this second beast carried on his interests 
 and designs; they are of three sorts:--

 1. Lying wonders, pretended miracles, by which they should be deceived,
 and prevailed with to worship the former beast in this new image or 
 shape that was now made for him; they would pretend to bring down fire 
 from heaven, as Elias did, and God sometimes permits his enemies, as he 
 did the magicians of Egypt, to do things that seem very wonderful, and 
 by which unwary persons may be deluded. It is well known that the papal 
 kingdom has been long supported by pretended miracles. 

 2. Excommunications, anathemas, severe censures, by which they pretend
 to cut men off from Christ, and cast them into the power of the devil, 
 but do indeed deliver them over to the secular power, that they may be 
 put to death; and thus, notwithstanding their vile hypocrisy, they are 
 justly charged with killing those whom they cannot corrupt. 

 3. By disfranchisement, allowing none to enjoy natural, civil, or
 municipal rights, who will not worship that papal beast, that is, the 
 image of the pagan beast. It is made a qualification for buying and 
 selling the rights of nature, as well as for places of profit and 
 trust, that they have <I>the mark of the beast in their forehead</I> 
 and <I>in their right hand,</I> and that they have <I>the name of the 
 beast</I> and <I>the number of his name.</I> It is probable that <I>the 
 mark, the name,</I> and <I>the number of the beast,</I> may all signify 
 the same thing--that they make an open profession of their subjection 
 and obedience to the papacy, which is receiving the mark in their 
 forehead, and that they oblige themselves to use all their interest, 
 power, and endeavour, to promote the papal authority, which is 
 receiving the mark in their right hands. We are told that pope
 Martin V. in his bull, added to the council of Constance, prohibits Roman
 catholics from suffering any heretics to dwell in their countries, or 
 to make any bargains, use any trades, or bear any civil offices, which 
 is a very clear interpretation of this prophecy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We have here <I>the number of the beast,</I> given in such a manner 
 as shows the infinite wisdom of God, and will sufficiently exercise all 
 the wisdom and accuracy of men: <I>The number</I> is <I>the number of a 
 man,</I> computed after the usual manner among men, and it is 666. 
 Whether this be the number of the errors and heresies that are 
 contained in popery, or rather, as others, the number of the years from
 its rise to its fall, is not certain, much less what that period is 
 which is described by these prophetic numbers. The most admired 
 dissertation on this intricate subject is that of Dr. Potter, where the 
 curious may find sufficient entertainment. It seems to me to be one of 
 those seasons which God has reserved in his own power; only this we 
 know, God has written <I>Mene Tekel</I> upon all his enemies; he has 
 numbered their days, and they shall be finished, but his own kingdom 
 shall endure for ever.</P>
