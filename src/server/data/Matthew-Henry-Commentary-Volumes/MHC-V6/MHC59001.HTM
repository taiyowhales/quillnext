 After the inscription and salutation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:1">ver. 1</A>)

 Christians are taught how to conduct themselves when under the cross.
 Several graces and duties are recommended; and those who endure their
 trials and afflictions as the apostle here directs are pronounced
 blessed and are assured of a glorious reward,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:2-12">ver. 2-12</A>.

 But those sins which bring sufferings, or the weakness and faults men
 are chargeable with under them, are by no means to be imputed to God, 
 who cannot be the author of sin, but is the author of all good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:13-18">ver. 13-18</A>.

 All passion, and rash anger, and vile affections, ought to be
 suppressed. The word of God should be made our chief study: and what we 
 hear and know of it we must take care to practise, otherwise our 
 religion will prove but a vain thing. To this is added an account 
 wherein pure religion consists,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
 twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the inscription of this epistle, which consists of three 
 principal parts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The character by which our author desires to be known: <I>James, a 
 servant of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ.</I> Though he was a 
 prime-minister in Christ's kingdom, yet he styles himself only a 
 servant. Note hence, Those who are highest in office or attainments in 
 the church of Christ are but servants. They should not therefore act as 
 masters, but as ministers. Further, Though James is called by the 
 evangelist <I>the brother of our Lord,</I> yet it was his glory to 
 serve Christ in the spirit, rather than to boast of his being akin 
 according to the flesh. Hence let us learn to prize this title above 
 all others in the world--<I>the servants of God and of Christ.</I>
 Again, it is to be observed that James professes himself <I>a servant 
 of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ;</I> to teach us that in all 
 services we should have an eye to the Son as well as the Father. We 
 cannot acceptably serve the Father, unless we are also servants of the 
 Son. God will have <I>all men to honour the Son as they honour the 
 Father</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:23">John v. 23</A>),

 looking for acceptance in Christ and assistance from him, and yielding
 all obedience to him, thus confessing <I>that Jesus Christ is Lord, to 
 the glory of God the Father.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostle here mentions the condition of those to whom he writes: 
 <I>The twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.</I> Some understand 
 this of the dispersion upon the persecution of Stephen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:4-40">Acts viii</A>.

 But that only reached to Judea and Samaria. Others by the Jews of the
 dispersion understand those who were in Assyria, Babylon, Egypt, and 
 other kingdoms into which their wars had driven them. The greatest part 
 indeed of ten of the twelve tribes were lost in captivity; but yet some 
 of every tribe were preserved and they are still honoured with the 
 ancient style of <I>twelve tribes.</I> These however were scattered and 
 dispersed.

 1. They were dispersed in mercy. Having the scriptures of the Old
 Testament, the providence of God so ordered it that they were scattered 
 in several countries for the diffusing of the light of divine 
 revelation. 

 2. They began now to be scattered in wrath. The Jewish nation was
 crumbling into parties and factions, and many were forced to leave 
 their own country, as having now grown too hot for them. Even good 
 people among them shared in the common calamity. 

 3. These Jews of the dispersion were those who had embraced the
 Christian faith. They were persecuted and forced to seek for shelter in 
 other countries, the Gentiles being kinder to Christians than the Jews 
 were. Note here, It is often the lot even of God's own tribes to be 
 scattered abroad. The gathering day is reserved for the end of time; 
 when all the dispersed children of God shall be gathered together to 
 Christ their head. In the mean time, while God's tribes are scattered 
 abroad, he will send to look after them. Here is an apostle writing to 
 the scattered; an epistle from God to them, when driven away from his 
 temple, and seemingly neglected by him. Apply here that of the prophet 
 Ezekiel, <I>Thus saith the Lord God, Although I have cast them far off 
 among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the 
 countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries 
 where they shall come,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:16">Ezek. xi. 16</A>.

 God has a particular care of his outcasts. <I>Let my outcasts dwell
 with thee, Moab,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:3,4">Isa. xvi. 3, 4</A>.

 God's tribes may be scattered; therefore we should not value ourselves
 too much on outward privileges. And, on the other hand, we should not
 despond and think ourselves rejected, under outward calamities, because 
 God remembers and sends comfort to his scattered people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. James here shows the respect he had even for the dispersed: 
 <I>greeting,</I> saluting them, wishing peace and salvation to them. 
 True Christians should not be the less valued for their hardships. It 
 was the desire of this apostle's heart that those who were scattered 
 might be comforted--that they might do well and fare well, and be
 enabled to rejoice even in their distresses. God's people have reason 
 to rejoice in all places, and at all times; as will abundantly appear 
 from what follows.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
 temptations;
 &nbsp; 3  Knowing <I>this,</I> that the trying of your faith worketh
 patience.
 &nbsp; 4  But let patience have <I>her</I> perfect work, that ye may be
 perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
 &nbsp; 5  If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
 all <I>men</I> liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given
 him.
 &nbsp; 6  But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that
 wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and
 tossed.
 &nbsp; 7  For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of
 the Lord.
 &nbsp; 8  A double minded man <I>is</I> unstable in all his ways.
 &nbsp; 9  Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
 &nbsp; 10  But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower
 of the grass he shall pass away.
 &nbsp; 11  For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
 withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the
 grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man
 fade away in his ways.
 &nbsp; 12  Blessed <I>is</I> the man that endureth temptation: for when he
 is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath
 promised to them that love him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We now come to consider the matter of this epistle. In this paragraph 
 we have the following things to be observed:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The suffering state of Christians in this world is represented, and 
 that in a very instructive manner, if we attend to what is plainly and 
 necessarily implied, together with what is fully expressed. 

 1. It is implied that troubles and afflictions may be the lot of the
 best Christians, even of those who have the most reason to think and
 hope well of themselves. Such as have a title to the greatest joy may
 yet endure very grievous afflictions. As good people are liable to be
 scattered, they must not think it strange if they meet with troubles.
 
 2. These outward afflictions and troubles are temptations to them. The
 devil endeavours by sufferings and crosses to draw men to sin and to 
 deter them from duty, or unfit them for it; but, as our afflictions are 
 in God's hand, they are intended for the trial and improvement of our 
 graces. The gold is put into the furnace, that it may be purified. 

 3. These temptations may be numerous and various: <I>Divers
 temptations,</I> as the apostle speaks. Our trials may be of many and 
 different kinds, and therefore we have need to put on the whole armour 
 of God. We must be armed on every side, because temptations lie on all 
 sides. 

 4. The trials of a good man are such as he does not create to himself, 
 nor sinfully pull upon himself; but they are such as he is said to fall 
 into. And for this reason they are the better borne by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The graces and duties of a state of trial and affliction are here 
 pointed out to us. Could we attend to these things, and grow in them as 
 we should do, how good would it be for us to be afflicted!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. One Christian grace to be exercised is joy: <I>Count it all joy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 We must not sink into a sad and disconsolate frame of mind, which would 
 make us faint under our trials; but must endeavour to keep our spirits 
 dilated and enlarged, the better to take in a true sense of our case, 
 and with greater advantage to set ourselves to make the best of it. 
 Philosophy may instruct men to be calm under their troubles; but 
 Christianity teaches them to be joyful, because such exercises proceed 
 from love and not fury in God. In them we are conformable to Christ our 
 head, and they become marks of our adoption. By suffering in the ways 
 of righteousness, we are serving the interests of our Lord's kingdom 
 among men, and edifying the body of Christ; and our trials will 
 brighten our graces now and our crown at last. Therefore there is 
 reason to count it all joy when trials and difficulties become our lot 
 in the way of our duty. And this is not purely a New-Testament paradox, 
 but even in Job's time it was said, <I>Behold, happy is the man whom 
 God correcteth.</I> There is the more reason for joy in afflictions if 
 we consider the other graces that are promoted by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Faith is a grace that one expression supposes and another expressly 
 requires: <I>Knowing this, that the trial of your faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>;

 and then in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>,

 <I>Let him ask in faith.</I> There must be a sound believing of the 
 great truths of Christianity, and a resolute cleaving to them, in times 
 of trial. That faith which is spoken of here as tried by afflictions 
 consists in a belief of the power, and word, and promise of God, and in 
 fidelity and constancy to the Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. There must be patience: <I>The trial of faith worketh patience.</I> 
 The trying of one grace produces another; and the more the suffering 
 graces of a Christian are exercised the stronger they grow. 
 <I>Tribulation worketh patience,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:3">Rom. v. 3</A>.

 Now, to exercise Christian patience aright, we must,

 (1.) Let it work. It is not a stupid, but an active thing. Stoical
 apathy and Christian patience are very different: by the one men 
 become, in some measure, insensible of their afflictions; but by the 
 other they become triumphant in and over them. Let us take care, in 
 times of trial, that patience and not passion, be set at work in us; 
 whatever is said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it: 
 let us not allow the indulging of our passions to hinder the operation 
 and noble effects of patience; let us give it leave to work, and it 
 will work wonders in a time of trouble.

 (2.) We must let it have its perfect work. Do nothing to limit it nor 
 to weaken it; but let it have its full scope: if one affliction come 
 upon the heels of another, and a train of them are drawn upon us, yet 
 let patience go on till its work is perfected. When we bear all that 
 God appoints, and as long as he appoints, and with a humble obedient 
 eye to him, and when we not only bear troubles, but rejoice in them, 
 then patience hath its perfect work. 

 (3.) When the work of patience is complete, then the Christian is 
 entire, and nothing will be wanting: it will furnish us with all that 
 is necessary for our Christian race and warfare, and will enable us to 
 persevere to the end, and then its work will be ended, and crowned with 
 glory. After we have abounded in other graces, we <I>have need of 
 patience,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:36">Heb. x. 36</A>.

 But <I>let patience have its perfect work, and we shall be perfect and
 entire, wanting nothing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Prayer is a duty recommended also to suffering Christians; and here 
 the apostle shows, 

 (1.) What we ought more especially to pray for--wisdom: <I>If any lack 
 wisdom, let him ask of God.</I> We should not pray so much for the 
 removal of an affliction as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And 
 who is there that does not want wisdom under any great trials or 
 exercises to guide him in his judging of things, in the government of 
 his own spirit and temper, and in the management of his affairs? To be 
 wise in trying times is a special gift of God, and to him we must seek 
 for it. 

 (2.) In what way this is to be obtained--upon our petitioning or asking 
 for it. Let the foolish become beggars at the throne of grace, and they 
 are in a fair way to be wise. It is not said, "Let such ask of man," 
 no, not of any man, but, "Let him ask of God," who made him, and gave 
 him his understanding and reasonable powers at first, of him in whom 
 are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Let us confess our want
 of wisdom to God and daily ask it of him. 

 (3.) We have the greatest encouragement to do this: <I>he giveth to all 
 men liberally, and upbraideth not.</I> Yea, it is expressly promised 
 that <I>it shall be given,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Here is something in answer to every discouraging turn of the mind, 
 when we go to God, under a sense of our own weakness and folly, to ask 
 for wisdom. He to whom we are sent, we are sure, has it to give: and he 
 is of a giving disposition, inclined to bestow this upon those who ask. 
 Nor is there any fear of his favours being limited to some in this 
 case, so as to exclude others, or any humble petitioning soul; for 
 <I>he gives to all men.</I> If you should say you want a great deal of 
 wisdom, a small portion will not serve your turn, the apostle affirms, 
 he <I>gives liberally;</I> and lest you should be afraid of going to 
 him unseasonably, or being put to shame for your folly, it is added, he 
 <I>upbraideth not.</I> Ask when you will, and as often as you will, you 
 will meet with no upbraidings. And if, after all, any should say, "This 
 may be the case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed so well in my 
 seeking for wisdom as some others may," let such consider how 
 particular and express the promise is: <I>It shall be given him.</I> 
 Justly then must fools perish in their foolishness, if wisdom may be 
 had for asking, and they will not pray to God for it. But,

 (4.) There is one thing necessary to be observed in our asking, namely, 
 that we do it with a believing, steady mind: <I>Let him ask in faith, 
 nothing wavering,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The promise above is very sure, taking this proviso along with us; 
 wisdom shall be given to those who ask it of God, provided they believe 
 that God is able to make the simple wise, and is faithful to make good 
 his word to those who apply to him. This was the condition Christ 
 insisted on, in treating with those who came to him for healing: 
 <I>Believest thou that I am able to do this?</I> There must be <I>no 
 wavering,</I> no staggering at the promise of God through unbelief, or 
 through a sense of any disadvantages that lie on our own part. Here 
 therefore we see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That oneness, and sincerity of intention, and a steadiness of mind, 
 constitute another duty required under affliction: <I>He that wavereth 
 is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind, and tossed.</I> To be 
 sometimes lifted up by faith, and then thrown down again by distrust--to
 mount sometimes towards the heavens, with an intention to secure glory, 
 and honour, and immortality, and then to sink again in seeking the ease 
 of the body, or the enjoyments of this world--this is very fitly and
 elegantly compared to a wave of the sea, that rises and falls, swells 
 and sinks, just as the wind tosses it higher or lower, that way or 
 this. A mind that has but one single and prevailing regard to its 
 spiritual and eternal interest, and that keeps steady in its purposes 
 for God, will grow wise by afflictions, will continue fervent in its 
 devotions, and will be superior to all trials and oppositions. Now, for 
 the cure of a wavering spirit and a weak faith, the apostle shows the 
 ill effects of these, 

 (1.) In that the success of prayer is spoiled hereby: <I>Let not that 
 man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Such a distrustful, shifting, unsettled person is not likely to value a 
 favour from God as he should do, and therefore cannot expect to receive 
 it. In asking for divine and heavenly wisdom we are never likely to 
 prevail if we have not a heart to prize it above rubies, and the 
 greatest things in this world.

 (2.) A wavering faith and spirit has a bad influence upon our 
 conversations. <I>A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there will 
 be great unsteadiness in all our conversation and actions. This may
 sometimes expose men to contempt in the world; but it is certain that 
 such ways cannot please God nor procure any good for us in the end. 
 While we have but one God to trust to, we have but one God to be 
 governed by, and this should keep us even and steady. He that is 
 unstable as water shall not excel. Hereupon,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The holy humble temper of a Christian, both in advancement and 
 debasement, is described: and both poor and rich are directed on what 
 grounds to build their joy and comfort, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.
 
 Here we may observe,
 
 1. Those of low degree are to be looked upon as brethren: <I>Let the 
 brother of low degree,</I> &c. Poverty does not destroy the relation 
 among Christians. 
 
 2. Good Christians may be rich in the world,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Grace and wealth are not wholly inconsistent. Abraham, the father of 
 the faithful, was rich in silver and gold. 

 3. Both these are allowed to rejoice. No condition of lie puts us out
 of a capacity of rejoicing in God. If we do not rejoice in him always, 
 it is our own fault. Those of low degree may rejoice, if they are 
 exalted to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of God (as Dr. 
 Whitby explains this place); and the rich may rejoice in humbling 
 providences, as they produce a lowly and humble disposition of mind, 
 which is highly valuable in the sight of God. Where any are made poor 
 for righteousness' sake, their very poverty is their exaltation. It is 
 an honour to be dishonoured for the sake of Christ. <I>To you it is 
 given to suffer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:29">Phil. i. 29</A>.

 All who are brought low, and made lowly by grace, may rejoice in the
 prospect of their exaltation at the last in heaven.

 4. Observe what reason rich people have, notwithstanding their riches, 
 to be humble and low in their own eyes, because both they and their 
 riches are passing away: <I>As the flower of the grass he shall pass 
 away.</I> He, and his wealth with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 <I>For the sun has no sooner risen with a burning heat than it 
 withereth the grass.</I> Note hence, Worldly wealth is a withering 
 thing. Riches are too uncertain (says Mr. Baxter on this place), too 
 inconsiderable things to make any great or just alteration in our 
 minds. As a flower fades before the heat of the scorching sun, <I>so 
 shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</I> His projects, counsels, 
 and managements for this world, are called his <I>ways;</I> in these he 
 shall <I>fade away.</I> For this reason let him that is rich rejoice, 
 not so much in the providence of God, that makes him rich, as in the 
 grace of God, that makes and keeps him humble; and in those trials and 
 exercises that teach him to seek his felicity in and from God, and not 
 from these perishing enjoyments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A blessing is pronounced on those who endure their exercises and 
 trials, as here directed: <I>Blessed is the man that endureth 
 temptation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. It is not the man who suffers only that is blessed, but he who 
 endures, who with patience and constancy goes through all difficulties 
 in the way of his duty. 

 2. Afflictions cannot make us miserable, if it be not our own fault. A
 blessing may arise from them, and we may be blessed in them. They are 
 so far from taking away a good man's felicity that they really increase 
 it. 

 3. Sufferings and temptations are the way to eternal blessedness:
 <I>When he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life,</I> 
 <B><I>dokimos genomenos</I></B>--<I>when he is approved,</I> when his 
 graces are found to be true and of the highest worth (so metals are 
 tried as to their excellency by the fire), and when his integrity is 
 manifested, and all is approved of the great Judge. Note hence, To be 
 approved of God is the great aim of a Christian in all his trials; and 
 it will be his blessedness at last, when he shall receive the crown of 
 life. The tried Christian shall be a crowned one: and the crown he 
 shall wear will be a crown of life. It will be life and bliss to him, 
 and will last for ever. We only bear the cross for a while, but we
 shall wear the crown to eternity. 

 4. This blessedness, involved in a crown of life, is a promised thing 
 to the righteous sufferer. It is therefore what we may most surely 
 depend upon: for, when heaven and earth shall pass away, this word of 
 God shall not fail of being fulfilled. But withal let us take notice 
 that our future reward comes, not as a debt, but by a gracious promise. 
 
 5. Our enduring temptations must be from a principle of love to God
 and to our Lord Jesus Christ, otherwise we are not interested in this 
 promise: <I>The Lord hath promised to those that love him.</I> Paul 
 supposes that a man may for some point of religion even give <I>his 
 body to be burnt,</I> and yet not be pleasing to God, nor regarded by 
 him, because of his want of charity, or a prevailing sincere love to 
 God and man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:3">1 Cor. xiii. 3</A>.

 6. The crown of life is promised not only to great and eminent saints,
 but to all those who have the love of God reigning in their hearts. 
 Every soul that truly loves God shall have its trials in this world 
 fully recompensed in that world above <I>where love is made 
 perfect.</I></P>

 lust, and enticed.
 &nbsp; 15  Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and
 sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
 &nbsp; 16  Do not err, my beloved brethren.
 &nbsp; 17  Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and
 cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
 variableness, neither shadow of turning.
 &nbsp; 18  Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
 should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are here taught that God is not the author of any man's sin. 
 Whoever they are who raise persecutions against men, and whatever 
 injustice and sin they may be guilty of in proceeding against them, God 
 is not to be charged with it. And, whatever sins good men may 
 themselves be provoked to by their exercises and afflictions, God is 
 not the cause of them. It seems to be here supposed that some 
 professors might fall in the hour of temptation, that the rod resting 
 upon them might carry some into ill courses, and make them put forth 
 their hands unto iniquity. But though this should be the case, and 
 though such delinquents should attempt to lay their fault on God, yet 
 the blame of their misconduct must lie entirely upon themselves. For, 
 
 1. There is nothing in the nature of God that they can lay the blame
 upon: <I>Let no man say, when he is tempted</I> to take any evil 
 course, or do any evil thing, <I>I am tempted of God; for God cannot be 
 tempted with evil.</I> All moral evil is owing to some disorder in the 
 being that is chargeable with it, to a want of wisdom, or of power, or 
 of decorum and purity in the will. But who can impeach the holy God 
 with the want of these, which are his very essence? No exigence of 
 affairs can ever tempt him to dishonour or deny himself, and therefore 
 he cannot be tempted with evil. 

 2. There is nothing in the providential dispensations of God that the
 blame of any man's sin can be laid upon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Neither tempteth he any man.</I> As God cannot be tempted with evil 
 himself, so neither can he be a tempter of others. He cannot be a 
 promoter of what is repugnant to his nature. The carnal mind is willing 
 to charge its own sins on God. There is something hereditary in this. 
 Our first father Adam tells God, <I>The woman thou gavest me</I> 
 tempted me, thereby, in effect, throwing the blame upon God, for giving 
 him the tempter. Let no man speak thus. It is very bad to sin; but is 
 much worse, when we have done amiss, to charge it upon God, and say it 
 was owing to him. Those who lay the blame of their sins either upon 
 their constitution or upon their condition in the world, or who pretend 
 they are under a fatal necessity of sinning, wrong God, as if he were 
 the author of sin. Afflictions, as sent by God, are designed to draw 
 out our graces, but not our corruptions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are taught where the true cause of evil lies, and where the
 blame ought to be laid 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Every man is tempted</I> (in an ill sense) <I>when he is drawn away
 of his own lust, and enticed.</I> In other scriptures the devil is 
 called <I>the tempter,</I> and other things may sometimes concur to 
 tempt us; but neither the devil nor any other person or thing is to be 
 blamed so as to excuse ourselves; for the true original of evil and 
 temptation is in our own hearts. The combustible matter is in us, 
 though the flame may be blown up by some outward causes. And therefore, 
 <I>if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:12">Prov. ix. 12</A>.
 
 Observe here, 

 1. The method of sin in its proceeding. First it draws away, then 
 entices. As holiness consists of two parts--forsaking that which is 
 evil and cleaving to that which is good, so these two things, reversed, 
 are the two parts of sin. The heart is carried from that which is good, 
 and enticed to cleave to that which is evil. It is first by corrupt 
 inclinations, or by lusting after and coveting some sensual or worldly 
 thing, estranged from the life of God, and then by degrees fixed in a 
 course of sin. 

 2. We may observe hence the power and policy of sin. The word here
 rendered <I>drawn away</I> signifies a being forcibly haled or 
 compelled. The word translated <I>enticed</I> signifies being wheedled 
 and beguiled by allurements and deceitful representations of things, 
 <B><I>exelkomenos kai deleazomenos.</I></B> There is a great deal of 
 violence done to conscience and to the mind by the power of corruption: 
 and there is a great deal of cunning and deceit and flattery in sin to 
 gain us to its interests. The force and power of sin could never 
 prevail, were it not for its cunning and guile. Sinners who perish are
 wheedled and flattered to their own destruction. And this will justify 
 God for ever in their damnation, that they destroyed themselves. Their 
 sin lies at their own door, and therefore their blood will lie upon 
 their own heads. 
 
 3. The success of corruption in the heart

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Then, when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin;</I> that is, 
 sin being allowed to excite desires in us, it will soon ripen those
 desires into consent, and then it is said to have <I>conceived.</I> The
 sin truly exists, though it be but in embryo. And, when it has grown
 to its full size in the mind, it is then brought forth in actual
 execution. Stop the beginnings of sin therefore, or else all the evils
 it produces must be wholly charged upon us.

 4. The final issue of sin, and how it ends: <I>Sin, when it is
 finished, bringeth forth death.</I> After sin is brought forth in
 actual commissions, the <I>finishing of it</I> (as Dr. Manton
 observes) is its being strengthened by frequent acts and settled into a 
 habit. And, when the iniquities of men are thus filled up, death is 
 brought forth. There is a death upon the soul, and death comes upon
 the body. And, besides death spiritual and temporal, the wages of sin 
 is eternal death too. Let sin therefore be repented of and forsaken, 
 before it be finished. <I>Why will you die, O house of Israel!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:11">Ezek. xxxiii. 11</A>.

 God has no pleasure in your death, as he has no hand in your sin; but
 both sin and misery are owing to yourselves. Your own hearts' lusts and 
 corruptions are your tempters; and when by degrees they have carried 
 you off from God, and finished the power and dominion of sin in you, 
 then they will prove your destroyers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are taught yet further that, while we are the authors and 
 procurers of all sin and misery to ourselves, <I>God is the Father and 
 fountain of all good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 We should take particular care not to err in our conceptions of God: 
 "<I>Do not err, my beloved brethren,</I> <B><I>me 
 lanasthe</I></B>--<I>do not wander,</I> that is, from the word of God, 
 and the accounts of him you have there. Do not stray into erroneous 
 opinions, and go off from the standard of truth, the things which you 
 have received from the Lord Jesus and by the direction of his Spirit." 
 The loose opinions of Sinon, and the Nicolaitans (from whom the 
 Gnostics, a most sensual corrupt set of people, arose afterwards), may 
 perhaps, by the apostle here, be more especially cautioned against. 
 Those who are disposed to look into these may consult the first book of 
 Iren&aelig;us against heresies. Let corrupt men run into what notions 
 they will, the truth, as it is in Jesus, stands thus: That God is not, 
 cannot be, the author and patronizer of any thing that is evil; but 
 must be acknowledged as the cause and spring of every thing that is 
 good: <I>Every good and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh 
 down from the Father of lights,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 1. God is the Father of lights. The visible light of the sun and the 
 heavenly bodies is from him. He said, <I>Let there be light, and there 
 was light.</I> Thus God is at once represented as the Creator of the 
 sun and in some respects compared to it. "As the sun is the same in its 
 nature and influences, though the earth and clouds, oft interposing, 
 make it seem to us as varying, by its rising and setting, and by its 
 different appearances, or entire withdrawment, when the change is not 
 in it; so God is unchangeable, and our changes and shadows are not from 
 any mutability or shadowy alterations in him, but from 
 ourselves."--<I>Baxter.</I> The Father of lights, <I>with whom there is 
 no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</I> What the sun is in 
 nature, God is in grace, providence, and glory; aye, and infinitely 
 more. For, 

 2. Every good gift is from him. As the Father of lights, he gives the
 light of reason. <I>The inspiration of the Almighty giveth 
 understanding,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:8">Job xxxii. 8</A>.

 He gives also the light of learning: Solomon's wisdom in the knowledge
 of nature, in the arts of government, and in all his improvements, is 
 ascribed to God. The light of divine revelation is more immediately 
 from above. The light of faith, purity, and all manner of consolation 
 is from him. So that we have nothing good but what we receive from God, 
 as there is no evil or sin in us, or done by us, but what is owing to 
 ourselves. We must own God as the author of all the powers and 
 perfections that are in the creature, and the giver of all the benefits 
 which we have in and by those powers and perfections: but none of their 
 darknesses, their imperfections, or their ill actions are to be charged 
 on the Father of lights; from him proceeds every good and perfect gift, 
 both pertaining to this life and that which is to come.

 3. As every good gift is from God, so particularly the renovation of
 our natures, our regeneration, and all the holy happy consequences of 
 it, must be ascribed to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth.</I> Here let us 
 take notice, 

 (1.) A true Christian is a creature begotten anew. He becomes as
 different a person from what he was before the renewing influences of 
 divine grace as if he were formed over again, and born afresh. 

 (2.) The original of this good work is here declared: it is of God's 
 own will; not by our skill or power; not from any good foreseen in us, 
 or done by us, but purely from the good-will and grace of God.

 (3.) The means whereby this is affected are pointed out: <I>the word of 
 truth,</I> that is, the gospel, as Paul expresses it more plainly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:15">1 Cor. iv. 15</A>,

 <I>I have begotten you in Jesus Christ through the gospel.</I> This
 gospel is indeed a word of truth, or else it could never produce such
 real, such lasting, such great and noble effects. We may rely upon it, 
 and venture our immortal souls upon it. And we shall find it a means of 
 our sanctification as it is a word of truth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:17">John xvii. 17</A>.

 (4.) The end and design of God's giving renewing grace is here laid
 down: <I>That we should be a kind of first-fruits of his 
 creatures</I>--that we should be God's portion and treasure, and a more 
 peculiar property to him, as the first-fruits were; and that we should 
 become holy to the Lord, as the first-fruits were consecrated to him.
 Christ is the first-fruits of Christians, Christians are the 
 first-fruits of creatures.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to
 hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
 &nbsp; 20  For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
 &nbsp; 21  Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
 naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which
 is able to save your souls.
 &nbsp; 22  But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving

 &nbsp; 23  For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is
 like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this part of the chapter we are required,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To restrain the workings of passion. This lesson we should learn 
 under afflictions; and this we shall learn if we are indeed begotten 
 again by the word of truth. For thus the connection stands--An angry and
 hasty spirit is soon provoked to ill things by afflictions, and errors 
 and ill opinions become prevalent through the workings of our own vile 
 and vain affections; but the renewing grace of God and the word of the 
 gospel teach us to subdue these: <I>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let 
 every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 This may refer, 
 
 1. To the word of truth spoken of in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:18">verse foregoing</A>.

 And so we may observe, It is our duty rather to hear God's word, and
 apply our minds to understand it, than to speak according to our own 
 fancies or the opinions of men, and to run into heat and passion 
 thereupon. Let not such errors as that of God's being the occasion of 
 men's sin ever be hastily, much less angrily, mentioned by you (and so 
 as to other errors); but be ready to hear and consider what God's word 
 teaches in all such cases. 

 2. This may be applied to the afflictions and temptations spoken of in
 the beginning of the chapter. And then we may observe, It is our duty
 rather to hear how God explains his providences, and what he designs by 
 them, than to say as David did in his haste, <I>I am cut off;</I> or as
 Jonah did in his passion, I do well to be angry. Instead of censuring 
 God under our trials, let us open our ears and hearts to hear what he 
 will say to us. 

 3. This may be understood as referring to the disputes and differences
 that Christians, in those times of trial, were running into among 
 themselves: and so this part of the chapter may be considered without 
 any connection with what goes before. Here we may observe that, 
 whenever matters of difference arise among Christians, each side should 
 be willing to hear the other. People are often stiff in their own 
 opinions because they are not willing to hear what others have to offer 
 against them: whereas we should be swift to hear reason and truth on 
 all sides, and be slow to speak any thing that should prevent this: 
 and, when we do speak, there should be nothing of wrath; for a soft 
 answer turneth away wrath. As this epistle is designed to correct a 
 variety of disorders that existed among Christians, these words, 
 <I>swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath,</I> may be very well 
 interpreted according to this last explication. And we may further 
 observe from them that, if men would govern their tongues, they must 
 govern their passions. When Moses's spirit was provoked, <I>he spoke 
 unadvisedly with his lips.</I> If we would be slow to speak, we must be 
 slow to wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A very good reason is given for suppressing: <I>For the wrath of 
 man worketh not the righteousness of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 It is as if the apostle had said, "Whereas men often pretend zeal for 
 God and his glory, in their heat and passion, let them know that God 
 needs not the passions of any man; his cause is better served by 
 mildness and meekness than by wrath and fury." Solomon says, <I>The 
 words of the wise are heard in quiet, more than the cry of him that 
 ruleth among fools,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:17">Eccl. ix. 17</A>.

 Dr. Manton here says of some assemblies, "That if we were as swift to
 hear as we are ready to speak there would be less of wrath, and more of 
 profit, in our meetings. I remember when a Manichee contested with 
 Augustine, and with importunate clamour cried, <I>Hear me! hear me!</I> 
 the father modestly replied, <I>Nec ego te, nec tu me, sed ambo 
 audiamus apostolum--Neither let me hear thee, nor do thou hear me, but
 let us both hear the apostle.</I>" The worst thing we can bring to a 
 religious controversy is anger. This, however it may pretend to be
 raised by a concern for what is just and right, is not to be trusted. 
 <I>Wrath</I> is a human thing, and the wrath of man stands opposed to 
 the righteousness of God. Those who pretend to serve the cause of God 
 hereby show that they are acquainted neither with God or his cause. 
 This passion must especially be watched against when we are hearing the 
 word of God. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:1,2">1 Pet. ii. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are called upon to suppress other corrupt affections, as well 
 as rash anger: <I>Lay aside all filthiness and superfluity of 
 naughtiness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The word here translated <I>filthiness</I> signifies those lusts which 
 have the greatest turpitude and sensuality in them; and the words 
 rendered <I>superfluity of naughtiness</I> may be understood of the 
 overflowings of malice or any other spiritual wickednesses. Hereby we 
 are taught, as Christians, to watch against, and lay aside, not only 
 those more gross and fleshly dispositions and affections which 
 denominate a person filthy, but all the disorders of a corrupt heart, 
 which would prejudice it against the word and ways of God. Observe, 

 1. Sin is a defiling thing; it is called filthiness itself.

 2. There is abundance of that which is evil in us, to be watched
 against; there is <I>superfluity of naughtiness.</I> 

 3. It is not enough to restrain evil affections, but <I>they must be
 cast from us, or laid apart.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:22">Isa. xxx. 22</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say, Get
 you hence.</I> 

 4. This must extend not only to outward sins, and greater abominations, 
 but to all sin of thought and affection as well as speech and practice; 
 <B><I>pasan rhyparian</I></B>--<I>all filthiness,</I> every thing that 
 is corrupt and sinful. 

 5. Observe, from the foregoing parts of this chapter, the laying aside
 of all filthiness is what a time of temptation and affliction calls 
 for, and is necessary to the avoiding of error, and the right receiving 
 and improving of the word of truth: for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We are here fully, though briefly, instructed concerning hearing 
 the word of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We are required to prepare ourselves for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 to get rid of every corrupt affection and of every prejudice and 
 prepossession, and to lay aside those sins which pervert the judgment 
 and blind the mind. <I>All the filthiness and superfluity of
 naughtiness,</I> before explained, must, in an especial manner, be 
 subdued and cast off, by all such as attend on the word of the 
 gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We are directed how to hear it: <I>Receive with meekness the 
 engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</I> 

 (1.) In hearing the word of God, we are to receive it--assent to the 
 truths of it--consent to the laws of it; receive it as the stock does 
 the graft; so as that the fruit which is produced may be, not according 
 to the nature of the sour stock, but according to the nature of that 
 word of the gospel which is engrafted into our souls. 

 (2.) We must therefore yield ourselves to the word of God, with most 
 submissive, humble, and tractable tempers: this is to <I>receive it 
 with meekness.</I> Being willing to hear of our faults, and taking it 
 not only patiently, but thankfully, desiring also to be molded and 
 formed by the doctrines and precepts of the gospel. 

 (3.) In all our hearing we should aim at the salvation of our souls. It 
 is the design of the word of God to make us wise to salvation; and 
 those who propose any meaner or lower ends to themselves in attending 
 upon it dishonour the gospel and disappoint their souls. We should come 
 to the word of God (both to read it and hear it), as those who know it 
 is <I>the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:16">Rom. i. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We are taught what is to be done after hearing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>But be you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your 
 own selves.</I> Observe here, 

 (1.) Hearing is in order to doing; the most attentive and the most 
 frequent hearing of the word of God will not avail us, unless we be 
 also doers of it. If we were to hear a sermon every day of the week, 
 and an angel from heaven were the preacher, yet, if we rested in bare 
 hearing, it would never bring us to heaven. Therefore the apostle
 insists much upon it (and, without doubt, it is indispensably 
 necessary) that we practice what we hear. "There must be inward
 practice by meditation, and outward practice in true obedience." 
 <I>Baxter.</I> It is not enough to remember what we hear, and to be 
 able to repeat it, and to give testimony to it, and commend it, and 
 write it, and preserve what we have written; that which all this is in 
 order to, and which crowns the rest, is that we be doers of the word.
 Observe, 

 (2.) Bare hearers are self-deceivers; the original word, 
 <B><I>paralogizomenoi,</I></B> signifies men's arguing sophistically to 
 themselves; their reasoning is manifestly deceitful and false when they 
 would make one part of their work discharge them from the obligation 
 they lie under to another, or persuade themselves that filling their 
 heads with notions is sufficient, though their hearts be empty of good 
 affections and resolutions, and their lives fruitless of good works.
 Self-deceit will be found the worst deceit at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The apostle shows what is the proper use of the word of God, who
 they are that do not use it as they ought, and who they are that do 
 make a right use of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:23-25"><I>v.</I> 23-25</A>.

 Let us consider each of these distinctly. 

 (1.) The use we are to make of God's word may be learnt from its being 
 compared to a glass, in which a man may <I>behold his natural face.</I> 
 As a looking-glass shows us the spots and defilements upon our faces, 
 that they may be remedied and washed off, so the word of God shows us 
 our sins, that we may repent of them and get them pardoned; it shows us 
 what is amiss, that it may be amended. There are glasses that will 
 flatter people; but that which is truly the word of God is no 
 flattering glass. If you flatter yourselves, it is your own fault; 
 <I>the truth, as it is in Jesus,</I> flatters no man. Let the word of 
 truth be carefully attended to, and it will set before you the 
 corruption of your nature, the disorders of your hearts and lives; it 
 will tell you plainly what you are. Paul describes himself as insensible 
 of the corruption of his nature till he saw himself in the
 glass of the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:9">Rom. vii. 9</A>):

 "<I>I was alive without the law;</I> that is, I took all to be right 
 with me, and thought myself not only clean, but, compared with the 
 generality of the world, beautiful too; <I>but when the commandment 
 came,</I> when the glass of the law was set before me, <I>then sin 
 revived, and I died</I>--then I saw my spots and deformities, and 
 discovered that amiss in myself which before I was not aware of; and 
 such was the power of the law, and of sin, that I then perceived myself 
 in a state of death and condemnation." Thus, when we attend to <I>the 
 word of God,</I> so as to see ourselves, our true state and condition, 
 to rectify what is amiss, and to form and dress ourselves anew by the 
 glass of God's word, this is to make a proper use of it. 

 (2.) We have here an account of those who do not use this glass of the 
 word as they ought: <I>He that beholds himself, and goes his way, and 
 straightway forgets what manner of man he was,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 This is the true description of one who hears the word of God and does 
 it not. How many are there who, when they sit under the word, are 
 affected with their own sinfulness, misery, and danger, acknowledge the 
 evil of sin, and their need of Christ; but, when their hearing is over, 
 all is forgotten, convictions are lost, good affections vanish, and 
 pass away like the waters of a land-flood: he <I>straightway 
 forgets.</I> "The word of God (as Dr. Manton speaks) discovers how we 
 may do away our sins, and deck and attire our souls with the 
 righteousness of Jesus Christ. <I>Macul&aelig; sunt peccata, qu&aelig; 
 ostendit lex; aqua est sanguis Christi, quem ostendit evangelium--Our 
 sins are the spots which the law discovers; Christ's blood is the laver 
 which the gospel shows.</I>" But in vain do we hear God's word, and 
 look into the gospel glass, if we go away, and forget our spots, 
 instead of washing them off, and forget our remedy, instead of applying 
 to it. This is the case of those who do not hear the word as they 
 ought.

 (3.) Those also are described, and pronounced blessed, who hear aright, 
 and who use the glass of God's word as they should do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth 
 therein,</I> &c. Observe here,

 [1.] The gospel is a law of liberty, or, as Mr. Baxter expresses it,
 <I>of liberation,</I> giving us deliverance from the Jewish law, and 
 from sin and guilt, and wrath and death. The ceremonial law was a yoke 
 of bondage; the gospel of Christ is a law of liberty. 

 [2.] It is a perfect law; nothing can be added to it. 

 [3.] In hearing the word, we look into this perfect law; we consult it 
 for counsel and direction; we look into it, that we may thence take our 
 measures. 

 [4.] Then only do we look into the law of liberty as we should when we 
 <I>continue therein</I>--"when we dwell in the study of it, till it 
 turn to a spiritual life, engrafted and digested in us" 
 (<I>Baxter</I>)--when we are not forgetful of it, but practice it as 
 our work and business, set it always before our eyes, and make it the 
 constant rule of our conversation and behaviour, and model the temper 
 of our minds by it.

 [5.] Those who thus do, and <I>continue in the law and word of God,</I> 
 are, and <I>shall be, blessed in their deed; blessed in all their 
 ways,</I> according to the first psalm, to which, some think, James 
 here alludes. <I>He that meditates in the law of God, and walks 
 according to it,</I> the psalmist says, <I>shall prosper in whatsoever 
 he does.</I> And <I>he that is not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of 
 the work</I> which God's word sets him about, James says, <I>shall be 
 blessed.</I> The papists pretend that here we have a clear text to 
 prove we are blessed for our good deeds; but Dr. Manton, in answer to 
 that pretence, puts the reader upon marking the distinctness of 
 scripture-phrase. The apostle does not say, <I>for</I> his deeds, that 
 any man is blessed, but <I>in</I> his deed. This is a way in which we 
 shall certainly find blessedness, but not the cause of it. This 
 blessedness does not lie in knowing, but in doing the will of God.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=joh+13:17">John xiii. 17</A>,

 <I>If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.</I> It is
 not talking, but walking, that will bring us to heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The apostle next informs us how we may distinguish between a vain 
 religion and that which is pure and approved of God. Great and hot 
 disputes there are in the world about this matter: what religion is 
 false and vain, and what is true and pure. I wish men would agree to 
 let the holy scripture in this place determine the question: and here 
 it is plainly and peremptorily declared,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What is a vain religion: <I>If any man among you seemeth to be 
 religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, 
 this man's religion is vain.</I> Here are three things to be 
 observed:--

 (1.) In a vain religion there is much of show, and affecting to seem
 religious in the eyes of others. This, I think, is mentioned in a 
 manner that should fix our thoughts on the word <I>seemeth.</I> When 
 men are more concerned to seem religious than really to be so, it is a 
 sign that their religion is but vain. Not that <I>religion</I> itself 
 is a vain thing (those do it a great deal of injustice who say, <I>It 
 is in vain to serve the Lord</I>), but it is possible for people to 
 make it a vain thing, if they have only a form of godliness, and not 
 the power. 

 (2.) In a vain religion there is much censuring, reviling, and 
 detracting of others. The not bridling the tongue here is chiefly meant 
 of not abstaining from these evils of the tongue. When we hear people 
 ready to speak of the faults of others, or to censure them as holding 
 scandalous errors, or to lessen the wisdom and piety of those about 
 them, that they themselves may seem the wiser and better, this is a 
 sign that they have but a vain religion. The man who has a detracting 
 tongue cannot have a truly humble gracious heart. He who delights to 
 injure his neighbour in vain pretends to love God; therefore a reviling 
 tongue will prove a man a hypocrite. Censuring is a pleasing sin, 
 extremely complaint with nature, and therefore evinces a man's being in 
 a natural state. These sins of the tongue were the great sins of that 
 age in which James wrote (as other parts of this epistle fully show); 
 and it is a strong sing of a vain religion (says Dr. Manton) to be 
 carried away with the evil of the times. This has ever been a leading 
 sin with hypocrites, that the more ambitious they have been to seem 
 well themselves the more free they have been in censuring and running 
 down others; and there is such quick intercourse between the tongue and 
 the heart that the one may be known by the other. On these accounts it 
 is that the apostle has made an ungoverned tongue an undoubted certain 
 proof of a vain religion. There is no strength nor power in that 
 religion which will not enable a man to bridle his tongue. 

 (3.) In a vain religion a man deceives his own heart; he goes on in 
 such a course of detracting from others, and making himself seem 
 somebody, that at last the vanity of his religion is consummated by the 
 deceiving of his own soul. When once religion comes to be a vain thing, 
 how great is the vanity!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is here plainly and peremptorily declared wherein true religion 
 consists: <I>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is 
 this,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Observe,

 (1.) It is the glory of religion to be pure and undefiled; not mixed 
 with the inventions of men nor with the corruption of the world. False 
 religions may be known by their impurity and uncharitableness; 
 according to that of John, <I>He that doeth not righteousness</I> is 
 not of God neither he that <I>loveth not his brother,</I> 1

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:10">John iii. 10</A>.

 But, on the other hand, a holy life and a charitable heart show a true
 religion. Our religion is not (says Dr. Manton) adorned with
 ceremonies, but purity and charity. And it is a good observation of his 
 that a religion which is pure should be kept undefiled. 

 (2.) That religion is pure and undefiled which is so before God and the 
 Father. That is right which is so in God's eye, and which chiefly aims
 at his approbation. True religion teaches us to do every thing as in 
 the presence of God; and to seek his favour, and study to please him in 
 all our actions. 

 (3.) Compassion and charity to the poor and distressed from a very 
 great and necessary part of true religion: <I>Visiting the fatherless 
 and widow in their affliction.</I> Visiting is here put for all manner 
 of relief which we are capable of giving to others; and fatherless and 
 widows are here particularly mentioned, because they are generally most 
 apt to be neglected or oppressed: but by them we are to understand all 
 who are proper objects of charity, all who are in affliction. It is 
 very remarkable that if the sum of religion be drawn up to two articles 
 this is one--to be charitable and relieve the afflicted. Observe, 

 (4.) An unspotted life must accompany an unfeigned love and charity: 
 <I>To keep himself unspotted from the world.</I> The world is apt to 
 spot and blemish the soul, and it is hard to live in it, and have to do 
 with it, and not be defiled; but this must be our constant endeavour. 
 Herein consists pure and undefiled religion. The very things of the 
 world too much taint our spirits, if we are much conversant with them; 
 but the sins and lusts of the world deface and defile them very 
 woefully indeed. John comprises <I>all that is in the world,</I> which 
 we are not to love, under three heads: <I>the lust of the flesh, the 
 lust of the eyes, and the pride of life;</I> and to keep ourselves 
 unspotted from all these is to keep ourselves unspotted from the world. 
 May God by his grace keep both our hearts and lives clean from the love 
 of the world, and from the temptations of wicked worldly men.</P>
