 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter the apostle goes on with his discourse, in opposition 
 to the false apostles, who were very industrious to lessen his interest 
 and reputation among the Corinthians, and had prevailed too much by 
 their insinuations. I. He apologizes for going about to commend 
 himself, and gives the reason for what he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. He mentions, in his own necessary vindication, his equality with
 the other apostles, and with the false apostles in this particular of 
 preaching the gospel to the Corinthians freely, without wages, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:5-15">ver. 5-15</A>.

 III. He makes another preface to what he was about further to say in
 his own justification, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:16-21">ver. 16-21</A>.
 
 And, 

 IV. He gives a large account of his qualifications, labours, and 
 sufferings, in which he exceeded the false apostles, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:22-33">ver. 22, to the end</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Would to God ye could bear with me a little in <I>my</I> folly:
 and indeed bear with me.
 &nbsp; 2  For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have
 espoused you to one husband, that I may present <I>you as</I> a chaste
 virgin to Christ.
 &nbsp; 3  But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
 through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the
 simplicity that is in Christ.
 &nbsp; 4  For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have
 not preached, or <I>if</I> ye receive another spirit, which ye have
 not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye
 might well bear with <I>him.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we may observe, 

 1. The apology the apostle makes for going about to commend himself. He
 is loth to enter upon this subject of self-commendation: <I>Would to 
 God you could bear with me a little in my folly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He calls this folly, because too often it is really no better. In his 
 case it was necessary; yet, seeing others might apprehend it to be 
 folly in him, he desires them to bear with it. Note, As much against 
 the grain as it is with a proud man to acknowledge his infirmities, so 
 much is it against the grain with a humble man to speak in his own 
 praise. It is no pleasure to a good man to speak well of himself, yet 
 in some cases it is lawful, namely, when it is for the advantage of 
 others, or for our own necessary vindication; as thus it was here. For, 
 
 2. We have the reasons for what the apostle did.

 (1.) To preserve the Corinthians from being corrupted by the 
 insinuations of the false apostles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 He tells them <I>he was jealous over them with godly jealousy;</I> he 
 was afraid lest their faith should be weakened by hearkening to such 
 suggestions as tended to lessen their regard to his ministry, by which 
 they were brought to the Christian faith. He had <I>espoused them to 
 one husband,</I> that is, converted them to Christianity (and the 
 conversion of a soul is its marriage to the Lord Jesus); and he was 
 desirous to <I>present them as a chaste virgin</I>--pure, and spotless,
 and faithful, not having <I>their minds corrupted</I> with false 
 doctrines by false teachers, as <I>Eve was beguiled by the subtlety of 
 the serpent.</I> This godly jealousy in the apostle was a mixture of 
 love and fear; and faithful ministers cannot but be afraid and 
 concerned for their people, lest they should lose that which they have 
 received, and turn from what they have embraced, especially when 
 <I>deceivers have gone abroad,</I> or have <I>crept in among them.</I>

 (2.) To vindicate himself against the false apostles, forasmuch as they 
 could not pretend they had another Jesus, or another Spirit, or another 
 gospel, to preach to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 If this had been the case, there would have been some colour of reason 
 to bear with them, or to hearken to them. But seeing there is but one 
 Jesus, one Spirit, and one gospel, that is, or at least that ought to 
 be, preached to them and received by them, what reason could there be 
 why the Corinthians should be prejudiced against him, who first 
 converted them to the faith, by the artifices of any adversary? It was 
 a just occasion of jealousy that such persons designed to preach 
 another Jesus, another Spirit, and another gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest
 apostles.
 &nbsp; 6  But though <I>I be</I> rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but
 we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things.
 &nbsp; 7  Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might
 be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God
 freely?
 &nbsp; 8  I robbed other churches, taking wages <I>of them,</I> to do you
 service.
 &nbsp; 9  And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable
 to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which
 came from Macedonia supplied: and in all <I>things</I> I have kept
 myself from being burdensome unto you, and <I>so</I> will I keep
 <I>myself.</I>
 &nbsp; 10  As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of
 this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
 &nbsp; 11  Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
 &nbsp; 12  But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion
 from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they
 may be found even as we.
 &nbsp; 13  For such <I>are</I> false apostles, deceitful workers,
 transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
 &nbsp; 14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an
 angel of light.
 &nbsp; 15  Therefore <I>it is</I> no great thing if his ministers also be
 transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be
 according to their works.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the foregoing preface to what he was about to say, the apostle in 
 these verses mentions,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His equality with the other apostles--that <I>he was not a whit
 behind the very chief of the apostles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This he expresses very modestly: <I>I suppose so.</I> He might have 
 spoken very positively. The apostleship, as an office, was equal in
 all the apostles; but the apostles, like other Christians, differed one 
 from another. These <I>stars differed one from another in glory,</I> 
 and Paul was indeed of the first magnitude; yet he speaks modestly of 
 himself, and humbly owns his personal infirmity, that he was <I>rude in 
 speech,</I> had not such a graceful delivery as some others might have. 
 Some think that he was a man of very low stature, and that his voice 
 was proportionably small; others think that he may have had some 
 impediment in his speech, perhaps a stammering tongue. However, he was 
 not rude <I>in knowledge;</I> he was not unacquainted with the best 
 rules of oratory and the art of persuasion, much less was he ignorant 
 of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, as had been <I>thoroughly 
 manifested among them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His equality with the false apostles in this particular--the
 preaching of the gospel unto them freely, without wages. This the 
 apostle largely insists on, and shows that, as they could not but own 
 him to be a minister of Christ, so they ought to acknowledge he had 
 been a good friend to them. For, 

 1. He had preached the gospel to them freely,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:7-10"><I>v.</I> 7-10</A>.

 He had proved at large, in his former epistle to them, the lawfulness 
 of ministers' receiving maintenance from the people, and the duty of 
 the people to give them an honourable maintenance; and here he says he 
 himself had <I>taken wages of other churches</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 so that he had a right to have asked and received from them: yet he 
 waived his right, and chose rather to abase himself, by working with 
 his hands in the trade of tent-making to maintain himself, than be 
 burdensome to them, that they might <I>be exalted,</I> or encouraged to 
 receive the gospel, which they had so cheaply; yea, he chose rather to 
 be supplied from Macedonia than to be chargeable unto them. 

 2. He informs them of the reason of this his conduct among them. It was
 not because <I>he did not love them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 or was unwilling to receive tokens of their love (for love and
 friendship are manifested by mutual giving and receiving), but it was 
 to avoid offence, that <I>he might cut off occasion from those that 
 desired occasion.</I> He would not give occasion for any to accuse him 
 of worldly designs in preaching the gospel, or that he intended to make 
 a trade of it, to enrich himself; and that others who opposed him at 
 Corinth might not in this respect gain an advantage against him: that 
 wherein <I>they gloried,</I> as to this matter, <I>they might be found 
 even as he,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It is not improbable to suppose that the chief of the false teachers at 
 Corinth, or some among them, were rich, and taught (or deceived) the 
 people freely, and might accuse the apostle or his fellow-labourers as 
 mercenary men, who received hire or wages, and therefore the apostle 
 kept to his resolution not to be chargeable to any of the 
 Corinthians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The false apostles are charged <I>as deceitful workers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and that upon this account, because they would <I>transform 
 themselves</I> into the likeness of the apostles of Christ, and, though 
 they were the ministers of Satan, would seem to be the <I>ministers of 
 righteousness.</I> They would be as industrious and as generous in 
 promoting error as the apostles were in preaching truth; they would 
 endeavour as much to undermine the kingdom of Christ as the apostles 
 did to establish it. There were counterfeit prophets under the Old 
 Testament, who wore the garb and learned the language of the prophets 
 of the Lord. So there were counterfeit apostles under the New 
 Testament, who seemed in many respects like the true apostles of 
 Christ. And no marvel (says the apostle); hypocrisy is a thing not to 
 be much wondered at in this world, especially when we consider the 
 great influence Satan has upon the minds of many, who <I>rules in the 
 hearts of the children of disobedience.</I> As he can turn himself into 
 any shape, and put on almost any form, and look sometimes <I>like an 
 angel of light,</I> in order to promote his kingdom of darkness, so he 
 will teach his ministers and instruments to do the same. But it 
 follows, <I>Their end is according to their works</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 the end will discover them to be deceitful workers, and their work will 
 end in ruin and destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet
 as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
 &nbsp; 17  That which I speak, I speak <I>it</I> not after the Lord, but as
 it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
 &nbsp; 18  Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
 &nbsp; 19  For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye <I>yourselves</I> are wise.
 &nbsp; 20  For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man
 devour <I>you,</I> if a man take <I>of you,</I> if a man exalt himself, if
 a man smite you on the face.
 &nbsp; 21  I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
 Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold
 also.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have a further excuse that the apostle makes for what he was 
 about to say in his own vindication. 

 1. He would not have them think he was guilty of folly, in saying what
 he said to vindicate himself: <I>Let no man think me a fool,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Ordinarily, indeed, it is unbecoming a wise man to be much and often 
 speaking in his own praise. Boasting of ourselves is usually not only
 a sign of a proud mind, but a mark of folly also. However, says the 
 apostle, yet <I>as a fool receive me;</I> that is, if you count it 
 folly in me to <I>boast a little,</I> yet give due regard to what I 
 shall say. 

 2. He mentions a caution, to prevent the abuse of what he should say,
 telling them that what he spoke, <I>he did not speak after the 
 Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He would not have them think that boasting of ourselves, or glorying in 
 what we have, is a thing commanded by the Lord in general unto 
 Christians, nor yet that this is always necessary in our own 
 vindication; though it may be lawfully used, because not contrary to 
 the Lord, when, strictly speaking, it is not after the Lord. It is the 
 duty and practice of Christians, in obedience to the command and 
 example of the Lord, rather to humble and abase themselves; yet 
 prudence must direct in what circumstances it is needful to do that 
 which we may do lawfully, even speak of what God has wrought for us, 
 and in us, and by us too. 

 3. He gives a good reason why they should suffer him to boast a little;
 namely, because they suffered others to do so who had less reason.
 <I>Seeing many glory after the flesh</I> (of carnal privileges, or 
 outward advantages and attainments), <I>I will glory also,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 But he would not glory in those things, though he had as much or more 
 reason than others to do so. But he gloried in his infirmities, as he 
 tells them afterwards. The Corinthians thought themselves wise, and 
 might think it an instance of wisdom to bear with the weakness of 
 others, and therefore suffered others to do what might seem folly; 
 therefore the apostle would have them bear with him. Or these words, 
 <I>You suffer fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),
 
 may be ironical, and then the meaning is this: "Notwithstanding all 
 your wisdom, you willingly suffer yourselves to be <I>brought into 
 bondage</I> under the Jewish yoke, or suffer others to tyrannize over 
 you; nay, to <I>devour you,</I> or make a prey of you, and <I>take of 
 you</I> hire for their own advantage, and to <I>exalt themselves</I> 
 above you, and lord it over you; nay, even to <I>smite you on the 
 face,</I> or impose upon you to your very faces 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 upbraiding you while they reproach me, as if you had been very weak in 
 showing regard to me," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Seeing this was the case, that the Corinthians, or some among them, 
 could so easily bear all this from the false apostles, it was 
 reasonable for the apostle to desire, and expect, they should bear with 
 what might seem to them an indiscretion in him, seeing the 
 circumstances of the case were such as made it needful that 
 <I>whereinsoever any were bold</I> he should be <I>bold also,</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the apostle gives a large account of his own qualifications, 
 labours, and sufferings (not out of pride or vain-glory, but to the 
 honour of God, who had enabled him to do and suffer so much for the 
 cause of Christ), and wherein he excelled the false apostles, who would 
 lessen his character and usefulness among the Corinthians.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He mentions the privileges of his birth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 which were equal to any they could pretend to. He was a Hebrew of the 
 Hebrews; of a family among the Jews that never intermarried with the 
 Gentiles. He was also an Israelite, and could boast of his being 
 descended from the beloved Jacob as well as they, and was also of the 
 seed of Abraham, and not of the proselytes. It should seem from this 
 that the false apostles were of the Jewish race, who gave disturbance 
 to the Gentile converts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He makes mention also of his apostleship, that he was more than an 
 ordinary minister of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 God had counted him faithful, and had put him into the ministry. He had 
 been a useful minister of Christ unto them; they had found full proofs 
 of his ministry: <I>Are they ministers of Christ? I am more so.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He chiefly insists upon this, that he had been an extraordinary 
 sufferer for Christ; and this was what he gloried in, or rather he 
 gloried in the grace of God that had enabled him to be more <I>abundant 
 in labours,</I> and to endure very great sufferings, such as <I>stripes 
 above measure, frequent imprisonments,</I> and <I>often</I> the dangers 
 of <I>death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Note, When the apostle would prove himself an extraordinary minister, 
 he proves that he had been an extraordinary sufferer. Paul was the 
 apostle of the Gentiles, and for that reason was hated of the Jews. 
 They did all they could against him; and among the Gentiles also he met 
 with hard usage. Bonds and imprisonments were familiar to him; never 
 was the most notorious malefactor more frequently in the hands of 
 public justice than Paul was for righteousness' sake. The jail and the 
 whipping-post, and all other hard usages of those who are accounted the 
 worst of men, were what he was accustomed to. As to the Jews, whenever 
 he fell into their hands, they never spared him. <I>Five times</I> he 
 fell under their lash, and received <I>forty stripes save one,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 Forty stripes was the utmost their law allowed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:3">Deut. xxv. 3</A>),

 but it was usual with them, that they might not exceed, to abate one at 
 least of that number. And to have the abatement of one only was all the 
 favour that ever Paul received from them. The Gentiles were not tied up 
 to that moderation, and among them <I>he was thrice beaten with 
 rods,</I> of which we may suppose once was at Philippi, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:22">Acts xvi. 22</A>.
 
 <I>Once he was stoned</I> in a popular tumult, and was taken up for 
 dead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:19">Acts xiv. 19</A>.

 He says that <I>thrice he suffered shipwreck;</I> and we may believe
 him, though the sacred history gives a relation but of one. <I>A night 
 and a day he had been in the deep</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 in some deep dungeon or other, shut up as a prisoner. Thus he was all 
 his days a constant confessor; perhaps scarcely a year of his life, 
 after his conversion, passed without suffering some hardship or other 
 for his religion; yet this was not all, for, wherever he went, he went 
 in perils; he was exposed to perils of all sorts. If he journeyed by 
 land, or voyaged by sea, he was in perils of robbers, or enemies of 
 some sort; the Jews, his own countrymen, sought to kill him, or do him 
 a mischief; the heathen, to whom he was sent, were not more kind to 
 him, for among them he was in peril. If he was in the city, or in the 
 wilderness, still he was in peril. He was in peril not only among 
 avowed enemies, but among those also who called themselves brethren, 
 but were false brethren, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Besides all this, he had great weariness and painfulness in his 
 ministerial labours, and these are things that will come into account 
 shortly, and people will be reckoned with for all the care and pains of 
 their ministers concerning them. Paul was a stranger to wealth and
 plenty, power and pleasure, preferment and ease; he was in <I>watchings 
 often,</I> and exposed to <I>hunger and thirst;</I> in <I>fastings 
 often,</I> it may be out of necessity; and endured <I>cold and 
 nakedness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Thus was he, who was one of the greatest blessings of the age, used as 
 if he had been the burden of the earth, and the plague of his 
 generation. And yet this is not all; for, as an apostle, the <I>care of 
 all the churches</I> lay on him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 He mentions this last, as if this lay the heaviest upon him, and as if 
 he could better bear all the persecutions of his enemies than the 
 scandals that were to be found in the churches he had the oversight of. 
 <I>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 There was not a weak Christian with whom he did not sympathize, nor any 
 one scandalized, but he was affected therewith. See what little reason 
 we have to be in love with the pomp and plenty of this world, when this 
 blessed apostle, one of the best of men that ever lived, excepting 
 Jesus Christ, felt so much hardship in it. Nor was he ashamed of all 
 this, but, on the contrary, it was what he accounted his honour; and 
 therefore, much against the grain as it was with him to glory, yet, 
 says he, <I>if I must needs glory,</I> if my adversaries will oblige me 
 to it in my own necessary vindication, <I>I will glory in these my 
 infirmities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 Note, Sufferings for righteousness' sake will, the most of any thing, 
 redound to our honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:32-33">last two verses</A>,

 he mentions one particular part of his sufferings out of its place, as
 if he had forgotten it before, or because the deliverance God wrought 
 for him was most remarkable; namely, the danger he was in at Damascus, 
 soon after he was converted, and not settled in Christianity, at least 
 in the ministry and apostleship. This is recorded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:24,25">Acts ix. 24, 25</A>.

 This was his first great danger and difficulty, and the rest of his
 life was a piece with this. And it is observable that, lest it should
 be thought he spoke more than was true, the apostle confirms this 
 narrative with a solemn oath, or appeal to the omniscience of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 It is a great comfort to a good man that <I>the God and Father of our 
 Lord Jesus Christ,</I> who is an omniscient God, knows the truth of all 
 he says, and knows all he does and all he suffers for his sake.</P>
