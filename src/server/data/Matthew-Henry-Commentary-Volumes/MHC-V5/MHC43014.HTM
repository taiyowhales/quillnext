 This chapter is a continuation of Christ's discourse with his disciples 
 after supper. When he had convicted and discarded Judas, he set himself 
 to comfort the rest, who were full of sorrow upon what he had said of 
 leaving them, and a great many good words and comfortable words he here 
 speaks to them. The discourse in interlocutory; as Peter in the 
 foregoing chapter, so Thomas, and Philip, and Jude, in this interposed 
 their thoughts upon what he said, according to the liberty he was 
 pleased to allow them. Free conferences are as instructive as solemn 
 speeches, and more so. The general scope of this chapter is in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:1">first verse</A>;

 it is designed to keep trouble from their hearts; now in order to this
 they must believe: and let them consider,

 I. Heaven as their everlasting rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 II. Christ himself as their way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:4-11">ver. 4-11</A>.

 III. The great power they shall be clothed with by the prevalency of 
 their prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 IV. The coming of another comforter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>.

 V. The fellowship and communion that should be between him and them 
 after his departure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:18-24">ver. 18-24</A>.

 VI. The instructions which the Holy Ghost should give them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:25,26">ver. 25, 26</A>.

 VII. The peace Christ bequeathed to them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:27">ver. 27</A>.

 VIII. Christ's own cheerfulness in his departure,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:28-31">ver. 28-31</A>.

 And this which he said to them is designed for the comfort of all his 
 faithful followers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
 also in me.
 &nbsp; 2  In my Father's house are many mansions: if <I>it were</I> not
 <I>so,</I> I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
 &nbsp; 3  And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,
 and receive you unto myself; that where I am, <I>there</I> ye may be
 also.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A general caution which Christ gives to his disciples against 
 <I>trouble of heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Let not your heart be troubled.</I> They now began to be troubled, 
 were entering into this temptation. Now here see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How Christ took notice of it. Perhaps it was apparent in their 
 looks; it was said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:22"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 22</A>),

 <I>They looked one upon another</I> with anxiety and concern, and
 Christ looked upon them all, and observed it; at least, it was 
 intelligible to the Lord Jesus, who is acquainted with all our secret 
 undiscovered sorrows, with the wound that bleeds inwardly; he knows not 
 only how we are afflicted, but how we stand affected under our 
 afflictions, and how near they lie to our hearts; he takes cognizance 
 of all the trouble which his people are at any time in danger of being 
 overwhelmed with; <I>he knows our souls in adversity.</I> Many things 
 concurred to trouble the disciples now.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ had just told them of the unkindness he should receive from 
 some of them, and this troubled them all. Peter, no doubt, looked very 
 sorrowful upon what Christ said to him, and all the rest were sorry for 
 him and for themselves too, not knowing whose turn it should be to be 
 told next of some ill thing or other they should do. As to this, Christ 
 comforts them; though a godly jealousy over ourselves is of great use 
 to keep us humble and watchful, yet it must not prevail to the 
 disquieting of our spirits and the damping of our holy joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He had just told them of his own departure from them, that he 
 should not only go away, but go away in a cloud of sufferings. They 
 must shortly hear him loaded with reproaches, and these will be <I>as a 
 sword in their bones;</I> they must see him barbarously abused and put 
 to death, and this also will be a sword piercing <I>through their own 
 souls,</I> for they had loved him, and chosen him, and left all to 
 follow him. When we now look upon Christ pierced, we cannot but 
 <I>mourn and be in bitterness,</I> though we see the glorious issue and 
 fruit of it; much more grievous must the sight be to them, who could 
 then look no further. If Christ depart from them 

 [1.] They will think themselves shamefully disappointed; for they 
 looked that this had been he that should have delivered Israel, and 
 should have set upon his kingdom in secular power and glory, and, in 
 expectation of this, had lost all to follow him. Now, if he leave the 
 world in the same circumstances of meanness and poverty in which he had 
 lived, and worse, they are quite defeated. 

 [2.] They will think themselves sadly deserted and exposed. They knew 
 by experience what little presence of mind they had in difficult 
 emergencies, that they could count upon nothing but being ruined and 
 run down if they part with their Master. Now, in reference to all 
 these, <I>Let not your heart be troubled.</I> Here are three words, 
 upon any of which the emphasis may significantly be laid.
 <I>First,</I> Upon the word <I>troubled,</I> <B> <I>me 
 tarassestho</I></B>. Be not so troubled as to be put into a hurry and 
 confusion, <I>like the troubled sea when</I> it cannot rest. He does 
 not say, "Let not your hearts be sensible of the griefs, or sad because 
 of them" but, "Be not ruffled and discomposed, be not cast down and 
 disquieted," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:5">Ps. xlii. 5</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Upon the word <I>heart:</I> "Though the nation and
 city be troubled, though your little family and flock be troubled, yet 
 <I>let not your heart be troubled.</I> Keep possession of your own 
 souls when you can keep possession of nothing else." The heart is the 
 main fort; whatever you do, keep trouble from this, keep this with 
 <I>all diligence.</I> The spirit must <I>sustain the infirmity,</I> 
 therefore, see that this be not <I>wounded. Thirdly,</I> Upon the word
 <I>your:</I> "You that are my disciples and followers, my redeemed, 
 chosen, sanctified ones, however others are overwhelmed with the 
 sorrows of this present time, be not you so, for you know better; let 
 <I>the sinners in Zion</I> tremble, but let the <I>sons of Zion be 
 joyful in their king.</I>" Herein Christ's disciples should <I>do more 
 than others,</I> should keep their minds quiet, when every thing else 
 is unquiet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The remedy he prescribes against this trouble of mind, which he saw 
 ready to prevail over them; in general, 
 <I>believe</I>--<B><I>pisteuete</I></B>.

 (1.) Some read it in both parts imperatively, "<I>Believe in God,</I>
 and his perfections and providence, <I>believe also in me,</I> and my 
 mediation. Build with confidence upon the great acknowledged principles 
 of natural religion: that there is a God, that he is most holy, wise, 
 powerful, and good; that he is the governor of the world, and has the 
 sovereign disposal of all events; and comfort yourselves likewise with 
 the peculiar doctrines of that holy religion which I have taught you." 
 But, 

 (2.) We read the former as an acknowledgment that they did believe in 
 God, for which he commends them: "But, if you would effectually provide 
 against a stormy day, <I>believe also in me.</I>" Through Christ we are 
 brought into covenant with God, and become interested in his favour and 
 promise, which otherwise as sinners we must despair of, and the 
 remembrance of God would have been our trouble; but, by believing in 
 Christ as the Mediator between God and man, our belief in God becomes 
 comfortable; and this is the will of God, that <I>all men should honour 
 the Son as they honour the Father,</I> by believing in the Son as they 
 believe in the Father. Those that rightly believe in God will believe 
 in Jesus Christ, whom he has made known to them; and believing in God 
 through Jesus Christ is an excellent means of keeping trouble from the 
 heart. The joy of faith is the best remedy against the griefs of
 sense; it is a remedy with a promise annexed to it; <I>the just shall 
 live by faith;</I> a remedy with a <I>probatum est</I> annexed to it. 
 <I>I had fainted unless I had believed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a particular direction to act faith upon the promise of 
 eternal life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 He had directed them to trust to God, and to trust in him; but what 
 must they trust God and Christ for? Trust them for a happiness to come 
 when this body and this world shall be no more, and for a happiness to 
 last as long as the immortal soul and the eternal world shall last. Now 
 this is proposed as a sovereign cordial under all the troubles of this 
 present time, to which there is that in the happiness of heaven which 
 is admirably adapted and accommodated. The saints have encouraged
 themselves with this in their greatest extremities, <I>That heaven 
 would make amends for all.</I> Let us see how this is suggested 
 here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Believe and consider that really there is such a happiness: <I>In my 
 Father's house there are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have 
 told you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) See under what notion the happiness of heaven is here represented: 
 as <I>mansions,</I> many mansions in Christ's Father's house. 

 [1.] Heaven is a house, not a tent or tabernacle; it is <I>a house not 
 made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</I> 

 [2.] It is a Father's house: <I>my Father's house;</I> and his Father 
 is our Father, to whom he was now ascending; so that in right of their 
 elder brother all true believers shall be welcome to that happiness as 
 to their home. It is his house who is King of kings and Lord of lords, 
 dwells in light, and inhabits eternity. 

 [3.] There are <I>mansions</I> there; that is, <I>First,</I> Distinct 
 dwellings, an apartment for each. Perhaps there is an allusion to the 
 priests' chambers that were about the temple. In heaven there are 
 accommodations for particular saints; though all shall be swallowed up 
 in God, yet our individuality shall not be lost there; every Israelite 
 had his lot in Canaan, and every elder <I>a seat,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:4">Rev. iv. 4</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Durable dwellings. <B><I>Monai</I></B>, from 
 <B><I>mneio</I></B>, <I>maneo, abiding places.</I> The house itself is 
 lasting; our estate in it is not for a term of years, but a perpetuity. 
 Here we are as in an inn; in heaven we shall gain a settlement. The 
 disciples had quitted their houses to attend Christ, who had not where 
 to lay his head, but the mansions in heaven will make them amends. 

 [4.] There are <I>many</I> mansions, for there are many sons to be 
 brought to glory, and Christ exactly knows their number, nor will be 
 straitened for room by the coming of more company than he expects. He 
 had told Peter that he should follow him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:36"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 36</A>),

 but let not the rest be discouraged, in heaven there are mansions for
 them <I>all. Rehoboth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:22">Gen. xxvi. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) See what assurance we have of the reality of the happiness itself, 
 and the sincerity of the proposal of it to us: "<I>If it were not so, I 
 would have told you.</I> If you had deceived yourselves, when you 
 quitted your livelihoods, and ventured your lives for me, in prospect 
 of a happiness future and unseen, I would soon have undeceived you." 
 The assurance is built, 

 [1.] Upon the veracity of his word. It is implied, "If there were not 
 such a happiness, valuable and attainable, I would not have told you 
 that there was." 

 [2.] Upon the sincerity of his affection to them. As he is true, and 
 would not impose upon them himself, so he is kind, and would not suffer 
 them to be imposed upon. If either there were no such mansions, or
 none designed for them, who had left all to follow him, he would have 
 given them timely notice of the mistake, that they might have made an 
 honourable retreat to the world again, and have made the best they 
 could of it. Note, Christ's good-will to us is a great encouragement to 
 our hope in him. He loves us too well, and means us too well, to 
 disappoint the expectations of his own raising, or to leave those to be 
 of all men most miserable who have been of him most observant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Believe and consider that the design of Christ's going away was to 
 prepare a place in heaven for his disciples. "You are grieved to think 
 of my going away, whereas I go on your errand, <I>as the forerunner; I 
 am to enter for you.</I>" He went to prepare a place for us; that is, 
 
 (1.) To take possession for us, as our advocate or attorney, and so to 
 secure our title as indefeasible. Livery of seisin was given to Christ, 
 for the use and behoof of all that should believe on him. 

 (2.) To make provision for us as our friend and father. The happiness 
 of heaven, though prepared <I>before the foundation of the world,</I> 
 yet must be further fitted up for man in his fallen state. It 
 consisting much in the presence of Christ there, it was therefore 
 necessary that he should <I>go before,</I> to enter into that glory 
 which his disciples were to share in. Heaven would be an <I>unready</I> 
 place for a Christian if Christ were not there. He went to prepare a 
 table for them, to prepare thrones for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:30">Luke xxii. 30</A>.

 Thus Christ declares the fitness of heaven's happiness for the saints,
 for whom it is prepared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Believe and consider that <I>therefore</I> he would certainly come 
 again in due time, to fetch them to that blessed place which he was now 
 going to possess for himself and prepare for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>If I go and prepare a place for you,</I> if this be the errand of 
 my journey, you may be sure, when every thing is ready, <I>I will come 
 again, and receive you to myself,</I> so that you shall follow me 
 hereafter, <I>that where I am there you may be also.</I>" Now these are 
 comfortable words indeed. 

 (1.) That Jesus Christ will come again; <B><I>erchomai</I></B>--<I>I do 
 come,</I> intimating the certainty of it, that he will come and that he 
 is daily coming. We say, We are coming, when we are busy in preparing 
 for our coming, and so he is; all he does has a reference and tendency 
 to his second coming. Note, The belief of Christ's second coming, of 
 which he has given us the assurance, is an excellent preservative 
 against trouble of heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:5,Jam+5:8">Phil. iv. 5; James v. 8</A>.

 (2.) That he will come again to receive all his faithful followers to
 himself. He sends for them privately at death, and gathers them one by 
 one; but they are to make their public entry in solemn state all 
 together at the last day, and then Christ himself will come to receive 
 them, to conduct them in the abundance of his grace, and to welcome 
 them in the abundance of his love. He will hereby testify the utmost 
 respect and endearment imaginable. The coming of Christ is in order to 
 our <I>gathering together unto him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1">2 Thess. ii. 1</A>.

 (3.) <I>That where he is there they shall be also.</I> This intimates,
 what many other scriptures declare, that the quintessence of heaven's 
 happiness is being with Christ <I>there,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24,Php+1:23,1Th+4:17"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 24; 
 Phil. i. 23; 1 Thess. iv. 17</A>.

 Christ speaks of his being there as now present, <I>that where I
 am;</I> where I am to be shortly, where I am to be eternally; there you 
 shall be shortly, there you shall be eternally: not only <I>there,</I> 
 in the same place; but <I>here,</I> in the same state: not only 
 spectators of his glory, as the three disciples on the mount, but 
 sharers in it. 

 (4.) That this may be inferred from his <I>going to prepare a place</I> 
 for us, for his preparations shall not be in vain. He will not build
 and furnish lodgings, and let them stand empty. He will be the finisher 
 of that of which he is the author. If he has prepared the place for us, 
 he will prepare us for it, and in due time put us in possession of it. 
 As the resurrection of Christ is the assurance of our resurrection, so 
 his ascension, victory, and glory, are an assurance of ours.</P>

 &nbsp; 5  Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest;
 and how can we know the way?
 &nbsp; 6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:
 no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
 &nbsp; 7  If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and
 from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
 &nbsp; 8  Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it
 sufficeth us.
 &nbsp; 9  Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and
 yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath
 seen the Father; and how sayest thou <I>then,</I> Show us the Father?
 &nbsp; 10  Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father
 in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ, having set the happiness of heaven before them as the end, here 
 shows them himself as the way to it, and tells them that they were 
 better acquainted both with the end they were to aim at and with the 
 way they were to walk in than they thought they were: <I>You know,</I> 
 that is, 

 1. "You may know; it is none of the <I>secret things</I> which belong
 not to you, but one of the <I>things revealed;</I> you <I>need not 
 ascend into heaven,</I> nor <I>go down into the deep,</I> for <I>the 
 word is nigh you</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:6-8">Rom. x. 6-8</A>),
 
 level to you." 

 2. "You do know; you know that which is the home and which is the way, 
 though perhaps not as the home and as the way. You have been told it, 
 and cannot but know, if you would recollect and consider it." Note, 
 Jesus Christ is willing to make the best of his people's knowledge, 
 though they are weak and defective in it. He knows the good that is in 
 them better than they do themselves, and is certain that they have that 
 knowledge, and faith, and love, of which they themselves are not 
 sensible, or not certain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This word of Christ gave occasion to two of his disciples to address 
 themselves to him, and he answers them both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Thomas enquired concerning the way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 without any apology for contradicting his Master.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He said, "<I>Lord, we know not whither thou goest,</I> to what place 
 or what state, <I>and how can we know the way</I> in which we must 
 follow thee? We can neither guess at it, nor enquire it out, but must 
 still be at a loss." Christ's testimony concerning their knowledge made 
 them more sensible of their ignorance, and more inquisitive after 
 further light. Thomas here shows more modesty than Peter, who thought 
 he could follow Christ now. Peter was the more solicitous to know 
 <I>whither Christ went.</I> Thomas here, though he complains that he 
 did not know this, yet seems more solicitous to know <I>the way.</I> 
 Now, 

 (1.) His confession of his ignorance was commendable enough. If good 
 men be in the dark, and know but in part, yet they are willing to own 
 their defects. But, 

 (2.) The cause of his ignorance was culpable. They knew not whither
 Christ went, because they dreamed of a temporal kingdom in external 
 pomp and power, and doted upon this, notwithstanding what he had said 
 again and again to the contrary. Hence it was that, when Christ spoke 
 of going away and their following him, their fancy ran upon his going 
 to some remarkable city or other, Bethlehem, or Nazareth, or Capernaum, 
 or some of the cities of the Gentiles, as David to Hebron, there to be 
 anointed king, and <I>to restore the kingdom to Israel;</I> and which 
 way this place lay, where these castles in the air were to be built, 
 east, west, north, or south, they could not tell, and therefore knew 
 not the way. Thus still we think ourselves more in the dark than we 
 need be concerning the future state of the church, because we expect 
 its worldly prosperity, whereas it is spiritual advancement that the 
 promise points at. Had Thomas understood, as he might have done, that 
 Christ was going to the invisible world, the world of spirits, to which 
 spiritual things only have a reference, he would not have said, 
 <I>Lord, we do not know the way.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Now to this complaint of their ignorance, which included a desire 
 to be taught, Christ gives a full answer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 Thomas had enquired both whither he went and what was the way, and 
 Christ answers both these enquiries and makes good what he had said, 
 that they would have needed no answer if they had understood themselves 
 aright; for they knew him, and he was the way; they knew the Father, 
 and he was the end; and therefore, <I>whither I go you know, and the 
 way you know.</I> Believe in God as the end, and in me as the way

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and you do all you should do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He speaks of himself as the way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Dost thou <I>not know the way? I am the way,</I> and I only, for <I>no 
 man comes to the Father but by me.</I> Great things Christ here saith 
 of himself, showing us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The nature of his mediation: He is <I>the way, the truth, and the 
 life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Let us consider these first distinctly.

 1. Christ is <I>the way, the highway</I> spoken of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8">Isa. xxxv. 8</A>.

 Christ was his own way, for by <I>his own blood he entered into the 
 holy place</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:12">Heb. ix. 12</A>),

 and he is our way, for we enter by him. By his doctrine and example he 
 teaches us our duty, by his merit and intercession he procures our 
 happiness, and so he is the way. In him God and man meet, and are 
 brought together. We could not get to the tree of life in the way of 
 innocency; but Christ is another way to it. By Christ, as the way an 
 intercourse is settled and kept up between heaven and earth; the angels 
 of God ascend and descend; our prayers go to God, and his blessings 
 come to us by him; this is <I>the way that leads to rest, the good old 
 way.</I> The disciples followed him, and Christ tells them that they 
 followed the road, and, while they continued following him, they would 
 never be out of their way. 
 
 2. He is <I>the truth.</I>

 (1.) As truth is opposed to figure and shadow. Christ is the substance 
 of all the Old-Testament types, which are therefore said to be 
 <I>figures of the true,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:24">Heb. ix. 24</A>.
 
 Christ is <I>the true manna</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:32"><I>ch.</I> vi. 32</A>),

 <I>the true tabernacle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:2">Heb. viii. 2</A>.

 (2.) As truth is opposed to falsehood and error; the doctrine of Christ
 is true doctrine. When we enquire for truth, we need learn no more than
 <I>the truth as it is in Jesus.</I> 

 (3.) As truth is opposed to fallacy and deceit; he is true to all that 
 trust in him, as true as truth itself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:20">2 Cor. i. 20</A>.

 3. He is <I>the life;</I> for we are <I>alive unto God</I> only in and
 <I>through Jesus Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:11">Rom. vi. 11</A>.

 Christ formed in us is that to our souls which our souls are to our
 bodies. Christ is <I>the resurrection and the life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Let us consider these jointly, and with reference to each
 other. Christ is <I>the way, the truth, and the life;</I> that is, 

 1. He is the beginning, the middle, and the end. In him we must set
 out, go on, and finish. As <I>the truth,</I> he is the guide of our 
 way; as <I>the life,</I> he is the end of it. 

 2. He is <I>the true and living way</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:20">Heb. x. 20</A>);

 there are <I>truth and life</I> in the way, as well as at the end of 
 it. 

 3. He is <I>the true way to life,</I> the only true way; other ways may 
 seem right, but the end of them is <I>the way of death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The necessity of his mediation: <I>No man cometh to the Father but 
 by me.</I> Fallen man must come to God as a Judge, but cannot come to 
 him as a Father, otherwise than by Christ as Mediator. We cannot 
 perform the duty of coming to God, by repentance and the acts of 
 worship, without the Spirit and grace of Christ, nor obtain the 
 happiness of coming to God as our Father without his merit and 
 righteousness; he is the <I>high priest of our profession,</I> our 
 advocate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He speaks of his Father as the end 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>If you had known me</I> aright, <I>you would have known my Father 
 also; and henceforth,</I> by the glory you have seen in me and the 
 doctrine you have heard from me, <I>you know him and have seen 
 him.</I>" Here is, 

 [1.] A tacit rebuke to them for their dulness and carelessness in not 
 acquainting themselves with Jesus Christ, though they had been his 
 constant followers and associates: <I>If you had known me--.</I> They 
 knew him, and yet did not know him so well as they might and should 
 have known him. They knew him to be the Christ, but did not follow on 
 to know God in him. Christ had said to the Jews

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:19"><I>ch.</I> viii. 19</A>):

 <I>If you had known me, you would have known my Father also;</I> and
 here the same to his disciples; for it is hard to say which is more 
 strange, the wilful ignorance of those that are enemies to the light, 
 or the defects and mistakes of <I>the children of light,</I> that have 
 had such opportunities of knowledge. If they had known Christ aright, 
 they would have known that his kingdom is spiritual, and <I>not of this 
 world;</I> that <I>he came down from heaven,</I> and therefore must 
 return <I>to heaven;</I> and then they would have known his Father 
 also, would have known whither he designed to go, when he said, <I>I go 
 to the Father,</I> to a glory in the other world, not in this. If we 
 knew Christianity better, we should better know natural religion. 

 [2.] A favourable intimation that he was well satisfied concerning 
 their sincerity, notwithstanding the weakness of their understanding: 
 "<I>And henceforth,</I> from my giving you this hint, which will serve 
 as a key to all the instructions I have given you hitherto, let me tell 
 you, <I>you know him, and have seen him,</I> inasmuch as you know me, 
 and have seen me;" for in the face of Christ we see the glory of God, 
 as we see a father in his son that resembles him. Christ tells his 
 disciples that they were not so ignorant as they seemed to be; for, 
 though <I>little children,</I> yet they had known the Father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:13">1 John ii. 13</A>.

 Note, Many of the disciples of Christ have more knowledge and more
 grace than they think they have, and Christ takes notice of, and is 
 well pleased with, that good in them which they themselves are not 
 aware of; for those that know God do not all at once know that they 
 know him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:3">1 John ii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Philip enquired concerning the Father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and Christ answered him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>,
 
 where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Philip's request for some extraordinary discovery of the Father. He 
 was not so forward to speak as some others of them were, and yet, from 
 an earnest desire of further light, he cries out, <I>Show us the 
 Father.</I> Philip listened to what Christ said to Thomas, and fastened 
 upon the last words, <I>You have seen him.</I> "Nay," says Philip, 
 "that is what we want, that is what we would have: <I>Show us the 
 Father and it sufficeth us.</I>" 

 (1.) This supposes an earnest desire of acquaintance with God as a 
 Father. The petition is, "<I>Show us the Father;</I> give us to know 
 him in that relation to us;" and this he begs, not for himself only, 
 but for the rest of the disciples. The plea is, <I>It sufficeth us.</I> 
 He not only professes it himself, but will pass his word for his 
 fellow-disciples. Grant us but one sight of the Father, and we have 
 enough. Jansenius saith, "Though Philip did not mean it, yet the Holy 
 Ghost, by his mouth, designed here to teach us that the satisfaction 
 and happiness of a soul consist in the vision and fruition of God," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:11,17:15">Ps. xvi. 11; xvii. 15</A>.

 In the knowledge of God the understanding rests, and is at the summit
 of its ambition; in the knowledge of God as our Father the soul is 
 satisfied; a sight of the Father is a heaven upon earth, fills us 
 <I>with joy unspeakable.</I>

 (2.) As Philip speaks it here, it intimates that he was not satisfied 
 with such a discovery of the Father as Christ thought fit to give them, 
 but he would prescribe to him, and press upon him, something further 
 and no less than some visible appearance of <I>the glory of God,</I> 
 like that to Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:22">Exod. xxxiii. 22</A>),

 and to <I>the elders of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:9-11">Exod. xxiv. 9-11</A>.

 "Let us see the Father with our bodily eyes, as we see thee, <I>and it 
 sufficeth us;</I> we will trouble thee with no more questions, 
 <I>Whither goest thou?</I>" And so it manifests not only the weakness 
 of his faith, but his ignorance of the gospel way of manifesting <I>the 
 Father,</I> which is spiritual, and not sensible. Such a sight of God,
 he thinks, would <I>suffice</I> them, and yet those who did thus see 
 him were not <I>sufficed,</I> but soon <I>corrupted themselves, and 
 made a graven image.</I> Christ's institutions have provided better for 
 the confirmation of our faith than our own inventions would.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ's reply, referring him to the discoveries already made of the 
 Father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He refers him to what he had seen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He upbraids him with his ignorance and inadvertency: "<I>Have I been so 
 long time with you,</I> now above three years intimately conversant 
 with you, <I>and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?</I> Now, <I>he 
 that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show 
 us the Father?</I> Wilt thou ask for that which thou hast already?" Now 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He reproves him for two things: <I>First,</I> For not improving 
 his acquaintance with Christ, as he might have done, to a clear and 
 distinct knowledge of him: "<I>Hast thou not known me, Philip,</I> whom 
 thou hast followed so long, and conversed with so much?" Philip, the 
 first day he came to him, declared that he knew him to be the Messiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:45"><I>ch.</I> i. 45</A>),

 and yet to this day did <I>not know the Father</I> in him. Many that
 have good knowledge in the scripture and divine things fall short of 
 the attainments justly expected from them, for want of compounding the 
 ideas they have, and going on to perfection. Many know Christ, who yet 
 do not know what they might know of him, nor see what they should see 
 in him. That which aggravated Philip's dulness was that he had so long 
 an opportunity of improvement: <I>I have been so long time with 
 thee.</I> Note, The longer we enjoy the means of knowledge and grace, 
 the more inexcusable we are if we be found defective in grace and 
 knowledge. Christ expects that our proficiency should be in some 
 measure according to our standing, that we should not be always babes. 
 Let us thus reason with ourselves: "Have I been so long a hearer of 
 sermons, a student in the scripture, a scholar in the school of Christ, 
 and yet so weak in <I>the knowledge of Christ,</I> and so unskilful in 
 <I>the word of righteousness?</I>" <I>Secondly,</I> He reproves him for 
 his infirmity in the prayer made, <I>Show us the Father.</I> Note, 
 Herein appears much of the weakness of Christ's disciples that they 
 <I>know not what to pray for as they ought</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:26">Rom. viii. 26</A>),

 but often <I>ask amiss</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:3">Jam. iv. 3</A>),

 for that which either is not promised or is already bestowed in the 
 sense of the promise, as here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He instructs him, and gives him a maxim which not only in general 
 magnifies Christ and leads us to the knowledge of God in him, but 
 justifies what Christ had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>You know the Father, and have seen him;</I> and answered what Philip 
 had asked, <I>Show us the Father.</I> Why, saith Christ, the difficulty 
 is soon over, for <I>he that hath seen me hath seen the Father. 
 First,</I> All that saw <I>Christ in the flesh</I> might <I>have seen 
 the Father</I> in him, if Satan had not <I>blinded their minds,</I> and 
 kept them from a sight of Christ, as <I>the image of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:4">2 Cor. iv. 4</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> All that saw Christ by faith did <I>see the Father</I>
 in him, though they were not suddenly aware that they did so. In the 
 light of Christ's doctrine they saw God as <I>the father of lights;</I> 
 in the miracles they saw God <I>as the God of power, the finger of 
 God.</I> The holiness of God shone in the spotless purity of Christ's 
 life, and his grace in all the acts of grace he did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He refers him to what he had reason to believe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>):
 
 "<I>Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in 
 me,</I> and therefore that in <I>seeing me</I> thou hast <I>seen the 
 Father?</I> Hast thou not believed this? If not, take my word for it, 
 and believe it now."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] See here what it is which we are to believe: <I>That I am in the 
 Father, and the Father in me;</I> that is, as he had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:30"><I>ch.</I> x. 30</A>),

 <I>I and my Father are one.</I> He speaks of the Father and himself as 
 two persons, and yet so one as never any two were or can be. In knowing 
 Christ as <I>God of God, light of light, very God of very God, 
 begotten, not made,</I> and as <I>being of one substance with the 
 Father, by whom all things were made,</I> we know the Father; and in 
 seeing him thus we see the Father. In Christ we behold more of <I>the 
 glory of God</I> than Moses did at Mount Horeb.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] See here what inducements we have to believe this; and they are 
 two:--We must believe it, <I>First,</I> For his word's sake: <I>The
 words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:16"><I>ch.</I> vii. 16</A>,

 <I>My doctrine is not mine.</I> What he said seemed to them careless 
 as <I>the word of man,</I> speaking his own thought at his own 
 pleasure; but really it was the wisdom of God that indited it and the 
 will of God that enforced it. <I>He spoke not of himself</I> only, but 
 the mind of God according to the eternal counsels. <I>Secondly,</I> For 
 his works' sake: <I>The Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth them;</I> 
 and therefore <I>believe me for their sake.</I> Observe, 

 1. The Father is said to <I>dwell</I> in him <B><I>ho en emoi
 menon</I></B>--<I>he abideth in me,</I> by the inseparable union of the 
 divine and human nature: never had God such a temple to dwell in on 
 earth as <I>the body of the Lord Jesus,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:21"><I>ch.</I> ii. 21</A>.

 Here was the true Shechinah, of which that in the tabernacle was but a
 type. <I>The fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:9">Col. ii. 9</A>.
 
 The Father so dwells in Christ that in him he may <I>be found,</I> as a
 man where he dwells. <I>Seek ye the Lord, seek</I> him in Christ, and
 <I>he will be found,</I> for in him he dwells. 

 2. <I>He doeth the works.</I> Many words of power, and works of mercy,
 Christ did, and the Father did them in him; and the work of redemption 
 in general was God's own work.

 3. We are bound to believe this, <I>for the very works' sake.</I> As we
 are to believe the being and perfections of God for the sake of the 
 works of creation, which declare his glory; so we are to believe the 
 revelation of God to man in Jesus Christ for the sake of the works of 
 the Redeemer, those mighty works which, by showing forth themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:2">Matt. xiv. 2</A>),

 <I>Show forth him, and God in him.</I> Note, Christ's miracles are 
 proofs of his divine mission, not only for the conviction of infidels, 
 but for the confirmation of the faith of his own disciples,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:11,5:36,10:37"><I>ch.</I> ii. 11; v. 36; x. 37</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The disciples, as they were full of grief to think of parting with 
 their Master, so they were full of care what would become of themselves 
 when he was gone; while he was with them, he was a support to them, 
 kept them in countenance, kept them in heart; but, if he leave them, 
 they will be <I>as sheep having no shepherd,</I> an easy prey to those 
 who seek to run them down. Now, to silence these fears, Christ here 
 assures them that they should be clothed with powers sufficient to bear 
 them out. As Christ has <I>all power,</I> they, in his name, should 
 have great <I>power, both in heaven and in earth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Great power on earth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>He that believeth on me</I> (as I know you do), <I>the works that I
 do shall he do also.</I> This does not weaken the argument Christ had 
 taken from his works, to prove himself one with the Father (that others 
 should do as <I>great works</I>), but rather strengthens it; for the 
 miracles which the apostles wrought were <I>wrought in his name,</I> 
 and <I>by faith in him;</I> and this magnifies his power more than any 
 thing, that he not only wrought miracles himself, but gave power to 
 others to do so too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Two things he assures them of:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That they should be enabled to do such works as he had done, and 
 that they should have a more ample power for the doing of them than 
 they had had when he first sent them forth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:8">Matt. x. 8</A>.

 Did Christ <I>heal the sick, cleanse the leper, raise the dead?</I> So
 should they. Did he convince and convert sinners, and draw multitudes 
 to him? So should they. Though he should depart, the work should not
 cease, nor fall to the ground, but should be carried on as vigorously 
 and successfully as ever; and it is still in the doing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That they should do <I>greater works than these.</I> 

 [1.] In the kingdom of nature they should work greater miracles. No 
 miracle is little, but some to our apprehension seem greater than 
 others. Christ had healed with the hem of his garment, but Peter with 
 his shadow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:15">Acts v. 15</A>),

 Paul by the handkerchief that had touched him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:12">Acts xix. 12</A>.

 Christ wrought miracles for two or three years in one country, but his 
 followers wrought miracles in his name for many ages in divers 
 countries. <I>You shall do greater works,</I> if there be occasion, for 
 the glory of God. <I>The prayer of faith,</I> if at any time it had 
 been necessary, would have <I>removed mountains.</I> 

 [2.] In the kingdom of grace. They should obtain greater victories by 
 the gospel than had been obtained while Christ was upon earth. The 
 truth is, the captivating of so great a part of the world to Christ, 
 under such outward disadvantages, was the miracle of all. I think this 
 refers especially to <I>the gift of tongues;</I> this was the immediate 
 effect of the <I>pouring out of the Spirit,</I> which was a constant 
 miracle upon the mind, in which words are framed, and which was made to 
 serve so glorious an intention as that of spreading the gospel to all 
 nations <I>in their own language.</I> This was a greater <I>sign to 
 them that believed not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:22">1 Cor. xiv. 22</A>),

 and more powerful for their conviction, than any other miracle 
 whatever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reason Christ gives for this is, <I>Because I go unto my 
 Father,</I> 

 (1.) "<I>Because I go,</I> it will be requisite that you should have 
 such a power, lest the work suffer damage by my absence." 

 (2.) "<I>Because I go to the Father,</I> I shall be in a capacity to 
 furnish you with such a power, for <I>I go to the Father, to send the 
 Comforter,</I> from whom <I>you shall receive power,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:8">Acts i. 8</A>.

 The wonderful works which they did in Christ's name were part of the
 glories of his exalted state, <I>when he ascended on high,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8">Eph. iv. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Great <I>power in heaven: "Whatsoever you shall ask, that will I 
 do</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>),

 as Israel, who was a prince with God. Therefore you shall do such 
 mighty works, because you have such an interest in me, and I in <I>my 
 Father.</I>" Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In what way they were to keep up communion with him, and derive 
 power from him, when he was gone to the Father--by prayer. When dear 
 friends are to be removed to a distance from each other, they provide 
 for the settling of a correspondence; thus, when Christ was going to 
 his Father, he tells his disciples how they might write to him upon 
 every occasion, and send their epistles by a safe and ready way of 
 conveyance, without danger of miscarrying, or lying by the way: "Let me 
 hear from you by prayer, <I>the prayer of faith,</I> and you shall hear 
 from me by the Spirit." This was the old way of intercourse with 
 Heaven, ever since <I>men began to call upon the name of the Lord;</I> 
 but Christ by his death has laid it more open, and it is still open to 
 us. Here is, 

 (1.) Humility prescribed: <I>You shall ask.</I> Though they had quitted 
 all for Christ, they could demand nothing of him as a debt, but must be 
 humble supplicants, beg or starve, beg or perish.

 (2.) Liberty allowed: "Ask any thing, any thing that is good and proper 
 for you; any thing, provided you know what you ask, you may ask; you 
 may ask for assistance in your work, for a mouth and wisdom, for 
 preservation out of the hands of your enemies, for power to work 
 miracles when there is occasion, for the success of the ministry in the 
 conversion of souls; ask to be informed, directed, vindicated." 
 Occasions vary, but they shall be welcome to the throne of grace upon 
 every occasion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In what name they were to present their petitions: <I>Ask in my 
 name.</I> To ask in Christ's name is, 

 (1.) To plead his merit and intercession, and to depend upon that plea. 
 The Old-Testament saints had an eye to this when they prayed <I>for the 
 Lord's sake</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:17">Dan. ix. 17</A>),
 
 and <I>for the sake of the anointed</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:9">Ps. lxxxiv. 9</A>),

 but Christ's mediation is brought to a clearer light by the gospel, and 
 so we are enabled more expressly to <I>ask in his name.</I> When Christ 
 dictated the Lord's prayer, this was not inserted, because they did not 
 then so fully understand this matter as they did afterwards, when the 
 Spirit was poured out. If we ask <I>in our own name,</I> we cannot 
 expect to speed, for, being strangers, we have <I>no name</I> in 
 heaven; being sinners, we have an <I>ill name</I> there; but Christ's 
 is a good name, well known in heaven, and very precious. 

 (2.) It is to aim at his glory and to seek this as our highest end in 
 all our prayers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What success they should have in their prayers: "What you ask, 
 <I>that will I do,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 And again
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 "<I>I will do it.</I> You may be sure I will: not only it shall be 
 done, I will see it done, or give orders for the doing of it, but <I>I 
 will do it;</I>" for he has not only the interest of an intercessor, 
 but the power of a sovereign prince, who <I>sits at the right hand of 
 God,</I> the hand of action, and has the doing of all in the kingdom of 
 God. By faith in his name we may have what we will for the asking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. For what reason their prayers should speed so well: <I>That the 
 Father may be glorified in the Son.</I> That is, 

 (1.) This they ought to aim at, and have their eye upon, in asking. In 
 this all our desires and prayers should meet as in their centre; to 
 this they must all be directed, that God in Christ may be honoured by 
 our services, and in our salvation. <I>Hallowed be thy name</I> is an 
 answered prayer, and is put first, because, if the heart be sincere in 
 this, it does in a manner <I>consecrate</I> all the other petitions. 
 
 (2.) This Christ will aim at in granting, and for the sake of this will 
 do what they ask, that hereby the glory of the Father in the Son may be 
 manifested. The wisdom, power, and goodness of God were magnified in 
 the Redeemer when by a power derived from him, and exerted in his name 
 and for his service, his apostles and ministers were enabled to do such 
 great things, both in the proofs of their doctrine and in the successes 
 of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  If ye love me, keep my commandments.
 &nbsp; 16  And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
 Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
 &nbsp; 17  <I>Even</I> the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive,
 because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him;
 for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ not only proposes such things to them as were the matter of 
 their comfort, but here promises to send the Spirit, whose office it 
 should be to be their Comforter, to <I>impress</I> these things upon 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He premises to this a memento of duty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>If you love me, keep my commandments.</I> Keeping the commandments 
 of Christ is here put for the practice of godliness in general, and for 
 the faithful and diligent discharge of their office as apostles in 
 particular. Now observe, 

 1. When Christ is comforting them, he bids them <I>keep his
 commandments;</I> for we must not expect comfort but in the way of 
 duty. The same word (<B><I>parakaleo</I></B>) signifies both to exhort 
 and to comfort.

 2. When they were in care what they should do, now that their Master
 was leaving them, and what would become of them now, he bids them
 <I>keep his commandments,</I> and then nothing could come amiss to
 them. In difficult times our care concerning the events of the day
 should be swallowed up in a care concerning the duty of the day. 

 3. When they were showing their love to Christ by their grieving to
 think of his departure, and the sorrow which filled their hearts upon
 the foresight of that, he bids them, if they would show their love to
 him, do it, not by these weak and feminine passions, but by their
 conscientious care to perform their trust, and by a universal obedience
 to his commands; this is better than sacrifice, better than tears.
 <I>Lovest thou me? Feed my lambs.</I> 

 4. When Christ has given them precious promises, of the answer of their 
 prayers and the coming of the Comforter, he lays down this as a 
 limitation of the promises, "Provided you keep my commandments, from a 
 principle of love to me." Christ will not be an advocate for any but 
 those that will be ruled and advised by him as their counsel. Follow 
 the conduct of the Spirit, and you shall have the comfort of the 
 Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He promises this great and unspeakable blessing to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is promised that they shall have <I>another comforter.</I> This 
 is the great New-Testament promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:4">Acts i. 4</A>),

 as that of the Messiah was of the Old Testament; a promise adapted to 
 the present distress of the disciples, who were in sorrow, and needed a 
 comforter. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The blessing promised: <B><I>allon parakleton</I></B>. The word is 
 used only here in these discourses of Christ's, and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1">1 John ii. 1</A>,

 where we translate it an <I>advocate.</I> The Rhemists, and Dr.
 Hammond, are for retaining the <I>Greek</I> word <I>Paraclete;</I> we 
 read,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:31">Acts ix. 31</A>,

 of the <B><I>paraklesis tou hagiou pneumatos</I></B>, the <I>comfort of 
 the Holy Ghost,</I> including his whole office as a paraclete. 

 [1.] You shall have another <I>advocate.</I> The office of the Spirit 
 was to be Christ's advocate with them and others, to plead his cause, 
 and take care of his concerns, on earth; to be <I>vicarius 
 Christi--Christ's Vicar,</I> as one of the ancients call him; and to be 
 their advocate with their opposers. When Christ was with them he spoke 
 for them as there was occasion; but now that he is leaving them they 
 shall not be run down, the Spirit of the Father shall speak in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:19,20">Matt. x. 19, 20</A>.

 And the cause cannot miscarry that is pleaded by such an advocate.

 [2.] You shall have another <I>master</I> or <I>teacher,</I> another
 <I>exhorter.</I> While they had Christ with them he excited and 
 exhorted them to their duty; but now that he is going he leaves one 
 with them that shall do this as effectually, though silently. Jansenius 
 thinks the most proper word to render it by is a <I>patron,</I> one 
 that shall both instruct and protect you. 

 [3.] Another <I>comforter.</I> Christ was expected as the consolation 
 of Israel. One of the names of the Messiah among the Jews was 
 <I>Menahem--the Comforter.</I> The Targum calls the days of the Messiah 
 <I>the years of consolation.</I> Christ comforted his disciples when he 
 was with them, and now that he was leaving them in their greatest need 
 he promises them <I>another.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The giver of this blessing: <I>The Father</I> shall give him, 
 <I>my Father</I> and <I>your Father;</I> it includes both. The same 
 that gave the Son to be our Saviour will give his Spirit to be our 
 comforter, pursuant to the same design. The Son is said to send the 
 Comforter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:26"><I>ch.</I> xv. 26</A>),
 
 but the Father is the prime agent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) How this blessing is procured--by the intercession of the Lord 
 Jesus: <I>I will pray the Father.</I> He said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 <I>I will do it;</I> here he saith, <I>I will pray for it,</I> to show 
 not only that he is both God and man, but that he is both king and 
 priest. As priest he is ordained for men to make intercession, as king 
 he is authorized by the Father to execute judgment. When Christ saith, 
 <I>I will pray the Father,</I> it does not suppose that the Father is 
 unwilling, or must be importuned to it, but only that the gift of the 
 Spirit is a fruit of Christ's mediation, purchased by his merit, and 
 taken out by his intercession.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The continuance of this blessing: <I>That he may abide with you 
 for ever.</I> That is, 

 [1.] "<I>With you,</I> as long as you live. You shall never know the 
 want of a comforter, nor lament his departure, as you are now lamenting 
 mine." Note, It should support us under the loss of those comforts 
 which were designed us for a time that there are everlasting 
 consolations provided for us. It was not expedient that Christ should 
 be with them for ever, for they who were designed for public service, 
 must not always live a college-life; they must disperse, and therefore 
 a comforter that would be with them all, in all places alike, 
 wheresoever dispersed and howsoever distressed, was alone fit to be 
 with them for ever. 

 [2.] "With your successors, when you are gone, to the end of time; your 
 successors in Christianity, in the ministry." 

 [3.] If we take <I>for ever</I> in its utmost extent, the promise will 
 be accomplished in those consolations of God which will be the eternal 
 joy of all the saints, <I>pleasures for ever.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This comforter is the <I>Spirit of truth, whom you know,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 They might think it impossible to have a comforter equivalent to him 
 who is the Son of God: "Yea," saith Christ, "you shall have the Spirit 
 of God, who is equal in power and glory with the Son."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The comforter promised is <I>the Spirit,</I> one who should do his 
 work in a spiritual way and manner, inwardly and invisibly, by working 
 on men's spirits.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) "He is the <I>Spirit of truth.</I>" He will be true to you, and to 
 his undertaking for you, which he will perform to the utmost. He will 
 <I>teach you the truth,</I> will enlighten your minds with the 
 knowledge of it, will strengthen and confirm your belief of it, and 
 will increase your love to it. The Gentiles by their idolatries, and 
 the Jews by their traditions, were led into gross errors and mistakes; 
 but the Spirit of truth shall not only <I>lead you into all truth,</I> 
 but others by your ministry. Christ is the truth, and he is the Spirit 
 of Christ, the Spirit that he was anointed with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He is one <I>whom the world cannot receive;</I> but <I>you know 
 him. Therefore he abideth with you.</I> 

 [1.] The disciples of Christ are here distinguished from the world, for 
 they are chosen and called out of the world that lies in wickedness; 
 they are the children and heirs of another world, not of this. 

 [2.] It is the misery of those that are invincibly devoted to the world 
 that they <I>cannot receive</I> the Spirit of truth. The spirit <I>of 
 the world</I> and <I>of God</I> are spoken of as directly contrary the 
 one to the other

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:12">1 Cor. ii. 12</A>);

 for where the spirit of the world has the ascendant, the Spirit of God 
 is excluded. Even the <I>princes of this world,</I> though, as princes, 
 they had advantages of knowledge, yet, as princes of this world, they 
 laboured under invincible prejudices, so that they knew not <I>the 
 things of the Spirit of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>.

 [3.] Therefore men <I>cannot receive the Spirit of truth</I> because
 they <I>see him not, neither know him.</I> The comforts of the Spirit 
 are <I>foolishness to them,</I> as much as ever the cross of Christ 
 was, and the great things of the gospel, like those of the law, are 
 counted as a strange thing. These are judgments far above out of their
 sight. Speak to the children of this world of the operations of the
 Spirit, and you are as a barbarian to them. 

 [4.] The best knowledge of the Spirit of truth is that which is got by 
 experience: <I>You know him, for he dwelleth with you.</I> Christ had 
 dwelt with them, and by their acquaintance with him they could not but 
 know <I>the Spirit of truth.</I> They had themselves been endued with 
 the Spirit in some measure. What enabled them to leave all to follow 
 Christ, and to continue with him in his temptations? What enabled them 
 to preach the gospel, and work miracles, but the Spirit dwelling in 
 them? The experiences of the saints are the explications of the 
 promises; paradoxes to others are axioms to them. 

 [5.] Those that have an experimental acquaintance with the Spirit have 
 a comfortable assurance of his continuance: He <I>dwelleth with you, 
 and shall be in you,</I> for the blessed Spirit doth not use to shift 
 his lodging. Those that know him know how to value him, invite him and
 bid him welcome; and therefore he shall be in them, as the light in the 
 air, as the sap in the tree, as the soul in the body. Their communion 
 with him shall be intimate, and their union with him inseparable. 

 [6.] The gift of the Holy Ghost is a peculiar gift, bestowed upon the 
 disciples of Christ in a distinguishing way--them, and not the world; 
 it is to them <I>hidden manna,</I> and the <I>white stone.</I> No 
 comforts comparable to those which make no show, make no noise. This is 
 the favour God bears to his chosen; it is the <I>heritage of those that 
 fear his name.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
 &nbsp; 19  Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye
 see me: because I live, ye shall live also.
 &nbsp; 20  At that day ye shall know that I <I>am</I> in my Father, and ye
 in me, and I in you.
 &nbsp; 21  He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is

 Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.
 &nbsp; 22  Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that
 thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?
 &nbsp; 23  Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will
 keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto
 him, and make our abode with him.
 &nbsp; 24  He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word
 which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When friends are parting, it is a common request they make to each 
 other, "Pray let us hear from you as often as you can:" this Christ 
 engaged to his disciples, that out of sight they should not be out of 
 mind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He promises that he would continue his care of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>I will not leave you orphans,</I> or <I>fatherless;</I> for, though 
 I leave you, yet I leave you this comfort, <I>I will come to you.</I>" 
 His departure from them was that which grieved them; but it was not so 
 bad as they apprehended, for it was neither total nor final. 

 1. Not total. "Though I leave you without my bodily presence, yet I do
 not leave you without comfort." Though children, and left 
 <I>little,</I> yet they had received the adoption of sons, and his 
 Father would be their Father, with whom those who otherwise would be 
 fatherless find mercy. Note, The case of true believers, though 
 sometimes it may be sorrowful, is never comfortless, because they are 
 never orphans: for God is their Father, who is an <I>everlasting 
 Father.</I> 

 2. Not final: <I>I will come to you,</I> <B><I>erchomai</I></B>--<I>I
 do come;</I> that is,

 (1.) "I will come speedily to you at my resurrection, I will not be 
 long away, but will be with you again in a little time." He had often 
 said, <I>The third day I will rise again.</I> 

 (2.) "I will be coming daily to you in my Spirit;" in the tokens of his 
 love, and visits of his grace, he is still coming. 

 (3.) "I will come certainly at the end of time; surely I will come 
 quickly to introduce you into the joy of your Lord." Note, The 
 consideration of Christ's coming to us saves us from being comfortless 
 in his removals from us; for, if he <I>depart for a season,</I> it is 
 <I>that we may receive him for ever.</I> Let this moderate our grief, 
 <I>The Lord is at hand.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He promises that they should continue their acquaintance with him 
 and interest in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):

 <I>Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more,</I> that is, Now 
 I am no more in the world. After his death, <I>the world saw him no 
 more,</I> for, though he rose to life, he never <I>showed himself to 
 all the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:41">Acts x. 41</A>.

 The malignant world thought they had seen enough of him, and <I>cried,
 Away with him; crucify him;</I> and so shall their doom be; they shall 
 see him no more. Those only that see Christ with an eye of faith shall 
 see him for ever. The world sees him no more till his second coming; 
 but his disciples have communion with him in his absence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>You see me,</I> and shall continue to see me, when <I>the world 
 sees me no more.</I> They saw him with their bodily eyes after his 
 resurrection, for he showed himself to them <I>by many infallible 
 proofs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:8">Acts i. 8</A>.

 And <I>then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord.</I> They
 saw him with an eye of faith after his ascension, sitting at God's 
 right hand, as Lord of all; saw that in him which the world saw 
 not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>Because I live, you shall live also.</I> That which grieved them 
 was, that their Master was dying, and they counted upon nothing else 
 but to die with him. No, saith Christ, 

 (1.) <I>I live;</I> this the great God glories in, <I>I live,</I> saith 
 the Lord, and Christ saith the same; not only, I shall live, as he 
 saith of them, but, I do live; for he has <I>life in himself,</I> and 
 <I>lives for evermore.</I> We are not comfortless, while <I>we know 
 that our Redeemer lives.</I> 

 (2.) Therefore <I>you shall live also.</I> Note, The life of Christians 
 is bound up in the life of Christ; as sure and as long as he lives, 
 those that by faith are united to him shall live also; they shall live 
 spiritually, a divine life in communion with God. This life is hid with 
 Christ; if the head and root live, the members and branches live also.
 They shall <I>live eternally;</I> their bodies shall rise in the virtue 
 of Christ's resurrection; it will be well with them in the world to 
 come. It cannot but be well with all that are his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:19">Isa. xxvi. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. You shall have the assurance of this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>At that day,</I> when I am glorified, when the Spirit is poured out, 
 <I>you shall know</I> more clearly and certainly than you do now that 
 <I>I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</I> 

 (1.) These glorious mysteries will be fully known in heaven; <I>At that 
 day,</I> when I shall receive you to myself, you shall know perfectly 
 that which now you <I>see through a glass darkly.</I> Now it appears 
 not <I>what we shall be,</I> but then it will appear what we were. 

 (2.) They were more fully known after the pouring out of the Spirit 
 upon the apostles; at that day divine light should shine, and their 
 eyes should see more clearly, their knowledge should greatly advance 
 and increase then, would become more extensive and more distinct, and 
 like the blind man's at the second touch of Christ's hand, who at first 
 only <I>saw men as trees walking.</I> 

 (3.) They are known by all that receive the Spirit of truth, to their 
 abundant satisfaction, for in the knowledge of this is founded their 
 <I>fellowship with the Father</I> and <I>his Son Jesus Christ.</I> They 
 know, 

 [1.] That <I>Christ is in the Father,</I> is one with the Father, by 
 their experience of what he has wrought for them and in them; they find 
 what an admirable consent and harmony there is between Christianity and 
 natural religion, that that is grafted into this, and so they know that 
 Christ <I>is in the Father.</I> 

 [2.] That Christ is in them; experienced Christians know by the Spirit 
 that Christ abides in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:24">1 John iii. 24</A>.

 [3.] That they are in Christ, for the relation is mutual, and equally
 near on both sides, Christ in them and they in Christ, which speaks an 
 intimate and inseparable union; in the virtue of which it is that 
 <I>because he lives they shall live also.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> Union 
 with Christ is the life of believers; and their relation to him, and to 
 God through him, is their felicity. <I>Secondly,</I> The knowledge of
 this union is their unspeakable joy and satisfaction; they were now in 
 Christ, and he in them, but he speaks of it as a further act of grace 
 that they should know it, and have the comfort of it. An interest in 
 Christ and the knowledge of it are sometimes separated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He promises that he would love them, and manifest himself to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:21-24"><I>v.</I> 21-24</A>.

 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who they are whom Christ will look upon, and accept, as lovers of 
 him; those that <I>have his commandments, and keep them.</I> By this 
 Christ shows that the kind things he here said to his disciples were 
 intended not for those only that were <I>now</I> his <I>followers,</I> 
 but for all that should <I>believe in him through their word.</I> Here 
 is, 

 (1.) The duty of those who claim the dignity of being disciples.
 Having Christ's commandments, we must keep them; as Christians in name 
 and profession we have Christ's commandments, we have them sounding in 
 our ears, written before our eyes, we have the knowledge of them; but 
 this is not enough; would we approve ourselves Christians indeed, we 
 must keep them. Having them in our heads, we must keep them in our 
 hearts and lives. 

 (2.) The dignity of those that do the duty of disciples. They are 
 looked upon by Christ to be such as love him. Not those that have the 
 greatest wit and know how to talk for him, but those that <I>keep his 
 commandments.</I> Note, The surest evidence of our love to Christ is 
 obedience to the laws of Christ. Such is the love of a subject to his 
 sovereign, a dutiful, respectful, obediential love, a conformity to his 
 will, and satisfaction in his wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What returns he will make to them for their love; rich returns; 
 there is no love lost upon Christ. 

 (1.) They shall have the Father's love: <I>He that loveth me shall be 
 loved of my Father.</I> We could not love God if he did not first, out 
 of his good-will to us, give us his grace to love him; but there is a 
 love of complacency promised to those that do love God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:17">Prov. viii. 17</A>.

 He loves them, and lets them know that he loves them, smiles upon them, 
 and embraces them. God so loves the Son as to love all those that love 
 him.

 (2.) They shall have Christ's love: <I>And I will love him,</I> as 
 God-man, as Mediator. God will love him as a Father, and I will love 
 him as a brother, an elder brother. The Creator will love him, and be 
 the felicity of his being; the Redeemer will love him, and be the 
 protector of his well-being. In the nature of God, nothing shines more 
 brightly than this, that <I>God is love.</I> And in the undertaking of 
 Christ nothing appears more glorious than this, that <I>he loved 
 us.</I> Now both these loves are the crown and comfort, the <I>grace 
 and glory,</I> which shall be to all those that <I>love the Lord Jesus 
 Christ in sincerity.</I> Christ was now leaving his disciples, but 
 promises to continue his love to them; for he not only retains a 
 kindness for believers, though absent, but is doing them kindness while 
 absent, for he bears them on his heart, and ever lives interceding for 
 them. 

 (3.) They shall have the comfort of that love: <I>I will manifest 
 myself to him.</I> Some understand it of Christ's showing himself alive 
 to his disciples after his resurrection; but, being promised to all 
 that <I>love him and keep his commandments,</I> it must be construed so 
 as to extend to them. There is a spiritual manifestation of Christ and
 his love made to all believers. When he enlightens their minds to know 
 his love, and the dimensions of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:18,19">Eph. iii. 18, 19</A>),

 enlivens their graces, and draws them into exercise, and thus enlarges 
 their comforts in himself--when he clears up the evidences of their 
 interest in him, and gives them tokens of his love, experience of his 
 tenderness, and earnests of his kingdom and glory,--then he manifests 
 himself to them; and Christ is manifested to none but those to whom he 
 is pleased to manifest himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What occurred upon Christ's making this promise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) One of the disciples expresses his wonder and surprise at it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Observe,

 [1.] Who it was that said this--<I>Judas, not Iscariot.</I> Judah, or 
 Judas, was a famous name; the most famous tribe in Israel was that of 
 Judah; two of Christ's disciples were of that name: one of them was the 
 traitor, the other was the brother of James

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:16">Luke vi. 16</A>),
 
 one of those that were akin to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:55">Matt. xiii. 55</A>.

 He is called <I>Lebbeus</I> and <I>Thaddeus,</I> was the penman of the 
 last of the epistles, which in our translation, for distinction's sake, 
 we call <I>the epistle of Jude.</I> This was he that spoke here. 
 Observe, <I>First,</I> There was a very good man, and a very bad man, 
 called by the same name; for names commend us not to God, nor do they 
 make men worse. Judas the apostle was never the worse, nor Judas the 
 apostate ever the better, for being namesakes. But, <I>Secondly,</I> 
 The evangelist carefully distinguishes between them; when he speaks of 
 this pious Judas, he adds, <I>not Iscariot.</I> Take heed of mistaking; 
 let us not confound the precious and the vile. 

 [2.] What he said--<I>Lord how is it?</I> which intimates either, 
 <I>First,</I> the weakness of his understanding. So some take it. He 
 expected the temporal kingdom of the Messiah, that it should appear in 
 external pomp and power, such as all the world would wonder after. 
 "How, then," thinks he, "should it be confined to us only?" <B><I>ti 
 gegonen</I></B>--"<I>what is the matter</I> now, that thou wilt not 
 show thyself openly as is expected, that <I>the Gentiles may come to 
 thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising?</I>" Note, We 
 create difficulties to ourselves by mistaking the nature of Christ's 
 kingdom, as if it were of this world. Or, <I>Secondly,</I> as
 expressing the strength of his affections, and the humble and thankful 
 sense he had of Christ's distinguishing favours to them: <I>Lord, how 
 is it?</I> He is amazed at the condescensions of divine grace, as 
 David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:18">2 Sam. vii. 18</A>.

 What is there in us to deserve so great a favour? Note,

 1. Christ's manifesting himself to his disciples is done in a
 distinguishing way-to them, and <I>not to the world</I> that <I>sits in 
 darkness;</I> to the <I>base,</I> and not to the <I>mighty</I> and 
 <I>noble;</I> to <I>babes,</I> and not to the <I>wise</I> and 
 <I>prudent.</I> Distinguishing favours are very obliging; considering 
 who are passed by, and who are pitched upon. 

 2. It is justly <I>marvellous in our eyes;</I> for it is
 unaccountable, and must be resolved into free and sovereign grace. 
 <I>Even so, Father, because it seemed good unto thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ, in answer hereto, explains and confirms what he had said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 He overlooks what infirmity there was in what Judas spoke, and goes on 
 with his comforts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He further explains the condition of the promise, which was loving 
 him, and keeping his commandments. And, as to this, he shows what an 
 inseparable connection there is between love and obedience; love is the 
 root, obedience is the fruit. <I>First,</I> Where a sincere love to
 Christ is in the heart, there will be obedience: "<I>If a man love 
 me</I> indeed, that love will be such a commanding constraining 
 principle in him, that, no question, he will <I>keep my words.</I>" 
 Where there is true love to Christ there is a value for his favour, a 
 veneration for his authority, and an entire surrender of the whole man 
 to his direction and government. Where love is, duty follows of course, 
 is easy and natural, and flows from a principle of gratitude.
 <I>Secondly,</I> On the other hand, where there is no true love to 
 Christ there will be no care to obey him: <I>He that loveth me not 
 keepeth not my sayings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 This comes in here as a discovery of those that <I>do not love 
 Christ;</I> whatever they pretend, certainly those do not love him that 
 believe not his truths, and obey not his laws, to whom Christ's sayings 
 are but as idle tales, which he heeds not, or hard sayings, which he 
 likes not. It is also a reason why Christ will not manifest himself to 
 the world that doth not <I>love him,</I> because they put this affront 
 upon him, not to <I>keep his sayings;</I> why should Christ be familiar 
 with those that will be strange to him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He further explains the promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>If a man thus love me, I will manifest myself to him. First, My 
 Father will love him;</I> this he had said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 and here repeats it for the confirming of our faith; because it is hard 
 to imagine that the great god should make those the objects of his love 
 that had made themselves <I>vessels of his wrath.</I> Jude wondered 
 that Christ should <I>manifest himself to them;</I> but this answers 
 it, "If my Father love you, why should not I be free with you?" 
 <I>Secondly, We will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</I> 
 This explains the meaning of Christ's manifesting himself to him, and 
 magnifies the favour. 

 1. Not only,<I>I will,</I> but, <I>We will, I and the Father,</I> who,
 in this, <I>are one.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The light and love of God are communicated to man in the light and love 
 of the Redeemer, so that wherever Christ is formed the image of God is 
 stamped. 

 2. Not only, "<I>I will show myself to him</I> at a distance," but,
 "<I>We will come to him,</I> to be near him, to be with him," such are 
 the powerful influences of divine graces and comforts upon the souls of 
 those that love Christ in sincerity. 

 3. Not only, "I will give him a transient view of me, or make him a
 short and running visit," but, <I>We will take up our abode with 
 him</I> which denotes complacency in him and constancy to him. God will 
 not only love obedient believers, but he will take a pleasure in loving 
 them, will rest in love to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:17">Zeph. iii. 17</A>.

 He will be with them as at his home.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] He gives a good reason both to bind us to observe the condition 
 and encourage us to depend upon the promise. <I>The word which you hear 
 is not mine, but his that sent me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 To this purport he had often spoken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:16,8:28,12:44"><I>ch.</I> vii. 16; viii. 28; xii. 44</A>),

 and here it comes in very pertinently. <I>First,</I> the stress of duty
 is laid upon the precept of Christ as our rule, and justly, for that 
 word of Christ which we are to keep is the Father's word, and his will 
 the Father's will. <I>Secondly,</I> The stress of our comfort is laid
 upon the promise of Christ. But forasmuch as, in dependence upon that 
 promise, we must deny ourselves, and take up our cross, and quit all, 
 it concerns us to enquire whether the security be sufficient for us to 
 venture our all upon; and this satisfies us that it is, that the 
 promise is not Christ's bare word, but the Father's which sent him, 
 which therefore we may rely upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  These things have I spoken unto you, being <I>yet</I> present
 with you.
 &nbsp; 26  But the Comforter, <I>which is</I> the Holy Ghost, whom the
 Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and
 bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
 you.
 &nbsp; 27  Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things Christ here comforts his disciples with:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That they should be under the tuition of his Spirit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>,

 where we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The reflection Christ would have them make upon the instructions he 
 had given them: <I>These things have I spoken unto you</I> (referring 
 to all the good lessons he had taught them, since they entered 
 themselves into his school), <I>being yet present with you.</I> This 
 intimates, 

 (1.) That what he had said he did not retract nor unsay, but ratify it, 
 or stand to it. What he had spoken he had spoken, and would abide by 
 it. 

 (2.) That he had improved the opportunity of his bodily presence with 
 them to the utmost: "As long as I have been yet present with them, you 
 know I have lost no time." Note, When our teachers are about to be 
 removed from us we should call to mind what they have spoken, <I>being 
 yet present with us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The encouragement given them to expect another teacher, and that 
 Christ would find out a way of speaking to them after his departure 
 from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 He had told them before that the Father would give them this other 
 comforter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and here he returns to speak of it again; for as the promise of the 
 Messiah had been, so the promise of the Spirit now was, the consolation 
 of Israel. Two things he here tells them further concerning the sending 
 of the Holy Ghost:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) On whose account he should be sent: "The Father will send him 
 <I>in my name;</I> that is, for <I>my sake,</I> at my special instance 
 and request:" or, "as my agent and representative." He came in his 
 Father's name, as his ambassador: the Spirit comes in his name, as 
 resident in his absence, to carry on his undertaking, and to ripen 
 things for his second coming. Hence he is called <I>the Spirit of 
 Christ,</I> for he pleads his cause, and does his work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) On what errand he should be sent; two things he shall do:--

 [1.] <I>He shall teach you all things,</I> as a Spirit of wisdom and 
 revelation Christ was a teacher to his disciples; if he leave them now 
 that they have made so little proficiency, what will become of them?
 Why, the Spirit shall teach them, shall be their standing tutor. He 
 shall teach them all things necessary for them either to learn 
 themselves, or to teach others. For those that would teach the things 
 of God must first themselves be taught of God; this is the Spirit's 
 work. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:21">Isa. lix. 21</A>.

 [2.] <I>He shall bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have
 said unto you.</I> Many a good lesson Christ had taught them, which 
 they had forgotten, and which would be to seek when they had occasion 
 for it. Many things they did not retain the remembrance of, because 
 they did not rightly understand the meaning of them. The Spirit shall 
 not teach them a new gospel, but bring to their minds that which they 
 had been taught, by leading them into the understanding of it. The 
 apostles were all of them to preach, and some of them to write, the 
 things that Jesus did and taught, to transmit them to distant nations 
 and future ages; now, if they had been left to themselves herein, some 
 needful things might have been forgotten, others misrepresented, 
 through the treachery of their memories; therefore the Spirit is 
 promised to enable them truly to relate and record what Christ said 
 unto them. And to all the saints the Spirit of grace is given to be a 
 remembrancer, and to him by faith and prayer we should commit the 
 keeping of what we hear and know.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That they should be under the influence of his peace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):
 
 <I>Peace I leave with you.</I> When Christ was about to leave the world 
 he <I>made his will.</I> His soul he committed to his Father; his body 
 he bequeathed to Joseph, to be decently interred; his clothes fell to 
 the soldiers; his mother he left to the care of John: but what should 
 he leave to his poor disciples, that had left all for him? Silver and 
 gold he had none; but he left them that which was infinitely better, 
 <I>his peace.</I> <I>"I leave you,</I> but I leave <I>my peace</I> with 
 you. I not only give you a title to it, but put you in possession of 
 it." He did not part in anger, but in love; for this was his farewell, 
 <I>Peace I leave with you,</I> as a dying father leaves portions to his 
 children; and this is a <I>worthy portion.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The legacy that is here bequeathed <I>Peace, my peace.</I> Peace is 
 put for all good, and Christ has left us all needful good, all that is 
 really and truly good, as all the purchased promised good. Peace is put 
 for reconciliation and love; the peace bequeathed is peace with God, 
 peace with one another; peace <I>in our own bosoms</I> seems to be 
 especially meant; a tranquillity of mind arising from a sense of our 
 justification before God. It is the counterpart of our pardons, and the 
 composure of our minds. This Christ calls <I>his</I> peace, for he is 
 himself our peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14">Eph. ii. 14</A>.

 It is the peace he purchased for us and preached to us, and on which
 the angels congratulated men at his birth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:14">Luke ii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To whom this legacy is bequeathed: "To you, my disciples and 
 followers, that will be exposed to trouble, and have need of peace; to 
 you that are the sons of peace, and are qualified to receive it." This 
 legacy was left to them as the representatives of the church, to them 
 and their successors, to them and all true Christians in all ages.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. In what manner it is left: <I>Not as the world giveth, give I unto 
 you.</I> That is, 

 (1.) "I do not compliment you with <I>Peace be unto you;</I> no, it is 
 not a mere formality, but a real blessing." 

 (2.) "The peace I give is of such a nature that the smiles of the world 
 cannot give it, nor the frowns of the world take it away." Or, 

 (3.) "The gifts I give to you are not such as this world gives to its 
 children and votaries, to whom it is kind." The world's gifts concern 
 only the body and time; Christ's gifts enrich the soul for eternity: 
 the world gives lying vanities, and that which will cheat us; Christ 
 gives substantial blessings, which will never fail us: the world gives 
 and takes; Christ gives a good part that shall <I>never be taken 
 away.</I> 

 (4.) The peace which Christ gives is infinitely more valuable than that 
 which the world gives. The world's peace begins in ignorance, consists 
 with sin, and ends in endless troubles; Christ's peace begins in grace, 
 consists with no allowed sin, and ends at length in everlasting peace. 
 As is the difference between a killing lethargy and a reviving 
 refreshing sleep, such is the difference between Christ's peace and the 
 world's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. What use they should make of it: <I>Let not your heart be 
 troubled,</I> for any evils past or present, <I>neither let it be 
 afraid</I> of any evil to come. Note, Those that are interested in the 
 covenant of grace, and entitled to the peace which Christ gives, ought 
 not to yield to overwhelming griefs and fears. This comes in here as 
 the conclusion of the whole matter; he had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>Let not your heart be troubled,</I> and here he repeats it as that 
 for which he had now given sufficient reason.</P>

 <TR><TD><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Christ's Consolatory Discourse.</I></FONT></TD>
 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come
 <I>again</I> unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I
 said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
 &nbsp; 29  And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when
 it is come to pass, ye might believe.
 &nbsp; 30  Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of
 this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.
 &nbsp; 31  But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as
 the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go
 hence.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ here gives his disciples another reason why their hearts should 
 not be troubled for his going away; and that is, because his heart was 
 not. And here he tells them what it was that enabled him to endure the 
 cross and despise the shame, that they might <I>look unto him,</I> and 
 <I>run with patience.</I> He comforted himself,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That, though he went away, he should <I>come again: "You have heard 
 how I have said,</I> and now I say it again, <I>I go away, and come 
 again.</I>" Note, What we have heard of the doctrine of Christ, 
 especially concerning his second coming, we have need to be told again 
 and again. When we are under the power of any transport of passion, 
 grief, or fear, or care, we forget that Christ will come again. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:5">Phil. iv. 5</A>.

 Christ encouraged himself with <I>this,</I> in his sufferings and
 death, that he should <I>come again,</I> and the same should comfort us 
 in our departure at death; we go away to come again; the leave we take 
 of our friends at that parting is only a good night, not a final 
 farewell. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:13,14">1 Thess. iv. 13, 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That he <I>went to his Father: "If you loved me,</I> as by your 
 sorrow you say you do, <I>you would rejoice</I> instead of mourning, 
 because, though I leave you, yet I said, <I>I go unto the Father,</I> 
 not only mine, but yours, which will be my advancement and your 
 advantage; for <I>my Father is greater than I.</I>" Observe here, 

 1. It is matter of joy to Christ's disciples that he is gone to the 
 Father, to take possession for orphans, and make intercession for 
 transgressors. His departure had a bright side as well as a dark side.
 Therefore he sent this message after his resurrection

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17"><I>ch.</I> xx. 17</A>),

 <I>I ascend to my Father and your Father,</I> as most comfortable. 

 2. The reason of this is, because <I>the Father is greater than
 he,</I> which, if it be a proper proof of that for which it is alleged 
 (as no doubt it is), must be understood thus, that his state with his 
 Father would be much more excellent and glorious than his present 
 state; his returning to his Father (so Dr. Hammond) would be the 
 advancing of him to a much higher condition than that which he was now 
 in. Or thus, His going to the Father himself, and bringing all his 
 followers to him there, was the ultimate end of his undertaking, and 
 therefore greater than the means. Thus Christ raises the thoughts and 
 expectations of his disciples to something greater than that in which 
 now they thought all their happiness bound up. The kingdom of the 
 Father, wherein he shall be all in all, will be greater than the 
 mediatorial kingdom. 

 3. The disciples of Christ should show that they love him by their
 rejoicing in the glories of his exaltation, rather than by lamenting 
 the sorrows of his humiliation, and rejoicing that he is gone to his 
 Father, where he would be, and where we shall be shortly with him. Many 
 that love Christ, let their love run out in a wrong channel; they think 
 if they love him they must be continually in pain because of him; 
 whereas those that love him should <I>dwell at ease</I> in him, should 
 <I>rejoice in Christ Jesus.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That his going away, compared with the prophecies which went 
 before of it, would be a means of confirming the faith of his disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 "<I>I have told you before it come to pass</I> that I must die and rise 
 again, and ascend to the Father, and send the Comforter, <I>that, when 
 it is come to pass, you might believe.</I>" See this reason,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:19,16:4"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 19; xvi. 4</A>.

 Christ told his disciples of his death, though he knew it would both
 puzzle them and grieve them, because it would afterwards redound to the
 confirmation of their faith in two things:--

 1. That he who foretold these things had a divine prescience, and knew
 beforehand what day would bring forth. When St. Paul was going to
 Jerusalem, he <I>knew not the things that did abide him there,</I> but
 Christ did. 

 2. That the things foretold were according to the divine purpose and
 designation, not sudden resolves, but the counterparts of an eternal
 counsel. Let them therefore not be troubled at that which would be for
 the confirmation of their faith, and so would redound to their real
 benefit; for the <I>trial of our faith</I> is very precious, though it
 cost us present <I>heaviness, through manifold temptations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:6">1 Pet. i. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That he was sure of a victory over Satan, with whom he knew he was 
 to have a struggle in his departure 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "<I>Henceforth I will not talk much with you,</I> having not much to 
 say, but what may be adjourned to the pouring out of the Spirit." He 
 had a great deal of good talk with them after this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:1-16:33"><I>ch.</I> xv. and xvi.</A>),

 but, in comparison with what he had said, it was not much. His time was
 now short, and he therefore spoke largely to them now, because the 
 opportunity would soon be over. Note, We should always endeavour to 
 talk to the purpose, because perhaps we may not have time to talk much.
 We know not how soon our breath may be stopped, and therefore should be 
 always breathing something that is good. When we come to be sick and 
 die, perhaps we may not be capable of talking much to those about us; 
 and therefore what good counsel we have to give them, let us give it 
 while we are in health. One reason why he would not talk much with them 
 was because he had now other work to apply himself to: <I>The prince of 
 this world comes.</I> He called the devil the <I>prince of this 
 world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:31"><I>ch.</I> xii. 31</A>.

 The disciples dreamed of their Master being the prince of this world,
 and they worldly princes under him. But Christ tells them that the 
 <I>prince of this world</I> was his enemy, and so were the <I>princes 
 of this world,</I> that were actuated and ruled by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>.

 But <I>he has nothing in me.</I> Observe here,

 1. The prospect Christ had of an approaching conflict, not only with
 men, but with the powers of darkness. The devil had set upon him with 
 his temptations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:1-11">Matt. iv.</A>),

 had
 offered him the <I>kingdoms of this world,</I> if he would hold them as 
 tributary to him, with an eye to which Christ calls him, in disdain, 
 <I>the prince of this world. Then the devil departed from him for a 
 season;</I> "But now," says Christ, "I see him rallying again, 
 preparing to make a furious onset, and so to gain by terrors that which 
 he could not gain by allurements;" to frighten from his undertaking, 
 when he could not entice from it. Note, The foresight of a temptation 
 gives us great advantage in our resistance of it; for, being 
 fore-warned, we should be fore-armed. While we are here, we may see 
 Satan continually coming against us, and ought therefore to be always 
 upon our guard.

 2. The assurance he had of good success in the conflict: <I>He hath 
 nothing in me,</I> <B><I>ouk echei ouden</I></B>--<I>He hath nothing at 
 all.</I> 

 (1.) There was no guilt in Christ to give authority to <I>the prince of 
 this world</I> in his terrors. The devil is said to have <I>the power 
 of death</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14">Heb. ii. 14</A>);

 the Jews called him <I>the angel of death,</I> as an executioner. Now 
 Christ having done no evil, Satan had no legal power against him, and 
 therefore, though he prevailed to crucify him, he could not prevail to 
 terrify him; though he hurried him to death, yet not to despair. When 
 Satan comes to disquiet us, he has something in us to perplex us with, 
 for we have all sinned; but, when he would disturb Christ, he found no 
 occasion against him. 

 (2.) There was no corruption in Christ, to give advantage to <I>the 
 prince of this world</I> in his temptations. He could not crush his 
 undertaking by drawing him to sin, because there was nothing sinful in 
 him, nothing irregular for his temptations to fasten upon, no tinder 
 for him to strike fire into; such was the spotless purity of his nature 
 that he was above the possibility of sinning. The more Satan's interest 
 in us is crushed and decays, the more comfortably may we expect 
 sufferings and death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That his departure was in compliance with, and obedience to, his 
 Father. Satan could not force his life from him, and yet he would die: 
 <I>that the world may know that I love the Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 We may take this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As confirming what he had often said, that his undertaking, as 
 Mediator, was a demonstration to the world, 

 (1.) Of his compliance with the Father; hereby it appeared that he 
 loved the Father. As it was an evidence of his love to man that he died 
 for his salvation, so it was of his love to God that he died for his 
 glory and the accomplishing of his purposes. Let the world know that 
 between the Father and the Son there is not love lost. <I>As the Father 
 loved the Son, and gave all things into his hands;</I> so <I>the Son 
 loved the Father,</I> and <I>gave his spirit into his hand.</I> 

 (2.) Of his obedience to his Father: "<I>As the Father gave me 
 commandment, even so I</I> did--did the thing commanded me in the 
 manner commanded." Note, The best evidence of our love to the Father is 
 our doing as he hath given us commandment. As Christ loved the Father, 
 and obeyed him, <I>even to the death,</I> so we must love Christ, and 
 obey him. Christ's eye to the Father's commandment, obliging him to
 suffer and die, bore him up with cheerfulness, and overcame the 
 reluctancies of nature; this took off the offence of the cross, that 
 what he did was by order from the Father. The command of God is 
 sufficient to bear us out in that which is most disputed by others, and 
 therefore should be sufficient to bear us up in that which is most 
 difficult to ourselves: <I>This is the will of him</I> that made me, 
 <I>that sent me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As concluding what he had now said; having brought it to this, here 
 he leaves it: <I>that the world may know that I love the Father.</I> 
 You shall see how cheerfully I can meet the appointed cross: "<I>Arise, 
 let us go hence</I> to the garden;" so some; or, to <I>Jerusalem.</I> 
 When we talk of troubles at a distance, it is easy to say, <I>Lord, I 
 will follow thee whithersoever thou goest;</I> but when it comes to the 
 pinch, when an unavoidable cross lies in the way of duty, then to say, 
 "<I>Arise, let us go</I> to meet it," instead of going out of our way 
 to miss it, this lets <I>the world know that we love the Father.</I> If 
 this discourse was at the close of the passover-supper, it should seem 
 that at these words he arose from the table, and retired into the 
 drawing-room, where he might the more freely carry on the discourse 
 with his disciples in the following chapters, and pray with them. Dr. 
 Goodwin's remark upon this is, that Christ mentioning the great motive 
 of his sufferings, his Father's commandment, was in all haste to go 
 forth to suffer and die, was afraid of slipping the time of Judas's 
 meeting him: <I>Arise,</I> says he, <I>let us go hence</I> but he looks 
 upon the glass, as it were, sees it not quite out, and therefore sits 
 down again, and preaches another sermon. Now, 

 (1.) In these words he gives his disciples an encouragement to follow 
 him. He does not say, <I>I must go;</I> but, <I>Let us go.</I> He calls 
 them out to no hardships but what he himself goes before them in as 
 their leader. They had promised they would not desert him: "Come," says 
 he, "<I>let us go</I> then; let us see how you will make the words 
 good." 

 (2.) He gives them an example, teaching them at all times, especially 
 in suffering times, to sit loose to all things here below, and often to 
 think and speak of leaving them. Though we sit easy, and in the midst 
 of the delights of an agreeable conversation, yet we must not think of 
 being here always: <I>Arise, let us go hence.</I> If it was at the 
 close of the paschal and eucharistical supper, it teaches us that the 
 solemnities of our communion with God are not to be constant in this 
 world. When we sit down under Christ's shadow with delight, and say, 
 <I>It is good to be here;</I> yet we must think of rising and going 
 hence; going down from the mount.</P>
