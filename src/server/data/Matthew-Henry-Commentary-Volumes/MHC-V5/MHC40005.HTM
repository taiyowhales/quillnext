 This chapter, and the two that follow it, are a sermon; a famous 
 sermon; the sermon upon the mount. It is the longest and fullest 
 continued discourse of our Saviour that we have upon record in all the 
 gospels. It is a practical discourse; there is not much of the credenda 
 of Christianity in it--the things to be believed, but it is wholly taken
 up with the agenda--the things to be done; these Christ began with in
 his preaching; for if any man will do his will, he shall know of the 
 doctrine, whether it be of God. The circumstances of the sermon being 
 accounted for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 the sermon itself follows, the scope of which is, not to fill our heads
 with notions, but to guide and regulate our practice.

 I. He proposes blessedness as the end, and gives us the character of
 those who are entitled to blessedness (very different from the
 sentiments of a vain world), in eight beatitudes, which may justly be
 called paradoxes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:3-12">ver. 3-12</A>.

 II. He prescribes duty as the way, and gives us standing rules of that
 duty. He directs his disciples, 

 1. To understand what they are--the salt of the earth, and the lights 
 of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.

 2. To understand what they have to do--they are to be governed by the 
 moral law. Here is, 

 (1.) A general ratification of the law, and a recommendation of it to 
 us, as our rule, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>.

 (2.) A particular rectification of divers mistakes; or, rather, a 
 reformation of divers wilful, gross corruptions, which the scribes and 
 Pharisees had introduced in their exposition of the law; and an 
 authentic explication of divers branches which most needed to be 
 explained and vindicated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:20">ver. 20</A>.

 Particularly, here is an explication, 

 [1.] Of the sixth commandment, which forbids murder,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:21-26">ver. 21-26</A>.

 [2.] Of the seventh commandment, against adultery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:27-32">ver. 27-32</A>.

 [3.] Of the third commandment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:33-37">ver. 33-37</A>.

 [4.] Of the law of retaliation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:38-42">ver. 38-42</A>.

 [5.] Of the law of brotherly love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:43-48">ver. 43-48</A>.

 And the scope of the whole is, to show that the law is spiritual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and
 when he was set, his disciples came unto him:
 &nbsp; 2  And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a general account of this sermon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>The Preacher</I> was our Lord Jesus, the Prince of preachers, the 
 great Prophet of his church, who <I>came into the world,</I> to be 
 <I>the Light of the world.</I> The prophets and John had <I>done 
 virtuously</I> in preaching, <I>but</I> Christ <I>excelled them 
 all.</I> He is the eternal Wisdom, <I>that lay in the bosom of the 
 Father, before all worlds,</I> and perfectly knew his will 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18">John i. 18</A>);
 
 and he is the eternal Word, by whom he <I>has in these last days spoken
 to us.</I> The many miraculous cures wrought by Christ in Galilee, 
 which we read of in the close of the foregoing chapter, were intended 
 to make way for this sermon, and to dispose people to receive 
 instructions from one in whom there appeared so much of a divine power 
 and goodness; and, probably, this sermon was the summary, or rehearsal, 
 of what he had preached up and down in the synagogues of Galilee. His 
 text <I>was, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</I> This is 
 a sermon on the former part of that text, showing what it is to 
 <I>repent;</I> it is to reform, both in judgment and practice; and here 
 he tells us wherein, in answer to that question 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:7">Mal. iii. 7</A>),

 <I>Wherein shall we return?</I> He afterward preached upon the latter
 part of the text, when, in divers parables, he showed what the kingdom 
 of heaven is like,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:1-52"><I>ch.</I> xiii.</A></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>The place</I> was a mountain in Galilee. As in other things, so 
 in this, our Lord Jesus was but ill accommodated; he had no convenient 
 place to preach in, any more than <I>to lay his head</I> on. While the 
 scribes and Pharisees had Moses' chair to sit in, with all possible 
 ease, honour, and state, and there corrupted the law; our Lord Jesus, 
 the great Teacher of truth, is driven out to the desert, and finds no 
 better a pulpit than <I>a mountain</I> can afford; and not one of the 
 <I>holy mountains</I> neither, not one of <I>the mountains of Zion,</I>
 but a common <I>mountain;</I> by which Christ would intimate that there 
 is no such distinguishing holiness of places now, under the gospel, as 
 there was under the law; but that it is <I>the will of God that men 
 should pray</I> and preach <I>every where,</I> any where, provided it 
 be decent and convenient. Christ preached this sermon, which was an 
 exposition of the law, upon a mountain, because upon a <I>mountain</I> 
 the law was given; and this was also a solemn promulgation of the 
 Christian law. But observe the difference: when <I>the law was 
 given,</I> the Lord <I>came down</I> upon the <I>mountain;</I> now the 
 Lord <I>went up:</I> then, he spoke <I>in thunder and lightning;</I> 
 now, <I>in a still small voice:</I> then the people were ordered to 
 keep their distance; now they are invited to draw near: a blessed 
 change! If God's grace and goodness are (as they certainly are) his 
 glory, then the glory of the gospel is the glory that excels, for
 <I>grace and truth came by Jesus Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:7,Heb+12:18">2 Cor. iii. 7; Heb. xii. 18</A>,

 &c. It was foretold of Zebulun and Issachar, two of the tribes of
 Galilee 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:19">Deut. xxxiii. 19</A>),

 that <I>they shall call the people to the mountain;</I> to this
 <I>mountain</I> we are called, to learn <I>to offer the sacrifices of 
 righteousness.</I> Now was this <I>the mountain of the Lord,</I> where 
 he <I>taught us his ways,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:2,3,Mic+4:1,2">Isa. ii. 2, 3; Mic. iv. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. <I>The auditors</I> were <I>his disciples,</I> who <I>came unto 
 him;</I> came at his call, as appears by comparing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:13,Lu+6:13">Mark iii. 13, Luke vi. 13</A>.
 
 To them he directed his speech, because they followed him for love and
 learning, while others attended him only for cures. <I>He taught 
 them,</I> because they were willing to be <I>taught (the meek will he 
 teach his way</I>); because they would <I>understand</I> what he 
 taught, which to others was foolishness; and because they were to teach 
 others; and it was therefore requisite that they should have a clear 
 and distinct knowledge of these things themselves. The duties 
 prescribed in this sermon were to be conscientiously performed by all 
 those that would <I>enter into that kingdom of heaven</I> which they 
 were sent to set up, with hope to have the benefit of it. But though 
 this discourse was directed to the disciples, it was in the hearing of 
 <I>the multitude;</I> for it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:28"><I>ch.</I> vii. 28</A>),

 <I>The people were astonished.</I> No bounds were set about <I>this
 mountain,</I> to keep the people off, as were about <I>mount Sinai</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:12">Exod. xix. 12</A>);

 for, through Christ, we have access to God, not only to speak to him,
 but to hear from him. Nay, he had an eye to the <I>multitude,</I> in 
 preaching this sermon. When the fame of his miracles had brought a vast 
 crowd together, he took the opportunity of so great a confluence of 
 people, to instruct them. Note, It is an encouragement to a faithful 
 minister to cast the net of the gospel where there are a great many 
 fishes, in hope that some will be caught. The sight of a
 <I>multitude</I> puts life into a preacher, which yet must arise from a 
 desire of their profit, not his own praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. <I>The solemnity</I> of his sermon is intimated in that word, 
 <I>when he was set.</I> Christ preached many times occasionally, and by 
 interlocutory discourses; but this was a set sermon, <B><I>kathisantos 
 autou</I></B>, when he had placed himself so as to be best heard. He 
 sat down as a Judge or Lawgiver. It intimates with what sedateness and 
 composure of mind the things of God should be spoken and heard. <I>He 
 sat,</I> that <I>the scriptures might be fulfilled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:3">Mal. iii. 3</A>),
 
 <I>He shall sit as a refiner,</I> to purge away the dross, the corrupt
 doctrines of the sons of Levi. He <I>sat</I> as <I>in the throne, 
 judging right</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:4">Ps. ix. 4</A>);

 for <I>the word he spoke shall judge us.</I> That phrase, <I>He opened
 his mouth,</I> is only a Hebrew periphrasis of speaking, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:1">Job iii. 1</A>.
 
 Yet some think it intimates the solemnity of this discourse; the
 congregation being large, he raised his voice, and spoke louder than 
 usual. He had spoken long <I>by his servants the prophets,</I> and 
 <I>opened their mouths</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:27,24:27,33:22">Ezek. iii. 27; xxiv. 27; xxxiii. 22</A>);

 but now <I>he opened his</I> own, and spoke with freedom, <I>as one
 having authority.</I> One of the ancients has this remark upon it; 
 Christ <I>taught</I> much without <I>opening his mouth,</I> that is, by
 his holy and exemplary life; nay, he <I>taught,</I> when, being <I>led 
 as a lamb to the slaughter, he opened not his mouth,</I> but now <I>he 
 opened his mouth, and taught,</I> that <I>the scriptures might be 
 fulfilled,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:1,2,6">Prov. viii. 1, 2, 6</A>.

 <I>Doth not wisdom cry--cry on the top of high places?</I> And <I>the 
 opening of her lips shall be right things. He taught them,</I> 
 according to the promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:13">Isa. liv. 13</A>),

 <I>All thy children shall be taught of the Lord;</I> for this purpose
 he had <I>the tongue of the learned</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:4">Isa. l. 4</A>),
 
 and <I>the Spirit of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1">Isa. lxi. 1</A>.
 
 <I>He taught them,</I> what was the evil they should abhor, and what
 was the good they should abide and abound in; for Christianity is not a 
 matter of speculation, but is designed to regulate the temper of our 
 minds and the tenour of our conversations; gospel-time is a time of 
 reformation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10">Heb. ix. 10</A>);

 and by the gospel we must be reformed, must be made good, must be made
 better. <I>The truth, as it is in Jesus,</I> is <I>the truth which is
 according to godliness,</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ begins his sermon with blessings, for <I>he came into the world 
 to bless us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:26">Acts iii. 26</A>),

 as <I>the great High Priest of our profession;</I> as <I>the blessed
 Melchizedec;</I> as He <I>in whom all the families of the earth should 
 be blessed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:3">Gen. xii. 3</A>.

 He came not only to purchase blessings for us, but to pour out and
 pronounce blessings on us; and here he does it <I>as one having 
 authority,</I> as one that can <I>command the blessing, even life for 
 evermore,</I> and that is the blessing here again and again promised to 
 the good; his pronouncing them happy makes them so; for those whom he 
 blesses, are blessed indeed. The Old Testament ended with a curse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:6">Mal. iv. 6</A>),

 the gospel begins with a blessing; for <I>hereunto are we called, that
 we should inherit the blessing.</I> Each of the blessings Christ here 
 pronounces has a double intention:

 1. To show who they are that are to be accounted truly happy, and what
 their characters are. 

 2. What that is wherein true happiness consists, in the promises made 
 to persons of certain characters, the performance of which will make 
 them happy. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This is designed to rectify the ruinous mistakes of a blind and 
 carnal world. Blessedness is the thing which men pretend to pursue; 
 <I>Who will make us to see good?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6">Ps. iv. 6</A>.

 But most mistake the end, and form a wrong notion of happiness; and
 then no wonder that they miss the way; they choose their own delusions, 
 and court a shadow. The general opinion is, <I>Blessed are they</I> 
 that are rich, and great, and honourable in the world; they spend their 
 days in mirth, and their years in pleasure; they eat the fat, and drink 
 the sweet, and carry all before them with a high hand, and have every 
 sheaf bowing to their sheaf; <I>happy the people that is in such a 
 case;</I> and their designs, aims, and purposes are accordingly; they 
 <I>bless the covetous</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:3">Ps. x. 3</A>);

 they <I>will be rich.</I> Now our Lord Jesus comes to correct this
 fundamental error, to advance a new hypothesis, and to give us quite 
 another notion of blessedness and blessed people, which, however 
 paradoxical it may appear to those who are prejudiced, yet is in 
 itself, and appears to be to all who are savingly enlightened, a rule 
 and doctrine of eternal truth and certainty, by which we must shortly 
 be judged. If this, therefore, be the beginning of Christ's doctrine, 
 the beginning of a Christian's practice must be to take his measures of 
 happiness from those maxims, and to direct his pursuits 
 accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is designed to remove the discouragements of the weak and poor 
 who receive the gospel, by assuring them that his gospel did not make 
 those only happy that were eminent in gifts, graces, comforts, and 
 usefulness; but that even <I>the least in the kingdom of heaven,</I> 
 whose heart was upright with God, was happy in the honours and 
 privileges of that kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is designed to invite souls to Christ, and to make way for his 
 law into their hearts. Christ's pronouncing these blessings, not at the 
 end of his sermon, to dismiss the people, but at the beginning of it, 
 to prepare them for what he had further to say to them, may remind us 
 of mount Gerizim and mount Ebal, on which the blessings and cursings of 
 the law were read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:12">Deut. xxvii. 12</A>,

 &c. <I>There</I> the curses are expressed, and the blessings only
 implied; <I>here</I> the blessings are expressed, and the curses 
 implied: in both, <I>life and death are set before us;</I> but the law 
 appeared more as a ministration of death, to deter us from sin; the 
 gospel as a dispensation of life, to allure us to Christ, in whom alone 
 all good is to be had. And those who had seen the gracious cures 
 wrought by his hand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:23,24"><I>ch.</I> iv. 23, 24</A>),

 and now heard <I>the gracious words proceeding out of his mouth,</I>
 would say that he was all of a piece, made up of love and 
 sweetness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. It is designed to settle and sum up the articles of agreement 
 between God and man. The scope of the divine revelation is to let us 
 know what God expects from us, and what we may then expect from him; 
 and no where is this more fully set forth in a few words than here, nor 
 with a more exact reference to each other; and this is that gospel 
 which we are required to believe; for what is faith but a conformity to 
 these characters, and a dependence upon these promises? The way to 
 happiness is here opened, and made a <I>highway</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8">Isa. xxxv. 8</A>);

 and this coming from the mouth of Jesus Christ, it is intimated that
 from him, and by him, we are to receive both the seed and the fruit, 
 both the grace required, and the glory promised. Nothing passes between 
 God and fallen man, but through his hand. Some of the wiser heathen had 
 notions of blessedness different from the rest of mankind, and looking 
 toward this of our Saviour. Seneca, undertaking to describe a blessed 
 man, makes it out, that it is only an honest, good man that is to be so 
 called: <I>De vita beata.</I> cap. 4. <I>Cui nullum bonum malumque sit, 
 nisi bonus malusque animus--Quem nec extollant fortuita, nec 
 frangant--Cui vera voluptas erit voluptatum comtemplio--Cui unum bonum 
 honestas, unum malum turpitudo.--In whose estimation nothing is good or 
 evil, but a good or evil heart--Whom no occurrences elate or 
 deject--Whose true pleasure consists in a contempt of pleasure--To whom 
 the only good is virtue, and the only evil vice.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Saviour here gives us eight characters of blessed people; which 
 represent to us the principal graces of a Christian. On each of them a 
 present blessing is pronounced; <I>Blessed are</I> they; and to each a 
 future blessing is promised, which is variously expressed, so as to 
 suit the nature of the grace or duty recommended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Do we ask then who are happy? It is answered,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>The poor in spirit</I> are happy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 There is a poor-spiritedness that is so far from making men blessed 
 that it is a sin and a snare--cowardice and base fear, and a willing 
 subjection to the lusts of men. But this poverty of spirit is a 
 gracious disposition of soul, by which we are emptied of self, in order 
 to our being filled with Jesus Christ. To be <I>poor in spirit</I> is, 

 1. To be contentedly poor, willing to be emptied of worldly wealth, if 
 God orders that to be our lot; to bring our mind to our condition, when 
 it is a low condition. Many are poor in the world, but high in spirit, 
 poor and proud, murmuring and complaining, and blaming their lot, but 
 we must accommodate ourselves to our poverty, must <I>know how to be 
 abased,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:12">Phil. iv. 12</A>.

 Acknowledging the wisdom of God in appointing us to poverty, we must be
 easy in it, patiently bear the inconveniences of it, be thankful for 
 what we have, and make the best of that which is. It is to sit loose to 
 all worldly wealth, and not set our hearts upon it, but cheerfully to 
 bear losses and disappointments which may befal us in the most 
 prosperous state. It is not, in pride or pretence, to make ourselves 
 poor, by throwing away what God has given us, especially as those in 
 the church of Rome, who vow poverty, and yet engross the wealth of the 
 nations; but if we be rich in the world we must be <I>poor in 
 spirit,</I> that is, we must condescend to the poor and sympathize with 
 them, as being touched with the feeling of their infirmities; we must 
 expect and prepare for poverty; must not inordinately fear or shun it, 
 but must bid it welcome, especially when it comes upon us for keeping a 
 good conscience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:34">Heb. x. 34</A>.

 Job was <I>poor in spirit,</I> when he blessed God in <I>taking
 away,</I> as well as giving.

 2. It is to be humble and lowly in our own eyes. To be <I>poor in 
 spirit,</I> is to think meanly of ourselves, of what we are, and have, 
 and do; the poor are often taken in the Old Testament for the humble 
 and self-denying, as opposed to those that are at ease, and the proud; 
 it is to be as little children in our opinion of ourselves, weak, 
 foolish, and insignificant,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:4,19:14"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 4; xix. 14</A>.

 Laodicea was <I>poor in spirituals,</I> wretchedly and miserably poor,
 and yet <I>rich in spirit,</I> so well increased with goods, as to 
 <I>have need of nothing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17">Rev. iii. 17</A>.

 On the other hand, Paul was rich in <I>spirituals,</I> excelling most 
 in gifts and graces, and yet <I>poor in spirit, the least of the 
 apostles,</I> less than the least of all saints, and <I>nothing</I> in 
 his own account. It is to look with a holy contempt upon ourselves, to 
 value others and undervalue ourselves in comparison of them. It is to 
 be willing to make ourselves cheap, and mean, and little, to do good; 
 to <I>become all things to all men.</I> It is to acknowledge that God 
 is great, and we are mean; that he is holy and we are sinful; that he 
 is all and we are nothing, less than nothing, worse than nothing; and 
 to humble ourselves before him, and under his mighty hand. 

 3. It is to come off from all confidence in our own righteousness and
 strength, that we may depend only upon the merit of Christ for our 
 justification, and the spirit and grace of Christ for our 
 sanctification. That <I>broken and contrite spirit</I> with which the 
 publican cried for mercy to a poor sinner, is that poverty of spirit.
 We must call ourselves poor, because always in want of God's grace, 
 always begging at God's door, always hanging on in his house.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 (1.) This poverty in spirit is put first among the Christian graces. 
 The philosophers did not reckon humility among their moral virtues, but 
 Christ puts it first. Self-denial is the first lesson to be learned in 
 his school, and poverty of spirit entitled to the first beatitude. The 
 foundation of all other graces is laid in humility. Those who would 
 build high must begin low; and it is an excellent preparative for the 
 entrance of gospel-grace into the soul; it fits the soil to receive the 
 seed. Those <I>who are weary and heavy laden,</I> are <I>the poor in
 spirit,</I> and they shall find rest with Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They are <I>blessed.</I> Now they are so, in this world. God looks 
 graciously upon them. They are his little ones, and have their angels. 
 To them he gives more grace; they live the most comfortable lives, and 
 are easy to themselves and all about them, and nothing comes amiss to 
 them; while high spirits are always uneasy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) <I>Theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</I> The kingdom of 
 <I>grace</I> is composed of such; they only are fit to be members of 
 Christ's church, which is called <I>the congregation of the poor</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:19">Ps. lxxiv. 19</A>);

 the kingdom of <I>glory</I> is prepared for them. Those who thus humble
 themselves, and comply with God when he humbles them, shall be thus 
 exalted. The great, high spirits go away with the glory of <I>the 
 kingdoms of the earth;</I> but the humble, mild, and yielding souls 
 obtain the glory of <I>the kingdom of heaven.</I> We are ready to think 
 concerning those who are rich, and do good with their riches, that, no 
 doubt, <I>theirs is the kingdom of heaven;</I> for they can thus lay up 
 in store a good security <I>for the time to come;</I> but what shall 
 the poor do, who have not wherewithal to do good? Why, the same 
 happiness is promised to those who are contentedly poor, as to those 
 who are usefully rich. If I am not able to <I>spend</I> cheerfully for 
 his sake, if I can but <I>want</I> cheerfully for his sake, even that 
 shall be recompensed. And do not we serve a good master then?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>They that mourn</I> are happy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 <I>Blessed are they that mourn.</I> This is another strange blessing, 
 and fitly follows the former. The poor are accustomed to mourn, the 
 graciously poor mourn graciously. We are apt to think, Blessed are the 
 <I>merry;</I> but Christ, who was himself a great mourner, says, 
 Blessed are the <I>mourners.</I> There is a sinful mourning, which is 
 an enemy to blessedness--<I>the sorrow of the world;</I> despairing 
 melancholy upon a spiritual account, and disconsolate grief upon a 
 temporal account. There is a natural mourning, which may prove a
 friend to blessedness, by the grace of God working with it, and 
 sanctifying the afflictions to us, for which we mourn. But there is a 
 gracious mourning, which qualifies for blessedness, an habitual 
 seriousness, the mind mortified to mirth, and an actual sorrow. 

 1. A penitential mourning for our own sins; this is <I>godly
 sorrow,</I> a sorrow according to God; sorrow for sin, with an eye to
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:10">Zech. xii. 10</A>.

 Those are God's mourners, who live a life of repentance, who lament the
 corruption of their nature, and their many actual transgressions, and 
 God's withdrawings from them; and who, out of regard to God's honour, 
 mourn also for the sins of others, and <I>sigh and cry for their 
 abominations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+9:4">Ezek. ix. 4</A>.

 2. A sympathizing mourning for the afflictions of others; the mourning
 of those who <I>weep with them that weep,</I> are sorrowful <I>for the 
 solemn assemblies, for the desolations of Zion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:18,Ps+137:1">Zeph. iii. 18; Ps. cxxxvii. 1</A>),

 especially who look with compassion on perishing souls, and <I>weep
 over</I> them, as Christ <I>over Jerusalem.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now these gracious mourners, 

 (1.) <I>Are blessed.</I> As in vain and sinful <I>laughter the heart is 
 sorrowful,</I> so in gracious mourning <I>the heart</I> has a serious 
 joy, a secret satisfaction, which a <I>stranger does not intermeddle 
 with.</I> They are <I>blessed,</I> for they are like the Lord Jesus, 
 who <I>was a man of sorrows,</I> and of whom we never read that he 
 laughed, but often that he wept. They are armed against the many
 temptations that attend vain mirth, and are prepared for the comforts 
 of a sealed pardon and a settled peace. 

 (2.) <I>They shall be comforted.</I> Though perhaps they are not 
 immediately comforted, yet plentiful provision is made for their 
 comfort; light is sown for them; and in heaven, it is certain, <I>they 
 shall be comforted,</I> as Lazarus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25">Luke xvi. 25</A>.

 Note, The happiness of heaven consists in being perfectly and eternally
 comforted, and in the <I>wiping away of all tears from their eyes.</I> 
 It <I>is the joy of our Lord; a fulness of joy and pleasures for 
 evermore;</I> which will be doubly sweet to those who have been 
 prepared for them by this <I>godly sorrow.</I> Heaven will be a heaven 
 indeed to those who go mourning thither; it will be a harvest of joy, 
 the return of a seed-time of tears

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:5,6">Ps. cxxvi. 5, 6</A>);

 a mountain of joy, to which our way lies through a vale of tears. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:10">Isa. lxvi. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. <I>The meek</I> are happy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 <I>Blessed are the meek.</I> The meek are those who quietly submit 
 themselves to God, to his word and to his rod, who follow his 
 directions, and comply with his designs, and are <I>gentle towards all 
 men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:2">Tit. iii. 2</A>);

 who can bear provocation without being inflamed by it; are either
 silent, or return a soft answer; and who can show their displeasure 
 when there is occasion for it, without being transported into any 
 indecencies; who can be cool when others are hot; and in their patience 
 keep possession of their own souls, when they can scarcely keep 
 possession of any thing else. <I>They</I> are the meek, who are rarely
 and hardly provoked, but quickly and easily pacified; and who would 
 rather forgive twenty injuries than revenge one, having the rule of 
 their own spirits.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These meek ones are here represented as happy, even in this world. 

 1. They are <I>blessed,</I> for they are like the blessed Jesus, in
 that wherein particularly they are to learn of him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:29"><I>ch.</I> xi. 29</A>.

 They are like the blessed God himself, who is Lord of his anger, and in
 whom fury is not. They are <I>blessed,</I> for they have the most 
 comfortable, undisturbed enjoyment of themselves, their friends, their 
 God; they are fit for any relation, and condition, any company; fit to 
 live, and fit to die. 

 2. <I>They shall inherit the earth;</I> it is quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:11">Ps. xxxvii. 11</A>,

 and it is almost the only express temporal promise in all the New 
 Testament. Not that they shall always have much of <I>the earth,</I> 
 much less that they shall be put off with that only; but this branch of 
 godliness has, in a special manner, <I>the promise of life that now 
 is.</I> Meekness, however ridiculed and run down, has a real tendency 
 to promote our health, wealth, comfort, and safety, even in this world. 
 <I>The meek</I> and quiet are observed to live the most easy lives, 
 compared with the froward and turbulent. Or, <I>They shall inherit the 
 land</I> (so it may be read), <I>the land of Canaan,</I> a type of 
 heaven. So that all the blessedness of heaven above, and all the 
 blessings of earth beneath, are the portion of the meek.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. <I>They that hunger and thirst after righteousness</I> are happy,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Some understand this as a further instance of our outward poverty, and 
 a low condition in this world, which not only exposes men to injury and 
 wrong, but makes it in vain for them to seek to have justice done to 
 them; they <I>hunger and thirst after</I> it, but such is the power on 
 the side of their oppressors, that they cannot have it; they desire 
 only that which is just and equal, but it is denied them by those that 
 <I>neither fear God nor regard men.</I> This is a melancholy case! Yet, 
 <I>blessed are they,</I> if they suffer these hardships for and with a 
 good conscience; let them hope in God, who will see justice done, right 
 take place, and will deliver the poor from their oppressors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:6">Ps. ciii. 6</A>.
 
 Those who contentedly bear oppression, and quietly refer themselves to
 God to plead their cause, shall in due time be satisfied, abundantly 
 satisfied, in the wisdom and kindness which shall be manifested in his 
 appearances for them. But it is certainly to be understood spiritually, 
 of such a desire as, being terminated on such an object, is gracious, 
 and the work of God's grace in the soul, and qualifies for the gifts of 
 the divine favour. 

 1. <I>Righteousness</I> is here put for all spiritual blessings. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:5,Mt+6:33">Ps. xxiv. 5; <I>ch.</I> vi. 33</A>.

 They are purchased for us by <I>the righteousness of Christ;</I>
 conveyed and secured by the imputation of that righteousness to us; and 
 confirmed by the faithfulness of God. To have Christ <I>made of God to 
 us righteousness,</I> and to be <I>made the righteousness of God in 
 him;</I> to have <I>the whole man renewed in righteousness,</I> so as 
 to become <I>a new man,</I> and to bear the image of God; to have an 
 interest in Christ and the promises--this is <I>righteousness.</I> 

 2. These we must <I>hunger and thirst after.</I> We must truly and
 really desire them, as one who is hungry and thirsty desires meat and 
 drink, who cannot be satisfied with any thing but meat and drink, and 
 will be satisfied with them, though other things be wanting. Our 
 desires of spiritual blessings must be earnest and importunate; 
 "<I>Give me these, or else I die;</I> every thing else is dross and 
 chaff, unsatisfying; give me these, and I have enough, though I had 
 nothing else." <I>Hunger and thirst</I> are appetites that return 
 frequently, and call for fresh satisfactions; so these holy desires 
 rest not in any thing attained, but are carried out toward renewed 
 pardons, and daily fresh supplies of grace. The quickened soul calls 
 for constant meals of righteousness, grace to do the work of every day 
 in its day, as duly as the living body calls for food. Those who 
 <I>hunger and thirst</I> will labour for supplies; so we must not only 
 desire spiritual blessings, but take pains for them in the use of the 
 appointed means. Dr. Hammond, in his practical Catechism, distinguishes 
 between <I>hunger and thirst.</I> <I>Hunger</I> is a desire of food to 
 sustain, such as <I>sanctifying righteousness.</I> <I>Thirst</I> is the 
 desire of drink to refresh, such as justifying <I>righteousness,</I> 
 and the sense of our pardon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those who <I>hunger and thirst</I> after spiritual blessings, <I>are 
 blessed</I> in those desires, and <I>shall be filled</I> with those 
 blessings. 

 (1.) They are <I>blessed</I> in those desires. Though all desires of 
 grace are not grace (feigned, faint desires are not), yet such a desire 
 as this is; it is an <I>evidence</I> of something <I>good,</I> and an 
 <I>earnest</I> of something <I>better.</I> It is a desire of God's own 
 raising, and he will not forsake the work of his own hands. Something 
 or other the soul will be <I>hungering</I> and <I>thirsting</I> after; 
 therefore <I>they</I> are blessed who fasten upon the right object, 
 which is satisfying, and not deceiving; and do not <I>pant after the 
 dust of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:7,Isa+55:2">Amos ii. 7; Isa. lv. 2</A>.

 (2.) They <I>shall be filled</I> with those blessings. God will give
 them what they desire to complete their satisfaction. It is God only 
 who can <I>fill a soul,</I> whose grace and favour are adequate to its 
 just desires; and he will fill those with <I>grace for grace,</I> who, 
 in a sense of their own emptiness, have recourse to his fulness. He 
 <I>fills the hungry</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:53">Luke i. 53</A>),
 
 <I>satiates</I> them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:25">Jer. xxxi. 25</A>.

 The happiness of heaven will certainly fill the soul; their
 righteousness shall be complete, the favour of God and his image, both 
 in their full perfection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The <I>merciful</I> are happy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This, like the rest, is a paradox; for the merciful are not taken to be 
 the wisest, nor are likely to be the richest; yet Christ pronounces 
 them <I>blessed.</I> Those are the <I>merciful,</I> who are piously and 
 charitably inclined to pity, help, and succour persons in misery. A man 
 may be truly <I>merciful,</I> who has not wherewithal to be bountiful 
 or liberal; and then God accepts the willing mind. We must not only 
 bear our own afflictions patiently, but we must, by Christian sympathy, 
 partake of the afflictions of our brethren; pity must be shown 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:14">Job vi. 14</A>),
 
 and <I>bowels of mercy put on</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:12">Col. iii. 12</A>);

 and, being put on, they must put forth themselves in contributing all
 we can for the assistance of those who are any way in misery. We must 
 have compassion on the souls of others, and help them; pity the 
 ignorant, and instruct them; the careless, and warn them; those who are 
 in a state of sin, and snatch them as <I>brands out of the burning.</I> 
 We must have compassion on those who are melancholy and in sorrow, and 
 comfort them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:5">Job xvi. 5</A>);

 on those whom we have advantage against, and not be rigorous and severe
 with them; on those who are in want, and supply them; which if we
 refuse to do, whatever we pretend, we <I>shut up the bowels of our
 compassion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:15,16,1Jo+3:17">James ii. 15, 16; 1 John iii. 17</A>.

 <I>Draw out they soul</I> by <I>dealing thy bread</I> to the hungry,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:7,10">Isa. lviii. 7, 10</A>.
 
 Nay, a <I>good man is merciful to his beast.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now as to the merciful. 

 1. They are <I>blessed;</I> so it was said in the Old Testament; 
 <I>Blessed is he that considers the poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:1">Ps. xli. 1</A>.

 Herein they resemble God, whose goodness is his glory; in being
 <I>merciful as he is merciful,</I> we are, in our measure, <I>perfect 
 as he is perfect.</I> It is an evidence of love to God; it will be a 
 satisfaction to ourselves, to be any way instrumental for the benefit 
 of others. One of the purest and most refined delights in this world, 
 is that of <I>doing good.</I> In this word, <I>Blessed are the 
 merciful,</I> is included that saying of Christ, which otherwise we 
 find not in the gospels, <I>It is more blessed to give than to 
 receive,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:35">Acts xx. 35</A>.

 2. <I>They shall obtain mercy;</I> mercy <I>with men,</I> when they 
 need it; <I>he that watereth, shall be watered also himself</I> (we 
 know not how soon we may stand in need of kindness, and therefore 
 should be kind); but especially mercy <I>with God,</I> for <I>with the 
 merciful he will show himself merciful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:25">Ps. xviii. 25</A>.

 The most <I>merciful</I> and charitable cannot pretend to <I>merit,</I>
 but must fly to mercy. The merciful shall find with God <I>sparing</I> 
 mercy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:14"><I>ch.</I> vi. 14</A>),
 
 <I>supplying</I> mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:17">Prov. xix. 17</A>),
 
 <I>sustaining</I> mercy
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:2">Ps. xli. 2</A>),
 
 mercy in that day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:18">2 Tim. i. 18</A>);
 
 may, they shall <I>inherit the kingdom prepared for them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:34,35"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 34, 35</A>);

 whereas <I>they</I> shall have <I>judgment without mercy</I> (which can
 be nothing short of <I>hell-fire</I>) who have <I>shown no 
 mercy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The <I>pure in heart</I> are happy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 <I>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</I> This is
 the most comprehensive of all the beatitudes; here holiness and 
 happiness are fully described and put together.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is the most <I>comprehensive character</I> of the blessed: they 
 are <I>pure in heart.</I> Note, True religion consists in heart-purity. 
 Those who are inwardly pure, show themselves to be under the power of 
 <I>pure and undefiled</I> religion. True Christianity lies in the
 heart, in the <I>purity of heart;</I> the <I>washing</I> of that 
 <I>from wickedness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:14">Jer. iv. 14</A>.

 We must lift up to God, not only clean hands, but a pure heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:4,5,1Ti+1:5">Ps. xxiv. 4, 5; 1 Tim. i. 5</A>.

 The heart must be <I>pure,</I> in opposition to <I>mixture</I>--an
 honest heart that aims well; and pure, in opposition to 
 <I>pollution</I> and <I>defilement;</I> as wine <I>unmixed,</I> as 
 water <I>unmuddied.</I> The heart must be kept <I>pure</I> from 
 <I>fleshly lusts,</I> all unchaste thoughts and desires; and from 
 <I>worldly lusts;</I> covetousness is called <I>filthy lucre;</I> from 
 all filthiness of flesh and spirit, all that which come <I>out of the 
 heart,</I> and <I>defiles the man.</I> The heart must be <I>purified by 
 faith,</I> and entire for God; must be presented and preserved a chaste 
 virgin to Christ. <I>Create in me such a clean heart, O God!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is the most <I>comprehensive comfort</I> of the blessed; They 
 shall see God. Note, 

 (1.) It is the perfection of the soul's happiness to <I>see God; seeing 
 him,</I> as we may by faith in our present state, is a <I>heaven upon 
 earth;</I> and seeing him as we shall in the future state, in the 
 <I>heaven of heaven.</I> To see him <I>as he is,</I> face to face, and 
 no longer through a glass darkly; to see him as ours, and to see him 
 and enjoy him; to see him and be like him, and be satisfied with that 
 likeness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:15">Ps. xvii. 15</A>);

 and to see him for ever, and never lose the sight of him; this is
 heaven's happiness.

 (2.) The happiness of seeing God is promised to those, and those only, 
 who are <I>pure in heart.</I> None but the <I>pure</I> are capable of 
 <I>seeing</I> God, nor would it be a felicity to the impure. What 
 pleasure could an unsanctified soul take in the vision of a holy God? 
 As <I>he</I> cannot endure to look upon their iniquity, <I>so they</I> 
 cannot endure to look upon his purity; nor shall any unclean thing 
 enter into the new Jerusalem; but all that are <I>pure in heart,</I> 
 all that are truly sanctified, have desires wrought in them, which 
 nothing but the sight of God will sanctify; and divine grace will not 
 leave those desires unsatisfied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The <I>peace-makers</I> are happy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The wisdom that is from above is first <I>pure,</I> and then 
 <I>peaceable;</I> the blessed ones are <I>pure</I> toward God, and 
 <I>peaceable</I> toward men; for with reference to both, conscience 
 must be kept <I>void of offence.</I> The <I>peace-makers</I> are those 
 who have, 

 1. <I>A peaceable disposition:</I> as, to <I>make a lie,</I> is to be
 given and addicted to lying, so, to <I>make peace,</I> is to have a
 strong and hearty affection to peace. <I>I am for peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:7">Ps. cxx. 7</A>.

 It is to love, and desire, and delight in peace; to be put in it as in
 our element, and to study to be quiet. 

 2. A <I>peaceable conversation;</I> industriously, as far as we can, to 
 preserve the peace that it be not broken, and to recover it when it is 
 broken; to hearken to proposals of peace ourselves, and to be ready to 
 make them to others; where distance is among brethren and neighbours, 
 to do all we can to accommodate it, and to be <I>repairers of the 
 breaches. The making of peace</I> is sometimes a <I>thankless 
 office,</I> and it is the lot of him who parts a fray, to have <I>blows 
 on both sides;</I> yet it is a good office, and we must be forward to 
 it. Some think that this is intended especially as a lesson for 
 ministers, who should do all they can to reconcile those who are at 
 variance, and to promote Christian love among those under their 
 charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 (1.) Such persons are <I>blessed;</I> for they have the satisfaction of 
 <I>enjoying themselves,</I> by keeping the peace, and of being truly 
 serviceable to others, by disposing them to peace. They are working 
 together with Christ, who came into the world to <I>slay all 
 enmities,</I> and to proclaim <I>peace on earth.</I> 

 (2.) <I>They shall be called the children of God;</I> it will be an 
 evidence to themselves that they are so; God will own them as such, and 
 herein they will resemble him. He is the God of peace; the Son of God 
 is the Prince of peace; the Spirit of adoption is a Spirit of peace. 
 Since God has declared himself reconcilable to us all, he will not own 
 those for his children who are implacable in their enmity to one 
 another; for if the peacemakers are blessed, woe to the peace-breakers! 
 Now by this it appears, that Christ never intended to have his religion 
 propagated by fire and sword, or penal laws, or to acknowledge bigotry, 
 or intemperate zeal, as the mark of his disciples. The children of this 
 world love to fish in troubled waters, but the children of God are the 
 peace-makers, the <I>quiet in the land.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. Those who are <I>persecuted for righteousness' sake,</I> are 
 happy. This is the greatest paradox of all, and peculiar to 
 Christianity; and therefore it is put last, and more largely insisted 
 upon than any of the rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>.

 This beatitude, like Pharaoh's dream, is doubled, because hardly 
 credited, and yet <I>the thing is certain;</I> and in the latter part 
 there is change of the person, "Blessed are <I>ye</I>--ye my disciples, 
 and immediate followers. This is that which you, who excel in virtue, 
 are more immediately concerned in; for you must reckon upon hardships 
 and troubles more than other men." Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The case of suffering saints described; and it is a hard case, and a 
 very piteous one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They are persecuted, hunted, pursued, run down, as noxious beasts 
 are, that are sought for to be destroyed; as if a Christian did 
 <I>caput gerere lupinum--bear a wolf's head,</I> as an outlaw is said to
 do--any one that finds him may slay him; they are abandoned as the
 <I>offscouring of all things;</I> fined, imprisoned, banished, stripped 
 of their estates, excluded from all places of profit and trust, 
 scourged, racked, tortured, always delivered to death, and accounted as 
 sheep for the slaughter. This has been the effect of the enmity of the
 serpent's seed against the holy seed, ever since the time <I>of 
 righteous Abel.</I> It was so in <I>Old-Testament</I> times, as we 
 find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:35">Heb. xi. 35</A>,

 &c. Christ has told us that it would much more be so with the Christian
 church, and we are not to think it strange, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:13">1 John iii. 13</A>.

 He has left us an example.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They are <I>reviled, and have all manner of evil said against them
 falsely.</I> Nicknames, and names of reproach, are fastened upon them, 
 upon particular persons, and upon the generation of the righteous in 
 the gross, to render them odious; sometimes to make them formidable, 
 that they may be powerfully assailed; things are laid to their charge 
 that they knew not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:11,Jer+20:18,Ac+17:6">Ps. xxxv. 11; 
 Jer. xx. 18; Acts xvii. 6, 7</A>.

 Those who have had no power in their hands to do them any other
 mischief, could yet do this; and those who have had power to 
 <I>persecute,</I> had found it necessary to <I>do this too,</I> to 
 justify themselves in their barbarous usage of them; they could not 
 have baited them, if they had not dressed them in bear-skins; nor have 
 given them the worst of treatment, if they had not first represented 
 them as the worst of men. They will <I>revile you, and persecute
 you.</I> Note, <I>Reviling</I> the saints is <I>persecuting</I> them, 
 and will be found so shortly, when <I>hard speeches</I> must be 
 accounted for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:15">Jude 15</A>),

 and <I>cruel mockings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:36">Heb. xi. 36</A>.

 They will say <I>all manner of evil of you falsely;</I> sometimes
 before the <I>seat of judgment,</I> as witnesses; sometimes in the 
 <I>seat of the scornful,</I> with <I>hypocritical mockers at 
 feasts;</I> they are the <I>song of the drunkards;</I> sometimes to 
 face their faces, as Shimei cursed David; sometimes behind their backs, 
 as the enemies of Jeremiah did. Note, There is no evil so black and 
 horrid, which, at one time or other, has not been said, falsely, of 
 Christ's disciples and followers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) All this is <I>for righteousness' sake</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 <I>for my sake,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 If for <I>righteousness' sake,</I> then for <I>Christ's sake,</I> for 
 he is nearly interested in the work of righteousness. Enemies to 
 righteousness are enemies to Christ. This precludes those from the 
 blessedness who suffer <I>justly,</I> and are evil spoken of 
 <I>truly</I> for their real crimes; let such be ashamed and confounded, 
 it is part of their punishment; it is not the suffering, but the cause, 
 that makes the martyr. Those suffer for <I>righteousness' sake,</I> who 
 suffer because they will not sin against their consciences, and who 
 suffer for doing that which is good. Whatever pretence persecutors
 have, it is the power of godliness that they have an enmity to; it is 
 really Christ and his righteousness that are maligned, hated, and 
 persecuted; <I>For thy sake I have borne reproach,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:9,Ro+8:36">Ps. lxix. 9; Rom. viii. 36</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The comforts of suffering saints laid down.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They <I>are blessed;</I> for they now, in their life-time, receive 
 <I>their evil things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25">Luke xvi. 25</A>),

 and receive them upon a good account. They are <I>blessed;</I> for it
 is an honour to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:41">Acts v. 41</A>);

 it is an opportunity of glorifying Christ, of doing good, and of
 experiencing special comforts and visits of grace and tokens of his
 presence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:5,Da+3:25.Ro+8:29">2 Cor. i. 5; 
 Dan. iii. 25; Rom. viii. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They shall be <I>recompensed;</I> Theirs is <I>the kingdom of 
 heaven.</I> They have at present a sure title to it, and sweet 
 foretastes of it; and shall ere long be in possession of it. Though 
 there be nothing in those sufferings than can, in strictness, merit of 
 God (for the sins of the best deserve the worst), yet this is here 
 promised as a <I>reward</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 <I>Great is your reward in heaven:</I> so great, as far to transcend
 the service. It is <I>in heaven,</I> future, and out of sight; but well 
 secured, out of the reach of chance, fraud, and violence. Note, God 
 will provide that those who lose <I>for</I> him, though it be life 
 itself, shall not lose <I>by</I> him in the end. Heaven, at last, will 
 be an abundant recompence for all the difficulties we meet with in our 
 way. This is that which has borne up the suffering saints in all 
 ages--this <I>joy set before them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) "<I>So persecuted they the prophets that were before you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They were <I>before you</I> in excellency, above what you are yet 
 arrived at; they were <I>before you</I> in time, that they might be 
 examples to you of <I>suffering affliction</I> and <I>of patience,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:10">James v. 10</A>.

 They were in like manner persecuted and abused; and can you expect to
 go to heaven in a way by yourself? Was not Isaiah mocked for his 
 <I>line upon line?</I> <I>Elisha</I> for his <I>bald head?</I> Were not 
 all the prophets thus treated? Therefore <I>marvel not</I> at it as a 
 <I>strange</I> thing, <I>murmur not</I> at it as a <I>hard</I> thing; 
 it is a comfort to see the way of suffering a beaten road, and an 
 honour to follow such leaders. That grace which was <I>sufficient for 
 them,</I> to carry them through their sufferings, shall not be 
 <I>deficient to you.</I> Those who are your enemies are the seed and 
 successors of them who of old mocked the messengers of the Lord,"

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ had lately called his disciples, and told them that they should 
 be <I>fishers of men;</I> here he tells them further what he designed 
 them to be--<I>the salt of the earth,</I> and <I>lights of the
 world,</I> that they might be indeed what it was expected they should 
 be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>Ye are the salt of the earth.</I> <I>This</I> would encourage and 
 support them under their sufferings, that, though they should be 
 treated with contempt, yet they should really be blessings to the 
 world, and the more so for their suffering thus. The prophets, who
 went before them, were the salt of the land of Canaan; but the apostles 
 were the salt of <I>the whole earth,</I> for they must <I>go into all 
 the world to preach the gospel.</I> It was a discouragement to them 
 that they were so <I>few</I> and so <I>weak.</I> What could they do in 
 so large a province as <I>the whole earth?</I> Nothing, if they were to 
 work by force of arms and dint of sword; but, being to work silent as 
 salt, one handful of that salt would diffuse its savour far and wide; 
 would go a great way, and work insensibly and irresistibly as leaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:33"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 33</A>.

 The doctrine of the gospel is as <I>salt;</I> it is penetrating,
 <I>quick,</I> and <I>powerful</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12">Heb. iv. 12</A>);

 it reaches <I>the heart</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:37">Acts ii. 37</A>.

 It is cleansing, it is relishing, and preserves from putrefaction. We
 read of the <I>savour of the knowledge of Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:14">2 Cor. ii. 14</A>);

 for all other learning is insipid without that. An everlasting covenant
 is called a <I>covenant of salt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:19">Num. xviii. 19</A>);
 
 and the gospel is an everlasting gospel. Salt was required in all the
 sacrifices

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+2:13">Lev. ii. 13</A>),

 in Ezekiel's mystical temple,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+43:24">Ezek. xliii. 24</A>.

 Now Christ's disciples having themselves learned the doctrine of the
 gospel, and being employed to teach it to others, were as salt. Note,
 Christians, and especially ministers, are the salt of the earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. If they be as they should be they are <I>as good salt,</I> white, 
 and small, and broken into many grains, but very useful and necessary. 
 Pliny says, <I>Sine sale, vita humana non potest degere--Without salt
 human life cannot be sustained.</I> See in this, 

 (1.) What they are to be in themselves--seasoned with the gospel, with 
 the salt of grace; thoughts and affections, words and actions, all 
 seasoned with grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:6">Col. iv. 6</A>.

 <I>Have salt in yourselves,</I> else you cannot diffuse it among
 others,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:50">Mark ix. 50</A>.

 (2.) What they are to be to others; they must not only <I>be</I> good 
 but <I>do</I> good, must insinuate themselves into the minds of the 
 people, not to serve any secular interest of their own, but that they 
 might transform them into the taste and relish of the gospel. 

 (3.) What great blessings they are to the world. Mankind, lying in
 ignorance and wickedness, were a vast heap of unsavoury stuff, ready to 
 putrefy; but Christ sent forth his disciples, by their lives and 
 doctrines, to season it with knowledge and grace, and so to render it 
 acceptable to God, to the angels, and to all that relish divine things. 
 
 (4.) How they must expect to be disposed of. They must not be laid on a
 heap, must not continue always together at Jerusalem, but must be 
 scattered as salt upon the meat, here a grain and there a grain; as the 
 Levites were dispersed in Israel, that, wherever they live, they may 
 communicate their savour. Some have observed, that whereas it is 
 foolishly called an ill omen to have the salt fall towards us, it is 
 really an ill omen to have the salt fall from us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. If they be not, they are as <I>salt</I> that has <I>lost its 
 savour.</I> If you, who should season others, are yourselves unsavoury, 
 void of spiritual life, relish, and vigour; if a Christian be so, 
 especially if a minister be so, his condition is very sad; for, 

 (1.) He is <I>irrecoverable:</I> <I>Wherewith shall it be salted?</I> 
 Salt is a remedy for <I>unsavoury meat,</I> but there is no remedy for 
 <I>unsavoury salt.</I> Christianity will give a man a relish; but if a 
 man can take up and continue the profession of it, and yet remain flat 
 and foolish, and graceless and insipid, no other doctrine, no other 
 means, can be applied, to make him savoury. If Christianity do not do 
 it, nothing will. 

 (2.) He is <I>unprofitable:</I> <I>It is thenceforth good for 
 nothing;</I> what use can it be put to, in which it will not do more 
 hurt than good? As a man without reason, so is a Christian without 
 grace. A wicked man is the worst of creatures; a wicked Christian is 
 the worst of men; and a wicked minister is the worst of Christians. 
 
 (3.) He is doomed to ruin and rejection; He shall be <I>cast 
 out</I>--expelled the church and the communion of the faithful, to 
 which he is a blot and a burden; and he shall be <I>trodden under foot 
 of men.</I> Let God be glorified in the shame and rejection of those by 
 whom he has been reproached, and who have made themselves fit for 
 nothing but to be trampled upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>Ye are the light of the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This also bespeaks them useful, as the former (<I>Sole et sale nihil 
 utilius--Nothing more useful than the sun and salt</I>), but more 
 glorious. All Christians are <I>light in the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:8">Eph. v. 8</A>),

 and must <I>shine as lights</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:15">Phil. ii. 15</A>),

 but ministers in a special manner. Christ calls himself <I>the Light of
 the world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:12">John viii. 12</A>),
 
 and they are <I>workers together with him,</I> and have some of his
 honour put upon them. Truly <I>the light is sweet,</I> it is welcome; 
 the light of the first day of the world was so, when it <I>shone out of 
 darkness;</I> so is the morning light of every day; so is the gospel, 
 and those that spread it, to all sensible people. The <I>world sat in 
 darkness,</I> Christ raised up his disciples to shine in it; and, that 
 they may do so, from him they borrow and derive their light.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This similitude is here explained in two things:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As <I>the lights of the world,</I> they are illustrious and 
 conspicuous, and have many eyes upon them. A city that is <I>set on a 
 hill cannot be hid.</I> The disciples of Christ, especially those who 
 are forward and zealous in his service, become remarkable, and are
 taken notice of as beacons. They are for <I>signs</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:18">Isa. vii. 18</A>),

 <I>men wondered at</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:8">Zech. iii. 8</A>);

 all their neighbours have an eye upon them. Some admire them, commend
 them, rejoice in them, and study to imitate them; others envy them, 
 hate them, censure them, and study to blast them. They are concerned 
 therefore to <I>walk circumspectly,</I> because of <I>their 
 observers;</I> they are as <I>spectacles to the world,</I> and must 
 take heed of every thing that <I>looks ill,</I> because they are so 
 much <I>looked at.</I> The disciples of Christ were obscure men before 
 he called them, but the character he put upon them dignified them, and 
 as preachers of the gospel they made a figure; and though they were 
 reproached for it by some, they were respected for it by others, 
 advanced to thrones, and made judges

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:30">Luke xxii. 30</A>);

 for Christ will honour those that honour him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As the <I>lights of the world,</I> they are intended to illuminate 
 and give light to others 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 and therefore, 

 (1.) They shall be <I>set up</I> as lights. Christ has lighted these 
 candles, they shall not be put under a bushel, not confined always, as 
 they are now, to the cities of Galilee, or the lost sheep of the house 
 of Israel, but they shall be sent into all the world. The churches are 
 the candlesticks, the golden candlesticks, in which these lights are 
 placed, that their light may be diffused; and the gospel is so strong a
 light, and carries with it so much of its own evidence, that, <I>like a 
 city on a hill, it cannot be hid,</I> it cannot but appear to be from 
 God, to all those who do not wilfully shut their eyes against it. It 
 will <I>give light to all that are in the house,</I> to all that will 
 draw near to it, and come where it is. Those to whom it does not give 
 light, must thank themselves; they will not be in the house with it; 
 will not make a diligent and impartial enquiry into it, but are 
 prejudiced against it.

 (2.) They must <I>shine</I> as lights,

 [1.] By their <I>good preaching.</I> The knowledge they have, they must 
 communicate for the good of others; not put it <I>under a bushel,</I> 
 but spread it. The talent must not be buried in a napkin, but traded 
 with. The disciples of Christ must not muffle themselves up in privacy 
 and obscurity, under pretence of contemplation, modesty, or 
 self-preservation, but, <I>as they have received the gift,</I> must 
 <I>minister the same,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:3">Luke xii. 3</A>.

 [2.] By their <I>good living.</I> They must be <I>burning and shining
 lights</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:35">John v. 35</A>);

 must evidence, in their whole conversation, that they are indeed
 followers of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:13">James iii. 13</A>.

 They must be to others for instruction, direction, quickening, and
 comfort,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:11">Job xxix. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, <I>First, How</I> our light must shine--by doing such <I>good
 works</I> as men <I>may see,</I> and may approve of; such works as are 
 of <I>good report</I> among them that are without, and as will 
 therefore give them cause to think well of Christianity. We must do 
 good works <I>that may be seen</I> to the edification of others, but 
 not <I>that they may be seen</I> to our own ostentation; we are bid to 
 pray in secret, and what lies between God and our souls, must be kept 
 to ourselves; but that which is of itself open and obvious to the sight 
 of men, we must study to make <I>congruous</I> to our profession, and 
 praiseworthy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:8">Phil. iv. 8</A>.

 Those about us must not only <I>hear</I> our good words, but <I>see</I>
 our good works; that they may be convinced that religion is more than a 
 bare name, and that we do not only make a profession of it, but abide 
 under the power of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> For what <I>end</I> our light must shine--"That those
 who see your good works may be brought, not to glorify <I>you</I> 
 (which was the things the Pharisees aimed at, and it spoiled all their 
 performances), but to <I>glorify your Father which is in heaven.</I>" 
 Note, The glory of God is the great thing we must aim at in every thing 
 we do in religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:11">1 Pet. iv. 11</A>.

 In this centre the lines of all our actions must meet. We must not only
 endeavor to glorify God ourselves, but we must do all we can to bring 
 others to glorify him. The sight of our <I>good works</I> will do this, 
 by furnishing them,

 1. With <I>matter for praise.</I> "Let them see <I>your good works,</I>
 that they may see the power of God's grace in you, and may thank him 
 for it, and give him the glory of it, who has given such power unto 
 men." 

 2. With <I>motives of piety.</I> "Let them see your good works, that
 they may be convinced of the truth and excellency of the Christian 
 religion, may be provoked by a holy emulation to imitate your good 
 works, and so may glorify God." Note, The holy, regular, and exemplary
 conversation of the saints, may do much towards the conversion of
 sinners; those who are unacquainted with religion, may hereby be
 brought to know what it is. Examples teach. And those who are
 prejudiced against it, may hereby be brought in love with it, and thus
 there is a winning virtue in a godly conversation.</P>

 Those to whom Christ preached, and for whose use he gave these 
 instructions to his disciples, were such as in their religion had an 
 eye, 

 1. To the <I>scriptures</I> of the <I>Old Testament</I> as their rule,

 prophets.</I> The <I>prophets</I> were commentators upon the law, and 
 both together made up that rule of faith and practice which Christ 
 found upon the throne in the Jewish church, and here he keeps it on the 
 throne.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He protests against the thought of cancelling and weakening the 
 <I>Old Testament;</I> <I>Think not that I am come to destroy the law 
 and the prophets.</I> 

 (1.) "Let not the pious Jews, who have an affection for the <I>law and 
 the prophets, fear</I> that I come to <I>destroy</I> them." Let them be 
 not prejudiced against Christ and his doctrine, from a jealousy that 
 this kingdom he came to set up, would derogate from the honour of the 
 scriptures, which they had embraced as coming from God, and of which 
 they had experienced the power and purity; no, let them be satisfied 
 that Christ has no ill design upon the law and the prophets. "Let not 
 the profane Jews, who have a disaffection to the law and the prophets, 
 and are weary of that yoke, hope that I am come to destroy them." Let 
 not carnal libertines imagine that the Messiah is come to discharge 
 them from the obligation of divine precepts and yet to secure to them 
 divine promises, to make the happy and yet to give them leave to live 
 as they list. Christ commands nothing now which was forbidden either by 
 the law of nature or the moral law, nor forbids any thing which those 
 laws had enjoined; it is a great mistake to think he does, and he here 
 takes care to rectify the mistake; <I>I am not come to destroy.</I> The 
 Saviour of souls is the <I>destroyer</I> of nothing but the <I>works of 
 the devil,</I> of nothing that comes from God, much less of those 
 excellent dictates which we have from Moses and the prophets. No, he 
 came to <I>fulfil</I> them. That is,

 [1.] To obey the commands of the law, for he was <I>made under the 
 law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:4">Gal. iv. 4</A>.

 He in all respects yielded obedience to the law, honoured his parents, 
 sanctified the sabbath, prayed, gave alms, and did that which never any 
 one else did, obeyed perfectly, and never broke the law in any thing.

 [2.] To make good the promises of the law, and the predictions of the
 prophets, which did all bear witness to him. The covenant of grace is,
 for substance, the same now that it was then, and Christ the Mediator 
 of it. 

 [3.] To answer the types of the law; thus (as bishop Tillotson 
 expresses it), he did not make <I>void,</I> but make <I>good,</I> the 
 ceremonial law, and manifested himself to be the Substance of all those 
 shadows. 

 [4.] To fill up the defects of it, and so to complete and perfect it. 
 Thus the word <B><I>plerosai</I></B> properly signifies. If we consider 
 the law as a vessel that had some water in it before, he did not come 
 to pour out the water, but to fill the vessel up to the brim; or, as a 
 picture that is first rough-drawn, displays some outlines only of the 
 piece intended, which are afterwards filled up; so Christ made an 
 improvement of the law and the prophets by his additions and 
 explications. 

 [5.] To carry on the same design; the Christian institutes are so far 
 from thwarting and contradicting that which was the main design of the 
 Jewish religion, that they promote it to the highest degree. The gospel 
 is the <I>time of reformation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10">Heb. ix. 10</A>),

 not the repeal of the law, but the amendment of it, and, consequently,
 its establishment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He asserts the perpetuity of it; that not only he designed not the 
 abrogation of it, but that it never should be abrogated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);
 
 "<I>Verily I say unto you,</I> I, the <I>Amen,</I> the faithful 
 Witness, solemnly declare it, that <I>till heaven and earth pass,</I> 
 when time shall be no more, and the unchangeable state of recompences 
 shall supersede all laws, <I>one jot, or one tittle,</I> the least and 
 most minute circumstance, <I>shall in no wise pass from the law till 
 all be fulfilled;</I>" for what is it that God is doing in all the 
 operations both of providence and grace, but fulfilling the scripture? 
 Heaven and earth shall come together, and all the fulness thereof be 
 wrapped up in ruin and confusion, rather than any word of God shall 
 fall to the ground, or be in vain. <I>The word of the Lord endures for 
 ever,</I> both that of the law, and that of the gospel. Observe, The 
 care of God concerning his law extends itself even to those things that 
 seem to be of least account in it, the iotas and the tittles; for 
 whatever belongs to God, and bears his stamp, be it ever so little, 
 shall be preserved. The laws of men are conscious to themselves of so 
 much imperfection, that they allow it for a maxim, <I>Apices juris non 
 sunt jura--The extreme points of the law are not the law,</I> but God
 will stand by and maintain every iota and every tittle of his law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He gives it in charge to his disciples, carefully to preserve the 
 law, and shows them the danger of the neglect and contempt of it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);
 
 <I>Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least
 commandments of the law of Moses,</I> much more any of the greater, as 
 the Pharisees did, who neglected the weightier matters of the law, and 
 shall teach men so as they did, who made void the commandment of God 
 with their traditions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:3"><I>ch.</I> xv. 3</A>),

 <I>he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.</I> Though
 the Pharisees be cried up for such teachers as should be, they shall 
 not be employed as teachers in Christ's kingdom; but <I>whosoever shall 
 do and teach them,</I> as Christ's disciples would, and thereby prove 
 themselves better friends to the <I>Old Testament</I> than the 
 Pharisees were, they, though despised by men, shall be <I>called great 
 in the kingdom of heaven.</I> Note, 

 (1.) Among the commands of God there are some less than others; none 
 absolutely little, but comparatively so. The Jews reckon the least of 
 the commandments of the law to be that of the bird's nest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:6,7">Deut. xxii. 6, 7</A>);

 yet even that had a significance and an intention very great and 
 considerable.

 (2.) It is a dangerous thing, in doctrine or practice, to disannul the
 least of God's commands; to break them, that is, to go about either to 
 <I>contract the extent,</I> or <I>weaken the obligation</I> of them; 
 whoever does so, will find it is at his peril. Thus to vacate any of
 the ten commandments, is too bold a stroke for the jealous God to pass 
 by. It is something more than transgressing the law, it is making void
 the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:126">Ps. cxix. 126</A>.

 (3.) That the further such corruptions as they spread, the worse they
 are. It is impudence enough to break the command, but is a greater 
 degree of it to teach men so. This plainly refers to those who at this
 time sat in Moses' seat, and by their comments corrupted and perverted 
 the text. Opinions that tend to the destruction of serious godliness 
 and the vitals of religion, by corrupt glosses on the scripture, are 
 bad when they are held, but worse when they are propagated and taught, 
 as the word of God. He that does so, shall be called <I>least in the 
 kingdom of heaven,</I> in the kingdom of glory; he shall never come 
 thither, but be eternally excluded; or, rather, in the kingdom of the 
 gospel-church. He is so far from deserving the dignity of a teacher in 
 it, that he shall not so much as be accounted a member of it. The 
 prophet that teaches these lies shall be the tail in that kingdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:15">Isa. ix. 15</A>);

 when truth shall appear in its own evidence, such corrupt teachers,
 though cried up as the Pharisees, shall be of no account with the wise
 and good. Nothing makes ministers more contemptible and base than
 corrupting the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:8,11">Mal. ii. 8, 11</A>.

 Those who extenuate and encourage sin, and discountenance and put
 contempt upon strictness in religion and serious devotion, are the 
 dregs of the church. But, on the other hand, Those are truly 
 honourable, and of great account in the church of Christ, who lay out 
 themselves by their life and doctrine to promote the purity and 
 strictness of practical religion; who both do and teach that which is 
 good; for those who do not as they teach, pull down with one hand what 
 they build up with the other, and give themselves the lie, and tempt 
 men to think that all religion is a delusion; but those who speak from 
 experience, who live up to what they preach, are truly great; they 
 honour God, and God will honour them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:30">1 Sam. ii. 30</A>),

 and hereafter they shall shine as the <I>stars in the kingdom of our 
 Father.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The righteousness which Christ came to establish by this rule, must 
 exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 This was strange doctrine to those who looked upon the scribes and 
 Pharisees as having arrived at the highest pitch of religion. The 
 scribes were the most noted teachers of the law, and the Pharisees the 
 most celebrated professors of it, and they both sat in Moses' chair

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:2"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 2</A>),

 and had such a reputation among the people, that they were looked upon
 as super-conformable to the law, and people did not think themselves 
 obliged to be as good as they; it was therefore a great surprise to 
 them, to hear that they must be better than they, or they should not go 
 to heaven; and therefore Christ here avers it with solemnity; <I>I say 
 unto you,</I> It is so. The scribes and Pharisees were enemies to 
 Christ and his doctrine, and were great oppressors; and yet it must be 
 owned, that there was something commendable in them. They were much in 
 fasting and prayer, and giving of alms; they were punctual in observing 
 the ceremonial appointments, and made it their business to teach 
 others; they had such an interest in the people that they ought, if but 
 two men went to heaven, one would be a Pharisee; and yet our Lord Jesus 
 here tells his disciples, that the religion he came to establish, did 
 not only exclude the badness, but excel the goodness, of the scribes 
 and Pharisees. We must do more than they, and better than they, or we 
 shall come short of heaven. They were <I>partial in the law,</I> and 
 laid most stress upon the ritual part of it; but we must be 
 <I>universal,</I> and not think it enough to give the priest his tithe, 
 but must give God our hearts. They minded only the <I>outside,</I> but 
 we must make conscience of <I>inside</I> godliness. They aimed at the 
 <I>praise</I> and <I>applause of men,</I> but we must aim at 
 <I>acceptance with God:</I> they were <I>proud</I> of what they did in 
 religion, and trusted to it as a <I>righteousness;</I> but we, when we 
 have done all, must <I>deny ourselves,</I> and say, We are 
 <I>unprofitable servants,</I> and trust only to the <I>righteousness of 
 Christ;</I> and thus we may go beyond the scribes and Pharisees.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou

 the judgment:
 &nbsp; 22  But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
 without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever

 Christ having laid down these principles, that Moses and the prophets 
 were still to be their rulers, but that the scribes and Pharisees were 
 to be no longer their rulers, proceeds to expound the law in some 
 particular instances, and to vindicate it from the corrupt glosses 
 which those expositors had put upon it. He adds not any thing new, only 
 limits and restrains some permissions which had been abused: and as to 
 the precepts, shows the breadth, strictness, and spiritual nature of 
 them, adding such explanatory statutes as made them more clear, and 
 tended much toward the perfecting of our obedience to them. In these 
 verses, he explains the law of the sixth commandment, according to the
 true intent and full extent of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the <I>command itself</I> laid down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 <I>We have heard it,</I> and remember it; he speaks <I>to them who know 
 the law,</I> who had Moses read to them in their synagogues every 
 sabbath-day; you have heard that it was said <I>by them,</I> or rather 
 as it is in the margin, <I>to them of old time,</I> to your forefathers 
 the Jews, <I>Thou shalt not kill.</I> Note, The laws of God are not 
 novel, upstart laws, but were delivered to them of old time; they are 
 ancient laws, but of that nature as never to be <I>antiquated</I> nor 
 grow <I>obsolete.</I> The moral law agrees with the law of nature, and 
 the eternal rules and reasons of good and evil, that is, the rectitude 
 of the eternal Mind. <I>Killing</I> is here forbidden, killing 
 ourselves, killing any other, directly or indirectly, or being any way 
 accessory to it. The law of God, the God of life, is a hedge of 
 protection about our lives. It was one of the precepts of Noah, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:5,6">Gen. ix. 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The exposition of this command which the Jewish teachers contended 
 themselves with; their comment upon it was, <I>Whosoever shall kill, 
 shall be in danger of the judgment.</I> This was all they had to say 
 upon it, that wilful murderers were liable to the sword of justice, and 
 casual ones to the judgment of the city of refuge. The courts of 
 judgment sat in the gate of their principal cities; the judges, 
 ordinarily, were in number twenty-three; these tried, condemned, and 
 executed murderers; so that whoever killed, was in danger of their 
 judgment. Now this gloss of theirs upon this commandment was faulty, 
 for it intimated, 

 1. That the law of the sixth commandment was only external, and forbade
 no more than the act of murder, and laid to restraint upon the inward 
 lusts, from which <I>wars and fightings come.</I> This was indeed the 
 <B><I>proton pseudos</I></B>--<I>the fundamental error</I> of the 
 Jewish teachers, that the divine law prohibited only the sinful act, 
 not the sinful thought; they were disposed <I>h&aelig;rere in 
 cortice--to rest in the letter</I> of the law, and they never enquired 
 into the spiritual meaning of it. Paul, while a Pharisee, did not, 
 till, by the key of the tenth commandment, divine grace let him into 
 the knowledge of the spiritual nature of all the rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:7,14">Rom. vii. 7, 14</A>.

 2. Another mistake of theirs was, that this law was merely
 <I>political</I> and <I>municipal,</I> given for them, and intended as 
 a directory for their courts, and no more; as if they only were the 
 people, and the wisdom of the law must die with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The exposition which Christ gave of this commandment; and we are 
 sure that according to his exposition of it we must be judged 
 hereafter, and therefore ought to be ruled now. <I>The commandment is 
 exceeding broad,</I> and not to be limited by the will of the flesh, or 
 the will of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ tells them that <I>rash anger is heart-murder</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);
 
 <I>Whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause,</I> breaks the 
 sixth commandment. By our <I>brother</I> here, we are to understand any 
 person, though ever so much our inferior, as a child, a servant, for we 
 are all <I>made of one blood.</I> Anger is a natural passion; there are 
 cases in which it is lawful and laudable; but it is then <I>sinful,</I> 
 when we are angry without cause. The word is <B><I>eike</I></B>, which 
 signifies, <I>sine caus&acirc;, sine effectu, et sine modo--without cause,
 without any good effect, without moderation;</I> so that the anger is 
 then sinful, 

 (1.) When it is without any just provocation given; either for no 
 cause, or no good cause, or no great and proportionable cause; when we 
 are angry at children or servants for that which could not be helped, 
 which was only a piece of forgetfulness or mistake, that we ourselves 
 might easily have been guilty of, and for which we should not have been 
 angry at ourselves; when we are angry upon groundless surmises, or for 
 trivial affronts not worth speaking of. 

 (2.) When it is without any good end aimed at, merely to show our 
 authority, to gratify a brutish passion, to let people know our 
 resentments, and excite ourselves to revenge, then it is in vain, it is 
 to do hurt; whereas if we are at any time angry, it should be to awaken 
 the offender to repentance, and prevent his doing so again; to clear 
 ourselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:11">2 Cor. vii. 11</A>),

 and to give warning to others. 

 (3.) When it exceeds due bounds; when we are hardy and headstrong in 
 our anger, violent and vehement, outrageous and mischievous, and when 
 we seek the hurt of those we are displeased at. This is a breach of
 the sixth commandment, for he that is thus angry, would kill if he 
 could and durst; he has taken the first step toward it; Cain's killing 
 his brother began in anger; he is a murderer in the account of God, who 
 knows his heart, whence murder proceeds,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:19"><I>ch.</I> xv. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He tells them, that given opprobrious language to our brother is 
 tongue-murder, calling him, <I>Raca,</I> and, <I>Thou fool.</I> When 
 this is done with mildness and for a good end, to convince others of 
 their vanity and folly, it is not sinful. Thus James says, <I>O vain
 man;</I> and Paul, <I>Thou fool;</I> and Christ himself, <I>O fools, 
 and slow of heart.</I> But when it proceeds from anger and malice 
 within, it is the smoke of that fire which is kindled from hell, and 
 falls under the same character. 

 (1.) <I>Raca</I> is a scornful word, and comes from pride, "Thou empty 
 fellow;" it is the language of that which Solomon calls <I>proud 
 wrath</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:24">Prov. xxi. 24</A>),

 which tramples upon our brother-disdains <I>to set him even with the 
 dogs of our flock. This people who knoweth not the law, is cursed,</I> 
 is such language, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:49">John vii. 49</A>.

 (2.) <I>Thou fool,</I> is a spiteful word, and comes from hatred; 
 looking upon him, not only as mean and not to be honoured, but as vile 
 and not to be loved; "Thou wicked man, thou reprobate." The former 
 speaks a man without sense, this (in scripture language) speaks a man 
 without grace; the more the reproach touches his spiritual condition, 
 the worse it is; the former is a haughty taunting of our brother, this 
 is a malicious censuring and condemning of him, as abandoned of God. 
 Now this is a breach of the sixth commandment; malicious slanders and 
 censures are <I>poison under the tongue,</I> that kills secretly and 
 slowly; <I>bitter words</I> are as <I>arrows</I> that would suddenly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:3">Ps. lxiv. 3</A>),

 or as a sword in the bones. The good name of our neighbour, which is
 better than life, is thereby stabbed and murdered; and it is an 
 evidence of such an ill-will to our neighbour as would strike at his 
 life, if it were in our power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He tells them, that how light soever they made of these sins, they 
 would certainly be reckoned for; he <I>that is angry with is brother 
 shall be in danger of the judgment</I> and anger of God; he that calls 
 him <I>Raca, shall be in danger of the council,</I> of being punished 
 by the Sanhedrim for reviling an Israelite; <I>but whosoever saith, 
 Thou fool,</I> thou profane person, thou child of hell, <I>shall be in 
 danger of hell-fire,</I> to which he condemns his brother; so the 
 learned Dr. Whitby. Some think, in allusion to the penalties used in
 the several courts of judgment among the Jews, Christ shows that the 
 sin of rash anger exposes men to lower or higher punishments, according 
 to the degrees of its proceeding. The Jews had three capital 
 punishments, each worse than the other; beheading, which was inflicted 
 by the judgment; stoning, by the council or chief Sanhedrim; and 
 burning <I>in the valley of the son of Hinnom,</I> which was used only 
 in extraordinary cases: it signifies, therefore, that rash anger and 
 reproachful language are damning sins; but some are more sinful than 
 others, and accordingly there is a greater damnation, and a sorer 
 punishment reserved for them: Christ would thus show which sin was most 
 sinful, by showing which it was the punishment whereof was most 
 dreadful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. From all this it is here inferred, that we ought carefully to 
 preserve Christian love and peace with our brethren, and that if at any 
 time a breach happens, we should labour for a reconciliation, by 
 confessing our fault, humbling ourselves to our brother, begging his 
 pardon, and making restitution, or offering satisfaction for wrong done 
 in word or deed, according as the nature of the thing is; and that we 
 should do this quickly for two reasons:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Because, till this be done, we are utterly unfit for communion with 
 God in holy ordinances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 The case supposed is, "<I>That thy brother have</I> somewhat <I>against 
 thee,</I>" that thou has injured and offended him, either really or in 
 his apprehension; if thou are the party offended, there needs not this 
 delay; if thou <I>have aught against thy brother,</I> make short work 
 of it; no more is to be done but to forgive him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+11:25">Mark xi. 25</A>),

 and forgive the injury; but if the quarrel began on thy side, and the
 fault was either at first or afterwards thine, so <I>that thy 
 brother</I> has a controversy with <I>thee, go</I> and <I>be reconciled 
 to</I> him before thou <I>offer thy gift at the altar,</I> before thou 
 approach solemnly to God in the gospel-services of prayer and praise, 
 hearing the word or the sacraments. Note,

 (1.) When we are addressing ourselves to any religious exercises, it is 
 good for us to take that occasion of serious reflection and 
 self-examination: there are many things to be <I>remembered,</I> when 
 we <I>bring our gift to the altar,</I> and this among the rest, whether 
 <I>our brother hath aught against us;</I> then, if ever, we are 
 disposed to be serious, and therefore should then call ourselves to an 
 account. 

 (2.) Religious exercises are not acceptable to God, if they are 
 performed when we are in wrath; envy, malice, and uncharitableness, are 
 sins so displeasing to God, that nothing pleases him which comes from a 
 heart wherein they are predominant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:8">1 Tim. ii. 8</A>.

 Prayers made in wrath are written in gall,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:15,58:4">Isa. i. 15; lviii. 4</A>.

 (3.) Love or charity is so much <I>better than all burnt-offerings and
 sacrifice,</I> that God will have reconciliation made with an offended 
 brother before the gift be offered; he is content to stay for the gift, 
 rather than have it offered while we are under guilt and engaged in a 
 quarrel. 

 (4.) Though we are unfitted for communion with God, by a continual 
 quarrel with a brother, yet that can be no excuse for the omission or 
 neglect of our duty: "<I>Leave there thy gift before the altar,</I> 
 lest otherwise, when thou has gone away, thou be tempted not to come 
 again." Many give this as a reason why they do not come to church or to 
 the communion, because they are at variance with some neighbour; and 
 whose fault is that? One sin will never excuse another, but will rather 
 double the guilt. Want of charity cannot justify the want of piety. The 
 difficulty is easily got over; those who have wronged us, we must 
 forgive; and those whom we have wronged, we must make satisfaction to, 
 or at least make a tender of it, and desire a renewal of the 
 friendship, so that if reconciliation be not made, it may not be our 
 fault; <I>and then come,</I> come and welcome, <I>come and offer thy 
 gift,</I> and it shall be accepted. <I>Therefore</I> we must <I>not let 
 the sun go down upon our wrath</I> any day, because we must go to 
 prayer before we go to sleep; much less let the sun rise <I>upon our 
 wrath</I> on a sabbath-day, because it is a day of prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Because, till this be done, we lie exposed to much danger, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 It is at our peril if we do not labour after an agreement, and that 
 quickly, upon two accounts:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Upon a temporal account. If the offence we have done to our 
 brother, in his body, goods, or reputation, be such as will bear 
 action, in which he may recover considerable damages, it is our wisdom, 
 and it is our duty to our family, to prevent that by a humble 
 submission and a just and peaceable satisfaction; lest otherwise he 
 recover it by law, and put us to the extremity of a prison. In such a 
 case it is better to compound and make the best terms we can, than to 
 stand it out; for it is in vain to contend with the law, and there is 
 danger of our being crushed by it. Many ruin their estates by an 
 obstinate persisting in the offences they have given, which would soon 
 have been pacified by a little yielding at first. Solomon's advice in 
 case of suretyship is, <I>Go, humble thyself,</I> and so secure <I>and 
 deliver thyself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:1-5">Prov. vi. 1-5</A>.

 It is good to agree, for the law is costly. Though we must be merciful 
 to those we have advantage against, yet we must be just to those that 
 have advantage against us, as far as we are able. "<I>Agree,</I> and 
 compound <I>with thine adversary quickly,</I> lest he be exasperated by 
 thy stubbornness, and provoked to insist upon the utmost demand, and 
 will not make thee the abatement which at first he would have made." A 
 prison is an uncomfortable place to those who are brought to it by 
 their own pride and prodigality, their own wilfulness and folly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Upon a spiritual account. "<I>Go,</I> and be <I>reconciled to thy 
 brother,</I> be just to him, be friendly with him, because while the 
 quarrel continues, as thou art unfit to <I>bring thy gift to the 
 altar,</I> unfit to come to <I>the table of the Lord,</I> so thou art 
 unfit to die: if thou persist in this sin, there is danger lest thou be 
 suddenly snatched away by the wrath of God, whose judgment thou canst 
 not escape nor except against; and if that iniquity be laid to thy 
 charge, thou art undone for ever." Hell is a prison for all that live 
 and die in malice and uncharitableness, for all that are 
 <I>contentious</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:8">Rom. ii. 8</A>),

 and out of that prison there is no rescue, no redemption, no escape, to
 eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is very applicable to the great business of our reconciliation to 
 God through Christ; <I>Agree with him quickly, whilst thou art in the 
 way.</I> Note, 

 [1.] The great God is an Adversary to all sinners, 
 <B><I>Antidikos</I></B>--<I>a law-adversary;</I> he has a controversy 
 with them, an action against them. 

 [2.] It is our concern to <I>agree with him,</I> to acquaint ourselves 
 with him, that we may <I>be at peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:21,2Co+5:20">Job xxii. 21; 2 Cor. v. 20</A>.

 [3.] It is our wisdom to do this <I>quickly, while we are in the 
 way.</I> While we are alive, <I>we are in the way;</I> after death, it 
 will be too late to do it; therefore <I>give not sleep to thine 
 eyes</I> till it be done. 

 [4.] They who continue in a state of enmity to God, are continually 
 exposed to the arrests of his justice, and the most dreadful instances 
 of his wrath. Christ is the Judge, to whom impenitent sinners will be
 delivered; for <I>all judgment is committed to the Son;</I> he that was 
 rejected as a Saviour, cannot be escaped as a Judge,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:16,17">Rev. vi. 16, 17</A>.

 It is a fearful thing to be thus turned over to the Lord Jesus, when 
 the Lamb shall become the Lion. Angels are the officers to whom Christ 
 will deliver them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:41,42"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 41, 42</A>);

 devils are so too, having <I>the power of death</I> as executioners to
 all unbelievers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14">Heb. ii. 14</A>.

 Hell is the prison, into which those will be cast that continue in a 
 state of enmity to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:4">2 Pet. ii. 4</A>.

 [5.] Damned sinners must remain in it to eternity; they shall not
 <I>depart till they have paid the uttermost farthing,</I> and that will 
 not be to the utmost ages of eternity: divine justice will be for ever 
 in the satisfying, but never satisfied.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an exposition of the seventh commandment, given us by the 
 same hand that made the law, and therefore was fittest to be the 
 interpreter of it: it is the law against uncleanness, which fitly 
 follows upon the former; <I>that</I> laid a restraint upon sinful 
 passions, <I>this</I> upon sinful appetites, both which ought always to 
 be under the government of reason and conscience, and if indulged, are 
 equally pernicious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The command is here laid down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 <I>Thou shalt not commit adultery;</I> which includes a prohibition of 
 all other acts of uncleanness, and the desire of them: but the 
 Pharisees, in their expositions of this command, made it to extend no 
 further than the act of adultery, suggesting, that if the iniquity was 
 only <I>regarded in the heart,</I> and went no further, God could not 
 hear it, would not regard it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:18">Ps. lxvi. 18</A>),

 and therefore they thought it enough to be able to say that they were
 <I>no adulterers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:11">Luke xviii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is here explained in the strictness of it, in three things, 
 which would seem new and strange to those who had been always governed 
 by the tradition of the elders, and took all for oracular that they 
 taught.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We are here taught, that there is such a thing as 
 <I>heart-adultery,</I> adulterous thoughts and dispositions, which 
 never proceed to the act of adultery or fornication; and perhaps the 
 defilement which these give to the soul, that is here so clearly 
 asserted, was not only included in the seventh commandment, but was 
 signified and intended in many of those ceremonial pollutions under the 
 law, for which they were to <I>wash their clothes, and bathe their 
 flesh in water. Whosoever looketh on a woman</I> (not only another 
 man's wife, as some would have it, but any woman), <I>to lust after 
 her, has committed adultery with her in his heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 This command forbids not only the acts of fornication and adultery, 
 but, 

 (1.) All appetites to them, all lusting after the forbidden object; 
 this is the beginning of the sin, <I>lust conceiving</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:15">James i. 15</A>);
 
 it is a bad step towards the sin; and where the lust is dwelt upon and
 approved, and the wanton desire is rolled under the tongue as a sweet 
 morsel, it is the commission of sin, as far as the heart can do it; 
 there wants nothing but convenient opportunity for the sin itself.
 <I>Adultera mens est--The mind is debauched.</I> Ovid. Lust is 
 conscience baffled or biassed: biassed, if it say nothing against the 
 sin; baffled, if it prevail not in what is says. 

 (2.) All approaches toward them; feeding the eye with the sight of the 
 forbidden fruit; not only looking for that end, that I may lust; but 
 looking till I do lust, or looking to gratify the lust, where further 
 satisfaction cannot be obtained. The eye is both the inlet and outlet 
 of a great deal of wickedness of this kind, witness Joseph's mistress 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:7">Gen. xxxix. 7</A>),
 
 Samson
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:1">Judg. xvi. 1</A>),
 
 David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:2">2 Sam. xi. 2</A>.

 We read the <I>eyes full of adultery, that cannot cease from sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:14">2 Pet. ii. 14</A>.

 What need have we, therefore, with holy Job, to <I>make a covenant with
 our eyes,</I> to make this bargain with them that they should have the 
 pleasure of beholding the light of the sun and the works of God, 
 provided they would never fasten or dwell upon any thing that might 
 occasion impure imaginations or desires; and under this penalty, that 
 if they did, they must smart for it in penitential tears!
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:1">Job xxxi. 1</A>.
 
 What have we the covering of the eyes for, but to restrain corrupt
 glances, and to keep out of their defiling impressions? This forbids 
 also the using of any other of our senses to stir up lust. If ensnaring 
 looks are forbidden fruit, much more unclean discourses, and wanton 
 dalliances, the fuel and bellows of this hellish fire. These precepts
 are hedges about the law of heart-purity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 And if looking be lust, they who dress and deck, and expose themselves, 
 with design to be looked at and lusted after (like Jezebel, that 
 <I>painted her face and tired her head, and looked out at the 
 window</I>) are no less guilty. Men sin, but devils tempt to sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That such looks and such dalliances are so very dangerous and 
 destructive to the soul, that it is better to lose the eye and the hand 
 that thus offend then to give way to the sin, and perish eternally in 
 it. This lesson is here taught us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>.

 Corrupt nature would soon object against the prohibition of 
 heart-adultery, that it is impossible to governed by it; "<I>It is a 
 hard saying, who can bear it?</I> Flesh and blood cannot but look with 
 pleasure upon a beautiful woman; and it is impossible to forbear 
 lusting after and dallying with such an object." Such pretences as 
 these will scarcely be overcome by reason, and therefore must be argued 
 against with <I>the terrors of the Lord,</I> and so they are here 
 argued against.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is a severe operation that is here prescribed for the 
 preventing of these fleshly lusts. <I>If thy right eye offend thee,</I> 
 or <I>cause thee to offend,</I> by wanton glances, or wanton gazings, 
 upon forbidden objects; <I>if thy right hand off end thee,</I> or 
 <I>cause thee to offend,</I> by wanton dalliances; and if it were 
 indeed impossible, as is pretended, to govern the eye and the hand, and 
 they have been so accustomed to these wicked practices, that they will 
 not be withheld from them; if there be no other way to restrain them 
 (which, blessed be God, through his grace, there is), it were better 
 for us to <I>pluck out the eye,</I> and <I>cut off the hand,</I> though 
 the <I>right eye,</I> and <I>right hand,</I> the more honourable and 
 useful, than to indulge them in sin to the ruin of the soul. And if 
 this must be submitted to, at the thought of which nature startles, 
 much more must we resolve to <I>keep under the body, and to bring it 
 into subjection;</I> to live a life of mortification and self-denial; 
 to keep a constant watch over our own hearts, and to suppress the first 
 rising of lust and corruption there; to avoid the occasions of sin, to 
 resist the beginnings of it, and to decline the company of those who 
 will be a snare to us, though ever so pleasing; to keep out of harm's 
 way, and abridge ourselves in the use of lawful things, when we find 
 them temptations to us; and to seek unto God for his grace, and depend 
 upon that grace daily, and so to <I>walk in the Spirit,</I> as that we 
 may not <I>fulfil the lusts of the flesh;</I> and this will be as 
 effectual as <I>cutting off a right hand</I> or <I>pulling out a right 
 eye;</I> and perhaps as much against the grain to flesh and blood; it 
 is the destruction of the old man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is a startling argument that is made use of to enforce this 
 prescription 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),
 
 and it is repeated in the same words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),
 
 because we are loth to hear such rough things; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:10">Isa. xxx. 10</A>.

 <I>It is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish,</I> 
 though it be an eye or a hand, which can be worse spared, <I>and not 
 that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</I> Note, 

 [1.] It is not unbecoming a minister of the gospel to preach of hell 
 and damnation; nay, he <I>must</I> do it, for Christ himself did it; 
 and we are unfaithful to our trust, if we give not warning of <I>the 
 wrath to come.</I> 

 [2.] There are some sins from which we need to be <I>saved with 
 fear,</I> particularly <I>fleshly lusts,</I> which are such <I>natural 
 brute beasts</I> as cannot be checked, but by being frightened; cannot 
 be kept from a forbidden tree, but by <I>cherubim, with a flaming 
 sword.</I> 

 [3.] When we are tempted to think it hard to <I>deny ourselves,</I> and 
 to <I>crucify fleshly lusts,</I> we ought to consider how much harder 
 it will be to lie for ever in <I>the lake that burns with fire and 
 brimstone;</I> those do not know or do not believe what hell is, that 
 will rather venture their eternal ruin in those flames, than deny 
 themselves the gratification of a base and brutish lust. 

 [4.] In hell there will be torments for the body; the <I>whole body</I> 
 will <I>be cast into hell,</I> and there will be torment in every part 
 of it; so that if we have a care of our own bodies, we shall <I>possess 
 them in sanctification and honour,</I> and <I>not in the lusts of 
 uncleanness.</I> 

 [5.] Even those duties that are most unpleasant to flesh and blood, are 
 <I>profitable for us;</I> and our Master requires nothing from us but 
 what he knows to be for our advantage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That men's divorcing of their wives upon dislike, or for any other 
 cause except adultery, however tolerated and practised among the Jews, 
 was a violation of the seventh commandment, as it opened a door to 
 adultery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How the matter now stood with reference to divorce. <I>It hath 
 been said</I> (he does not say as before, <I>It hath been said by them 
 of old time,</I> because this was not a precept, as those were, though 
 the Pharisees were willing so to understand it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:7"><I>ch.</I> xix. 7</A>,

 but only a permission), "<I>Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him
 give her a bill of divorce;</I> let him not think to do it by word of 
 mouth, when he is in a passion; but let him do it deliberately, by a 
 legal instrument in writing, attested by witnesses; if he will dissolve 
 the matrimonial bond, let him do it solemnly." Thus the law had 
 prevented rash and hasty divorces; and perhaps at first, when writing 
 was not so common among the Jews, that made divorces rare things; but 
 in process of time it became very common, and this direction of how to 
 do it, when there was just cause for it, was construed into a 
 permission of it for any cause,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:3"><I>ch.</I> xix. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How this matter was rectified and amended by our Saviour. He 
 reduced the ordinance of marriage to its primitive institution: <I>They 
 two shall be one flesh,</I> not to be easily separated, and therefore 
 divorce is not to be allowed, except in case of adultery, which breaks 
 the marriage covenant; but he that puts away his wife upon any other 
 pretence, <I>causeth her to commit adultery,</I> and him also that 
 shall marry her when she is thus divorced. Note, Those who lead others 
 into temptation to sin, or leave them in it, or expose them to it, make 
 themselves guilty of their sin, and will be accountable for it. This is 
 one way of being <I>partaker with adulterers</I>

 time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the

 it is God's throne:

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an exposition of the third commandment, which we are the 
 more concerned right to understand, because it is particularly said, 
 that <I>God will not hold him guiltless,</I> however he may hold 
 himself, who breaks this commandment, by <I>taking the name of the Lord 
 in vain.</I> Now as to this command,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is agreed on all hands that it forbids perjury, forswearing, and 
 the violation of oaths and vows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 This was said to them of old time, and is the true intent and meaning 
 of the third commandment. <I>Thou shalt not</I> use, or <I>take up,
 the name of God</I> (as we do by an oath) <I>in vain,</I> or <I>unto 
 vanity,</I> or <I>a lie.</I> He <I>hath not lift up his soul unto 
 vanity,</I> is expounded in the next words, <I>nor sworn 
 deceitfully,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:4">Ps. xxiv. 4</A>.

 Perjury is a sin condemned by the light of nature, as a complication of
 impiety toward God and injustice toward man, and as rendering a man 
 highly obnoxious to the divine wrath, which was always judged to follow 
 so infallibly upon that sin, that the forms of swearing were commonly 
 turned into execrations or imprecations; as that, <I>God do so to me, 
 and more also;</I> and with us, <I>So help me God;</I> wishing I may 
 never have any help from God, if I swear falsely. Thus, by the consent 
 of nations, have men cursed themselves, not doubting but that God would 
 curse them, if they lied against the truth then, when they solemnly 
 called God to witness to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is added, from some other scriptures, <I>but shalt perform unto the 
 Lord thine oaths</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+30:2">Num. xxx. 2</A>);
 
 which may be meant, either,

 1. Of those promises to which God is a party, vows made to God; these
 must be punctually paid

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:4,5">Eccl. v. 4, 5</A>):

 or,

 2. Of those promises made to our brethren, to which God was a Witness,
 he being appealed to concerning our sincerity; these must be 
 <I>performed to the Lord,</I> with an eye to him, and for his sake: for 
 to him, by ratifying the promises with an oath, we have made ourselves 
 debtors; and if we break a promise so ratified, <I>we have not lied 
 unto men</I> only, <I>but unto God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is here added, that the commandment does not only forbid false 
 swearing, but all rash, unnecessary swearing: <I>Swear not at all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:34,Jam+5:12"><I>v.</I> 34; 
 Compare Jam. v. 12</A>.
 
 Not that all swearing is sinful; so far from
 that, if rightly done, it is a part of religious worship, and we in it 
 <I>give unto God the glory due to his name.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:13,10:20,Isa+45:23,Jer+4:2">Deut. vi. 13; x. 20; 
 Isa. xlv. 23; Jer. iv. 2</A>.

 We find Paul confirming what he said by such solemnities 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:23">2 Cor. i. 23</A>),
 
 when there was a necessity for it. In swearing, we pawn the truth of 
 something known, to confirm the truth of something doubtful or unknown; 
 we appeal to a greater knowledge, to a higher court, and imprecate the 
 vengeance of a righteous Judge, if we swear deceitfully.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the mind of Christ in this matter is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That we must <I>not swear at all,</I> but when we are duly called to 
 it, and justice or charity to our brother, or respect to the 
 commonwealth, make it necessary for <I>the end of strife</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:16">Heb. vi. 16</A>),

 of which necessity the civil magistrate is ordinarily to be the judge.
 We may be sworn, but we must now swear; we may be adjured, and so 
 obliged to it, but we must not thrust ourselves upon it for our own 
 worldly advantage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That we must not swear lightly and irreverently, in common 
 discourse: it is a very great sin to make a ludicrous appeal to the 
 glorious Majesty of heaven, which, being a sacred thing, ought always 
 to be very serious: it is a gross profanation of God's holy name, and 
 of one of the holy things which the <I>children of Israel sanctify to 
 the Lord:</I> it is a sin that has no cloak, no excuse for it, and 
 therefore a sign of a graceless heart, in which enmity to God reigns: 
 <I>Thine enemies take thy name in vain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That we must in a special manner avoid promissory oaths, of which 
 Christ more particularly speaks here, for they are oaths that are to be 
 performed. The influence of an affirmative oath immediately ceases, 
 when we have faithfully discovered the truth, and the whole truth; but 
 a promissory oath binds so long, and may be so many ways broken, by the 
 surprise as well as strength of a temptation, that it is not to be used 
 but upon great necessity: the frequent requiring and using of oaths, is 
 a reflection upon Christians, who should be of such acknowledged 
 fidelity, as that their sober words should be as sacred as their solemn 
 oaths.</P>

 4. That we must not swear by any other creature. It should seem there 
 were some, who, in civility (as they thought) to the name of God, would 
 not make use of that in swearing, but would swear <I>by heaven or 
 earth, &c.</I> This Christ forbids here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>)

 and shows that there is nothing we can swear by, but it is some way or 
 other related to God, who is the Fountain of all beings, and therefore 
 that it is as dangerous to swear by them, as it is to swear by God 
 himself: it is the verity of the creature that is laid at stake; now 
 that cannot be an instrument of testimony, but as it has regard to God, 
 who is the <I>summum verum--the chief Truth.</I> As for instance,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Swear not by the heaven;</I> "As sure as there is a heaven, 
 this is true;" <I>for it is God's throne,</I> where he resides, and in 
 a particular manner manifests his glory, as a Prince upon his throne: 
 this being the inseparable dignity of the upper world, you cannot 
 <I>swear by heaven,</I> but you swear by God himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool.</I> He governs the 
 motions of this lower world; as he rules in heaven, so he rules over 
 the earth; and though under his feet, yet it is also under his eye and 
 care, and stands in relation to him as his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:1">Ps. xxiv. 1</A>.

 <I>The earth is the Lord's;</I> so that in swearing by it, you swear by
 its Owner.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) <I>Neither by Jerusalem,</I> a place for which the Jews had such a 
 veneration, that they could not speak of any thing more sacred to 
 <I>swear by;</I> but beside the common reference Jerusalem has to God, 
 as part of the earth, it is in special relation to him, <I>for it is 
 the city of the great King</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:2">Ps. xlviii. 2</A>),
 
 <I>the city of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:4">Ps. xlvi. 4</A>),

 he is therefore interested in it, and in every oath taken by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) "<I>Neither shalt thou swear by the head;</I> though it be near 
 thee, and an essential part of thee, yet it is more God's than thine; 
 for he made it, and formed all the springs and powers of it; whereas 
 thou thyself canst not, from any natural intrinsic influence, change 
 the colour of <I>one hair,</I> so as to make <I>it white or black;</I> 
 so that thou canst not <I>swear by thy head,</I> but thou swearest by 
 him who is the <I>Life of thy head,</I> and <I>the Lifter up of 
 it.</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:3">Ps. iii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That therefore in all our communications we must content ourselves 
 with, <I>Yea, yea,</I> and <I>nay, nay,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 In ordinary discourse, if we affirm a thing, let us only say, 
 <I>Yea,</I> it is so; and, if need be, to evidence our assurance of a 
 thing, we may double it, and say, <I>Yea, yea,</I> indeed it is so: 
 <I>Verily, verily,</I> was our Saviour's <I>yea, yea.</I> So if we deny 
 a thing, let is suffice to say, No; or if it be requisite, to repeat 
 the denial, and say, No, no; and if our fidelity be known, that will 
 suffice to gain us credit; and if it be questioned, to back what we say 
 with swearing and cursing, is but to render it more suspicious. They 
 who can <I>swallow</I> a profane oath, will not <I>strain at a</I> lie. 
 It is a pity that this, which Christ puts in the mouths of all his 
 disciples, should be fastened, as a name of reproach, upon a sect 
 faulty enough other ways, when (as Dr. Hammond says) we are not 
 forbidden any more than <I>yea</I> and <I>nay,</I> but are in a manner 
 directed to the use of that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The reason is observable; <I>For whatsoever is more than these cometh 
 of evil,</I> though it do not amount to the iniquity of an oath. It 
 comes <B><I>ek tou Diabolou</I></B>; so an ancient copy has it: it 
 comes <I>from the Devil,</I> the evil one; it comes from the corruption 
 of men's nature, from passion and vehemence; from a reigning vanity in 
 the mind, and a contempt of sacred things: it comes from that 
 deceitfulness which is in men, <I>All men are liars;</I> therefore men 
 use these protestations, because they are distrustful one of another, 
 and think they cannot be believed without them. Note, Christians 
 should, for the credit of their religion, avoid not only that which is 
 in itself evil, but <I>that which cometh of evil,</I> and has <I>the 
 appearance of</I> it. That may be suspected as a bad thing, which comes 
 from a bad cause. An oath is physic, which supposes a disease.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the law of retaliation is expounded, and in a manner 
 repealed. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the <I>Old-Testament permission</I> was, in case of injury; and 
 here the expression is only, <I>Ye have heard that is has been 
 said;</I> not, as before, concerning the commands of the decalogue, 
 <I>that it has been said by,</I> or to, <I>them of old time.</I> It was 
 a command, that every one should of necessity require such 
 satisfaction; but they might lawfully insist upon it, if they pleased; 
 <I>an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</I> This we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:24,Le+24:20,De+19:21">Exod. xxi. 24; 
 Lev. xxiv. 20; Deut. xix. 21</A>;

 in all which places it is appointed to be done by the magistrate, who 
 <I>bears not the sword in vain,</I> but is <I>the minister of God, an 
 avenger to execute wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:4">Rom. xiii. 4</A>.

 It was a direction to the judges of the Jewish nation what punishment
 to inflict in case of maims, for terror to such as would do mischief on 
 the one hand, and for a restraint to such as have mischief done to them 
 on the other hand, that they may not insist on a greater punishment 
 than is proper: it is not <I>a life for an eye,</I> nor <I>a limb for a 
 tooth,</I> but observe a proportion; and it is intimated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:31">Num. xxxv. 31</A>),

 that the forfeiture in this case might be redeemed with money; for when
 it is provided that <I>no ransom shall be taken for the life of a 
 murderer,</I> it is supposed that for maims a pecuniary satisfaction 
 was allowed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But some of the Jewish teachers, who were not the most compassionate 
 men in the world, insisted upon it as necessary that such revenge 
 should be taken, even by private persons themselves, and that there was 
 no room left for remission, or the acceptance of satisfaction. Even 
 now, when they were under the government of the Roman magistrates, and 
 consequently the judicial law fell to the ground of course, yet they 
 were still zealous for any thing that looked harsh and severe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, so far this is in force with us, as a direction to magistrates, to 
 use the sword of justice according to the good and wholesome laws of 
 the land, for the terror of evil-doers, and the vindication of the 
 oppressed. That judge <I>neither feared God nor regarded man,</I> who 
 would not <I>avenge</I> the poor widow <I>of her adversary,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:2,3">Luke xviii. 2, 3</A>.

 And it is in force as a rule to lawgivers, to provide accordingly, and
 wisely to apportion punishments to crimes, for the restraint of rapine 
 and violence, and the protection of innocency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the <I>New-Testament precept</I> is, as to the complainant 
 himself, his duty is, to <I>forgive the injury</I> as done to himself, 
 and no further to insist upon the punishment of it than is necessary to 
 the public good: and this precept is consonant to the meekness of 
 Christ, and the gentleness of his yoke.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things Christ teaches us here:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must not be revengeful 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>);

 <I>I say unto you, that ye resist not evil;</I>--the evil person that 
 is injurious to you. The resisting of any ill attempt upon us, is here 
 as generally and expressly forbidden, as <I>the resisting of the higher 
 powers</I> is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:2">Rom. xiii. 2</A>);

 and yet this does not repeal the law of self-preservation, and the care
 we are to take of our families; we may <I>avoid evil,</I> and may 
 <I>resist</I> it, so far as is necessary to our own security; but we 
 must not <I>render evil for evil,</I> must not bear a grudge, nor 
 avenge ourselves, nor study to be even with those that have treated us 
 unkindly, but we must go beyond them by forgiving them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:22,24:29,25:21,22,Ro+12:7">Prov. xx. 22; xxiv. 29; xxv. 21, 22;
 Rom. xii. 7</A>.

 The law of retaliation must be made consistent with the law of love: 
 nor, if any have injured us, is our recompence in our own hands, but in 
 the hands of God, to whose wrath we must give place; and sometimes in 
 the hands of his viceregents, where it is necessary for the 
 preservation of the public peace; but it will not justify us in hurting 
 our brother to say that he began, for it is the second blow that makes 
 the quarrel; and when we were injured, we had an opportunity not to 
 justify our injuring him, but to show ourselves the true disciples of 
 Christ, by forgiving him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three things our Saviour specifies, to show that Christians must 
 patiently yield to those who bear hard upon them, rather than contend; 
 and these include others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A blow on the cheek, which is an injury to me in my body; 
 "<I>Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek,</I>" which is not 
 only a hurt, but an affront and indignity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:20">2 Cor. xi. 20</A>),

 if a man in anger or scorn thus abuse thee, "<I>turn to him the other 
 cheek;</I>" that is, "instead of avenging that injury, prepare for 
 another, and bear it patiently: give not the rude man as good as he 
 brings; do not challenge him, nor enter an action against him; if it be 
 necessary to the public peace that he be bound to his good behaviour, 
 leave that to the magistrate; but for thine own part, it will 
 ordinarily be the wisest course to pass it by, and take no further 
 notice of it: there are no bones broken, no great harm done, forgive it 
 and forget it; and if proud fools think the worse of thee, and laugh at 
 thee for it, all wise men will value and honour thee for it, as a 
 follower of the blessed Jesus, who, though he was the Judge of Israel, 
 did not smite those who smote him on the cheek," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:1">Micah v. 1</A>.

 Though this may perhaps, with some base spirits, expose us to the like
 affront another time, and so it is, in effect, to <I>turn the other 
 cheek,</I> yet let not that disturb us, but let us trust God and his 
 providence to protect us in the way of our duty. Perhaps, the forgiving 
 of one injury may prevent another, when the avenging of it would but 
 draw on another; some will be overcome by submission, who by resistance 
 would but be the more exasperated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:22">Prov. xxv. 22</A>.

 However, our recompence is in Christ's hands, who will reward us with 
 eternal glory for the shame we thus patiently endure; and though it be 
 not directly inflicted, it if be quietly borne for conscience' sake, 
 and in conformity to Christ's example, it shall be put upon the score 
 of suffering for Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The loss of a coat, which is a wrong to me in my estate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>);
 
 <I>If any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat.</I> It 
 is a hard case. Note, It is common for legal processes to be made use 
 of for the doing of greatest injuries. Though judges be just and
 circumspect, yet it is possible for bad men who make no conscience of 
 oaths and forgeries, by course of law to force off the coat from a 
 man's back. <I>Marvel not at the matter</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:8">Eccl. v. 8</A>),

 but, in such a case, rather than go to the law by way of revenge,
 rather than exhibit a cross bill, or stand out to the utmost, in 
 defence of that which is thy undoubted right, <I>let him</I> even take 
 <I>thy cloak also.</I> If the matter be small, which we may lose 
 without an considerable damage to our families, it is good to submit to 
 it for peace' sake. "It will not cost thee so much to buy another 
 cloak, as it will cost thee by course of law to recover that; and 
 therefore unless thou canst get it again by fair means, it is better to 
 let him take it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The going a mile by constraint, which is a wrong to me in my 
 liberty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>);

 "<I>Whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile,</I> to run an errand for 
 him, or to wait upon him, grudge not at it, but <I>go with him two 
 miles</I> rather than fall out with him:" say not, "I would do it, if I 
 were not compelled to it, but I hate to be forced;" rather say, 
 "Therefore I will do it, for otherwise there will be a quarrel;" and it 
 is better to serve him, than to serve thy own lusts of pride and 
 revenge. Some give this sense of it: The Jews taught that the disciples 
 of the wise, and the students of the law, were not to be pressed, as 
 others might, by the king's officers, to travel upon the public 
 service; but Christ will not have his disciples to insist upon this 
 privilege, but to comply rather than offend the government. The sum of 
 all is, that Christians must not be litigious; small injuries must be 
 submitted to, and no notice taken of them; and if the injury be such as 
 requires us to seek reparation, it must be for a good end, and without 
 thought of revenge: though we must not invite injuries, yet we must 
 meet them cheerfully in the way of duty, and make the best of them. If 
 any say, Flesh and blood cannot pass by such an affront, let them 
 remember, that <I>flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of 
 God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We must be charitable and beneficent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>);

 must not only do no hurt to our neighbours, but labour to do them all 
 the good we can. 

 (1.) We must be ready to give; "<I>Give to him that asketh thee.</I> If 
 thou has an ability, look upon the request of the poor as giving thee 
 an opportunity for the duty of almsgiving." When a real object of 
 charity presents itself, we should give at the first word: <I>Give a 
 portion to seven, and also to eight;</I> yet the affairs of our charity 
 must be <I>guided with discretion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:5">Ps. cxii. 5</A>),

 lest we give that to the idle and unworthy, which should be given to
 those that are necessitous, and deserve well. What God says to us, we 
 should be ready to say to our poor brethren, <I>Ask, and it shall be 
 given you.</I>

 (2.) We must be ready to lend. This is sometimes as great a piece of 
 charity as giving; as it not only relieves the present exigency, but 
 obliges the borrower to providence, industry, and honesty; and 
 therefore, "<I>From him that would borrow of thee</I> something to live 
 on, or something to trade on, <I>turn not thou away:</I> shun not those 
 that thou knowest have such a request to make of thee, nor contrive 
 excuses to shake them off." Be easy of access to him <I>that would 
 borrow:</I> though he be bashful, and have not confidence to make known 
 his case and beg the favour, yet thou knowest both his need and his 
 desire, and therefore offer him the kindness. <I>Exorabor antequam 
 rogor; honestis precibus occuram--I will be prevailed on before I am 
 entreated; I will anticipate the becoming petition.</I> Seneca, <I>De 
 Vit&acirc; Beat&acirc;.</I> It becomes us to be thus forward in acts of 
 kindness, for before we call, God hears us, and <I>prevents us with the 
 blessings of his goodness.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>43  Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy

 &nbsp; 44  But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
 you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
 despitefully use you, and persecute you;

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, lastly, an exposition of that great fundamental law of 
 the second table, <I>Thou shalt love thy neighbour,</I> which was the 
 fulfilling of the law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See here how this law was corrupted by the comments of the Jewish 
 teachers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 God said, <I>Thou shalt love thy neighbour;</I> and by <I>neighbour</I> 
 they understood those only of their own country, nation, and religion; 
 and those only that they were pleased to look upon as their friends: 
 yet this was not the worst; from this command, <I>Thou shalt love thy 
 neighbour,</I> they were willing to infer what God never designed; 
 <I>Thou shalt hate thine enemy;</I> and they looked upon whom they 
 pleased as their enemies, thus making void the great command of God by 
 their traditions, though there were express laws to the contrary, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:4,5,De+23:7">Exod. xxiii. 4, 5; Deut. xxiii. 7</A>.

 <I>Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, nor an Egyptian,</I> though these
 nations had been as much enemies to Israel as any whatsoever. It was 
 true, God appointed them to destroy the seven devoted nations of 
 Canaan, and not to make leagues with them; but there was a particular 
 reason for it--to make room for Israel, and that they might not be 
 <I>snares to them;</I> but it was very ill-natured from hence to infer, 
 that they must hate all their enemies; yet the moral philosophy of the 
 heathen then allowed this. It is Cicero's rule, <I>Nemini nocere nisi 
 prius lacessitum injuri&acirc;--To injure no one, unless previously
 injured. De Offic.</I> See how willing corrupt passions are to fetch 
 countenance from the word of God, and to <I>take occasion by the 
 commandment</I> to justify themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See how it is cleared by the command of the Lord Jesus, who teaches 
 us another lesson: "<I>But I say unto you, I,</I> who come to be the 
 great Peace-Maker, the general Reconciler, who loved you when you were 
 strangers and enemies, <I>I say, Love your enemies,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 Though men are ever so bad themselves, and carry it ever so basely 
 towards us, yet that does not discharge us from the great debt we owe 
 them, of love to our kind, love to our kin. We cannot but find 
 ourselves very prone to wish the hurt, or at least very coldly to 
 desire the good, of those <I>that hate</I> us, and have been abusive to 
 us; but that which is at the bottom hereof is a root of bitterness, 
 which must be plucked up, and a remnant of corrupt nature which grace 
 must conquer. Note, it is the great duty of Christians to <I>love their 
 enemies;</I> we cannot have complacency in one that is openly wicked 
 and profane, nor put a confidence in one that we know to be deceitful; 
 nor are we to love all alike; but we must pay respect to the human 
 nature, and so far <I>honour all men:</I> we must take notice, with 
 pleasure, of that even in our enemies which is amiable and commendable; 
 ingenuousness, good temper, learning, and moral virtue, kindness to 
 others, profession of religion, &c., and love that, though they are our 
 enemies. We must have a compassion for them, and a good will toward 
 them. We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That we must <I>speak</I> well of them: <I>Bless them that curse 
 you.</I> When we speak to them, we must answer their revilings with 
 courteous and friendly words, and <I>not render railing for 
 railing;</I> behind their backs we must commend that in them which is 
 commendable, and when we have said all the good we can of them, not be 
 forward to say any thing more. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:9">1 Pet. iii. 9</A>.

 They, in whose tongues is <I>the law of kindness,</I> can give good
 words to those who give bad words to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That we must <I>do</I> well to them: "<I>Do good to them that hate 
 you,</I> and that will be a better proof of love than good words. Be 
 ready to do them all the real kindness that you can, and glad of an 
 opportunity to do it, in their bodies, estates, names, families; and 
 especially to do good to their souls." It was said of Archbishop 
 Cranmer, that the way to make him a friend was to do him an ill turn; 
 so many did he serve who had disobliged him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We must <I>pray for them:</I> <I>Pray for them that despitefully use 
 you, and persecute you.</I> Note, 

 (1.) It is no new thing for the most excellent saints to be hated, and 
 cursed, and persecuted, and despitefully used, by wicked people; Christ 
 himself was so treated.

 (2.) That when at any time we meet with such usage, we have an 
 opportunity of showing our conformity both to the precept and to the 
 example of Christ, by praying for them who thus abuse us. If we cannot 
 otherwise testify our love to them, yet this way we may without 
 ostentation, and it is such a way as surely we durst not dissemble in.
 We must pray that God will forgive them, that they may never fare the 
 worse for any thing they have done against us, and that he would make 
 them to be at peace with us; and this is one way of making them so.
 Plutarch, in his Laconic Apophthegms, has this of Aristo; when one 
 commended Cleomenes's saying, who, being asked <I>what a good king 
 should do,</I> replied, <B><I>Tous men philous euergetein, tous de 
 echthrous kakos poiein</I></B>--<I>Good turns to his friends, and evil 
 to his enemies;</I> he said, How much better is it <B><I>tous men 
 philous euergetein, tous de echthrous philous poiein</I></B>--to <I>do 
 good to our friends, and make friends of our enemies.</I> This is 
 <I>heaping coals of fire on their heads.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two reasons are here given to enforce this command (which sounds so 
 harsh) of <I>loving our enemies.</I> We must do it,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That we may be <I>like God our Father;</I> "that ye may be, may 
 approve yourselves to be, <I>the children of your Father which is in 
 heaven.</I>" Can we write a better copy? It is a copy in which love to 
 the worst of enemies is reconciled to, and consistent with, infinite 
 purity and holiness. God <I>maketh his sun to rise,</I> and <I>sendeth 
 rain,</I> on <I>the just and the unjust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 Note, <I>First, Sunshine</I> and <I>rain</I> are great blessings to the 
 world, and they come from God. It is <I>his sun</I> that <I>shines,</I> 
 and the rain is sent by him. They do not come of course, or by chance, 
 but from God. <I>Secondly,</I> Common mercies must be valued as
 instances and proofs of the goodness of God, who in them shows himself 
 a bountiful Benefactor to the world of mankind, who would be very 
 miserable without these favours, and are utterly unworthy of the least 
 of them. <I>Thirdly,</I> These gifts of common providence are
 dispensed indifferently to <I>good</I> and <I>evil, just</I> and 
 <I>unjust;</I> so that we cannot know <I>love</I> and <I>hatred</I> by 
 what is <I>before us,</I> but by what is <I>within us;</I> not by the 
 shining of the sun on our heads, but by the rising of the Sun of 
 Righteousness in our hearts. <I>Fourthly,</I> The worst of men partake 
 of the comforts of this life in common with others, though they abuse 
 them, and fight against God with his own weapons; which is an amazing 
 instance of God's patience and bounty. It was but once that God forbade 
 his sun to shine on the Egyptians, when the Israelites had <I>light in 
 their dwellings;</I> God could make such a distinction every day.
 <I>Fifthly,</I> The gifts of God's bounty to wicked men that are in 
 rebellion against him, teach us to <I>do good to those that hate 
 us;</I> especially considering, that though there is in us a carnal 
 mind which is enmity to God, yet we share in his bounty.
 <I>Sixthly,</I> Those only will be accepted as the children of God, who 
 study to resemble him, particularly in his goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That we may herein <I>do more than others,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:46,47"><I>v.</I> 46, 47</A>.
 
 <I>First, Publicans love their friends.</I> Nature inclines them to it; 
 interest directs them to it. To do good to them who do good to us, is a 
 common piece of humanity, which even those whom the Jews hated and 
 despised could give as good proofs as of the best of them. The 
 publicans were men of no good fame, yet they were grateful to such as 
 had helped them to their places, and courteous to those they had a 
 dependence upon; and shall we be no better than they? In doing this we 
 serve ourselves and consult our own advantage; and what reward can we 
 expect for that, unless a regard to God, and a sense of duty, carrying 
 us further than our natural inclination and worldly interest?
 <I>Secondly,</I> We must therefore love our enemies, that we may exceed
 them. If we must go beyond scribes and Pharisees, much more beyond 
 publicans. Note, Christianity is something more than humanity. It is a 
 serious question, and which we should frequently put to ourselves, 
 "<I>What do we more than others? What excelling thing do we do?</I> We 
 <I>know</I> more than others; we <I>talk</I> more of the things of God 
 than others; we <I>profess,</I> and have <I>promised,</I> more than 
 others; God has done more for us, and therefore justly expects more 
 from us than from others; the glory of God is more concerned in us than 
 in others; but <I>what do we more than others?</I> Wherein do we live 
 above the rate of the children of this world? <I>Are we not carnal,</I> 
 and do we not walk as men, below the character of Christians? In this 
 especially we must do more than others, that while every one will 
 render <I>good for good,</I> we must render <I>good for evil;</I> and 
 this will speak a nobler principle, and is consonant to a higher rule, 
 than the most of men act by. Others <I>salute their brethren,</I> they 
 embrace those of their own party, and way, and opinion; but we must not 
 so confine our respect, but <I>love our enemies,</I> otherwise <I>what 
 reward have we?</I> We cannot expect the reward of Christians, if we 
 rise no higher than the virtue of publicans." Note, Those who promise 
 themselves a reward above others must study to <I>do more than 
 others.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Our Saviour concludes this subject with this exhortation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>),

 <I>Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father which is in heaven is 
 perfect.</I> Which may be understood, 

 1. In general, including all those things wherein we must be
 <I>followers of God as dear children.</I> Note, It is the duty of 
 Christians to desire, and aim at, and press toward a perfection in 
 grace and holiness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:12-14">Phil. iii. 12-14</A>.

 And therein we must study to conform ourselves to the example of our 
 heavenly Father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:15,16">1 Pet. i. 15, 16</A>.
 
 Or,

 2. In this particular before mentioned, of <I>doing good to our
 enemies;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:36">Luke vi. 36</A>.

 It is God's perfection to <I>forgive injuries</I> and to <I>entertain
 strangers,</I> and to do good to the evil and unthankful, and it will 
 be ours to be like him. We that owe <I>so much,</I> that owe <I>our 
 all,</I> to the divine bounty, ought to copy it out as well as we 
 can.</P>
