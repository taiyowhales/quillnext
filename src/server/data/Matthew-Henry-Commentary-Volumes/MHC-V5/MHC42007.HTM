 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Christ confirming the doctrine he had preached in the former
 chapter, with two glorious miracles--the curing of one at a distance, 
 and that was the centurion's servant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>),

 and the raising of one to life that was dead, the widow's son at Nain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:11-18">ver. 11-18</A>.

 II. Christ confirming the faith of John who was now in prison, and of
 some of his disciples, by sending him a short account of the miracles
 he wrought, in answer to a question he received from him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:19-23">ver. 19-23</A>),

 to which he adds an honourable testimony concerning John, and a just
 reproof to the men of that generation for the contempt they put upon
 him and his doctrine,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:24-35">ver. 24-35</A>.

 III. Christ comforting a poor penitent that applied herself to him, all 
 in tears of godly sorrow for sin, assuring her that her sins were 
 pardoned, and justifying himself in the favour he showed her against 
 the cavils of a proud Pharisee,

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the
 people, he entered into Capernaum.
 &nbsp; 2 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was
 sick, and ready to die.
 &nbsp; 3 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of
 the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.
 &nbsp; 4 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly,
 saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:
 &nbsp; 5 For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.
 &nbsp; 6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from
 the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him,
 Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou
 shouldest enter under my roof:
 &nbsp; 7 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee:
 but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
 &nbsp; 8 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me
 soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another,
 Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth
 <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 9 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and
 turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I
 say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
 &nbsp; 10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the
 servant whole that had been sick.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some difference there is between this story of the cure of the 
 centurion's servant as it is related here and as we had it in 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:5">Matt. viii. 5</A>,
 
 &c. There it was said that the centurion came to Christ; here it is
 said that he sent to him first some of the <I>elders of the Jews</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and afterwards some other <I>friends,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 But it is a rule that <I>we are said to do that which we do by 
 another--Quod facimus per alium, id ipsum facere judicamur.</I> The 
 centurion might be said to do that which he did by his proxies; as a 
 man takes possession by his attorney. But it is probable that the 
 centurion himself came at last, when Christ said to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:13">Matt. viii. 13</A>),

 <I>As thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This miracle is here said to have been wrought by our Lord Jesus 
 <I>when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 What Christ said he said <I>publicly;</I> whoever would might come and 
 hear him: <I>In secret have I said nothing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:20">John xviii. 20</A>.
 
 Now, to give an undeniable proof of the <I>authority</I> of his
 <I>preaching word,</I> he here gives an incontestable proof of the 
 <I>power</I> and <I>efficacy</I> of his <I>healing word.</I> He that 
 had such a commanding empire in the kingdom of nature as that he could 
 command away diseases, no doubt has such a sovereignty in the kingdom 
 of grace as to enjoin duties displeasing to flesh and blood, and bind, 
 under the highest penalties, to the observance of them. This miracle 
 was wrought in Capernaum, where most of Christ's mighty works were 
 done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:23">Matt. xi. 23</A>.
 
 Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The centurion's servant that was sick was <I>dear to his master,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It was the praise of the servant that by his diligence and 
 faithfulness, and a manifest concern for his master and his interest, 
 as for himself and for his own, he recommended himself to his master's 
 esteem and love. Servants should study to <I>endear</I> themselves to 
 their masters. It was likewise the praise of the master that, when he 
 had a good servant, he knew how to value him. Many masters, that are 
 haughty and imperious, think it favour enough to the best servants they 
 have not to rate them, and beat them, and be cruel to them, whereas 
 they ought to be kind to them, and tender of them, and solicitous for 
 their welfare and comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The master, <I>when he heard of Jesus,</I> was for making 
 application to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Masters ought to take particular care of their servants when they are 
 <I>sick,</I> and not to neglect them then. This centurion begged that
 <I>Christ would come and heal his servant.</I> We may now, by faithful 
 and fervent prayer, apply ourselves to Christ in heaven, and ought to 
 do so, when sickness is in our families; for Christ is still the great 
 Physician.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He sent some of the <I>elders of the Jews</I> to Christ, to 
 represent the case, and solicit for him, thinking that a greater piece 
 of respect to Christ than if he had come himself, because he was an 
 uncircumcised Gentile, whom he thought Christ, being a prophet, would 
 not care for conversing with. For that reason he sent Jews, whom he 
 acknowledged to be favourites of Heaven, and not ordinary Jews neither, 
 but <I>elders of the Jews,</I> persons in authority, that the dignity 
 of the messengers might give honour to him to whom they were sent. 
 Balak sent princes to Balaam.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The elders of the Jews were hearty intercessors for the centurion: 
 <I>They besought him instantly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 were very urgent with him, pleading for the centurion that which he 
 would never have pleaded for himself, <I>that he was worthy for whom he 
 should do this.</I> If any Gentile was qualified to receive such a 
 favour, surely he was. The centurion said, <I>I am not</I> so much as 
 <I>worthy</I> of a visit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:8">Matt. viii. 8</A>),

 but the elders of the Jews thought him worthy of the cure; thus 
 <I>honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. Let another man praise 
 thee, and not thy own mouth.</I> But that which they insisted upon in 
 particular was, that, though he was a Gentile, yet he was a hearty 
 well-wisher to the Jewish nation and religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They thought there needed as much with Christ as there did with them to 
 remove the prejudices against him as a Gentile, a Roman, and an officer 
 of the army, and therefore mention this, 

 1. That he was well-affected to the people of the Jews: <I>He loveth
 our nation</I> (which few of the Gentile did). Probably he had read the 
 Old Testament, whence it was easy to advance to a very high esteem of 
 the Jewish nation, as favoured by Heaven above all people. Note, Even 
 conquerors, and those <I>in power,</I> ought to keep up an affection 
 for the conquered, and those they have <I>power over.</I> 

 2. That he was well-affected to their worship: <I>He built them a</I>
 new <I>synagogue</I> at Capernaum, finding that what they had was 
 either gone to decay or not large enough to contain the people, and 
 that the inhabitants were not of ability to build one for themselves. 
 Hereby he testified his veneration for the God of Israel, his belief of 
 his being the one only living and true God, and his desire, like that 
 of Darius, to have an interest in the prayers of God's Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:10">Ezra vi. 10</A>.

 This centurion built a synagogue at his own proper costs and charges,
 and probably employed his soldiers that were in garrison there in the 
 building, to keep them from idleness. Note, Building places of meeting 
 for religious worship is a very <I>good work,</I> is an instance of 
 love to God and his people; and those who do good works of that kind 
 are <I>worthy of double honour.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Jesus Christ was very ready to show kindness to the centurion. He 
 presently <I>went with them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 though he was a Gentile; for <I>is he the Saviour of the Jews only? Is 
 he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:29">Rom. iii. 29</A>.
 
 The centurion did not think himself worthy to visit Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 yet Christ thought him worthy to be visited by him; for those that
 <I>humble themselves shall be exalted.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The centurion, when he heard that Christ was doing him the honour 
 to come to his house, gave further proofs both of his humility and of 
 his faith. Thus the graces of the saints are quickened by Christ's 
 approaches towards them. <I>When he was now not far from the house,</I> 
 and the centurion had notice of it, instead of setting his house in 
 order for his reception, he <I>sends friends</I> to meet him with fresh 
 expressions, 

 1. Of his <I>humility: "Lord, trouble not thyself,</I> for I am
 unworthy of such an honour, because I am a Gentile." This bespeaks not 
 only his low thoughts of himself notwithstanding the greatness of his 
 figure; but his high thoughts of Christ, notwithstanding the meanness 
 of his figure in the world. He knew how to honour a prophet of God, 
 though he was despised and rejected of men. 

 2. Of his <I>faith:</I> "Lord, <I>trouble not thyself,</I> for I know
 there is no occasion; thou canst <I>cure</I> my servant without coming 
 <I>under my roof,</I> by that almighty power from which <I>no thought 
 can be withholden. Say, in a word, and my servant shall be healed:</I>" 
 so far was this centurion from Namaan's fancy, that he should come to 
 him, and stand, and <I>strike his hand over the</I> patient, and so 
 <I>recover</I> him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:11">2 Kings v. 11</A>.

 He illustrates this faith of his by a comparison taken from his own
 profession, and is confident that Christ can as easily command away the 
 distemper as he can command any of his soldiers, can as easily send an 
 angel with commission to cure this servant of his as he can send a 
 soldier on an errand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Christ has a sovereign power over all the creatures and all their 
 actions, and can change the course of nature as he pleases, can rectify 
 its disorders and repair its decays in human bodies; for <I>all power 
 is given to him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Our Lord Jesus was wonderfully well pleased with the faith of the 
 centurion, and the more surprised at it because he was a Gentile; and, 
 the centurion's faith having thus honoured Christ, see how he honoured 
 it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>He turned him about,</I> as one amazed, and <I>said to the people 
 that followed him, I have not found so great faith, no not in 
 Israel.</I> Note, Christ will have those that follow him to observe and 
 take notice of the great examples of faith that are sometimes set 
 before them--especially when any such are found among those that do not 
 follow Christ so closely as they do in profession--that we may be 
 shamed by the strength of their faith out of the weakness and waverings 
 of ours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. The cure was <I>presently</I> and <I>perfectly</I> wrought 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>).

 <I>They that were sent</I> knew they had their errand, and therefore
 went back, and found the servant well, and under no remains at all of 
 his distemper. Christ will take cognizance of the distressed case of 
 poor servants, and be ready to relieve them; for there <I>is no respect 
 of persons with him.</I> Nor are the Gentiles excluded from the benefit 
 of his grace; nay, this was a specimen of that much greater faith which 
 would be found among the Gentiles, when the gospel should be published, 
 than among the Jews.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city
 called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much
 people.
 &nbsp; 12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there
 was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she
 was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
 &nbsp; 13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and
 said unto her, Weep not.
 &nbsp; 14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare <I>him</I>
 stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
 &nbsp; 15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he
 delivered him to his mother.
 &nbsp; 16 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God,
 saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God
 hath visited his people.
 &nbsp; 17 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Jud&aelig;a, and
 throughout all the region round about.
 &nbsp; 18 And the disciples of John showed him of all these things.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of Christ's raising to life a widow's son at 
 Nain, that was dead and in the carrying out to be buried, which Matthew 
 and Mark had made no mention of; only, in the general, Matthew had 
 recorded it, in Christ's answer to the disciples of John, that <I>the 
 dead were raised</I> up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:5">Matt. xi. 5</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Where, and when, this miracle was wrought. It was the <I>next day 
 after</I> he had cured the centurion's servant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Christ was doing good <I>every day,</I> and never had cause to complain 
 that he had <I>lost a day.</I> It was done at the gate of a small city, 
 or town, called <I>Nain,</I> not far from Capernaum, probably the same 
 with a city called <I>Nais,</I> which Jerome speaks of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Who were the witnesses of it. It is as well attested as can be, for 
 it was done in the sight of two crowds that met in or near the gate of 
 the city. There was a crowd of <I>disciples</I> and other <I>people</I> 
 attending Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and a crowd of relations and neighbours attending the funeral of the 
 young man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Thus there was a sufficient number to attest the truth of this miracle, 
 which furnished greater proof of Christ's divine authority than his 
 healing diseases; for by no power of nature, or any means, can the dead 
 be raised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How it was wrought by our Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The person raised to life was a <I>young man,</I> cut off by death 
 in the beginning of his days--a common case; <I>man comes forth like a
 flower and is cut down.</I> That he was really dead was universally 
 agreed. There could be no collusion in the case; for Christ was 
 <I>entering into the town,</I> and had not seen him till now that he 
 met him upon the bier. He was <I>carried out</I> of the city; for the 
 Jews' burying-places were without their cities, and at some distance 
 from them. This young man was the <I>only son of his mother,</I> and 
 <I>she a widow.</I> She depended upon him to be the staff of her old 
 age, but he proves a broken reed; every man at his best estate is so. 
 How numerous, how various, how very calamitous, are the afflictions of 
 the afflicted in this world! What a vale of tears is it! What a Bochim, 
 a place of weepers! We may well think how deep the <I>sorrow</I> of 
 this poor mother was for her <I>only son</I> (such sorrowing is 
 referred to as expressive of the greatest grief,--
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:10">
 Zech. xii. 10</A>),

 and it was the deeper in that she was a <I>widow,</I> broken with 
 breach upon breach, and a <I>full end made of her comforts. Much people 
 of the city was with her, condoling</I> with her loss, to 
 <I>comfort</I> her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ showed both his <I>pity</I> and his <I>power</I> in raising 
 him to life, that he might give a specimen of both, which shine so 
 brightly in man's redemption.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) See how <I>tender</I> his <I>compassions</I> are towards the 
 afflicted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>When the Lord saw</I> the poor widow following her son to the grave, 
 <I>he had compassion on her.</I> Here was not application made to him 
 for her, not so much as that he would speak some words of comfort to 
 her, but, <I>ex mero motu--purely from the goodness of his nature,</I> 
 he was troubled for her. The case was piteous, and he looked upon it 
 with pity. His eye affected his heart; and he <I>said unto her, Weep 
 not.</I> Note, Christ has a concern for the mourners, for the 
 miserable, and often <I>prevents them with the blessing of his 
 goodness.</I> He undertook the work of our redemption and salvation, 
 <I>in his love and in his pity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9">Isa. lxiii. 9</A>.

 What a pleasing idea does this give us of the compassions of the Lord
 Jesus, and the multitude of his <I>tender mercies,</I> which may be
 very comfortable to us when at any time we are in sorrow! Let poor
 widows comfort themselves in their sorrows with this, that Christ
 <I>pities them</I> and knows their souls in adversity; and, if others
 despise their grief, he does not. Christ said, <I>Weep not;</I> and he
 could give her a reason for it which no one else could: "Weep not for a
 <I>dead son,</I> for he shall presently become a <I>living one.</I>"
 This was a reason peculiar to her case; yet there is a reason common to
 all that sleep in Jesus, which is of equal force against inordinate and
 excessive grief for their death--that they shall rise again, shall
 rise in glory; and therefore we must <I>not sorrow as those that have
 no hope,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:13">1 Thess. iv. 13</A>.

 Let Rachel, that <I>weeps for her children, refrain her eyes from
 tears,</I> for <I>there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy
 children shall come again to their own border,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:17">Jer. xxxi. 17</A>.

 And let our <I>passion</I> at such a time be checked and claimed by the
 consideration of Christ's <I>compassion.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) See how <I>triumphant</I> his <I>commands</I> are over even death 
 itself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>He came, and touched the bier,</I> or coffin, in or upon which the 
 dead body lay; for to him it would be no pollution. Hereby he
 intimated to the bearers that they should not proceed; he had something 
 to say to the dead young man. <I>Deliver him from going down to the 
 pit; I have found a ransom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:24">Job xxxiii. 24</A>.

 Hereupon <I>they that bore him stood still,</I> and probably let down
 the bier from their shoulders to the ground, and opened the coffin, it 
 if was closed up; and then with solemnity, as one that had authority, 
 and to whom belonged the issues from death, he said, <I>Young man, I 
 say unto thee, Arise.</I> The young man was <I>dead,</I> and could not 
 arise by any power of his own (no more can those that are spiritually 
 dead in trespasses and sins); yet it was no absurdity at all for Christ 
 to bid him <I>arise,</I> when a power went along with that word to 
 <I>put life</I> into him. The gospel call to all people, to young 
 people particularly, is, "<I>Arise,</I> arise from the dead, and Christ 
 shall give you light and life." Christ's dominion over death was 
 evidenced by the immediate effect of his word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>He that was dead sat up.</I> Have we grace from Christ? Let us show 
 it. Another evidence of life was that he <I>began to speak;</I> for 
 whenever Christ gives us spiritual life he <I>opens the lips</I> in 
 prayer and praise. And, <I>lastly,</I> he would not oblige this young 
 man, to whom he had given a new life, to go along with him as his 
 disciple, to minister to him (though he owed him even his own self), 
 much less as a trophy or show to get honour by him, but <I>delivered 
 him to his mother,</I> to attend her as became a dutiful son; for 
 Christ's miracles were miracles of mercy, and a great act of mercy this 
 was to this widow; now she was <I>comforted,</I> according to the time 
 in which she had been afflicted and much more, for she could now look 
 upon this son as a particular favourite of Heaven, with more pleasure 
 than if he had not died.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What influence it had upon the people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>There came a fear on all;</I> it frightened them all, to see a dead 
 man start up alive out of his coffin in the open street, at the command 
 of a man; they were all struck with wonder at his miracle, and 
 <I>glorified God.</I> The Lord and his goodness, as well as the Lord 
 and his greatness, are to be feared. The inference they drew from it 
 was, "<I>A great prophet is risen up among us,</I> the great prophet 
 that we have been long looking for; doubtless, he is one divinely 
 inspired who can thus breathe life into the dead, and in him <I>God 
 hath visited his people,</I> to redeem them, as was expected," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:68">Luke i. 68</A>.

 This would be <I>life from the dead</I> indeed to all them that waited
 for the consolation of Israel. When dead souls are thus raised to 
 spiritual life, by a divine power going along with the gospel, we must 
 glorify God, and look upon it as a gracious visit to his people. The
 report of this miracle was carried,

 1. In general, all the country over

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>This rumour of him,</I> that he was the great prophet, <I>went 
 forth</I> upon the wings of fame <I>through all Judea,</I> which lay a 
 great way off, and throughout all Galilee, which was the <I>region 
 round about.</I> Most had this notice of him, yet few believed in him, 
 and gave up themselves to him. Many have the <I>rumour</I> of Christ's 
 gospel in their ears that have not the <I>savour</I> and <I>relish</I> 
 of it in their souls. 

 2. In particular, it was carefully brought to John Baptist, who was now
 in prison

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>His disciples came,</I> and gave him an account of all things, that
 he might know that though <I>he</I> was bound yet <I>the word of the 
 Lord was not bound;</I> God's work was going on, though he was laid 
 aside.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  And John calling <I>unto him</I> two of his disciples sent <I>them</I>
 to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for
 another?
 &nbsp; 20 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist
 hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or
 look we for another?
 &nbsp; 21 And in that same hour he cured many of <I>their</I> infirmities
 and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many <I>that were</I> blind
 he gave sight.
 &nbsp; 22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell
 John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see,
 the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead
 are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.
 &nbsp; 23 And blessed is <I>he,</I> whosoever shall not be offended in me.
 &nbsp; 24 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to
 speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the
 wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
 &nbsp; 25 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
 raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live
 delicately, are in kings' courts.
 &nbsp; 26 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto
 you, and much more than a prophet.
 &nbsp; 27 This is <I>he,</I> of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
 messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before
 thee.
 &nbsp; 28 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there
 is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is
 least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
 &nbsp; 29 And all the people that heard <I>him,</I> and the publicans,
 justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
 &nbsp; 30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God
 against themselves, being not baptized of him.
 &nbsp; 31 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of
 this generation? and to what are they like?
 &nbsp; 32 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and
 calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and
 ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.
 &nbsp; 33 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking
 wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.
 &nbsp; 34 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say,
 Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans
 and sinners!
 &nbsp; 35 But wisdom is justified of all her children.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All this discourse concerning John Baptist, occasioned by his sending 
 to ask whether he was the Messiah or no, we had, much as it is here 
 related, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:2-19">Matt. xi. 2-19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here the message John Baptist sent to Christ, and the return 
 he made to it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great thing we are to enquire concerning Christ is whether he be 
 he that should come to redeem and save sinners, or whether we are to 
 look for another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 We are sure that God has promised that a Saviour shall come, an 
 anointed Saviour; we are as sure that what he has promised he will 
 perform in its season. If this Jesus be that promised Messiah, we will 
 receive him, and will look for no other; but, if not, we will continue 
 our expectations, and, though he tarry, will wait for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The faith of John Baptist himself, or at least of his disciples, 
 wanted to be <I>confirmed</I> in this matter; for Christ had not yet 
 publicly declared himself to be indeed the Christ, nay, he would not 
 have his disciples, who knew him to be so, to speak of it, till the 
 proofs of his being so were completed in his resurrection. The great 
 men of the Jewish church had not owned him, nor had he gained any 
 interest that was likely to set him upon the throne of his father 
 David. Nothing of that power and grandeur was to be seen about him in 
 which it was expected that the Messiah would appear; and therefore it 
 is not strange that they should ask, <I>Art thou the Messiah?</I> not 
 doubting but that, if he was not, he would direct them what 
 <I>other</I> to <I>look for.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ left it to his own works to praise him in the gates, to tell 
 what he was and to prove it. While John's messengers were with him, he 
 wrought many miraculous cures, <I>in that same hour,</I> which perhaps 
 intimates that they staid but <I>an hour</I> with him; and what a deal 
 of work did Christ do in a little time! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 <I>He cured many of their infirmities and plagues</I> in body, and of 
 <I>evil spirits</I> that affected the mind either with frenzy or 
 melancholy, and <I>unto many that were blind he gave sight.</I> He 
 multiplied the cures, that there might be no ground left to suspect a 
 fraud; and then

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 he bade them <I>go and tell John what they had seen.</I> And he and 
 they might easily argue, as even the common people did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:31">John vii. 31</A>),
 
 <I>When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this 
 man hath done?</I> These cures, which they saw him work, were not only 
 confirmations of his commission, but explications of it. The Messiah 
 must come to cure a diseased world, to give light and sight to them 
 that sit in darkness, and to restrain and conquer evil spirits. You see 
 that Jesus does this to the bodies of people, and therefore must 
 conclude this is he that should come to do it to the souls of people, 
 and you are to <I>look for no other.</I> To his miracles in the kingdom 
 of nature he adds this in the kingdom of grace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 <I>To the poor the gospel is preached,</I> which they knew was to be 
 done by the Messiah; for he was anointed to <I>preach the gospel to the 
 meek</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1">Isa. lxi. 1</A>),

 and to <I>save the souls of the poor and needy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:13">Ps. lxxii. 13</A>.

 Judge, therefore, whether you can look for any other that will more 
 fully answer the characters of the Messiah and the great intentions of 
 his coming.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He gave them an intimation of the danger people were in of being 
 prejudiced against him, notwithstanding these evident proofs of his 
 being the Messiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me,</I> or 
 <I>scandalized</I> at me. We are here in a state of trial and
 probation; and it is agreeable to such a state that, as there are 
 sufficient arguments to <I>confirm the truth</I> to those that are 
 <I>honest</I> and <I>impartial</I> in searching after it, and have 
 their minds prepared to receive it, so there should be also objections, 
 to <I>cloud the truth</I> to those that are careless, worldly, and 
 sensual. Christ's education at Nazareth, his residence at Galilee, the 
 meanness of his family and relations, his poverty, and the 
 despicableness of his followers--these and the like were 
 stumbling-blocks to many, which all the miracles he wrought could not 
 help them over. He is <I>blessed,</I> for he is wise, humble, and well 
 disposed, that is not overcome by these prejudices. It is a sign that 
 God has <I>blessed</I> him, for it is by his grace that he is helped 
 over these stumbling-stones; <I>and he shall be blessed</I> indeed, 
 blessed in Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have here the high encomium which Christ gave of John Baptist; 
 not while his messengers were present (lest he should seem to flatter 
 him), but <I>when they were departed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 to make the people sensible of the advantages they had enjoyed in 
 John's ministry, and were deprived of by his imprisonment. Let them now 
 consider <I>what they went out into the wilderness to see,</I> who that 
 was about whom there had been so much talk and such a great and general 
 amazement. "Come," saith Christ, "I will tell you."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was a man of unshaken <I>self-consistence,</I> a man of 
 steadiness and constancy. He was not a <I>reed shaken with the 
 wind,</I> first in one direction and then in another, shifting with 
 every wind; he was <I>firm</I> as a <I>rock,</I> not <I>fickle</I> as a 
 <I>reed.</I> If he could have bowed like a <I>reed</I> to Herod, and 
 have complied with the court, he might have been a favourite there; but 
 <I>none of these things moved him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was a man of unparalleled <I>self-denial,</I> a great example of 
 mortification and contempt of the world. He was not <I>a man clothed in 
 soft raiment,</I> nor did he <I>live delicately</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 but, on the contrary, he lived in a wilderness and was clad and fed 
 accordingly. Instead of adorning and pampering the body, he brought it 
 under, and kept it in subjection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He was <I>a prophet,</I> had his commission and instructions 
 immediately from God, and not of man or by man. He was by birth a 
 <I>priest,</I> but that is never taken notice of; for his glory, as a 
 prophet, eclipsed the honour of his priesthood. Nay, he was
 <I>more,</I> he was <I>much more than a prophet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 than any of the prophets of the Old Testament; for they spoke of Christ 
 as at a distance, he spoke of him as at the door.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He was the harbinger and forerunner of the Messiah, and was himself 
 prophesied of in the Old Testament 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>This is he of whom it is written</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal. iii. 1</A>),

 <I>Behold, I send my messenger before thy face.</I> Before he sent the 
 Master himself, he sent a messenger, to give notice of his coming, and 
 prepare people to receive him. Had the Messiah been to appear as a 
 <I>temporal prince,</I> under which character the carnal Jews expected 
 him, his <I>messenger</I> would have appeared either in the <I>pomp</I> 
 of a <I>general</I> or the <I>gaiety</I> of a <I>herald at arms;</I> 
 but it was a <I>previous</I> indication, plain enough, of the 
 <I>spiritual</I> nature of Christ's kingdom, that the messenger he sent 
 before him to <I>prepare his way</I> did it by preaching repentance and 
 reformation of men's hearts and lives. Certainly that kingdom was not 
 of this world which was thus ushered in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He was, upon this account, so great, that really there was not a 
 <I>greater prophet</I> than he. <I>Prophets</I> were the 
 <I>greatest</I> that were <I>born of women,</I> more honourable than 
 kings and princes, and John was the <I>greatest</I> of all the 
 <I>prophets.</I> The country was not sensible what a <I>valuable,</I> 
 what an <I>invaluable,</I> man it had in it, when John Baptist went 
 about preaching and baptizing. And yet <I>he that is least in the 
 kingdom of God is greater than he.</I> The least gospel minister, that 
 has obtained mercy of the Lord to be <I>skilful</I> and <I>faithful</I> 
 in his work, or the meanest of the <I>apostles</I> and first preachers 
 of the gospel, being <I>employed</I> under a more <I>excellent</I> 
 dispensation, are in a more honourable office than John Baptist. The 
 meanest of those that <I>follow the Lamb</I> far excel the greatest of 
 those that went before him. Those therefore who live under the gospel 
 dispensation have so much the more to answer for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have here the just censure of the men of that generation, who 
 were not wrought upon by the ministry either of John Baptist or of 
 Jesus Christ himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ here shows what contempt was put upon John Baptist, while he 
 was preaching and baptizing. 

 (1.) Those who did show him any respect were but the common ordinary 
 sort of people, who, in the eye of the gay part of mankind, were rather
 a disgrace to him than a credit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 <I>The people</I> indeed, the vulgar herd, of whom it was said, <I>This 
 people, who know not the law, are cursed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:49">John vii. 49</A>),

 and the publicans, men of ill fame, as being generally men of bad
 morals, or taken to be so, these were <I>baptized with his baptism,</I> 
 and became his disciples; and these, though glorious monuments of 
 divine grace, yet did not <I>magnify John</I> in the eye of the world; 
 but by their repentance and reformation they <I>justified God,</I> 
 justified his conduct and the wisdom of it in appointing such a one as 
 John Baptist to be the forerunner of the Messiah: they hereby made it 
 to appear that it was the best method that could be taken, for it was 
 not in vain to <I>them</I> whatever it was to others.

 (2.) The great men of their church and nation, the <I>polite</I> and 
 the <I>politicians,</I> that would have done him some credit in the eye 
 of the world, did him all the dishonour they could; they heard him 
 indeed, but they were not <I>baptized of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 The Pharisees, who were most in reputation for religion and devotion, 
 and the lawyers, who were celebrated for their learning, especially 
 their knowledge of the scriptures, <I>rejected the counsel of God 
 against themselves;</I> they <I>frustrated it,</I> they <I>received the 
 grace of God,</I> by the baptism of John, in <I>vain.</I> God in 
 sending that <I>messenger</I> among them had a kind <I>purpose</I> of 
 good to them, <I>designed</I> their salvation by it, and, if they had 
 closed with the counsel of God, it had been <I>for themselves,</I> they 
 had been made for ever; but they <I>rejected it,</I> would not comply 
 with it, and it was <I>against themselves,</I> it was to their own 
 ruin; they came short of the benefit intended them, and not only so, 
 but forfeited the grace of God, put a bar in their own door, and, by 
 refusing that discipline which was to fit them for the kingdom of the 
 Messiah, shut themselves out of it, and they not only excluded 
 themselves, but hindered others, and stood in their way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He here shows the strange perverseness of the men of that 
 generation, in their cavils both against John and Christ, and the 
 prejudices they conceived against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They made but a jesting matter of the methods God took to do them 
 good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "<I>Whereunto shall I liken the men of this generation?</I> What can I 
 think of absurd enough to represent them by? They are, then, <I>like
 children sitting in the market-place,</I> that mind nothing that is 
 serious, but are as full of play as they can hold. As if God were but
 in jest with them, in all the methods he takes to do them good, as 
 children are with one another in the market-place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 they turn it all off with a banter, and are not more affected with it 
 than with a piece of pageantry." This is the ruin of multitudes, they 
 can never persuade themselves to be <I>serious</I> in the concerns of 
 their souls. Old men, sitting in the sanhedrim, were but as <I>children 
 sitting in the market-place,</I> and no more affected with the things 
 that belonged to their everlasting peace than people are with 
 children's play. O the amazing stupidity and vanity of the blind and 
 ungodly world! The Lord awaken them out of their security.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They still found something or other to carp at. 

 [1.] John Baptist was a reserved austere man, lived much in solitude, 
 and ought to have been admired for being such a humble, sober, 
 self-denying man, and hearkened to as a man of thought and 
 contemplation; but this, which was his praise, was turned to his 
 reproach. Because he came <I>neither eating nor drinking,</I> so 
 freely, plentifully, and cheerfully, as others did, <I>you say, "He has 
 a devil;</I> he is a melancholy man, he is possessed, as the demoniac 
 whose dwelling was <I>among the tombs,</I> though he be not quite so 
 wild."

 [2.] Our Lord Jesus was of a more free and open conversation; he 
 <I>came eating and drinking,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 He would go and dine with Pharisees, though he knew they did not care 
 for him; and with publicans, though he knew they were no credit to him; 
 yet, in hopes of doing good both to the one and the other, he conversed 
 familiarly with them. By this it appears that the ministers of Christ 
 may be of very different tempers and dispositions, very different ways 
 of preaching and living, and yet all good and useful; <I>diversity of 
 gifts,</I> but each given to <I>profit withal.</I> Therefore none must 
 make themselves a standard to all others, nor judge hardly of those 
 that do not do just as they do. John Baptist bore witness to Christ, 
 and Christ applauded John Baptist, though they were the reverse of each 
 other in their way of living. But the common enemies of them both 
 reproached them both. The very same men that had represented John as 
 <I>crazed in his intellects,</I> because he came <I>neither eating nor 
 drinking,</I> represented our Lord Jesus as <I>corrupt in his 
 morals,</I> because he came <I>eating and drinking; he is a gluttonous 
 man, and a wine-bibber.</I> Ill-will never speaks well. See the malice 
 of wicked people, and how they put the worst construction upon every 
 thing they meet with in the gospel, and in the preachers and professors 
 of it; and hereby they think to depreciate <I>them,</I> but really 
 destroy <I>themselves.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He shows that, notwithstanding this, God will be glorified in the 
 salvation of a chosen remnant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>Wisdom is justified of all her children.</I> There are those who are 
 given to wisdom <I>as her children,</I> and they shall be brought by 
 the grace of God to submit to wisdom's conduct and government, and 
 thereby to justify wisdom in the ways she takes for bringing them to 
 that submission; for to them they are effectual, and thereby appear 
 well chosen. Wisdom's children are herein unanimous, one and all, they 
 have all a complacency in the methods of grace which divine wisdom 
 takes, and think never the worse of them for their being ridiculed by 
 some.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>36  And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with
 him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.
 &nbsp; 37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when
 she knew that <I>Jesus</I> sat at meat in the Pharisee's house,
 brought an alabaster box of ointment,
 &nbsp; 38 And stood at his feet behind <I>him</I> weeping, and began to
 wash his feet with tears, and did wipe <I>them</I> with the hairs of
 her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed <I>them</I> with the
 ointment.
 &nbsp; 39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw <I>it,</I> he
 spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet,
 would have known who and what manner of woman <I>this is</I> that
 toucheth him: for she is a sinner.
 &nbsp; 40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to
 say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.
 &nbsp; 41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one
 owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.
 &nbsp; 42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them
 both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?
 &nbsp; 43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that <I>he,</I> to whom he
 forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.
 &nbsp; 44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou
 this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water
 for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped
 <I>them</I> with the hairs of her head.
 &nbsp; 45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came
 in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
 &nbsp; 46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath
 anointed my feet with ointment.
 &nbsp; 47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are
 forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,
 <I>the same</I> loveth little.
 &nbsp; 48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
 &nbsp; 49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within
 themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
 &nbsp; 50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
 peace.

 When and where this passage of story happened does not appear; this 
 evangelist does not observe order of time in his narrative so much as 
 the other evangelists do; but it comes in here, upon occasion of 
 Christ's being reproached as <I>a friend to publicans and sinners,</I> 
 to show that it was only for their good, and to bring them to 
 repentance, that he conversed with them; and that those whom he 
 admitted hear him were reformed, or in a hopeful way to be so. Who this 
 woman was that here testified so great an affection to Christ does not 
 appear; it is commonly said to be Mary Magdalene, but I find no ground 
 in scripture for it: she is described 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:2,Mk+16:9"><I>ch.</I> viii. 2 and Mark xvi. 9</A>)

 to be one <I>out of whom Christ had cast seven devils;</I> but that is
 not mentioned here, and therefore it is probable that it was not she. 
 Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The civil entertainment which a Pharisee gave to Christ, and his 
 gracious acceptance of that entertainment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>One of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him,</I> 
 either because he thought it would be a reputation to him to have such 
 a guest at his table or because his company would be an entertainment 
 to him and his family and friends. It appears that this Pharisee did 
 not believe in Christ, for he will not own him to be a <I>prophet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 and yet our Lord Jesus accepted his invitation, <I>went into his house, 
 and sat down to meat,</I> that they might see he took the same liberty 
 with Pharisees that he did with publicans, in hopes of <I>doing them 
 good.</I> And those may venture further into the society of such as are 
 prejudiced against Christ, and his religion, who have wisdom and grace 
 sufficient to instruct and argue with them, than others may.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great respect which a poor penitent sinner showed him, when he 
 was at meat in the Pharisee's house. It was a woman in the city <I>that 
 was a sinner,</I> a Gentile, a <I>harlot,</I> I doubt, known to be so, 
 and infamous. She <I>knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's 
 house,</I> and, having been converted from her wicked course of life by 
 his preaching, she came to acknowledge her obligations to him, having 
 no opportunity of doing it in any other way than by <I>washing</I> his 
 feet, and anointing them with some sweet ointment that she brought with 
 her for that purpose. The way of sitting at table then was such that 
 their feet were partly <I>behind them.</I> Now this woman did not look 
 Christ in the face, but came <I>behind him,</I> and did the part of a 
 <I>maid-servant,</I> whose office it was to <I>wash the feet</I> of the 
 guests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:41">1 Sam. xxv. 41</A>)
 
 and to prepare the ointments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now in what this good woman did, we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Her <I>deep humiliation</I> for sin. She stood behind him 
 <I>weeping;</I> her eyes had been the inlets and outlets of sin, and 
 now she makes them fountains of tears. Her face is now foul with 
 weeping, which perhaps used to be covered with paints. Her hair now
 made a towel of, which before had been plaited and adorned. We have 
 reason to think that she had before sorrowed for sin; but, now that she 
 had an opportunity of coming into the presence of Christ, the wound 
 bled afresh and her sorrow was renewed. Note, It well becomes 
 penitents, upon all their approaches to Christ, to renew their godly 
 sorrow and shame for sin, <I>when he is pacified,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:63">Ezek. xvi. 63</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Her <I>strong affection</I> to the Lord Jesus. This was what our 
 Lord Jesus took special notice of, that she <I>loved much,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:42,47"><I>v.</I> 42, 47</A>.

 She <I>washed his feet,</I> in token of her ready submission to the 
 meanest office in which she might <I>do him honour.</I> Nay, she washed 
 them with <I>her tears,</I> tears of joy; she was in a transport, to 
 find herself so near her Saviour, whom her soul loved. She <I>kissed 
 his feet,</I> as one unworthy of the kisses of his mouth, which the 
 spouse coveted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:2">Cant. i. 2</A>.

 It was a kiss of adoration as well as affection. <I>She wiped them with
 her hair,</I> as one entirely devoted to his honour. Her eyes shall 
 yield water to wash them, and her hair be a towel to wipe them; and she 
 <I>anointed</I> his feet <I>with the ointment,</I> owning him hereby to 
 be the Messiah, the <I>Anointed.</I> She anointed his feet in token of 
 her consent to God's design in anointing his head with the <I>oil of 
 gladness.</I> Note, All true penitents have a dear love to the Lord 
 Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The offence which the Pharisee took at Christ, for admitting the 
 respect which this poor penitent paid him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>He said within himself</I> (little thinking that Christ knew what he
 thought), <I>This man, if he were a prophet,</I> would then have so 
 much <I>knowledge</I> as to perceive that <I>this woman is a 
 sinner,</I> is a Gentile, is a woman of ill fame, and so much 
 <I>sanctity</I> as <I>therefore</I> not to suffer her to come so near 
 him; for can one of such a character approach a prophet, and his heart 
 not rise at it? See how apt proud and narrow souls are to think that 
 others should be as haughty and censorious as themselves. Simon, if she 
 had touched him, would have said, <I>Stand by thyself, come not near 
 me, for I am holier than thou</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:5">Isa. lxv. 5</A>);

 and he thought Christ should say so too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ's justification of the woman in what she did to him, and of 
 himself in admitting it. Christ knew what the Pharisee spoke <I>within 
 himself,</I> and made answer to it: <I>Simon, I have something to say 
 unto thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 Though he was kindly entertained at his table, yet even there he 
 reproved him for what he saw amiss in him, and would not <I>suffer sin 
 upon him.</I> Those whom Christ hath <I>something against</I> he hath 
 something to <I>say to,</I> for his <I>Spirit</I> shall <I>reprove.</I> 
 Simon is willing to give him the hearing: <I>He saith, Master, say 
 on.</I> Though he could not believe him to be a prophet (because he was 
 not so nice and precise as he was), yet he can compliment him with the 
 title of <I>Master,</I> among those that cry <I>Lord, Lord,</I> but 
 <I>do not the things which he saith.</I> Now Christ, in his answer to 
 the Pharisee, reasons thus:--It is true this woman has been a sinner:
 he knows it; but she is a <I>pardoned</I> sinner, which supposes her to 
 be a <I>penitent</I> sinner. What she did to him was an expression of 
 her <I>great love</I> to her Saviour, by whom her sins were forgiven. 
 If she was pardoned, who had been <I>so great a sinner,</I> it might 
 reasonably be expected that she should love her Saviour more than 
 others, and should give greater proofs of it than others; and if this 
 was the fruit of her love, and flowing from a sense of the pardon of 
 her sin, it became him to accept of it, and it ill became the Pharisee 
 to be offended at it. Now Christ has a further intention in this. The 
 Pharisee doubted whether he was a <I>prophet</I> or no, nay, he did in 
 effect deny it; but Christ shows that he was more than a prophet, for 
 he is one that has <I>power on earth to forgive sins,</I> and to whom 
 are due the affections and thankful acknowledgments of penitent 
 pardoned sinners. Now, in his answer,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He by a parable forces Simon to acknowledge that the greater sinner 
 this woman had been the greater love she ought to show to Jesus Christ 
 when her <I>sins</I> were <I>pardoned,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:41-43"><I>v.</I> 41-43</A>.

 A man had <I>two debtors</I> that were both insolvent, but one of them 
 owed him <I>ten times</I> more than the other. He very freely 
 <I>forgave them both,</I> and did not take the advantage of the law 
 against them, did not order them and their children to be sold, or 
 <I>deliver them to the tormentors.</I> Now they were both sensible of 
 the great kindness they had received; but <I>which of them will love 
 him most?</I> Certainly, saith the Pharisee, he to <I>whom he forgave 
 most;</I> and herein he rightly judged. Now we, being obliged to 
 <I>forgive,</I> as we are and hope to be <I>forgiven,</I> may hence 
 learn the duty between debtor and creditor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>debtor,</I> if he have <I>any thing to pay,</I> ought to 
 make satisfaction to his <I>creditor.</I> No man can reckon any thing 
 <I>his own</I> or have any comfortable enjoyment of it, but that which 
 is so when <I>all his debts are paid.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) If God in his providence have disabled the debtor to pay his debt, 
 the creditor ought not to be severe with him, nor to go to the utmost 
 rigour of the law with him, but <I>freely to forgive him. Summum jus 
 est summa injuria--The law stretched into rigour becomes unjust.</I> Let
 the unmerciful creditor read that parable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:23">Matt. xviii. 23</A>,

 &c., and tremble; for <I>they</I> shall have judgment without mercy
 that show no mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The debtor that has found his creditors merciful ought to be very 
 grateful to them; and, if he cannot otherwise recompense them, ought to 
 love them. Some insolvent debtors, instead of being <I>grateful,</I> 
 are <I>spiteful,</I> to their creditors that lose by them, and cannot 
 give them a good word, only because they complain, whereas losers may 
 have leave to speak. But this parable speaks of God as the Creator (or 
 rather of the Lord Jesus himself, for he it is that forgives, and is 
 beloved by, the debtor) and sinners are the debtors: and so we may 
 learn here, 

 [1.] That <I>sin is a debt,</I> and <I>sinners are debtors</I> to God 
 Almighty. As creatures, we owe a debt, a debt of obedience to the 
 precept of the law, and, for non-payment of that, as sinners, we become 
 liable to the penalty. We have not paid our rent; nay, we have wasted 
 our Lord's goods, and so we become debtors. God has an action against 
 us for the injury we have done him, and the omission of our duty to 
 him.

 [2.] That some are deeper in debt to God, by reason of sin, than others 
 are: <I>One owed five hundred pence and the other fifty.</I> The 
 Pharisee was the less debtor, yet he a debtor too, which was more than 
 he thought himself, but rather that God was his debtor,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:10,11">Luke xviii. 10, 11</A>.

 This woman, that had been a scandalous notorious sinner, was the
 <I>greater debtor.</I> Some sinners are in themselves greater debtors 
 than others, and some sinners, by reason of divers aggravating 
 circumstances, greater debtors; as those that have sinned most openly 
 and scandalously, that have sinned against greater light and knowledge, 
 more convictions and warnings, and more mercies and means.

 [3.] That, whether our debt be more or less, it is <I>more</I> than we 
 are able to pay: <I>They had nothing to pay,</I> nothing at all to make 
 a composition with; for the debt is great, and we have nothing at all 
 to pay it with. Silver and gold will not pay our debt, nor will 
 sacrifice and offering, no, not <I>thousands of rams.</I> No 
 righteousness of our own will pay it, no, not our repentance and 
 obedience for the future; for it is what we are already bound to, and 
 it is God that works it within us.

 [4.] That the God of heaven is <I>ready</I> to forgive, <I>frankly</I> 
 to <I>forgive,</I> poor sinners, upon gospel terms, though their debt 
 be ever so great. If we repent, and believe in Christ, our iniquity 
 shall not be our ruin, it shall not be laid to our charge. God has 
 proclaimed his name gracious and merciful, and ready to forgive sin; 
 and, his Son having purchased pardon for penitent believers, his gospel 
 promises it to them, and his Spirit seals it and gives them the comfort 
 of it.

 [5.] That those who have their sins <I>pardoned</I> are obliged to
 <I>love him</I> that pardoned them; and the more is forgiven them, the 
 more they should love him. The <I>greater sinners</I> any have been 
 before their conversion, the <I>greater saints</I> they should be 
 after, the more they should study to do for God, and the more their 
 hearts should be enlarged in obedience. When a <I>persecuting Saul</I>
 became a preaching Paul he <I>laboured more abundantly.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He applies this parable to the different temper and conduct of the 
 Pharisee and the sinner towards Christ. Though the Pharisee would not 
 allow Christ to be a prophet, Christ seems ready to allow him to be in 
 a justified state, and that he was one <I>forgiven,</I> though to him 
 <I>less was forgiven.</I> He did indeed show some love to Christ, in 
 inviting him to his house, but nothing to what this poor woman showed. 
 "Observe," saith Christ to him, "she is one that has much forgiven her, 
 and therefore, according to thine own judgment, it might be expected 
 that she should love much more than thou dost, and so it appears. 
 <I>Seest thou this woman?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 Thou lookest upon her with contempt, but consider how much kinder a 
 friend she is to me than thou art; should I then accept thy kindness, 
 and refuse hers?"

 (1.) "Thou didst not so much as order a basin of water to be brought, 
 to wash my feet in, when I came in, wearied and dirtied with my walk, 
 which would have been some refreshment to me; but she has done much 
 more: <I>she has washed my feet with tears,</I> tears of affection to 
 me, tears of affliction for sin, and has <I>wiped them with the hairs 
 of her head,</I> in token of her great love to me." 

 (2.) "Thou didst not so much as kiss my cheek" (which was a usual
 expression of a hearty and affectionate welcome to a friend); "but 
 <I>this woman has not ceased to kiss my feet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>),

 thereby expressing both a humble and an affectionate love." 

 (3.) "Thou didst not provide me a little common oil, as usual, to 
 anoint my head with; but she has bestowed a box of precious 
 <I>ointment</I> upon <I>my feet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>),

 so far has she outdone thee." The reason why some people blame the 
 pains and expense of zealous Christians, in religion, is because they 
 are not willing themselves to come up to it, but resolve to rest in a 
 <I>cheap</I> and <I>easy</I> religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He silenced the Pharisee's cavil: <I>I say unto thee,</I> Simon, 
 <I>her sins, which are many, are forgiven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 He owns that she had been guilty of <I>many sins:</I> "But they are 
 <I>forgiven</I> her, and therefore it is no way unbecoming in me to 
 accept her kindness. They <I>are forgiven, for she loved much.</I>" It
 should be rendered, <I>therefore she loved much;</I> for it is plain, 
 by the tenour of Christ's discourse, that the loving much was not the 
 <I>cause,</I> but the <I>effect,</I> of her pardon, and of her 
 comfortable sense of it; for <I>we love God</I> because <I>he first 
 loved us;</I> he did not forgive us because we first loved him. "But 
 <I>to whom little is forgiven,</I> as is to thee, <I>the same loveth 
 little,</I> as thou dost." Hereby he intimates to the Pharisee that his 
 love to Christ was so little that he had reason to question whether he 
 loved him at all in sincerity; and, consequently, whether indeed his 
 sin, though comparatively <I>little,</I> were forgiven him. Instead of
 grudging greater sinners the mercy they find with Christ, upon their 
 repentance, we should be stirred up by their example to examine 
 ourselves whether we be indeed forgiven, and do love Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He silenced her fears, who probably was discouraged by the 
 Pharisee's conduct, and yet would not so far yield to the 
 discouragement as to fly off. 

 (1.) Christ said unto her, <I>Thy sins are forgiven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.

 Note, The more we express our sorrow for sin, and our love to Christ, 
 the clearer evidence we have of the forgiveness of our sins; for it is 
 by the experience of a <I>work of grace</I> wrought <I>in us</I> that 
 we obtain the assurance of an <I>act of grace</I> wrought <I>for 
 us.</I> How well was she paid for her pains and cost, when she was 
 dismissed with this word from Christ, <I>Thy sins are forgiven!</I> and 
 what an effectual prevention would this be of her return to sin again! 
 
 (2.) Though there were those present who quarrelled with Christ, in 
 their own minds, for presuming to forgive sin, and to pronounce sinners 
 absolved 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>),
 
 as those had done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:3">Matt. ix. 3</A>),

 yet he <I>stood to what he had said;</I> for as he had there proved 
 that he had <I>power to forgive sin,</I> by curing the man sick of the 
 palsy, and therefore would not here take notice of the cavil, so he 
 would now show that he had <I>pleasure in forgiving sin,</I> and it was 
 his delight; he loves to speak pardon and peace to penitents: <I>He 
 said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>.

 This would confirm and double her comfort in the forgiveness of her 
 sin, that she was <I>justified by her faith.</I> All these expressions 
 of sorrow for sin, and love to Christ, were the effects and products of 
 faith; and therefore, as faith of all graces doth most honour God, so 
 Christ doth of all graces put most honour upon faith. Note, They who 
 know that their faith hath saved them may go in peace, may go on their 
 way rejoicing.</P>
