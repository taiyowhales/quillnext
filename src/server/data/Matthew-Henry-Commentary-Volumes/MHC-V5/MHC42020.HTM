 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, <I>that</I> on one of those days, as he
 taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the
 chief priests and the scribes came upon <I>him</I> with the elders,
 &nbsp; 2 And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest
 thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?
 &nbsp; 3 And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one
 thing; and answer me:
 &nbsp; 4 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?
 &nbsp; 5 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
 From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?
 &nbsp; 6 But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for
 they be persuaded that John was a prophet.
 &nbsp; 7 And they answered, that they could not tell whence <I>it was.</I>
 &nbsp; 8 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what
 authority I do these things.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this passage of story nothing is added here to what we had in the 
 other evangelists; but only in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:1">first verse</A>,

 where we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That he was now <I>teaching the people in the temple,</I> and 
 <I>preaching the gospel.</I> Note, Christ was a preacher of his own 
 gospel. He not only <I>purchased</I> the salvation for us, but 
 <I>published</I> it to us, which is a great confirmation of the truth 
 of the gospel, and gives abundant encouragement to us to receive it, 
 for it is a sign that the heart of Christ was much upon it, to have it 
 received. This likewise puts an honour upon the preachers of the 
 gospel, and upon their office and work, how much soever they are 
 despised by a vain world. It puts an honour upon the <I>popular 
 preachers</I> of the gospel; Christ condescended to the capacities of 
 the <I>people</I> in preaching the gospel, and <I>taught them.</I> And 
 observe, when he was <I>preaching the gospel to the people</I> he had 
 this interruption given him. Note, Satan and his agents do all they can 
 to hinder the <I>preaching of the gospel to the people,</I> for nothing 
 weakens the interest of Satan's kingdom more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That his enemies are here said to <I>come upon 
 him</I>--<B><I>epestesan</I></B>. The word is used only here, and it
 intimates,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they thought to surprise him with this question; they <I>came 
 upon him</I> suddenly, hoping to catch him unprovided with an answer, 
 as if this were not a thing he had himself thought of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they thought to frighten him with this question. They <I>came 
 upon him</I> in a body, with violence. But how could he be terrified 
 with the <I>wrath of men,</I> when it was in his <I>own power to 
 restrain it,</I> and make it turn to his praise? From this story
 itself we may learn, 

 (1.) That it is not to be thought strange, if even that which is 
 evident to a demonstration be disputed, and called in question, as a 
 doubtful thing, by those that shut their eyes against the light. 
 Christ's miracles plainly showed <I>by what authority he did these 
 things,</I> and sealed his commission; and yet this is that which is 
 here <I>arraigned.</I> 

 (2.) Those that question Christ's authority, if they be but catechized 
 themselves in the plainest and most evident principles of religion, 
 will have their folly made manifest unto all men. Christ answered these 
 priests and scribes with a question concerning the baptism of John, a 
 plain question, which the meanest of the common people could answer: 
 <I>Was it from heaven or of men?</I> They all knew it was <I>from 
 heaven;</I> there was nothing in it that had an earthly relish or 
 tendency, but it was all heavenly and divine. And this question
 gravelled them, and ran them aground, and served to shame them before 
 the people. 

 (3.) It is not strange if those that are governed by reputation and 
 secular interest imprison the plainest truths, and smother and stifle 
 the strongest convictions, as these priests and scribes did, who, to 
 save their credit, would not own that John's baptism was <I>from 
 heaven,</I> and had no other reason why they did not say it was <I>of 
 men</I> but because they <I>feared the people.</I> What good can be 
 expected from men of such a spirit? 

 (4.) Those that bury the knowledge they have are justly denied further 
 knowledge. It was just with Christ to refuse to give an account of his 
 authority to them that knew the baptism of John to be from heaven and 
 would not believe in him, nor own their knowledge,

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain
 man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went
 into a far country for a long time.
 &nbsp; 10 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that
 they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the
 husbandmen beat him, and sent <I>him</I> away empty.
 &nbsp; 11 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also,
 and entreated <I>him</I> shamefully, and sent <I>him</I> away empty.
 &nbsp; 12 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and
 cast <I>him</I> out.
 &nbsp; 13 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will
 send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence <I>him</I> when
 they see him.
 &nbsp; 14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among
 themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that
 the inheritance may be ours.
 &nbsp; 15 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed <I>him.</I> What
 therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?
 &nbsp; 16 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give
 the vineyard to others. And when they heard <I>it,</I> they said, God
 forbid.
 &nbsp; 17 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is
 written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is
 become the head of the corner?
 &nbsp; 18 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on
 whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
 &nbsp; 19 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought
 to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they
 perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ spoke this parable against those who were resolved not to own 
 his authority, though the evidence of it was ever so full and 
 convincing; and it comes very seasonably to show that by questioning 
 his authority they forfeited their own. Their disowning the lord of 
 their vineyard was a defeasance of their lease of the vineyard, and 
 giving up of all their title.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The parable has nothing added here to what we had before in Matthew 
 and Mark. The scope of it is to show that the Jewish nation, by 
 persecuting the prophets, and at length Christ himself, had provoked 
 God to take away from them all their church privileges, and to abandon 
 them to ruin. It teaches us, 

 1. That those who enjoy the privileges of the visible church are as
 tenants and farmers that have a vineyard to look after, and rent to pay 
 for it. God, by setting up revealed religion and instituted orders in 
 the world, hath planted a vineyard, which he lets out to those people 
 among whom his tabernacle is,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 And they have <I>vineyard-work</I> to do, needful and constant work, 
 but pleasant and profitable. Whereas man was, for sin, condemned to 
 <I>till the ground,</I> they that have a place in the church are 
 restored to that which was Adam's work in innocency, to <I>dress the 
 garden,</I> and to keep it; for the church is a paradise, and Christ 
 the tree of life in it. They have also <I>vineyard-fruits</I> to 
 present to the Lord of the vineyard. There are rents to be paid and 
 services to be done, which, though bearing no proportion to the value 
 of the premises, yet must be <I>done</I> and must be <I>paid.</I> 

 2. That the work of God's ministers is to call upon those who enjoy
 the privileges of the church to <I>bring forth fruit</I> accordingly. 
 They are God's rent-gatherers, to put the husbandmen in mind of their 
 arrears, or rather to put them in mind that they have a landlord who 
 expects to hear from them, and to receive some acknowledgment of their 
 dependence on him, and obligations to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The Old-Testament prophets were sent on this errand to the Jewish 
 church, to demand from them the duty and obedience they owed to God. 

 3. That it has often been the lot of God's faithful servants to be
 wretchedly abused by his own tenants; they have been <I>beaten</I> and 
 <I>treated</I> shamefully by those that resolved to <I>send them 
 empty</I> away. They that are resolved not to do their duty to God 
 cannot bear to be called upon to do it. Some of the best men in the 
 world have had the hardest usage from it, for their best services. 

 4. That God sent his Son into the world to carry on the same work that
 the prophets were employed in, to <I>gather the fruits of the 
 vineyard</I> for God; and one would have thought that he would have 
 been reverenced and received. The prophets spoke as <I>servants, Thus 
 saith the Lord;</I> but Christ <I>as a Son,</I> among his own, 
 <I>Verily, I say unto you.</I> Putting such an honour as this upon 
 them, to send him, one would have thought, should have won upon them. 
 
 5. That those who reject Christ's ministers would reject Christ himself
 if he should come to them; for it has been tried, and found that the 
 persecutors and murderers of his servants the prophets were the 
 persecutors and murderers of himself. They said, <I>This is the heir, 
 come let us kill him.</I> When they slew the servants, there were other 
 servants sent. "But, if we can but be the death of the son, there is
 never another son to be sent, and then we shall be no longer molested 
 with these demands; we may have a quiet possession of the vineyard for 
 ourselves." The scribes and Pharisees promised themselves that, if they 
 could but get Christ out of the way, they should for ever ride masters 
 in the Jewish church; and therefore they took the bold step, they 
 <I>cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</I> 

 6. That the putting of Christ to death filled up the measure of the
 Jewish iniquity, and brought upon them ruin without remedy. No other 
 could be expected than that God should <I>destroy those wicked 
 husbandmen.</I> They began in <I>not paying their rent,</I> but then 
 proceeded to beat and kill the servants, and at length their young 
 Master himself. Note, Those that live in the neglect of their duty to 
 God know not what degrees of sin and destruction they are running 
 themselves into.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To the application of the parable is added here, which we had not 
 before, their deprecation of the doom included in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>When they heart it, they said, God forbid,</I> <B><I>Me 
 genoito</I></B>--<I>Let not this be done,</I> so it should be read.
 Though they could not but own that for such a sin such a punishment was 
 just, and what might be expected, yet they could not bear to hear of 
 it. Note, It is an instance of the folly and stupidity of sinners that 
 they proceed and persevere in their sinful ways though at the same time 
 they have a foresight and dread of the destruction that is at the end 
 of those ways. And see what a cheat they put themselves, to think to 
 avoid it by a cold <I>God forbid,</I> when they do nothing towards the 
 preventing of it; but will this make the threatening of no effect? No, 
 they shall know whose word shall stand, God's or theirs. Now observe 
 what Christ said, in answer to this childish deprecation of their ruin.
 
 1. He <I>beheld them.</I> This is taken notice of only by this
 evangelist, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He <I>looked upon</I> them with pity and compassion, grieved to see 
 them cheat themselves thus to their own ruin. He <I>beheld them,</I> to 
 see if they would blush at their own folly, or if he could discern in 
 their countenances any indication of relenting.

 2. He referred them to the scripture: "<I>What is this then that is
 written?</I> How can you escape the judgment of God, when you cannot 
 prevent the exaltation of him whom you despise and reject? The word of
 God hath said it, that <I>the stone which the builders rejected is 
 become the head of the corner.</I>" The Lord Jesus will be exalted to 
 the Father's right hand. He has all judgment and all power committed
 to him; he is the corner-stone and top-stone of the church, and, if so, 
 his enemies can expect no other than to be destroyed. Even those that 
 slight him, that stumble at him, and are offended in him, <I>shall be 
 broken</I>--it will be their ruin; but as to those that not only reject 
 him, but hate and persecute him, as the Jews did, he will fall upon 
 them and crush them to pieces--will <I>grind them to powder.</I> The 
 condemnation of spiteful persecutors will be much sorer than that of 
 careless unbelievers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> We are told how the chief priests and scribes were 
 exasperated by this parable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>They perceived that he had spoken this parable against them;</I> and 
 so he had. A guilty conscience needs no accuser; but they, instead of 
 yielding to the convictions of conscience, fell into a rage at him who 
 awakened that sleeping lion in their bosoms, and <I>sought to lay hands 
 on him.</I> Their corruptions rebelled against their convictions, and 
 got the victory. And it was not because they had any fear of God or of 
 his wrath before their eyes, but only because they <I>feared the 
 people,</I> that they did not now fly in his face, and take him by the 
 throat. They were just ready to make his words good: <I>This is the 
 heir, come let us kill him.</I> Note, When the hearts of the sons of 
 men are fully set in them to do evil, the fairest warnings both of the 
 sin they are about to commit and of the consequences of it make no 
 impression upon them. Christ tells them that instead of <I>kissing the 
 Son</I> of God they would <I>kill him,</I> upon which they should have 
 said, <I>What, is thy servant a dog?</I> But they do, in effect, say 
 this: "And so we will; have at him now." And, though they deprecate the 
 punishment of the sin, in the next breath they are projecting the 
 commission of it.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  And they watched <I>him,</I> and sent forth spies, which should
 feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his
 words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and
 authority of the governor.
 &nbsp; 21 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest
 and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person <I>of any,</I>
 but teachest the way of God truly:
 &nbsp; 22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto C&aelig;sar, or no?
 &nbsp; 23 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why
 tempt ye me?
 &nbsp; 24 Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it?
 They answered and said, C&aelig;sar's.
 &nbsp; 25 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto C&aelig;sar the
 things which be C&aelig;sar's, and unto God the things which be God's.
 &nbsp; 26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people:
 and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's evading a snare which his enemies laid for him, 
 by proposing a question to him about tribute. We had this passage 
 before, both in Matthew and Mark. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The mischief designed him, and that is more fully related here than 
 before. The plot was to <I>deliver him unto the power and authority of 
 the governor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 They could not themselves put him to death by course of law, nor 
 otherwise than by a <I>popular tumult,</I> which they could not depend 
 upon; and, since they could not be his judges, they would willingly 
 condescend to be his prosecutors and accusers, and would themselves 
 <I>inform</I> against him. They hoped to gain their point, if they 
 could but incense the governor against him. Note, It has been the 
 common artifice of persecuting church-rulers to make the secular powers 
 the tools of their malice, and oblige the <I>kings of the earth to 
 do</I> their drudgery, who, if they had not been instigated, would have 
 let their neighbours live quietly by them, as Pilate did Christ till 
 the chief priests and the scribes presented Christ to him. But thus 
 Christ's word must be fulfilled by their cursed politics, that he 
 should be <I>delivered into the hands of the Gentiles.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The persons they employed. Matthew and Mark told us that they were 
 disciples of the Pharisees, with some Herodians. Here it is added, They 
 were <I>spies, who should feign themselves just men.</I> Note, It is no 
 new thing for <I>bad men</I> to feign themselves <I>just men,</I> and 
 to cover the most wicked projects with the most specious and plausible 
 pretences. The devil can <I>transform himself into an angel of 
 light,</I> and a Pharisee appear in the garb, and speak the language, 
 of a disciple of Christ. A spy must go in disguise. These spies must 
 take on them to have a value for Christ's judgment, and to depend upon 
 it as an oracle, and therefore must desire his advice in a case of 
 conscience. Note, Ministers are concerned to stand upon their guard 
 against some that feign themselves to be <I>just men,</I> and to be 
 <I>wise as serpents</I> when they are in the midst of a <I>generation 
 of vipers</I> and <I>scorpions.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The question they proposed, with which they hoped to ensnare him.
 
 1. Their preface is very courtly: <I>Master, we know that thou sayest
 and teachest rightly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Thus they thought to flatter him into an incautious freedom and 
 openness with them, and so to gain their point. They that are proud, 
 and love to be commended, will be brought to do any thing for those 
 that will but flatter them, and speak kindly to them; but they were 
 much mistaken who thought thus to impose upon the humble Jesus. He was
 not pleased with the testimony of such hypocrites, nor thought himself 
 honoured by it. It is true that he <I>accepts not the person of 
 any,</I> but it is as true that he knows the hearts of all, and knew 
 theirs, and the <I>seven abominations</I> that were there, though they 
 <I>spoke fair.</I> It was certain that he <I>taught the way of God 
 truly;</I> but he knew that they were unworthy to be taught by him, who 
 came to <I>take hold of his words,</I> not to be <I>taken hold of</I> 
 by them. 

 2. Their case is very nice: "Is it lawful <I>for us</I>" (this is added
 here in Luke) "<I>to give tribute to C&aelig;sar</I>--for us Jews, us 
 the free-born seed of Abraham, us that pay the Lord's tribute, may give 
 tribute to C&aelig;sar?" Their pride and covetousness made them loth to 
 pay taxes, and then they would have it a question whether it was lawful 
 or no. Now if Christ should say that <I>it was lawful</I> the people 
 would take it ill, for they expected that he who set up to be the 
 Messiah should in the first place free them from the Roman yoke, and 
 stand by them in denying tribute to C&aelig;sar. But if he should say 
 that <I>it was not lawful,</I> as they expected he would (for if he had 
 not been of that mind they thought he could not have been so much the 
 darling of the people as he was), then they should have something to 
 accuse him of to the governor, which was what they wanted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His evading the snare which they laid for him: <I>He perceived
 their craftiness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Note, Those that are most crafty in their designs against Christ and 
 his gospel cannot with all their art conceal them from his cognizance. 
 He can see through the most politic disguises, and so break through the 
 most dangerous snare; for <I>surely in vain is the net spread in the 
 sight of any bird.</I> He did not give them a direct answer, but 
 reproved them for offering to impose upon him--<I>Why tempt ye me?</I> 
 and called for a <I>piece of money,</I> current money with the 
 merchants--<I>Show me a penny;</I> and asked them whose money it was, 
 whose stamp it bore, who coined it. They owned, "It is C&aelig;sar's 
 money." "Why them," saith Christ, "you should first have asked whether 
 it was lawful to <I>pay</I> and <I>receive</I> C&aelig;sar's money 
 among yourselves, and to admit that to be the instrument of your 
 commerce. But, having granted this by a common consent, you are 
 concluded by your own act, and, no doubt, you ought to give tribute to 
 him who furnished you with this convenience for your trade, protects 
 you in it, and lends you the sanction of his authority for the value of 
 your money. You must therefore <I>render to C&aelig;sar the things that 
 are C&aelig;sar's.</I> In civil things you ought to submit to the civil 
 powers, and so, if C&aelig;sar protects you in your civil rights by 
 laws and the administration of justice, you ought to <I>pay him 
 tribute;</I> but in sacred things God only is your King. You are not 
 bound to be of C&aelig;sar's religion; you must <I>render to God the 
 things that are God's,</I> must worship and adore him only, and not any 
 golden image that C&aelig;sar sets up;" and we must worship and adore 
 him in such way as he had appointed, and not according to the 
 inventions of C&aelig;sar. It is God only that has authority to say 
 <I>My son, give me thy heart.</I></P>

 1. The snare is broken; <I>They could not take hold of his words before 
 the people.</I> They could not fasten upon any thing wherewith to 
 incense either the governor or the people against him. 

 2. Christ is honoured; even the wrath of man is made to praise him.
 They <I>marvelled at his answer,</I> it was so discreet and 
 unexceptionable, and such an evidence of that wisdom and sincerity 
 which make the face to shine. 

 3. Their mouths are stopped; they <I>held their peace.</I> They had
 nothing to object, and durst ask him nothing else, lest he should shame 
 and expose them.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  Then came to <I>him</I> certain of the Sadducees, which deny that
 there is any resurrection; and they asked him,
 &nbsp; 28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother
 die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother
 should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
 &nbsp; 29 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a
 wife, and died without children.
 &nbsp; 30 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
 &nbsp; 31 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also:
 and they left no children, and died.
 &nbsp; 32 Last of all the woman died also.
 &nbsp; 33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for
 seven had her to wife.
 &nbsp; 34 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this
 world marry, and are given in marriage:
 &nbsp; 35 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that
 world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are
 given in marriage:
 &nbsp; 36 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the
 angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the
 resurrection.
 &nbsp; 37 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush,
 when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of
 Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
 &nbsp; 38 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all
 live unto him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This discourse with the Sadducees we had before, just as it is here, 
 only that the description Christ gives of the future state is somewhat 
 more full and large here. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In every age there have been men of corrupt minds, that have 
 endeavoured to subvert the fundamental principles of revealed religion. 
 As there are deists now, who call themselves <I>free</I>-thinkers, but 
 are really <I>false</I>-thinkers; so there were Sadducees in our 
 Saviour's time, who bantered the doctrine of the resurrection of the 
 dead and the life of the world to come, though they were plainly 
 revealed in the Old Testament, and were articles of the Jewish faith. 
 The Sadducees deny that <I>there is any resurrection,</I> any <I>future 
 state,</I> so <B><I>anastasis</I></B> may signify; not only no return 
 of the body <I>to life,</I> but no continuance of the soul <I>in 
 life,</I> no world of spirits, no state of recompence and retribution 
 for what was done in the body. Take away this, and all religion falls 
 to the ground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is common for those that design to undermine any truth of God to 
 perplex it, and load it with difficulties. So these Sadducees did; when 
 they would weaken people's faith in the doctrine of the resurrection, 
 they put a question upon the supposition of it, which they thought 
 could not be answered either way to satisfaction. The case perhaps was 
 matter of fact, at least it might be so, of a woman that had <I>seven 
 husbands.</I> Now in the resurrection <I>whose wife shall she be?</I> 
 whereas it was not at all material whose she was, for when death puts 
 an end to that relation it is not to be resumed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. There is a great deal of difference between the state of the 
 children of men on earth and that of the children of God in heaven, a 
 vast unlikeness between <I>this world</I> and <I>that world;</I> and we 
 wrong ourselves, and wrong the truth of Christ, when we form our 
 notions of that world of spirits by our present enjoyments in this 
 world of sense.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The children of men in this world <I>marry, and are given in 
 marriage,</I> <B><I>hyioi tou aionos toutou</I></B>--<I>the children of
 this age,</I> this generation, both good and bad, marry themselves and 
 give their children in marriage. Much of our business in this world is 
 to raise and build up families, and to provide for them. Much of our 
 pleasure in this world is in our relations, our wives and children; 
 nature inclines to it. Marriage is instituted for the comfort of human 
 life, here in this state where we carry bodies about with us. It is 
 likewise a remedy against fornication, that natural desires might not 
 become brutal, but be under direction and control. The <I>children of 
 this</I> world are dying and going off the stage, and <I>therefore</I> 
 they marry and give their children in marriage, that they may furnish 
 the world of mankind with needful recruits, that as one generation 
 passeth away another may come, and that they may have some of their own 
 offspring to leave the fruit of their labours to, especially that the 
 chosen of God in future ages may be introduced, for it is a <I>godly 
 seed</I> that is sought by <I>marriage</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:15">Mal. ii. 15</A>),

 a seed to serve the Lord, that shall be a <I>generation to him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The world to come is quite another thing; it is called <I>that 
 world,</I> by way of emphasis and eminency. Note, There are more worlds 
 than one; a present visible world, and a future invisible world; and it 
 is the concern of every one of us to compare worlds, <I>this world</I> 
 and <I>that world,</I> and give the preference in our thoughts and 
 cares to that which deserves them. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Who shall be the inhabitants of <I>that world:</I> They that shall 
 be <I>accounted worthy to obtain it,</I> that is, that are interested 
 in <I>Christ's merit,</I> who <I>purchased it for us,</I> and have a 
 holy <I>meetness</I> for it wrought in them by the Spirit, whose 
 business it is to prepare us for it. They have not a <I>legal</I> 
 worthiness, upon account of any thing in them or done by them, but an 
 <I>evangelical</I> worthiness, upon account of the inestimable price 
 which Christ paid for the <I>redemption of the purchased 
 possession.</I> It is a worthiness imputed by which we are glorified, 
 as well as righteousness imputed by which we are justified; 
 <B><I>kataxiothentes</I></B>, they are <I>made agreeable to that 
 world.</I> The disagreeableness that there is in the corrupt nature is 
 taken away, and the dispositions of the soul are by the grace of God 
 conformed to that state. They are by grace made and <I>counted worthy 
 to obtain that world;</I> it intimates some <I>difficulty</I> in 
 reaching after it, and danger of coming short. We must <I>so run</I> as 
 that we may obtain. They shall obtain the <I>resurrection from the 
 dead,</I> that is, the blessed resurrection; for that of 
 <I>condemnation</I> (as Christ calls it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:29">John v. 29</A>),

 is rather a resurrection <I>to death,</I> a second death, an eternal 
 death, than <I>from death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What shall be the happy state of the inhabitants of that world we
 cannot express or conceive, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:9">1 Cor. ii. 9</A>.
 
 See what Christ here says of it.

 [1.] They <I>neither marry nor are given in marriage.</I> Those that
 have entered into the joy of their Lord are entirely taken up with 
 that, and need not the joy of the bridegroom in his bride. The love in 
 that world of love is all seraphic, and such as eclipses and loses the 
 purest and most pleasing loves we entertain ourselves with in this 
 world of sense. Where the body itself shall be a spiritual body, the
 delights of sense will all be banished; and where there is a perfection 
 of holiness there is no occasion for marriage as a preservative from 
 sin. Into the <I>new Jerusalem</I> there enters nothing that defiles. 
 
 [2.] They cannot <I>die any more;</I> and this comes in as a reason why 
 they do not <I>marry.</I> In this dying world there must be marriage, 
 in order to the filling up of the vacancies made by death; but, where 
 there are no burials, there is no need of weddings. This crowns the 
 comfort of that world that there is no more death there, which sullies 
 all the beauty, and damps all the comforts, of this world. Here death 
 reigns, but thence it is for ever excluded. 

 [3.] They are <I>equal unto the angels.</I> In the other evangelists it 
 was said, They are <I>as the angels</I>--<B><I>os angeloi</I></B>, but 
 here they are said to be <I>equal to the angels,</I> 
 <B><I>isangeloi</I></B>--<I>angels' peers;</I> they have a glory and 
 bliss no way inferior to that of the holy angels. They shall see the 
 same sight, be employed in the same work, and share in the same joys, 
 with the holy angels. Saints, when they come to heaven, shall be 
 <I>naturalized,</I> and, though by nature strangers, yet, having 
 <I>obtained this freedom</I> with a <I>great sum,</I> which Christ paid 
 for them, they have in all respects equal privileges with them that 
 were free-born, the angels that are the natives and aborigines of that 
 country. They shall be companions with the angels, and converse with
 those blessed spirits that love them dearly, and with an innumerable 
 company, to whom they are now come in faith, hope, and love.

 [4.] They <I>are the children of God,</I> and so they are as the 
 angels, who are called the <I>sons of God.</I> In the <I>inheritance of 
 sons,</I> the <I>adoption of sons</I> will be completed. Hence 
 believers are said to <I>wait for the adoption,</I> even <I>the 
 redemption of the body,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:23">Rom. viii. 23</A>.

 For till the body is redeemed from the grave the adoption is not
 completed. <I>Now are we the sons of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:2">1 John iii. 2</A>.

 We have the nature and disposition of sons, but that will not be
 <I>perfected</I> till we come to heaven.

 [5.] They are the <I>children of the resurrection,</I> that is, they 
 are made capable of the employments and enjoyments of the future state; 
 they are <I>born to that world,</I> belong to that family, had their 
 education for it here, and shall there have their inheritance in it. 
 They are the <I>children of God,</I> being the <I>children of the 
 resurrection.</I> Note, God owns those only for his children that are 
 the children of the resurrection, that are born from above, are allied 
 to the world of spirits, and prepared for that world, the children of 
 that family.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. It is an undoubted truth that there is another life after this, and 
 there were eminent discoveries made of this truth in the early ages of 
 the church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>):

 <I>Moses showed this, as it was shown to Moses at the bush,</I> and he 
 hath shown it to us, when <I>he calleth the Lord,</I> as the Lord 
 calleth himself, the <I>God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the 
 God of Jacob. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</I> were then <I>dead</I> as 
 to our world; they had departed out of it many years before, and their 
 bodies were turned into dust in the cave of Machpelah; how then could 
 God say, not <I>I was,</I> but <I>I am</I> the <I>God or Abraham?</I> 
 It is absurd that the living God and Fountain of life should continue 
 related to them as their God, if there were no more of them in being 
 than what lay in that cave, undistinguished from common dust. We must 
 therefore conclude that they were then in being in another world; for 
 <I>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</I> Luke here 
 adds, <I>For all live unto him,</I> that is, all who, like them, are 
 true believers; though they are dead, yet they <I>do live;</I> their 
 souls, which <I>return to God who gave them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:7">Eccl. xii. 7</A>),

 live to him as the Father of spirits: and their bodies shall live again 
 at the end of time by the power of God; for he calleth things that are 
 not as though they were, because he is the God that <I>quickens the 
 dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:17">Rom. iv. 17</A>.

 But there is more in it yet; when God called himself <I>the God</I> of
 these patriarchs, he meant that he was their felicity and portion, a 
 <I>God all-sufficient to them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1">Gen. xvii. 1</A>),
 
 their <I>exceeding great reward,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:1">Gen. xv. 1</A>.

 Now it is plain by their history that he never did that for them in 
 this world which would answer the <I>true intent</I> and <I>full 
 extent</I> of that great undertaking, and therefore there must be 
 another life after this, in which he will do that for them that will 
 amount to a <I>discharge in full</I> of that promise--that he would be 
 to them a God, which he is able to do, for <I>all live to him,</I> and 
 he has wherewithal to make every soul happy that lives to him; enough 
 for <I>all,</I> enough for <I>each.</I></P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>39  Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou
 hast well said.
 &nbsp; 40 And after that they durst not ask him any <I>question at all.</I>
 &nbsp; 41 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's
 son?
 &nbsp; 42 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said
 unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
 &nbsp; 43 Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
 &nbsp; 44 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?
 &nbsp; 45 Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his
 disciples,
 &nbsp; 46 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes,
 and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the
 synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;
 &nbsp; 47 Which devour widows' houses, and for a show make long
 prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scribes were <I>students</I> in the law, and <I>expositors</I> of 
 it to the people, men in reputation for wisdom and honour, but the 
 generality of them were enemies to Christ and his gospel. Now here we 
 have some of them attending him, and four things we have in these 
 verses concerning them, which we had before:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have them here commending the reply which Christ made to the 
 Sadducees concerning the resurrection: <I>Certain of the scribes said, 
 Master, thou hast well said,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 Christ had the testimony of his adversaries that he said well; and 
 <I>therefore</I> the scribes were his enemies because he would not 
 <I>conform</I> to the traditions of the elders, but yet when he 
 vindicated the fundamental practices of religion, and appeared in the 
 defence of them, even the scribes commended his performance, and owned 
 that he said well. Many that call themselves Christians come short even 
 of this spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have them here struck with an awe of Christ, and of his wisdom 
 and authority 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 <I>They durst not ask him any questions at all,</I> because they say 
 that he was too hard for all that contended with him. His own 
 disciples, though weak, yet, being willing to receive his doctrine, 
 durst <I>ask him any question;</I> but the Sadducees, who contradicted 
 and cavilled at his doctrine, durst ask him none.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have them here <I>puzzled</I> and run aground with a question 
 concerning the Messiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 It was plain by many scriptures that Christ was to be the <I>Son of 
 David;</I> even the blind man knew this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:39"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 39</A>);

 and yet it was plain that David called the Messiah <I>his Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:42,44"><I>v.</I> 42, 44</A>),

 his owner, and ruler, and benefactor: <I>The Lord said to my Lord.</I> 
 God said it to the Messiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>.

 Now if he be <I>his Son,</I> why doth he call him <I>his Lord?</I> If 
 he be <I>his Lord,</I> why do <I>we</I> call him <I>his Son?</I> This 
 he left them to consider of, but they could not reconcile this seeming 
 contradiction; thanks be to God, we can; that Christ, <I>as God,</I> 
 was David's Lord, but Christ, <I>as man,</I> was David's Son. He was 
 both the <I>root</I> and the <I>offspring of David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:16">Rev. xxii. 16</A>.

 By his <I>human nature</I> he was the <I>offspring of David,</I> a 
 branch of his family; by his <I>divine nature</I> he was the <I>root of 
 David,</I> from whom he had his being and life, and all the supplies of 
 grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We have them here described in their black characters, and a public 
 caution given to the disciples to take heed of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:45-47"><I>v.</I> 45-47</A>.

 This we had, just as it is here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:38">Mark xii. 38</A>,
 
 and more largely 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:1-39">Matt. xxiii</A>.
 
 Christ bids his disciples <I>beware of the scribes,</I> that is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. "Take heed of being drawn <I>into sin</I> by them, of learning their 
 way, and going into their measures; beware of such a spirit as they are 
 governed by. Be not you such in the Christian church as they are in the 
 Jewish church."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. "Take heed of being <I>brought into trouble</I> by them," in the 
 same sense that he had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:17">Matt. x. 17</A>),

 "<I>Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councils;</I> 
 beware of the scribes, for they will do so. Beware of them, for," 

 (1.) "They are <I>proud</I> and <I>haughty.</I> They <I>desire</I> to 
 walk about the streets in <I>long robes,</I> as those that are above 
 business (for men of business went with their <I>loins girt up</I>), 
 and as those that take state, and take place." <I>Cedant arma 
 tog&aelig;--Let arms yield to the gown.</I> They loved in their hearts 
 to have people make their obeisance to them <I>in the markets,</I> that 
 many might see what respect was paid them; and were very proud of the 
 precedency that was given them in all places of concourse. They 
 <I>loved the highest seats in the synagogues</I> and <I>the chief rooms 
 at feasts,</I> and, when they were placed in them, looked upon 
 themselves with great conceit and upon all about them with great 
 contempt. <I>I sit as a queen.</I> 

 (2.) "They are <I>covetous and oppressive,</I> and make their religion 
 a cloak and cover for crime." They <I>devour widows' houses,</I> get 
 their estates into their hands, and then by some trick or other make 
 them their own, or they live upon them, and eat up what they have; and 
 <I>widows</I> are an easy prey to them, because they are apt to be 
 deluded by their specious pretences: <I>for a show they make long 
 prayers,</I> perhaps long prayers with the widows when they are in 
 sorrow, as if they had not only a <I>piteous</I> but a <I>pious</I> 
 concern for them, and thus endeavour to ingratiate themselves with 
 them, and get their money and effects into their hands. Such devout men 
 may surely be trusted with <I>untold gold;</I> but they will give such 
 an account of it as they think fit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ reads them their doom in a few words: <I>These shall receive a 
 more abundant judgment,</I> a double damnation, both for their abuse of 
 the poor <I>widows,</I> whose houses they devoured, and for their abuse
 of religion, and particularly of prayer, which they had made use of as 
 a pretence for the more plausible and effectual carrying on of their 
 worldly and wicked projects; for <I>dissembled piety is double 
 iniquity.</I></P>
