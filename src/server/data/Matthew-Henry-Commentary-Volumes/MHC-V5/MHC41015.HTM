 What we read of the sufferings of Christ, in the foregoing chapter, was 
 but the prologue or introduction; here we have the completing of them. 
 We left him condemned by the chief priests; but they could only show 
 their teeth, they could not bite. Here we have him,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
 consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council,
 and bound Jesus, and carried <I>him</I> away, and delivered <I>him</I> to
 Pilate.
 &nbsp; 2  And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
 answering said unto him, Thou sayest <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 3  And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he
 answered nothing.
 &nbsp; 4  And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
 behold how many things they witness against thee.
 &nbsp; 5  But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
 &nbsp; 6  Now at <I>that</I> feast he released unto them one prisoner,
 whomsoever they desired.
 &nbsp; 7  And there was <I>one</I> named Barabbas, <I>which lay</I> bound with
 them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed
 murder in the insurrection.
 &nbsp; 8  And the multitude crying aloud began to desire <I>him to do</I> as
 he had ever done unto them.
 &nbsp; 9  But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto
 you the King of the Jews?
 &nbsp; 10  For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for
 envy.
 &nbsp; 11  But the chief priests moved the people, that he should
 rather release Barabbas unto them.
 &nbsp; 12  And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye
 then that I shall do <I>unto him</I> whom ye call the King of the
 Jews?
 &nbsp; 13  And they cried out again, Crucify him.
 &nbsp; 14  Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And
 they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. A <I>consultation</I> held by the great Sanhedrim for the effectual 
 prosecution of our Lord Jesus. They met <I>early in the morning</I> 
 about it, and went into a grand committee, to find out <I>ways and 
 means</I> to get him put to death; they lost no time, but followed 
 their blow in good earnest, lest there should be an <I>uproar among the 
 people.</I> The unwearied industry of wicked people in doing that which 
 is evil, should shame us for our backwardness and slothfulness in that 
 which is good. They that <I>war</I> against Christ and thy soul, are up 
 early; <I>How long then wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The delivering of him up a prisoner to Pilate; they <I>bound 
 him.</I> He was to be the great sacrifice, and sacrifices must be bound 
 with cords, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:27">Ps. cxviii. 27</A>.

 Christ was bound, to make bonds easy to us, and enable us, as Paul and
 Silas, to sing in bonds. It is good for us often to <I>remember the 
 bonds</I> of the Lord Jesus, as bound with him who was <I>bound for 
 us.</I> They led him through the streets of Jerusalem, to expose 
 <I>him</I> to contempt, who, while he taught in the temple, but a day 
 or two before, was had in veneration; and we may well imagine how 
 miserably he looked after such a night's usage as he had had; so 
 buffeted, spit upon, and abused. Their delivering him to the Roman 
 power was a type of ruin of their church, which hereby they merited, 
 and brought upon themselves; it signified that the promise, the 
 covenant, and the oracles, of God, and the visible state church, which 
 were the glory of Israel, and had been so long in their possession, 
 should now be delivered up to the Gentiles. By delivering up the
 <I>king</I> they do, in effect, deliver up the <I>kingdom of God,</I> 
 which is therefore, as it were, by their own consent, taken from them, 
 and given to another nation. If they had delivered up Christ, to 
 gratify the desires of the Romans, or to satisfy and jealousies of 
 theirs concerning him, it had been another matter; but they voluntarily 
 betrayed him that was <I>Israel's crown,</I> to them that were 
 <I>Israel's yoke.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The examining of him by Pilate upon interrogatories 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);
 
 "<I>Art thou the king of the Jews?</I> Dost thou pretend to be so, to 
 be that Messiah whom the Jews expect as a temporal prince?"--"Yea,"
 saith Christ, "it is as <I>thou sayest,</I> I am that Messiah, but not 
 such a one as they expect." He is the king that rules and protects his 
 Israel according to the spirit, who are Jews inwardly by the 
 circumcision of the spirit, and the king that will restrain and punish 
 the carnal Jews, who continue in unbelief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The articles of impeachment exhibited against him, and his silence 
 under the charge and accusation. The chief priests forgot the dignity 
 of their place, when they turned informers, and did in person <I>accuse 
 Christ of many things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 and witness against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Many of the Old-Testament prophets charge the priests of their times 
 with great wickedness, in which <I>well did they prophesy</I> of these 
 priests; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:26,Ho+5:1,6:9,Mic+3:11,Zep+3:4,Mal+1:6,2:8">Ezek. xxii. 26;
 Hos. v. 1; vi. 9; Mic. iii. 11; Zeph. iii. 4; Mal. i. 6; ii. 8</A>.

 The destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans is said to be for the
 <I>iniquity of the priests that shed the blood of the just,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:13">Lam. iv. 13</A>.

 Note, Wicked priests are generally the worst of men. The better any
 thing is, the worse it is when it is corrupted. Lay persecutors have 
 been generally found more compassionate than ecclesiastics. These 
 priests were very eager and noisy in their accusation; but Christ 
 <I>answered nothing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 When Pilate urged him to clear himself, and was desirous he should 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 yet still he stood mute 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 he <I>answered nothing,</I> which Pilate thought very strange. He gave 
 Pilate a direct answer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 but would not answer the prosecutors and witnesses, because the things 
 they alleged, were notoriously false, and he knew Pilate himself was 
 convinced they were so. Note, As Christ <I>spoke</I> to admiration, so 
 he <I>kept silence</I> to admiration.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The proposal Pilate made to the people, to have Jesus released to 
 them, since it was the custom of the feast to grace the solemnity with 
 the release of one prisoner. The people expected and demanded that he 
 should do <I>as he had ever done to them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 it was not an ill usage, but they would have it kept up. Now Pilate 
 perceived that the chief priests delivered up Jesus <I>for envy,</I> 
 because he had got such a reputation among the people as eclipsed 
 theirs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It was easy to see, comparing the eagerness of the prosecutors with the 
 slenderness of the proofs, that it was not his <I>guilt,</I> but his 
 <I>goodness,</I> not any thing <I>mischievous</I> or <I>scandalous,</I> 
 but something <I>meritorious</I> and <I>glorious,</I> that they were 
 provoked at. And therefore, hearing how much he was the darling of the 
 crowd, he thought that he might safely appeal from the priests to the 
 people, and that they would be proud of rescuing him out of the 
 priests' hands; and he proposed an expedient for their doing it without 
 danger of an <I>uproar;</I> let them demand him to be <I>released,</I> 
 and Pilate will be ready to do it, and stop the mouths of the priests 
 with this--that the people insisted upon his release. There was indeed 
 another prisoner, <I>one Barabbas,</I> that had an interest, and would 
 have some votes; but he questioned not but Jesus would out-poll 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The unanimous outrageous clamours of the people have <I>Christ put 
 to death,</I> and particularly to have him <I>crucified.</I> It was a 
 great surprise to Pilate, when he found the people so much under the 
 influence of the priests, that they all agreed to desire that Barabbas 
 might be <I>released,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Pilate opposed it all he could; "<I>What will ye that I shall do to him 
 whom ye call the King of the Jews?</I> Would not ye then have him 
 released too?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 No, say they, <I>Crucify him.</I> The priests having put that in their 
 mouths, the insist upon it; when Pilate objected, <I>Why, what evil has 
 he done?</I> (a very material question in such a case), they did not 
 pretend to answer it, but <I>cried out more exceedingly,</I> as they 
 were more and more instigated and irritated by the priests, <I>Crucify 
 him, crucify him.</I> Now the priests, who were very busy dispersing 
 themselves and their creatures among the mob, to keep up the cry, 
 promised themselves that it would influence Pilate two ways to condemn 
 him. 

 1. It might incline him to believe Christ <I>guilty,</I> when there was
 so general an out-cry against him. "Surely," might Pilate think, "he 
 must needs be a bad man, whom all the world is weary of." He would now 
 conclude that he had been <I>misinformed,</I> when he was told what an 
 interest he had in the people, and that the matter was not so. But the 
 priest had hurried on the prosecution with so much expedition, that we 
 may suppose that they who were Christ's friends, and would have opposed 
 this cry, were at the other end of the town, and knew nothing of the 
 matter. Note, It has been the common artifice of Satan, to put Christ 
 and his religion into an ill name, and so to run them down. When once 
 this sect, as they called it, comes to be <I>every where spoken 
 against,</I> though <I>without cause,</I> then that is looked upon as 
 <I>cause enough</I> to condemn it. But let us <I>judge</I> of persons 
 and things by their merits, and the standard of God's word, and not 
 prejudge by common fame and the cry of the country.

 2. It might induce him to condemn Christ, to <I>please</I> the people,
 and indeed for <I>fear of displeasing</I> them. Though he was not so 
 <I>weak</I> as to be governed by their opinion, to believe him guilty, 
 yet he was so <I>wicked</I> as to be swayed by their outrage, to 
 condemn him, though he believed him innocent; induced thereunto by 
 reasons of state, and the wisdom of the world. Our Lord Jesus dying as 
 a <I>sacrifice</I> for the <I>sins of many,</I> he fell a sacrifice to 
 the <I>rage of many.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  And <I>so</I> Pilate, willing to content the people, released
 Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged
 <I>him,</I> to be crucified.
 &nbsp; 16  And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called
 Pr&aelig;torium; and they call together the whole band.
 &nbsp; 17  And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of
 thorns, and put it about his <I>head,</I>
 &nbsp; 18  And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
 &nbsp; 19  And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit
 upon him, and bowing <I>their</I> knees worshipped him.
 &nbsp; 20  And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from
 him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify
 him.
 &nbsp; 21  And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming
 out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear
 his cross.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Pilate, to gratify the Jews' malice, delivers Christ to be 
 <I>crucified,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>Willing to content the people,</I> to <I>do enough</I> for them (so 
 the word is), and make them easy, that he might keep them quiet, he 
 <I>released Barabbas unto them,</I> who was the scandal and plague of 
 their nation, and <I>delivered Jesus</I> to be <I>crucified,</I> who 
 was the glory and blessing of their nation. Though he <I>had scourged
 him</I> before, hoping that would <I>content</I> them, and then not 
 designing to crucify him, yet he went on to that; for no wonder that he 
 who could persuade himself to <I>chastise</I> one that was innocent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:16">Luke xxiii. 16</A>),

 could by degrees persuade himself to <I>crucify</I> him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ was <I>crucified,</I> for that was, 

 1. A <I>bloody</I> death, and <I>without blood no remission,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:22">Heb. ix. 22</A>.
 
 The blood is <I>the life</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:4">Gen. ix. 4</A>);

 it is the <I>vehicle</I> of the <I>animal</I> spirits, which 
 <I>connect</I> the soul and body, so that the exhausting of the blood 
 is the exhausting of the life. Christ was to lay down <I>his life</I> 
 for us, and therefore <I>shed his blood.</I> Blood <I>made atonement 
 for the soul</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:11">Lev. xvii. 11</A>),

 and therefore in every sacrifice of propitiation special order was 
 given for the <I>pouring out</I> of the blood, and the 
 <I>sprinkling</I> of that before the Lord. Now, that Christ might 
 answer all these types, he <I>shed his blood.</I> 

 2. It was a <I>painful</I> death; the pains were exquisite and acute,
 for death made its assaults upon the vitals by the exterior parts, 
 which are <I>quickest of sense.</I> Christ died, so as that he might 
 <I>feel himself die,</I> because he was to be both the priest and the 
 sacrifice; so that he might be <I>active</I> in dying; because he was 
 to <I>make his soul an offering</I> for sin. Tully calls crucifixion, 
 <I>Teterrimum supplicium--A most tremendous punishment:</I> Christ 
 would meet death in its greatest terror, and so conquer it. 

 3. It was a <I>shameful</I> death, the death of slaves, and the vilest
 malefactors; so it was accounted among the Romans. The <I>cross</I> and 
 the <I>shame</I> are put together. God having been injured in his 
 honour by the sin of man, it is <I>in his honour</I> that Christ makes 
 him <I>satisfaction,</I> not only by denying himself in, and divesting 
 himself of, the honours due to his divine nature, for a time, but by 
 submitting the greatest reproach and ignominy the human nature was 
 capable of being loaded with. Yet this was not the worst. 

 4. It was a <I>cursed</I> death; thus it was branded by the Jewish law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:23">Deut. xxi. 23</A>);

 <I>He that is hanged, is accursed of God,</I> is under a particular 
 mark of God's displeasure. It was the death that Saul's sons were put 
 to, when the guilt of their father' bloody house was to be expiated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:6">2 Sam. xxi. 6</A>.
 
 Haman and his sons were <I>hanged,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+7:10,9:13">Esth. vii. 10; ix. 13</A>.

 We do not read any of the prophets of the Old Testament that were
 <I>hanged;</I> but now that Christ has submitted to be <I>hanged upon a 
 tree,</I> the reproach and curse of that kind of death are quite rolled 
 away, so that it ought to be any hindrance to the comfort of those who 
 die either innocently or penitently, nor any diminution from, but 
 rather an addition to, the glory of those who die martyrs for Christ, 
 to be as he was, hanged upon a tree.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Pilate, to gratify the gay humour of the Roman soldiers, delivered 
 him to them, to be abused and spitefully treated, while they were 
 preparing for the execution. They called together <I>the whole 
 regiment</I> that was then in waiting, and they went into an inner 
 hall, where they ignominiously abused our Lord Jesus, as a king, just 
 as in the high priest's hall his servants had ignominiously abused him 
 as a Prophet and Saviour. 

 1. Do kings wear robes of purple or scarlet? They <I>clothed him with
 purple.</I> This abuse done to Christ in his apparel should be an
 intimation to Christians, not to make the putting on of apparel
 <I>their adorning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:4">1 Pet. iii. 4</A>.

 Shall a purple or scarlet robe be matter of pride to a Christian, which
 was matter of reproach and shame to Christ.

 2. Do kings wear <I>crowns?</I> They <I>platted a crown of thorns,</I>
 and <I>put it on his head.</I> A crown of straw, or rushes, would have 
 been banter enough; but this was pain also. He wore the crown of thorns 
 which we had deserved, that we might wear the crown of glory which he 
 merited. Let us be <I>taught</I> by these <I>thorns,</I> as Gideon 
 taught the men of Succoth, to hate sin, and be uneasy under it, and to 
 be in love with Jesus Christ, who is here a lily among thorns. If we be 
 at any time afflicted with a <I>thorn in the flesh,</I> let it be our 
 comfort, that our high priest is touched with the feelings of our 
 infirmities, having himself known what <I>thorns in the flesh</I> 
 meant. 

 3. Are kings attended with the acclamations of their subjects, <I>O
 king, live for ever?</I> That also is mimicked; they saluted him with 
 "<I>Hail, King of the Jews;</I> such a prince, and such a people, even 
 good enough for one another." 

 4. Kings have <I>sceptres</I> put into their hand, marks of dominion,
 as the crown is of dignity; to imitate this, they put a <I>reed in his 
 right hand.</I> Those that despise the authority of Jesus Christ, as 
 not to be observed and obeyed, who regard not either the precepts of 
 his word, or the threatenings of his wrath, do, in effect, <I>put a 
 reed in his hand;</I> nay, and, as these here, <I>smite him on the 
 head</I> with it, such is the indignity they do him. 

 5. Subjects, when they swear allegiance, were wont to <I>kiss</I> their
 sovereign; and this they offered to do, but, instead of that, <I>spit 
 upon him.</I> 

 6. Kings used to be addressed upon the <I>knee;</I> and this also they
 brought into the jest, they <I>bowed the knee, and worshipped him;</I> 
 this they did in scorn, to make themselves and one another laugh. We 
 were by sin become liable to <I>everlasting shame and contempt,</I> to 
 deliver us from which, our Lord Jesus submitted to this shame and 
 contempt for us. He was thus mocked, not in <I>his own clothes,</I> but 
 in another's, to signify that he suffered not for his own sin; the 
 crime was ours, the shame his. Those who pretend subjection to Christ, 
 but at the same time give themselves up to the service of the world and 
 the flesh, do, in effect, the same that they did, who bowed the knee to 
 him in mockery, and abused him with, <I>Hail, king of the Jews,</I> 
 when they said, <I>We have no king but C&aelig;sar.</I> Those that bow 
 the knee to Christ, but do not bow the soul, that <I>draw nigh to him 
 with their mouths,</I> and <I>honour him with their lips,</I> but 
 <I>their hearts are far from him,</I> put the same affront upon him 
 that these here did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The soldiers, at the hour appointed, led him away from Pilate's 
 judgment-hall to the place of execution

 as a sheep to the slaughter; he was <I>led forth with the workers of 
 iniquity,</I> though he did no sin. But lest his death, under the load 
 of his cross, which he was to carry, should prevent the further 
 cruelties they intended, they compelled one Simon of Cyrene to carry 
 his cross for him. He <I>passed by, coming out of the country</I> or 
 out of the <I>fields,</I> not thinking of any such matter. Note, We 
 must not think it strange, if crosses come upon us suddenly, and we be 
 surprised by them. The cross was a very troublesome unwieldy load: but 
 he that carried it a few minutes, had the honour to have his name upon 
 the record in the book of God, though otherwise an obscure person; so 
 that, wherever this gospel is preached; so that, wherever this gospel 
 is preached, there shall this be told for a memorial to him: in like 
 manner, though <I>no affliction,</I> no cross, <I>for the present, be 
 joyous, but grievous,</I> yet afterward it yields a crown of glory to 
 them that are exercised thereby.</P>

 interpreted, The place of a skull.
 &nbsp; 23  And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he
 received <I>it</I> not.
 &nbsp; 24  And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,
 casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
 &nbsp; 25  And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
 &nbsp; 26  And the superscription of his accusation was written over,
 THE KING OF THE JEWS.
 &nbsp; 27  And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right
 hand, and the other on his left.
 &nbsp; 28  And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was
 numbered with the transgressors.
 &nbsp; 29  And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,
 and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest
 <I>it</I> in three days,
 &nbsp; 30  Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
 &nbsp; 31  Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among
 themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot
 save.
 &nbsp; 32  Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross,
 that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with
 him reviled him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the <I>crucifixion</I> of our Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>place where</I> he was crucified; it was called 
 <I>Golgotha--the place of a scull:</I> some think, because of the heads 
 of malefactors that were there cut off: it was the common place of 
 execution, as Tyburn, for he was in all respects numbered with the 
 transgressors. I know not how to give any credit to it, but divers of 
 the ancients mention it as a current tradition, that in this place our 
 first father Adam was buried, and they think it highly congruous that 
 there Christ should be crucified; for as in Adam all die, so in Christ 
 shall all be made alive. Tertullian, Origen, Chrysostom, and Epiphanius 
 (great names), take notice of it; nay, Cyprian adds, <I>Creditur 
 &agrave; piis--Many good people believe</I> that the blood of Christ
 crucified did trickle down upon the scull of Adam, who was buried in 
 the same place. Something more credible is the tradition, that this 
 mount Calvary was <I>that mountain in the land of Moriah</I> (and in 
 the land of Moriah it certainly was, for so the country about Jerusalem 
 was called), on which Isaac was to be offered; and the ram was offered 
 instead of him; and then Abraham had an eye to <I>this day</I> of 
 Christ, when he called the place <I>Jehovah-jireh--The Lord will 
 provide,</I> expecting that so it would be seen in the <I>mount of the 
 Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The <I>time when</I> he was crucified; it was the <I>third 
 hour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 He was brought before Pilate about the sixth hour
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:14">John xix. 14</A>),

 according to the Roman way of reckoning, which John uses, with which 
 ours at this day agrees, that is at six o'clock in the morning; and 
 then, at the <I>third hour,</I> according to the Jews' way of 
 reckoning, that is, about nine of the clock in the morning, or soon 
 after, they nailed him to the cross. Dr. Lightfoot thinks the <I>third 
 hour</I> is here mentioned, to intimate an aggravation of the 
 wickedness of the priests, they were here prosecuting Christ to the 
 death, though it was after the <I>third hour,</I> when they ought to 
 have been attending the service of the temple, and offering the 
 peace-offerings; it being the first day of the <I>feast of unleavened 
 bread,</I> when there was to be a <I>holy convocation.</I> At that very 
 time, when they should have been, according to the duty of their place, 
 presiding in the public devotions, were they here venting their malice 
 against the Lord Jesus; yet these were the men that seemed so zealous 
 for the temple, and condemned Christ for speaking against it. Note, 
 There are many who pretend to be <I>for the church,</I> who yet care 
 not how seldom they <I>go to church.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The indignities that were done him, when he was nailed to the 
 cross; as if that had not been ignominious enough, they added several 
 things to the ignominy of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It being the custom to give <I>wine</I> to persons that were to be 
 <I>put to death,</I> they <I>mingled</I> his with <I>myrrh,</I> which 
 was <I>bitter,</I> and made it <I>nauseous;</I> he <I>tasted</I> it, 
 but would not drink it; was willing to admit the bitterness of it, but 
 not the benefit of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The garments of those that were crucified, being, as with us, the 
 executioners' fee, the soldiers <I>cast lots</I> upon his garments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 threw dice (as our soldiers do upon a drum-head), for them: so making
 themselves merry with his misery, and sitting at their sport while he 
 was hanging in pain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They set up a superscription over his head, by which they intended 
 to reproach him, but really did him both justice and honour, <I>The 
 king of the Jews,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Here was no crime alleged, but his sovereignty owned. Perhaps Pilate 
 meant to cast disgrace upon Christ as a baffled king, or upon the Jews, 
 who by their importunity had forced him, against his conscience, to 
 condemn Christ, as a people that deserved no better a king than he 
 seemed to be: however, God intended it to be the proclaiming even of 
 Christ upon the cross, the <I>king of Israel;</I> though Pilate know 
 not what he wrote, any more than Caiaphas what he said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:51">John xi. 51</A>.
 
 Christ crucified is king of his church, his spiritual Israel; and even
 then when he hung on the cross, he was like a king, <I>conquering</I>
 his and his people's enemies, and <I>triumphing</I> over them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>.

 Now he was writing his laws in his own blood, and preparing his favours
 for his subjects. Whenever we look unto Christ crucified, we must 
 remember the inscription over his head, that he is a king, and we must 
 give up ourselves to be his subjects, as Israelites indeed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They crucified <I>two thieves</I> with him, <I>one on his right 
 hand, the other on his left,</I> and him in the midst as the worst of 
 the three 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 so great a degree of dishonour did they hereby intend him. And, no 
 doubt, it gave him <I>disturbance</I> too. Some that have been 
 imprisoned in the common gaols, for the testimony of Jesus, have 
 complained of the company of cursing, swearing prisoners, more than any 
 other of the grievances of their prison. Now, in the midst of such our 
 Lord Jesus was <I>crucified;</I> while he lived he had, and there was 
 occasion, <I>associated</I> with sinners, to do them good; and now when 
 he died, he was for the same purpose joined with them, for he <I>came 
 into the world,</I> and went out of it, to <I>save sinners,</I> even 
 the chief. But this evangelist takes particular notice of the 
 fulfilling of the scriptures in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 In that famous prediction of Christ's sufferings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:12">Isa. liii. 12</A>),

 it was foretold that he should be numbered with the 
 <I>transgressors,</I> because he was made <I>sin for us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The spectators, that is, the generality of them, instead of 
 condoling with him in his misery, added to it by insulting over him. 
 Surely never was such an instance of barbarous inhumanity toward the 
 vilest malefactor: but thus the devil showed the utmost rage against 
 him, and thus he submitted to the greatest dishonours that could be 
 done him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Even they that <I>passed by,</I> that were no way concerned, 
 <I>railed on him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 If their hearts were so hardened, that their compassions were not moved 
 with such a spectacle, yet they should have thought it enough to have 
 their curiosity gratified; but that will not serve: as if they were not 
 only divested of all humanity, but were devils in human shape, they 
 taunted him, and expressed themselves with the utmost detestation of 
 him, and indignation at him, and shot thick at him their arrows, even 
 <I>bitter words.</I> The chief priests, no doubt, put these sarcasms 
 into their mouths, <I>Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it 
 in three days, now,</I> if thou canst, <I>save thyself,</I> and <I>come 
 down from the cross.</I> They triumph as if now that they had got him 
 to the cross, there were no danger of his <I>destroying the temple;</I> 
 whereas the <I>temple</I> of which <I>he</I> spoke, he was now 
 <I>destroying,</I> and did within <I>three days build it up;</I> and 
 the temple of which <I>they</I> spoke, he did by men, that were <I>his 
 sword</I> and <I>his hand,</I> destroy not many years after. When 
 secure sinners think the danger is over, it is then most ready to seize 
 them: the day of the Lord <I>comes as a thief</I> upon those that 
 <I>deny</I> his coming, and say, Where is the promise of it? much more 
 upon those that <I>defy</I> his coming, and say, <I>Let him make speed, 
 and hasten his work.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Even the chief priests, who, being <I>taken from among men</I> and 
 ordained for men, should have compassion even on those that are out of 
 the way, should be tender of those that are suffering and dying 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:1,2">Heb. v. 1, 2</A>),

 yet they poured vinegar instead of oil into his wounds, they <I>talked 
 to the grief</I> of him <I>whom God had smitten</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:26">Ps. lxix. 26</A>),

 they <I>mocked him,</I> they said, <I>He saved others,</I> healed and 
 helped them, but now it appears that it was not by his own power, for 
 <I>himself he cannot save.</I> They challenged him to <I>come down from 
 the cross,</I> if he could, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Let them but <I>see</I> that, and they would <I>believe;</I> whereas 
 they would not believe, when he gave them a more convincing sign than 
 that, when he came up from the grave. These chief priests, one would
 think, might now have found themselves <I>other work</I> to do: if they 
 would not go to do their duty in <I>the temple,</I> yet they might have 
 been employed in an office not foreign to their profession; though they 
 would not offer any counsel or comfort to the Lord Jesus, yet they 
 might have given some help to the thieves in their dying moments (the 
 monks and priests in Popish countries are very officious about 
 criminals broken upon the wheel, a death much like that of the cross); 
 but they do not think that their business.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Even they that were crucified with him, reviled him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 one of them did, so wretchedly was his heart hardened even in the depth 
 of misery, and at the door of eternity.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>33  And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over
 the whole land until the ninth hour.
 &nbsp; 34  And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
 Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My
 God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
 &nbsp; 35  And some of them that stood by, when they heard <I>it,</I> said,
 Behold, he calleth Elias.
 &nbsp; 36  And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put
 <I>it</I> on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us
 see whether Elias will come to take him down.
 &nbsp; 37  And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
 &nbsp; 38  And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to
 the bottom.
 &nbsp; 39  And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw
 that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this
 man was the Son of God.
 &nbsp; 40  There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was
 Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of
 Joses, and Salome;
 &nbsp; 41  (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and
 ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him
 unto Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have an account of Christ's dying, how his enemies abused him, 
 and God honoured him at his death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. There was a thick <I>darkness</I> over <I>the whole land</I> (some 
 think over the whole earth), for three hours, from noon till three of 
 the clock. Now the scripture was fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:9">Amos viii. 9</A>),

 <I>I will cause the sun to go down at noon,</I> and I will <I>darken
 the earth in the clear day;</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:9">Jer. xv. 9</A>,

 <I>Her sun is gone down while it is yet day.</I> The Jews have often
 demanded of Christ a <I>sign from heaven;</I> and now they had one, but
 such a one as signified the blinding of their eyes. It was a sign of
 the darkness that was come, and coming, upon the Jewish church and
 nation. They were doing their utmost to extinguish the Sun of
 righteousness, which was now setting, and the rising again of which
 they would never own; and what then might be expected among them but a
 worse than Egyptian darkness? This intimated to them, that the things
 which belonged to their peace, were now <I>hid from their eyes,</I> and
 that the day of the Lord was at hand, which should be to them a <I>day
 of darkness and gloominess,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:1,2">Joel ii. 1, 2</A>.

 It was the power of darkness that they were now under, the works of 
 darkness that they were now doing; and such as this should their doom 
 justly be, who <I>loved darkness rather than light.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Toward the close of this darkness, our Lord Jesus, in the agony of 
 his soul, cried out, <I>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 The darkness signified the present cloud which the human soul of Christ 
 was under, when he was making it an <I>offering for sin.</I> Mr. Fox,
 in his <I>Acts and Monuments</I> (vol. 3, p. 160), tells of one Dr.
 Hunter, a martyr in queen Mary's time, who, being fastened to the 
 stake, to be burnt, put up this short prayer, <I>Son of God, shine upon 
 me;</I> and immediately the sun in the firmament shone out of the dark 
 cloud, so full in his face, that he was forced to look another way, 
 which was very comfortable to him. But our Lord Jesus, on the contrary, 
 was denied the light of the sun, when he was in his sufferings, to 
 signifying the withdrawing of the light of God's countenance. And this 
 he complained of more than any thing; he did not complain of his 
 disciples' forsaking him, but of his Father's, 

 1. Because this <I>wounded his spirit;</I> and that is a thing <I>hard
 to bear</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:14">Prov. xviii. 14</A>);
 
 brought the waters into his soul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:1-3">Ps. lxix. 1-3</A>.

 2. Because in this especially he was <I>made sin for us;</I> our 
 iniquities had deserved <I>indignation and wrath</I> upon the soul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:8">Rom. ii. 8</A>),

 and therefore, Christ, being made a <I>sacrifice,</I> underwent as much 
 of it as he was capable of; and it could not but bear hard indeed upon 
 him who had lain <I>in the bosom</I> of the Father from eternity, and 
 was <I>always his light.</I> These symptoms of divine wrath, which 
 Christ was under in his sufferings, were like that fire from heaven 
 which had been sent sometimes, in extraordinary cases, to consume the 
 sacrifices (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:24,2Ch+7:1,1Ki+18:38">Lev. ix. 24; 
 2 Chron. vii. 1; 1 Kings xviii. 38</A>);

 and it was always a token of God's acceptance. The fire that should 
 have fallen upon the <I>sinner,</I> if God had not been 
 <I>pacified,</I> fell upon the <I>sacrifice,</I> as a token that he was 
 so; therefore it now fell upon Christ, and extorted him from this 
 <I>loud</I> and <I>bitter</I> cry. When Paul was to be <I>offered</I>
 as a sacrifice for the <I>service of saints,</I> he could <I>joy</I> 
 and <I>rejoice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:17">Phil. ii. 17</A>);

 but it is another thing to be offered as a sacrifice for <I>the sin of 
 sinners.</I> Now, at the <I>sixth hour,</I> and so to the <I>ninth,</I> 
 the <I>sun</I> was <I>darkened</I> by an extraordinary eclipse; and if 
 it be true, as some astronomers compute, that in the evening of this 
 day on which Christ died there was an eclipse of the moon, that was 
 natural and expected, in which seven digits of the moon were darkened, 
 and it continued from five o'clock till seven, it is remarkable, and 
 yet further significant of the darkness of the time that then was. When 
 the <I>sun</I> shall be <I>darkened,</I> the <I>moon</I> also shall 
 <I>not give her light.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's prayer was bantered by them that stood by 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:35,36"><I>v.</I> 35, 36</A>);
 
 because he cried, <I>Eli, Eli,</I> or (as Mark has it, according to the
 Syriac dialect) <I>Eloi, Eloi,</I> they said, <I>He calls for 
 Elias,</I> though they knew very well what he said, and what it 
 signified, <I>My God, My God.</I> Thus did they represent him as 
 <I>praying to saints,</I> either because he had abandoned God, or God 
 had abandoned him; and hereby they would make him more and more odious 
 to the people. One of them <I>filled a sponge with vinegar,</I> and 
 reached it up to him upon a reed; "Let him cool his mouth with that, it 
 is a drink good enough for him," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 This was intended for a further affront and abuse to him; and whoever 
 it was that checked him who did it, did but add to the reproach; 
 "<I>Let him alone;</I> he has called for Elias: <I>let us see whether 
 Elias will come take him down;</I> and if not, we may conclude that he 
 also hath abandoned him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ did again <I>cry with a loud voice,</I> and so <I>gave up
 the ghost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 He was now commending his soul into his Father's hand; and though God 
 is not moved with any <I>bodily exercise,</I> yet this loud voice 
 signified the great strength and ardency of affection wherewith he did 
 it; to teach us, in every thing wherein we have to do with God, to put 
 forth our utmost vigour, and to perform all the duties of religion, 
 particularly that of <I>self-resignation,</I> with our whole heart and 
 whole soul; and then, though speech fails, that we cannot <I>cry with a 
 loud voice,</I> as Christ did, yet if God be the <I>strength of the 
 heart,</I> that will not fail. Christ was really and truly <I>dead,</I> 
 for he <I>gave up the ghost;</I> his human soul departed to the world 
 of spirits, and left his body a breathless clod of clay.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Just at that instant that Christ died upon <I>mount Calvary,</I> the 
 veil of the <I>temple</I> was <I>rent in twain from the top to the 
 bottom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 This bespoke a great deal, 

 1. Of the terror of the unbelieving Jews; for it was a presage of the 
 utter destruction of their church and nation, which followed not long 
 after; it was like the cutting asunder of the <I>staff of beauty</I> 
 (for this veil was exceedingly splendid and glorious,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+26:31">Exod. xxvi. 31</A>),

 and that was done at the same time when they gave for his price 
 <I>thirty pieces of silver</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:10,12">Zech. xi. 10, 12</A>),

 to <I>break the covenant which he had made with that people.</I> Now it 
 was time to cry, <I>Ichabod, The glory is departed from Israel.</I> 
 Some think that the story which Josephus relates, of the temple door 
 opening of its own accord, with that voice, <I>Let us depart hence,</I> 
 some years before the destruction of Jerusalem, is the same with this; 
 but that is not probable: however, this had the same signification, 
 according to that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:14">Hos. v. 14</A>),
 
 <I>I will tear, and go away.</I> 

 2. It bespeaks a great deal of comfort to all believing Christians, for 
 it signifies the consecrating and laying open to us of a <I>new and 
 living way into the holiest</I> by the <I>blood of Jesus.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The centurion who commanded the detachment which had the oversight 
 of the execution was convinced, and confessed that this Jesus was the 
 <I>Son of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 One thing that satisfied him, was, that he <I>so cried out, and gave up 
 the ghost:</I> that one who was ready to give up the ghost, should be 
 able to cry out so, was very surprising. Of all the sad spectacles of
 this kind he never observed the like; and that one who had strength to 
 cry so loud, should yet immediately give up the ghost, this also made 
 him wonder; and he said, to the honour of Christ, and the shame of 
 those that abused him, <I>Truly this man was the Son of God.</I> But 
 what reason had he to say so? I answer, 

 1. He had reason to say that he suffered <I>unjustly,</I> and had a
 great deal of wrong done him. Note, He suffered for saying that he was 
 <I>the Son of God;</I> and it was true, he did say so, so that if he 
 suffered unjustly, as it was plain by all the circumstances of his 
 suffering that he did, then what he said was true, and he was indeed 
 the <I>Son of God.</I> 

 2. He had reason to say that he was a <I>favourite of heaven,</I> and
 one for whom the almighty power was particularly engaged, seeing how 
 Heaven did him honour at his death, and frowned upon his persecutors.
 "Surely," thinks he, "this must be some divine person, highly beloved 
 of God." This he expresses by such words as denote his eternal 
 generation as God, and his special designation to the office of 
 Mediator, though he meant not so. Our Lord Jesus, even in the depth of 
 his sufferings and humiliation, was the Son of God, and was declared to 
 be so <I>with power.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. There were some of his friends, the good women especially, that 
 attended him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:40,41"><I>v.</I> 40, 41</A>);

 <I>There were women looking on afar off:</I> the <I>men</I> durst not 
 be seen at all, the mob was so very outrageous; <I>Currenti cede 
 furori--Give way to the raging torrent,</I> they thought, was good 
 counsel now. The women durst not come near, but stood at a distance, 
 overwhelmed with grief. Some of these women are here named. <I>Mary 
 Magdalene</I> was one; she had been his patient, and owed all her 
 comfort to his power and goodness, which rescued her out of the 
 possession of seven devils, in gratitude for which she thought she 
 could never do enough for him. <I>Mary</I> also was there, <I>the 
 mother of James the little, Jacobus parvus,</I> so the word is; 
 probably, he was so called because he was, like Zaccheus, little of 
 stature. This Mary was the wife of Cleophas or Alpheus, sister to the 
 virgin Mary. These women had followed Christ <I>from Galilee,</I> 
 though they were not required to attend the feast, as the males were; 
 but it is probably that they came, in expectation that his temporal 
 kingdom would now shortly be set up, and big with hopes of preferment 
 for themselves, and their relations under him. It is plain that the 
 mother of Zebedee's children was so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:21">Matt. xx. 21</A>);

 and now to see <I>him</I> upon a cross, whom they thought to have seen 
 upon a throne, could not but be a great disappointment to them. Note, 
 Those that follow Christ, in expectation of great things in this world 
 by him, and by the profession of his religion, may probably live to see 
 themselves sadly disappointed.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>42  And now when the even was come, because it was the
 preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
 &nbsp; 43  Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, an honourable counsellor, which also
 waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto
 Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
 &nbsp; 44  And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling
 <I>unto him</I> the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any
 while dead.
 &nbsp; 45  And when he knew <I>it</I> of the centurion, he gave the body to
 Joseph.
 &nbsp; 46  And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him
 in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a
 rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
 &nbsp; 47  And Mary Magdalene and Mary <I>the mother</I> of Joses beheld
 where he was laid.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here attending the funeral of our Lord Jesus, a solemn, mournful 
 funeral. O that we may by grace be planted in the likeness of it!
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the body of Christ was <I>begged.</I> It was, as the dead bodies 
 of malefactors are, at the disposal of the government. Those that 
 hurried him to the cross, designed that he should make <I>his grave 
 with the wicked;</I> but God designed he should make it <I>with the 
 rich</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:9">Isa. liii. 9</A>),
 
 and so he did. We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When the body of Christ was begged, in order to its being buried, 
 and why such haste was made with the funeral; <I>The even was come,</I> 
 and it was <I>the preparation,</I> that is, <I>the day before the 
 sabbath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 The Jews were more strict in the observation of the sabbath than of any 
 other feast; and therefore, though this day was itself a 
 <I>feast-day,</I> yet they observed it more religiously as the 
 <I>eve</I> of the <I>sabbath;</I> when they prepared their houses and 
 tables for the <I>splendid</I> and <I>joyful</I> solemnizing of the 
 sabbath day. Note, The day before the sabbath should be a day of 
 preparation for the sabbath, not of our houses and tables, but of our 
 hearts, which, as much as possible, should be <I>freed</I> from the 
 cares and business of the world, and <I>fixed,</I> and put in frame for 
 the service and enjoyment of God. Such work is to be done, and such 
 advantages are to be gained on the sabbath day, that it is requisite we 
 should get ready for it a day before; nay, the whole week should be 
 divided between the improvement of the foregoing sabbath and the 
 preparation for the following sabbath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Who was it that begged the body, and took care for the decent 
 interment of it; it was <I>Joseph of Arimathea,</I> who is here called 
 an <I>honourable counsellor</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>),

 a person of character and distinction, and in an office of public 
 trust; some think <I>in the state,</I> and that he was one of Pilate's 
 privy council; his post rather seems to have been <I>in the church,</I> 
 he was one of the <I>great Sanhedrim</I> of the Jews, or one of the 
 high priest's council. He was <B><I>euschemon bouleutes</I></B>--<I>a 
 counsellor that conducted himself in his place as did become him.</I> 
 Those are truly honourable, and those only, in place of power and 
 trust, who make conscience of their duty, and whose deportment is 
 agreeable to their preferment. But here is a more shining character put 
 upon him; he was one that <I>waited for the kingdom of God,</I> the 
 kingdom of grace on earth, and of glory in heaven, the kingdom of the 
 Messiah. Note, Those who <I>wait for the kingdom of God,</I> and hope 
 for an interest in the privileges of it, must show it by their 
 forwardness to own Christ's cause and interest, even then when it seems 
 to be crushed and run down. Observe, Even among the <I>honourable
 counsellors</I> there were some, there was <I>one</I> at least, that 
 waited for the kingdom of God, whose faith will condemn the unbelief of 
 all the rest. This man God raised up for this necessary service, when 
 none of Christ's disciples could, or durst, undertake it, having 
 neither purse, nor interest, nor courage, for it. <I>Joseph went in 
 boldly to Pilate;</I> though he knew how much it would affront the 
 chief priests, who had loaded him with so much reproach, to see any 
 honour done him, yet he <I>put on courage;</I> perhaps at first he was 
 a little afraid, but <B><I>tolmesas</I></B>--<I>taking heart on it,</I> 
 he determined to show this respect to the remains of the Lord Jesus, 
 let the worst come to the worst.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What a surprise it was to Pilate, to hear that he was <I>dead</I> 
 (Pilate, perhaps, expecting that he would have saved himself, and come 
 down from the cross), especially that he was <I>already dead,</I> that 
 one who seemed to have more than ordinary vigour, should so soon yield 
 to death. Every circumstance of Christ's dying was marvellous; for from 
 first to last his name was called <I>Wonderful.</I> Pilate doubted (so 
 some understand it) whether he was yet dead or no, fearing lest he 
 should be imposed upon, and the body should be <I>taken down alive,</I> 
 and recovered, whereas the sentence was, as with us, to hang <I>till 
 the body be dead.</I> He therefore called the centurion, his own 
 officer, and asked him <I>whether he had been any while dead</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>),

 whether it was so long since they perceived any sign of life in him, 
 any breath or motion, that they might conclude he was dead past recall. 
 The centurion could assure him of this, for he had particularly 
 observed how <I>he gave up the ghost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 There was a special providence in it, that Pilate should be so strict 
 in examining this, that there might be no pretence to say that he was 
 buried alive, and so to take away the truth of his resurrection; and so 
 fully was this determined, that the objection was never started. Thus 
 the truth of Christ gains confirmation, sometimes, even from its 
 enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the body of Christ was <I>buried.</I> Pilate gave Joseph leave 
 to take down the body, and do what he pleased with it. It was a wonder 
 the chief priests were not too quick for him, and had not first begged 
 the body of Pilate, to expose it and drag it about the streets, but 
 that remainder of their wrath did God restrain, and gave that 
 invaluable prize to Joseph, who knew how to value it; and the hearts of 
 the priests were so influenced, that they did not oppose it. <I>Sit 
 divus, modo non sit vivus--We care not for his being adored, provided he
 be not revived.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Joseph bought <I>fine linen</I> to wrap the body in, though in such 
 a case old linen that had been worn might have been thought sufficient. 
 In paying respects to Christ it becomes us to be <I>generous,</I> and 
 to serve him with the <I>best</I> that can be got, not with that which 
 can be got at the best hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He <I>took down</I> the body, mangled and macerated as it was, and 
 <I>wrapt it in the linen</I> as a treasure of great worth. Our Lord 
 Jesus hath commanded himself to be delivered to us sacramentally in the 
 ordinance of the Lord's supper, which we should receive in such a 
 manner as may best express our love to him who loved us and died for 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He <I>laid it in a sepulchre</I> of his own, in a private place. We 
 sometimes find it spoken of in the story of the kings of Judah, as a 
 slur upon the memory of the wicked kings, that they were not buried in 
 the <I>sepulchres of the kings;</I> our Lord Jesus, though he did no 
 evil but much good, and to him was given the throne of his father 
 David, yet was buried in the graves of the common people, for it was 
 not in this world, but in the other, that <I>his rest was glorious.</I> 
 The sepulchre belonged to Joseph. Abraham when he had no other 
 possession in the land of Canaan, yet had a burying-place, but Christ 
 had not so much as that. This sepulchre was <I>hewn out of a rock,</I> 
 for Christ died to make the grave a <I>refuge</I> and shelter to the 
 saints, and being hewn out of a rock, it is a <I>strong</I> refuge. 
 <I>O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave!</I> Christ himself is a 
 <I>hiding place</I> to his people, that is, as <I>the shadow of a great 
 rock.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He <I>rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre,</I> for so the 
 manner of the Jews was to bury. When Daniel was put into the lion's 
 den, a stone was laid to the mouth of it to keep him in, as here to the 
 door of Christ's sepulchre, but neither of them could keep off the 
 angels' visits to the prisoners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Some of the good women attended the funeral, and <I>beheld where he 
 was laid,</I> that they might come after the sabbath to anoint the dead 
 body, because they had not time to do it now. When Moses, the mediator 
 and lawgiver of the Jewish church, was buried, care was taken that no 
 man should <I>know of his sepulchre</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+34:6">Deut. xxxiv. 6</A>),

 because the respect of the people towards his person were to die with 
 him; but when our great Mediator and Lawgiver was buried, special 
 notice was taken of his sepulchre, because he was to <I>rise again:</I> 
 and the care taken of his body, bespeaks the care which he himself will 
 take concerning his body the church. Even when it seems to be a dead 
 body, and as a valley full of dry bones, it shall be preserved in order 
 to a resurrection; as shall also the dead bodies of the saints, with 
 whose dust there is a covenant in force which shall not be forgotten. 
 Our mediations on Christ's burial should lead us to think of our own, 
 and should help to make the grave familiar to us, and so to render that 
 bed easy which we must shortly make in the darkness. Frequent thoughts 
 of it would not only take off the dread and terror of it, but quicken 
 us, since the <I>graves</I> are always ready for us, to get ready for 
 the graves,
