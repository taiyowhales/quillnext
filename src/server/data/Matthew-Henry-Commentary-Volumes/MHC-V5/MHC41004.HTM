 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was
 gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a
 ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea
 on the land.
 &nbsp; 2  And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto
 them in his doctrine,
 &nbsp; 3  Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
 &nbsp; 4  And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side,
 and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
 &nbsp; 5  And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth;
 and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:
 &nbsp; 6  But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had
 no root, it withered away.
 &nbsp; 7  And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and
 choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
 &nbsp; 8  And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that
 sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some
 sixty, and some a hundred.
 &nbsp; 9  And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him
 hear.
 &nbsp; 10  And when he was alone, they that were about him with the
 twelve asked of him the parable.
 &nbsp; 11  And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the
 mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without,
 all <I>these</I> things are done in parables:
 &nbsp; 12  That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they
 may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be
 converted, and <I>their</I> sins should be forgiven them.
 &nbsp; 13  And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how
 then will ye know all parables?
 &nbsp; 14  The sower soweth the word.
 &nbsp; 15  And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown;
 but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh
 away the word that was sown in their hearts.
 &nbsp; 16  And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground;
 who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with
 gladness;
 &nbsp; 17  And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a
 time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the
 word's sake, immediately they are offended.
 &nbsp; 18  And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear
 the word,
 &nbsp; 19  And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of
 riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the
 word, and it becometh unfruitful.
 &nbsp; 20  And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as
 hear the word, and receive <I>it,</I> and bring forth fruit, some
 thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The foregoing chapter began with Christ's <I>entering into the 
 synagogue</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 this chapter begins with Christ's <I>teaching again by the sea 
 side.</I> Thus he changed his method, that if possible all might be 
 reached and wrought upon. To gratify the nice and more genteel sort of 
 people that had seats, <I>chief seats, in the synagogue,</I> and did 
 not care for hearing a sermon any where else, he did not preach always 
 by the <I>sea side,</I> but, having liberty, went often <I>into the 
 synagogue,</I> and taught there; yet, to gratify the poor, the mob, 
 that could not get room in the synagogue, he did not always preach 
 there, but <I>began again to teach by the sea side,</I> where they 
 could come <I>within hearing.</I> Thus are we <I>debtors both to the 
 wise and to the unwise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:14">Rom. i. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here seems to be a new convenience found out, which had not been used 
 before, though he had before preached by the sea side 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:13"><I>ch.</I> ii. 13</A>),

 and that was--his standing <I>in a ship,</I> while his hearers <I>stood
 upon the land;</I> and that inland sea of Tiberias having no tide, 
 there was no ebbing and flowing of the waters to disturb them. Methinks 
 Christ's carrying his doctrine into a ship, and preaching it thence, 
 was a presage of his sending the gospel to the <I>isles of the 
 Gentiles,</I> and the shipping off of the kingdom of God (that rich 
 cargo) from the Jewish nation, to be sent to a people that would bring 
 forth more of the fruits of it. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>way of teaching</I> that Christ used with the 
 <I>multitude</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 He <I>taught them many things,</I> but it was <I>by parables</I> or 
 similitudes, which would <I>tempt them to hear;</I> for people love to 
 be spoken to in their own language, and careless hearers will catch at 
 a plain comparison borrowed from common things, and will retain and 
 repeat that, when they have <I>lost,</I> or perhaps never <I>took,</I> 
 the truth which it was designed to explain and illustrate: but unless 
 they would take pains to search into it, it would but amuse them; 
 <I>seeing they would see, and not perceive</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 and so, while it gratified their curiosity, it was the punishment of 
 their stupidity; they wilfully shut their eyes against the light, and 
 therefore justly did Christ put it into the dark lantern of a parable, 
 which had a bright side toward those who applied it to themselves, and 
 were willing to be guided by it; but to those who were only <I>willing 
 for a season to play with it,</I> it only gave a flash of light now and 
 then, but sent them away in the dark. It is just with God to say of 
 those that <I>will not see,</I> that they <I>shall not see,</I> and to 
 hide from their eyes, who only look about them with a great deal of 
 carelessness, and never look before them with any concern upon the 
 things that belong to their peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The way of <I>expounding</I> that he used with his <I>disciples; 
 When he was alone</I> by himself, not only the <I>twelve,</I> but 
 others that were <I>about him with the twelve,</I> took the opportunity 
 to <I>ask him</I> the meaning of the parables, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They found it good to be <I>about Christ;</I> the nearer him the
 better; good to be <I>with the twelve,</I> to be conversant with those 
 that are intimate with him. And he told them what a distinguishing 
 favour it was to them, that they were made acquainted with the 
 <I>mystery of the kingdom of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 <I>The secret of the Lord was with them.</I> That <I>instructed</I>
 them, which others were only <I>amused</I> with, and they were made to 
 increase in knowledge by every parable, and understood more of the way 
 and method in which Christ designed to set up his kingdom in the world, 
 while others were dismissed, never the wiser. Note, Those who know the 
 <I>mystery</I> of the <I>kingdom of heaven,</I> must acknowledge that 
 it is <I>given to them;</I> they receive both the light and the sight 
 from Jesus Christ, who, after his resurrection, both <I>opened the 
 scriptures,</I> and <I>opened the understanding,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:27,45">Luke xxiv. 27, 45</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In particular, we have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The parable of the sower, as we had it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:3">Matt. xiii. 3</A>,

 &c. He begins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 with, <I>Hearken,</I> and concludes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 with, <I>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</I> Note, The words 
 of Christ demand attention, and those who speak from him, may command 
 it, and should stir it up; even that which as yet we do not 
 <I>thoroughly</I> understand, or not <I>rightly,</I> we must carefully 
 attend to, believing it to be both intelligible and weighty, that at 
 length we may understand it; we shall find more in Christ's sayings 
 than at first there seemed to be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The exposition of it to the disciples. Here is a question Christ put 
 to them before he expounded it, which we had not in Matthew 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);
 
 "<I>Know ye not this parable?</I> Know ye not the meaning of it? <I>How 
 then will ye know all parables?</I>" 

 (1.) "If ye know not this, which is so plain, how will ye understand 
 other parables, which will be more dark and obscure? If ye are 
 gravelled and run aground with this, which bespeaks so plainly the 
 different success of the word preached upon those that hear it, which 
 ye yourselves may see easily, how will ye understand the parables which 
 hereafter will speak of the rejection of the Jews, and the calling of 
 the Gentiles, which is a thing ye have no idea of?" Note, This should 
 quicken us both to prayer and pains that we may get knowledge, that 
 there are a great many things which we are concerned to know; and if we 
 understand not the plain truths of the gospel, how shall we master 
 those that are more difficult? <I>Vita brevis, ars longa--Life is 
 short, art is long. If we have run with the footmen, and they have 
 wearied us,</I> and run us down, then <I>how shall we contend with 
 horses?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:5">Jer. xii. 5</A>.

 (2.) "If ye know not this, which is intended for your direction in
 hearing the word, that ye may profit by it; how shall ye profit by what 
 ye are further to hear? This parable is to teach you to be attentive to 
 the word, and affected with it, that you may <I>understand</I> it. If 
 ye receive not this, ye will not know how to use the key by which ye 
 must be let into all the rest." If we understand not the rules we are 
 to observe in order to our profiting by the word, how shall we profit 
 by any other rule? Observe, Before Christ expounds the parable, 

 [1.] He shows them how sad <I>their</I> case was, who were not let into
 the meaning of the doctrine of Christ; <I>To you it is given, but not 
 to them.</I> Note, It will help us to put a value upon the privileges 
 we enjoy as disciples of Christ, to consider the deplorable state of 
 those who want such privileges, especially that they are out of the 
 ordinary way of conversion; <I>lest they should be converted, and their 
 sins should be forgiven them.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Those only who are <I>converted,</I> have <I>their sins forgiven
 them:</I> and it is the misery of <I>unconverted</I> souls, that they 
 lie under <I>unpardoned</I> guilt.

 [2.] He shows them what a shame it was, that they needed such
 particular explanations of the word they heard, and did not apprehend 
 it at first. Those that would improve in knowledge, must be made 
 sensible of their ignorance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having thus prepared them for it, he gives them the interpretation of 
 the parable of the sower, as we had it before in Matthew. Let us only 
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> That in the great field of the church, the word of God is 
 dispensed to all promiscuously; <I>The sower soweth the word</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 sows it at a venture, <I>beside all waters,</I> upon all sorts of 
 ground 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:20">Isa. xxxii. 20</A>),

 not knowing where it will light, or what fruit it will bring forth. He 
 <I>scatters</I> it, in order to the <I>increase</I> of it. Christ was 
 awhile <I>sowing</I> himself, when he went about teaching and 
 preaching; now he sends his ministers, and sows by their hand.
 Ministers are sowers; they have need of the skill and discretion of the 
 husbandman 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:24-26">Isa. xxviii. 24-26</A>);
 
 they must not observe winds and clouds
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:4,6">Eccl. xi. 4, 6</A>),
 
 and must look up to God, who <I>gives seed to the sower,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:10">2 Cor. ix. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> That of the many that hear the word of the gospel, and 
 read it, and are conversant with it, there are, comparatively, but few 
 that receive it, so as to bring forth the fruits of it; here is but one 
 in four, that comes to good. It is sad to think, how much of the 
 precious seed of the word of God is lost, and <I>sown in vain;</I> but 
 there is a day coming when <I>lost sermons</I> must be accounted for. 
 Many that have heard Christ himself <I>preach in their streets,</I> 
 will hereafter be bidden to depart from him; those therefore who place 
 all their religion in hearing, as if that alone would save them, do but 
 deceive themselves, and build their hope upon the sand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:22">Jam. i. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> Many are much affected with the word for the present, 
 who yet receive no abiding benefit by it. The motions of soul they 
 have, answerable to what they hear, are but a mere flash, like the 
 crackling of thorns under a pot. We read of hypocrites, that they 
 <I>delight to know God's ways</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:2">Isa. lviii. 2</A>);

 of Herod, that he heard John gladly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:20"><I>ch.</I> vi. 20</A>);

 of others, that they <I>rejoiced in his light</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:35">John v. 35</A>);

 of those to whom Ezekiel was a <I>lovely song</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:32">Ezek. xxxiii. 32</A>);

 and those represented here by the stony ground, received the word 
 <I>with gladness,</I> and yet came to nothing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> The reason why the word doth not leave commanding, 
 abiding, impressions upon the minds of the people, is, because their 
 hearts are not duly disposed and prepared to receive it; the fault is 
 in themselves, not in the word; some are careless forgetful hearers, 
 and these get <I>no good at all</I> by the word; it comes in at one 
 ear, and goes out at the other; others have their convictions 
 overpowered by their corruptions, and they lose the good impressions 
 the word has made upon them, so that they get no <I>abiding</I> good by 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fifthly,</I> The devil is very busy about loose, careless hearers, 
 as the fowls of the air go about the seed that lies above ground; when 
 the heart, like the <I>highway,</I> is unploughed, unhumbled, when it 
 <I>lies common,</I> to be trodden on by every passenger, as theirs that 
 are great company-keepers, then the devil is <I>like the fowls;</I> he 
 comes swiftly, and carries away the word ere we are aware. When 
 therefore these fowls come down upon the sacrifices, we should take 
 care, as <I>Abram</I> did, to <I>drive them away</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:11">Gen. xv. 11</A>);
 
 that, though we cannot keep them from hovering over our heads, we may 
 not let them nestle in our hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Sixthly,</I> Many that are not openly <I>scandalized,</I> so as to 
 throw off their profession, as they on the stony ground did, yet have 
 the efficacy of it secretly <I>choked</I> and stifled, so that it comes 
 to nothing; they continue in a barren, hypocritical profession, which 
 brings nothing to pass, and so go down as certainly, though more 
 plausibly, to hell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Seventhly,</I> Impressions that are not <I>keep,</I> will not be 
 <I>durable,</I> but will wear off in suffering, trying times; like 
 footsteps on the sand of the sea, which are gone the next high tide of 
 persecution; when <I>that</I> iniquity doth abound, the love of many to 
 the ways of God waxeth cold; many that keep their profession in fair 
 days, lose it in a storm; and do as those that go to sea only for 
 pleasure, come back again when the wind arises. It is the ruin of 
 hypocrites, that they <I>have no root;</I> they do not act from a 
 living fixed principle; they do not mind <I>heart-work,</I> and without 
 that religion is nothing; for he is the Christian, that is <I>one 
 inwardly.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Eighthly, Many are hindered from profiting by the word of God, by their 
 abundance of the world. Many a good lesson of humility, charity, 
 self-denial, and heavenly-mindedness, is choked and lost by that 
 prevailing complacency in the world, which <I>they</I> are apt to have, 
 on whom it smiles. Thus many professors, that otherwise might have come 
 to something, prove like Pharaoh's <I>lean kine</I> and <I>thin 
 ears.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Ninthly, Those that are not encumbered with the cares of the world, and 
 the deceitfulness of riches, may yet lose the benefit of their 
 profession by the <I>lusts of other things;</I> this is added here in 
 Mark; <I>by the desires which are about other things</I> (so Dr. 
 Hammond), an inordinate appetite toward those things that are pleasing 
 to sense or to the fancy. Those that have but little of the world, may 
 yet be ruined by an indulgence of the body.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Tenthly,</I> Fruit is the thing that God expects and requires from 
 those that enjoy the gospel: fruit according to the <I>seed;</I> a 
 temper of mind, and a course of life, agreeable to the gospel; 
 Christian graces daily exercised, Christian duties duly performed. This 
 is <I>fruit,</I> and it will abound to our account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> No good fruit is to be expected but from good seed. If 
 the seed be sown on <I>good ground,</I> if the heart be humble, and 
 holy, and heavenly, there will be <I>good fruit,</I> and it will 
 <I>abound</I> sometimes even to a <I>hundred fold,</I> such a crop as 
 Isaac reaped,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a
 bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?
 &nbsp; 22  For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested;
 neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come
 abroad.
 &nbsp; 23  If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
 &nbsp; 24  And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what
 measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that
 hear shall more be given.
 &nbsp; 25  For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath
 not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.
 &nbsp; 26  And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should
 cast seed into the ground;
 &nbsp; 27  And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed
 should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.
 &nbsp; 28  For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the
 blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.
 &nbsp; 29  But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth
 in the sickle, because the harvest is come.
 &nbsp; 30  And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or
 with what comparison shall we compare it?
 &nbsp; 31  <I>It is</I> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown
 in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:
 &nbsp; 32  But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater
 than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the
 fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
 &nbsp; 33  And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as
 they were able to hear <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 34  But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they
 were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The lessons which our Saviour designs to teach us here by parables and 
 figurative expressions are these:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That those who <I>are good</I> ought to consider the obligations 
 they are under to <I>do good;</I> that is, as in the parable before, to 
 <I>bring forth fruit.</I> God expects a grateful return of his gifts to 
 us, and a useful improvement of his gifts in us; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed?</I> 
 No, but that it may be <I>set on a candlestick.</I> The apostles were 
 ordained, to receive the gospel, not for themselves only, but for the 
 good of others, to communicate it to them. All Christians, as they have 
 <I>received the gift,</I> must <I>minister the same.</I> Note, 

 1. Gifts and graces make a man <I>as a candle;</I> the <I>candle of the
 Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:27">Prov. xx. 27</A>),

 lighted by the Father of lights; the most eminent are but candles, poor 
 lights, compared with the <I>Sun of righteousness.</I> A candle gives 
 light but a <I>little way,</I> and but a <I>little while,</I> and is 
 easily blown out, and continually burning down and wasting. 

 2. Many who are <I>lighted</I> as candles, put themselves <I>under a
 bed, or under a bushel:</I> they do not <I>manifest</I> grace 
 themselves, nor <I>minister</I> grace to others; they have estates, and 
 do no good with them; have their limbs and senses, wit and learning 
 perhaps, but nobody is the better for them; they have spiritual gifts, 
 but do not use them; like a taper in an urn, they burn to themselves. 
 
 3. Those who are lighted as candles, should set themselves <I>on a
 candlestick;</I> that is, should improve all opportunities of doing 
 good, as those that were made for the glory of God, and the service of 
 the communities they are members of; we are not born for ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The reason given for this, is, because <I>there is nothing hid, which 
 shall not be manifested,</I> which <I>should not</I> be made manifest 
 (so it might better be read), 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 There is no treasure of gifts and graces lodged in any but with design 
 to be communicated; nor was the gospel made a <I>secret</I> to the 
 apostles, to be concealed, but that it should <I>come abroad,</I> and 
 be divulged to all the world. Though Christ expounded the parables to 
 his disciples privately, yet it was with design to make them the more 
 publicly useful; they were <I>taught,</I> that they might teach; and it 
 is a general rule, that <I>the ministration of the Spirit is given to 
 every man to profit withal,</I> not himself only, but others also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It concerns those who hear the word of the gospel, to <I>mark</I> 
 what they hear, and to <I>make a good use</I> of it, because their 
 <I>weal</I> or <I>woe</I> depends upon it; what he had said before he 
 saith again, <I>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 Let him give the gospel of Christ a fair hearing; but that is not
 enough, it is added 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 <I>Take heed what ye hear,</I> and give a due regard to that which ye 
 do hear; <I>Consider what ye</I> hear, so Dr. Hammond reads it. Note,
 What we hear, doth us no good, unless we consider it; those especially 
 that are to teach others must themselves be very observant of the 
 things of God; must take notice of the message they are to deliver, 
 that they may be exact. We must likewise <I>take heed what we hear,</I> 
 by <I>proving</I> all things, that we may <I>hold fast that which is 
 good.</I> We must be <I>cautious,</I> and stand upon our guard, lest we 
 be imposed upon. To enforce this caution, consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As we deal with God, God will deal with us, so Dr. Hammond explains 
 these words, "<I>With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to 
 you.</I> If ye be faithful servants to him, he will be a faithful 
 Master to you: <I>with the upright he will show himself 
 upright.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As we improve the talents we are entrusted with, we shall increase 
 them; if we make use of the knowledge we have, for the glory of God and 
 the benefit of others, it shall sensibly grow, as stock in trade doth 
 by being turned; <I>Unto you that hear, shall more be given; to you 
 that have, it shall be given,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 If the disciples <I>deliver</I> that to the church, which they have
 <I>received of the Lord,</I> they shall be <I>led</I> more into the 
 <I>secret of the Lord.</I> Gifts and graces multiply by being 
 exercised; and God has promised to bless the <I>hand of the 
 diligent.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. If we do not <I>use,</I> we <I>lose,</I> what we have; <I>From him 
 that hath not,</I> that doeth no good with what he hath, and so hath it 
 in vain, is as if he had it not, <I>shall be taken even that which he 
 hath.</I> Burying a talent is the betraying of a trust, and amounts to 
 a forfeiture; and gifts and graces <I>rust</I> for want of 
 <I>wearing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The good seed of the gospel sown in the world, and sown in the 
 heart, doth by degrees produce wonderful effects, but without noise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>,

 &c.); <I>So is the kingdom of God;</I> so is the gospel, when it is
 sown, and received, as seed in good ground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It will <I>come up;</I> though it seem lost and buried under the 
 clods, it will find or make its way through them. The seed <I>cast into 
 the ground will spring.</I> Let but the word of Christ have the place 
 it ought to have in a soul, and it will show itself, as the <I>wisdom 
 from above</I> doth in a <I>good conversation.</I> After a field is 
 sown with corn, how soon is the surface of it altered! How gay and 
 pleasant doth it look, when it is covered with green!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The husbandman cannot describe how it comes up; it is one of the 
 mysteries of nature; It <I>springs and grows up, he knows not how,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He sees it has grown, but he cannot tell in what manner it grew, or
 what was the cause and method of its growth. Thus we know not how the 
 Spirit by the word makes a change in the heart, any more than we can 
 account for the blowing of the wind, which we hear the sound of, but 
 cannot tell whence it comes, or whither it goes. Without controversy, 
 great is the mystery of godliness; how <I>God manifested in the 
 flesh</I> came to be <I>believed on in the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16">1 Tim. iii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The husbandman, when he hath sown the seed, doth nothing toward the 
 springing of it up; <I>He sleeps, and rises, night and day;</I> goes to 
 sleep <I>at night,</I> gets up <I>in the morning,</I> and perhaps never 
 so much as thinks of the corn he hath sown, or ever looks upon it, but 
 follows his pleasures or other business, and yet <I>the earth brings 
 forth fruit of itself,</I> according to the ordinary course of nature, 
 and by the concurring power of the God of nature. Thus the <I>word of 
 grace,</I> when it is received in faith, is in the heart a <I>work of 
 grace,</I> and the preachers contribute nothing to it. The Spirit of 
 God is carrying it on when <I>they sleep,</I> and can do no business 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:15,16">Job xxxiii. 15, 16</A>),

 or when they rise to go about other business. The prophets do not 
 <I>live for ever;</I> but the word which they preached, is doing its 
 work, when they are in their graves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:5,6">Zech. i. 5, 6</A>.

 The dew by which the seed is brought up <I>tarrieth not for man, nor
 waiteth for the sons of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:7">Mic. v. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. It grows gradually; <I>first the blade, then the ear, after that the 
 full corn in the ear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 When it is sprung up, it will go forward; nature will have its course,
 and so will grace. Christ's interest, both in the world and in the 
 heart, is, and will be, a <I>growing</I> interest; and though <I>the 
 beginning be small, the latter end will greatly increase.</I> Though 
 thou sowest not that body that shall be, but <I>bare grain,</I> yet God 
 <I>will give to every seed its own body;</I> though at first it is but 
 a tender <I>blade,</I> which the frost may nip, or the foot may crush, 
 yet it will increase to <I>the ear,</I> to the <I>full corn in the ear. 
 Natura nil facit per saltum--Nature does nothing abruptly.</I> God 
 carries on his work insensibly and without noise, but insuperably and 
 without fail.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. It comes to perfection at last 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>);

 <I>When the fruit is brought forth,</I> that is, when it is 
 <I>ripe,</I> and ready to be <I>delivered</I> into the owner's hand; 
 then he <I>puts in the sickle.</I> This intimates, 

 (1.) That Christ <I>now accepts</I> the services which are done to him 
 by an honest heart from a good principle; from the fruit of the gospel 
 taking place and working in the soul, Christ <I>gathers in</I> a 
 harvest of honour to himself. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:35">John iv. 35</A>.

 (2.) That he will reward them in eternal life. When those that receive 
 the gospel aright, have finished their course, the harvest comes, when 
 they shall be gathered as <I>wheat into God's barn</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:30">Matt. xiii. 30</A>),

 as a shock of corn <I>in his season.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The work of grace is small in its beginnings, but comes to be great 
 and considerable at last 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:30-32"><I>v.</I> 30-32</A>);

 "<I>Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God,</I> as now to be set up 
 by the Messiah? How shall I make you to understand the designed method 
 of it?" Christ speaks as one considering and consulting with himself, 
 how to illustrate it with an apt similitude; <I>With what comparison 
 shall we compare it?</I> Shall we fetch it from the motions of the sun, 
 or the revolutions of the moon? No, the comparison is borrowed from 
 this earth, it is <I>like a grain of mustard-seed;</I> he had compared 
 it before to <I>seed sown,</I> here to <I>that seed,</I> intending 
 thereby to show,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the beginnings of the <I>gospel kingdom</I> would be very 
 small, like that which is <I>one of the least of all seeds.</I> When a 
 Christian church was <I>sown in the earth</I> for God, it was all 
 contained in one room, and the <I>number of the names</I> was but one 
 hundred and twenty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:15">Acts i. 15</A>),

 as the children of Israel, when they went down into Egypt, were but 
 seventy souls. The work of grace in the soul, is, at first, but the 
 <I>day of small things;</I> a <I>cloud</I> no <I>bigger than a man's 
 hand.</I> Never were there such great things undertaken by such an 
 inconsiderable handful, as that of the discipling of the nations by the 
 ministry of the apostles; nor a work that was to end in such great 
 glory, as the work of grace raised from such weak and unlikely 
 beginnings. <I>Who hath begotten me these?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That the perfection of it will be very great; <I>When it grows up, 
 it becomes greater than all herbs.</I> The gospel kingdom in the world, 
 shall increase and spread to the remotest nations of the earth, and 
 shall continue to the latest ages of time. The <I>church</I> hath
 <I>shot out great branches,</I> strong ones, spreading far, and 
 fruitful. The <I>work of grace</I> in the soul has mighty products, now 
 while it is in its growth; but what will it be, when it is perfected in 
 heaven? The difference between a <I>grain of mustard seed</I> and a 
 <I>great tree,</I> is nothing to that between a <I>young convert</I> on 
 earth and a <I>glorified saint</I> in heaven. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:24">John xii. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the parables thus specified the historian concludes with this 
 general account of Christ's preaching--that <I>with many such parables
 he spoke the word unto them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 probably designing to refer us to the larger account of the parables of
 this kind, which we had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:1-52">Matt. xiii.</A>

 He spoke in parables, <I>as they were able to hear them;</I> he fetched
 his comparisons from those things that were familiar to them, and level 
 to their capacity, and delivered them in plain expressions, in 
 condescension to their capacity; though he did not let them into the 
 <I>mystery</I> of the parables, yet his manner of expression was easy, 
 and such as they might hereafter recollect to their edification. But, 
 for the present, <I>without a parable spoke he not unto them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 The glory of the Lord was covered with a cloud, and God speaks to us in
 the language of the <I>sons of men,</I> that, though not <I>at 
 first,</I> yet <I>by degrees,</I> we may understand his meaning; the 
 disciples themselves understood those sayings of Christ afterward, 
 which at first they did not rightly take the sense of. But these 
 parables <I>he expounded to them, when they were alone.</I> We cannot 
 but wish we had had that exposition, as we had of the parable of the 
 sower; but it was not so needful; because, when the church should be 
 enlarged, that would <I>expound</I> these parables to us, without any 
 more ado.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>35  And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto
 them, Let us pass over unto the other side.
 &nbsp; 36  And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him
 even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other
 little ships.
 &nbsp; 37  And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat
 into the ship, so that it was now full.
 &nbsp; 38  And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a
 pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou
 not that we perish?
 &nbsp; 39  And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea,
 Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
 &nbsp; 40  And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that
 ye have no faith?
 &nbsp; 41  And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What
 manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This miracle which Christ wrought for the relief of his disciples, in 
 stilling the storm, we had before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:23">Matt. viii. 23</A>,

 &c.); but it is here more fully related. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was <I>the same day</I> that he had preached out of a ship, 
 <I>when the even was come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 When he had been <I>labouring in the word and doctrine</I> all day,
 instead of <I>re</I>posing himself, he <I>ex</I>poseth himself, to 
 teach us not to think of a constant remaining rest till we come to 
 heaven. The end of a toil may perhaps be but the beginning of a toss. 
 But observe, the ship that Christ made his pulpit is taken under his 
 special protection, and, though in danger, cannot sink. What is used 
 for Christ, he will take particular care of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He himself proposed putting to sea at night, because he would lose 
 no time; <I>Let us pass over to the other side;</I> for we shall find, 
 in the next chapter, he has work to do there. Christ went about doing 
 good, and no difficulties in his way should hinder him; thus 
 industrious we should be in serving him, and our generation according 
 to his will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They did not put to sea, till <I>they had sent away the 
 multitude,</I> that is, had given to each of them that which they came 
 for, and answered all their requests; for he sent none home complaining 
 that they had attended him <I>in vain.</I> Or, They sent them away 
 <I>with a solemn blessing;</I> for Christ came into the world, not only 
 to pronounce, but to <I>command,</I> and to <I>give,</I> the 
 blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They took him <I>even as he was,</I> that is, in the same dress that 
 he was in when he preached, without any cloak to throw over him, which 
 he ought to have had, to keep him <I>warm,</I> when he went to sea at 
 night, especially after preaching. We must not hence infer that we may 
 be careless of our health, but we may learn hence not to be over nice 
 and solicitous about the body.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The storm was so great, that the ship was <I>full of water</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 not by springing a leak, but perhaps partly with the shower, for the 
 word here used signifies a <I>tempest of wind with rain;</I> however, 
 the ship being little, the waves beat into it so that <I>it was 
 full.</I> Note, It is no new thing for that ship to be greatly hurried 
 and endangered, in which Christ and his disciples, Christ and his name 
 and gospel, are embarked.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. There were <I>with him other little ships,</I> which, no doubt, 
 shared in the distress and danger. Probably, these <I>little ships</I> 
 carried those who were desirous to go along with Christ, for the 
 benefit of his preaching and miracles on the other side. The 
 <I>multitude went away</I> when he put to sea, but some there were, 
 that would venture upon the water with him. Those follow the Lamb 
 aright, that follow him <I>wherever he goes.</I> And those that hope 
 for a happiness in Christ, must be willing to take their lot with him, 
 and run the same risks that he runs. One may boldly and cheerfully put 
 to sea in Christ's company, yea though we foresee a storm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. Christ was asleep in this storm; and here we are told that it was 
 <I>in the hinder part of the ship,</I> the pilot's place: he lay at the 
 helm, to intimate that, as Mr. George Herbert expresses it,</P>

 <CENTER>
 <TABLE BORDER=0>
 <TR><TD>When winds and waves assault my keel,
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; He doth preserve it, he doth steer,
 <BR>Ev'n when the boat seems most to reel.
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Storms are the triumph of his art;
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he may close his eyes, yet not his heart.</TD></TR>
 </TABLE>
 </CENTER>

 &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He had a <I>pillow</I> there, such a one as a fisherman's ship would 
 furnish him with. And he <I>slept,</I> to try the faith of his 
 disciples and to stir up prayer: upon the trial, their faith appeared 
 <I>weak,</I> and their prayers <I>strong.</I> Note, Sometimes when the 
 church is in a storm, Christ seems as if he were asleep, unconcerned in 
 the troubles of his people, and regardless of their prayers, and doth 
 not presently appear for their relief. <I>Verily he is a God that 
 hideth himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:15">Isa. xlv. 15</A>.

 But as, when he tarries, he doth not tarry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:3">Hab. ii. 3</A>),

 so when he sleeps he doth not sleep; the keeper of Israel doth not so 
 much as slumber 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+121:3,4">Ps. cxxi. 3, 4</A>);

 he slept, but his heart was awake, as the spouse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:2">Cant. v. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. His disciples encouraged themselves with their having his presence, 
 and thought it the best way to improve that, and appeal to that, and 
 ply the oar of prayer rather than their other oars. Their confidence 
 lay in this, that they had their Master with them; and the ship that 
 has Christ in it, though it may be <I>tossed,</I> cannot <I>sink;</I> 
 the bush that has God in it, though it may <I>burn,</I> shall not 
 <I>consume.</I> C&aelig;sar encouraged the master of the ship, that had
 him on board, with this, <I>C&aelig;sarem vehis, et fortunam 
 C&aelig;saris--Thou hast C&aelig;sar on board, and C&aelig;sar's
 fortune.</I> They <I>awoke Christ.</I> Had not the necessity of the 
 case called for it, they would not have <I>stirred up</I> or 
 <I>awoke</I> their Master, <I>till he had pleased</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:7">Cant. ii. 7</A>);

 but they knew he would <I>forgive them this wrong.</I> When Christ 
 seems as if he slept in a storm, he is awaked by the prayers of his 
 people; when we know not what to do, our eye must be to him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:12">2 Chron. xx. 12</A>);

 we may be at our wits' end, but not at our faith's end, while we have 
 such a Saviour to go to. Their address to Christ is here expressed very 
 emphatically; <I>Master, carest thou not that we perish?</I> I confess 
 this sounds somewhat harsh, rather like chiding him for sleeping than 
 begging him to awake. I know no excuse for it, but the great 
 familiarity which he was pleased to admit them into, and the freedom he 
 allowed them; and the present distress they were in, which put them 
 into such a fright, that they knew not what they said. <I>They</I> do
 Christ a deal of wrong, who suspect him to be <I>careless</I> of his 
 people in distress. The matter is not so; he is not willing that any 
 should perish, much less any of his little ones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:14">Matt. xviii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 9. The word of command with which Christ rebuked the storm, we have 
 here, and had not in Matthew, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 He says, <I>Peace, be still</I>--<B><I>Siopa, pephimoso</I></B>--<I>be
 silent, be dumb.</I> Let not the wind any longer roar, nor the sea 
 rage. Thus he <I>stills the noise of the sea, the noise of her 
 waves;</I> a particular emphasis is laid upon the noisiness of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:7,93:3,4">Ps. lxv. 7, and xciii. 3, 4</A>.

 The noise is threatening and terrifying; let us hear no more of it. 
 This is,

 (1.) A word of command to us; when our wicked hearts are <I>like the
 troubled sea which cannot rest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:20">Isa. lvii. 20</A>);

 when our passions are up, and are unruly, let us think we hear the law 
 of Christ, saying, <I>Be silent, be dumb.</I> Think not confusedly, 
 speak not unadvisedly; but <I>be still.</I> 

 (2.) A word of comfort to us, that, be the storm of trouble ever so 
 loud, ever so strong, Jesus Christ can lay it with a word's speaking. 
 When without are fightings, and within are fears, and the spirits are 
 in a tumult, Christ can <I>create the fruit of the lips, peace.</I> If 
 he say, <I>Peace, be still,</I> there is a <I>great calm</I> presently. 
 It is spoken of as God's prerogative to command the seas, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:35">Jer. xxxi. 35</A>.
 
 By this therefore Christ proves himself to be God. He that made the
 seas, can make them <I>quiet.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 10. The reproof Christ gave them for their fears, is here carried 
 further than in Matthew. There it is, <I>Why are ye fearful?</I> Here, 
 <I>Why are ye so fearful?</I> Though there may be cause for some fear, 
 yet not for fear to such a degree as this. There it is, <I>O ye of
 little faith.</I> Here it is, <I>How is it that ye have no faith?</I> 
 Not that the disciples were without faith. No, they believed that 
 <I>Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God;</I> but at this time their 
 fears prevailed so that they seemed to <I>have no faith</I> at all. It 
 was out of the way, when they had occasion for it, and so it was as if 
 they had not had it. "<I>How is it, that in this matter ye have no 
 faith,</I> that ye think I would not come in with seasonable and 
 effectual relief?" Those may suspect their faith, who can entertain 
 such a thought as that Christ <I>careth not</I> though his <I>people 
 perish,</I> and Christ justly takes it ill.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The impression this miracle made upon the disciples, is 
 here differently expressed. In Matthew it is said, <I>The men 
 marvelled;</I> here it is said, <I>They feared greatly.</I> They 
 <I>feared a great fear;</I> so the original reads it. Now their fear
 was rectified by their faith. When they feared the winds and the seas, 
 it was for want of the reverence they ought to have had for Christ. But
 now that they saw a demonstration of his power over them, they feared 
 <I>them</I> less, and <I>him</I> more. They <I>feared</I> lest they had 
 offended Christ by their unbelieving fears; and therefore studied now 
 to give him honour. They had <I>feared</I> the power and wrath of the 
 Creator in the storm, and that fear had torment and amazement in it; 
 but now they feared the power and grace of the Redeemer in the calm; 
 they <I>feared the Lord and his goodness,</I> and it had pleasure and 
 satisfaction in it, and by it they gave glory to Christ, as Jonah's 
 mariners, who, when the <I>sea ceased from her raging, feared the Lord 
 exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:16">Jon. i. 16</A>.

 This sacrifice they offered to the honour of Christ; they said, <I>What
 manner of man is this?</I> Surely more than a man, <I>for even the 
 winds and the seas obey him.</I></P>
