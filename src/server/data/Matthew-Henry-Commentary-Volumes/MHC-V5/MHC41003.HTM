 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man
 there which had a withered hand.
 &nbsp; 2  And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the
 sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
 &nbsp; 3  And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand
 forth.
 &nbsp; 4  And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the
 sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they
 held their peace.
 &nbsp; 5  And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being
 grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man,
 Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched <I>it</I> out: and his hand
 was restored whole as the other.
 &nbsp; 6  And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel
 with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
 &nbsp; 7  But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and
 a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Jud&aelig;a,
 &nbsp; 8  And from Jerusalem, and from Idum&aelig;a, and <I>from</I> beyond
 Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when
 they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.
 &nbsp; 9  And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait
 on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
 &nbsp; 10  For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him
 for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
 &nbsp; 11  And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before
 him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
 &nbsp; 12  And he straitly charged them that they should not make him
 known.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, as before, we have our Lord Jesus busy at work <I>in the 
 synagogue</I> first, and then by <I>the sea side;</I> to teach us that 
 his presence should not be confined either to the one or to the other, 
 but, wherever any are gathered together in his name, whether <I>in the 
 synagogue</I> or any where else, there is he in the midst of them. 
 <I>In every place where he records his name,</I> he will meet his 
 people, and <I>bless them;</I> it is his will that men <I>pray every 
 where.</I> Now here we have some account of what he did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When he <I>entered again into the synagogue,</I> he improved the 
 opportunity he had there, of doing good, and having, no doubt, preached 
 a sermon there, he wrought a miracle for the confirmation of it, or at 
 least for the confirmation of this truth--that <I>it is lawful to do
 good on the sabbath day.</I> We had the narrative, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:9">Matt. xii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The patient's case was piteous; he had a <I>withered hand,</I> by 
 which he was disabled to work for his living; and those that are so, 
 are the most proper objects of charity; let those be helped that cannot 
 help themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The spectators were very unkind, both to the patient and to the 
 Physician; instead of interceding for a poor neighbour, they did what 
 they could to hinder his cure: for they intimated that if Christ cured 
 him now on the sabbath day, they would accuse him as a <I>Sabbath 
 breaker.</I> It had been very unreasonable, if they should have opposed 
 a physician or surgeon in helping any poor body in misery, by ordinary 
 methods; but much more absurd was it to oppose him that cured without 
 any labour, but by a word's speaking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ dealt very fairly with the spectators, and dealt with them 
 <I>first,</I> if possible to <I>prevent</I> the offence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He laboured to convince their judgment. He bade the man <I>stand 
 forth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that by the sight of him they might be moved with compassion toward 
 him, and might not, for shame, account his cure a crime. And then he 
 appeals to their own consciences; though the thing <I>speaks 
 itself,</I> yet <I>he</I> is pleased to <I>speak</I> it; "<I>Is it 
 lawful to do good on the sabbath days,</I> as I design to do, <I>or to 
 do evil,</I> as you design to do? Whether is better, to <I>save 
 life</I> or to <I>kill?</I>" What fairer question could be put? And
 yet, because they saw it would turn against them, <I>they held their 
 peace.</I> Note, Those are obstinate indeed in their infidelity, who, 
 when they can say nothing <I>against</I> a truth, will say nothing 
 <I>to it;</I> and, when they cannot <I>resist,</I> yet will not 
 <I>yield.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) When they rebelled against the light, he <I>lamented their 
 stubbornness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 <I>He looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the 
 hardness of their hearts.</I> The <I>sin</I> he had an eye to, was, the 
 <I>hardness of their hearts,</I> their insensibleness of the evidence 
 of his miracles, and their inflexible resolution to persist in 
 unbelief. We hear what is said amiss, and see what is done amiss; but 
 Christ looks at the <I>root of bitterness</I> in the heart, the 
 blindness and hardness of <I>that.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] How he was <I>provoked</I> by the sin; he looked <I>round upon
 them;</I> for they were so many, and had so placed themselves, that 
 they surrounded him: and he looked <I>with anger;</I> his anger, it is 
 probable, appeared in his countenance; his anger was, like God's, 
 without the least <I>perturbation</I> to himself, but not without great 
 <I>provocation</I> from us. Note, The sin of sinners is very 
 displeasing to Jesus Christ; and the way to be angry, and not to sin, 
 is it be angry, as Christ was, at nothing but sin. Let hard-hearted 
 sinners tremble to think of the anger with which he will <I>look 
 round</I> upon them shortly, when the <I>great day of his wrath 
 comes.</I> 

 [2.] How he <I>pitied</I> the sinners; he was <I>grieved for the
 hardness of their hearts;</I> as God was grieved forty years for the 
 hardness of the hearts of their fathers in the wilderness. Note, It is 
 a great grief to our Lord Jesus, to see sinners bent upon their own 
 ruin, and obstinately set against the methods of their conviction and 
 recovery, for he would not that any should perish. This is a good 
 reason why the hardness of our own hearts and of the hearts of others, 
 should be a grief to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Christ dealt very kindly with the patient; he bade him <I>stretch 
 forth his hand,</I> and it was immediately <I>restored.</I> Now, 

 (1.) Christ has hereby taught us to go on with resolution in the way of 
 our duty, how violent soever the opposition is, that we meet with in 
 it. We must deny ourselves sometimes in our ease, pleasure, and 
 convenience, rather than give offence even to those who causelessly 
 take it; but we must not deny ourselves the satisfaction of serving 
 God, and doing good, though offence may unjustly be taken at it. None 
 could be more tender of giving offence than Christ; yet, rather than 
 send this poor man away uncured, he would venture offending all the 
 scribes and Pharisees that compassed him about. 

 (2.) He hath hereby given us a <I>specimen</I> of the cures wrought by 
 his grace upon <I>poor souls;</I> our hands are spiritually 
 <I>withered,</I> the powers of our souls weakened by sin, and disabled 
 for that which is good. The great healing day is the <I>sabbath,</I> 
 and the healing place the <I>synagogue;</I> the healing power is that 
 of Christ. The gospel command is like this recorded here; and the 
 command is rational and just; though our hands are withered, and we 
 cannot of ourselves <I>stretch them forth,</I> we must attempt it, 
 must, as well as we can, <I>lift them up</I> to God in prayer, <I>lay 
 hold</I> on Christ and eternal life, and employ them in good works; and 
 if we do our endeavour, power goes along with the word of Christ, he 
 effects the cure. Though our hands be <I>withered,</I> yet, if we will 
 not offer to <I>stretch them out,</I> it is our own fault that we are 
 not healed; but if we do, and are healed, Christ and his power and 
 grace must have all the glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The enemies of Christ dealt very barbarously with him. Such a work 
 of <I>mercy</I> should have engaged their love <I>to him,</I> and such 
 a work of <I>wonder</I> their faith <I>in him.</I> But, instead of 
 that, the Pharisees, who pretended to be oracles in the church, and the 
 Herodians, who pretended to be the supporters of the state, though of 
 opposite interests one to another, <I>took counsel together against 
 him, how they might destroy him.</I> Note, They that suffer for doing 
 good, do but suffer as their Master did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When he withdrew <I>to the sea,</I> he did good there. While his 
 enemies sought to <I>destroy him,</I> he quitted the place; to teach us 
 in troublous times to shift for our own safety; but see here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he was followed into his retirement. When some had such an 
 enmity to him, that they drove him out of their country, others had 
 such a value for him, that they followed him wherever he went; and the 
 enmity of their leaders to Christ did not cool their respect to him. 
 <I>Great multitudes</I> followed him from all parts of the nation; as 
 far north, as <I>from Galilee;</I> as far south, as from Judea and 
 Jerusalem; nay, and from Idumea; as far east, as from beyond Jordan; 
 and west, as from about Tyre and Sidon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) What induced them to follow him; it was the report they heard of
 the <I>great things he did</I> for all that applied themselves to him; 
 some wished <I>to see</I> one that had done such <I>great things,</I> 
 and others hoped he would do great things <I>for them.</I> Note, The 
 consideration of the <I>great things</I> Christ has done, should engage 
 us to <I>come to him.</I> 

 (2.) What they followed him for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 They <I>pressed upon him, to touch him, as many as had plagues.</I> 
 Diseases are here called <I>plagues,</I> 
 <B><I>mastigas</I></B>--<I>corrections, chastisements;</I> so they are 
 designed to be, to make us <I>smart</I> for our sins, that thereby we 
 may be made <I>sorry</I> for them, and may be warned not to return to 
 them. Those that were under these <I>scourgings</I> came to Jesus; this 
 is the errand on which sickness is sent, to quicken us to enquire after 
 Christ, and apply ourselves to him as our Physician. They <I>pressed 
 upon him,</I> each striving which should get <I>nearest to</I> him, and 
 which should be <I>first served.</I> They <I>fell down before him</I> 
 (so Dr. Hammond), as petitioners for his favour; they desired leave but 
 to <I>touch him,</I> having faith to be healed, not only by <I>his</I> 
 touching <I>them,</I> but by <I>their</I> touching him; which no doubt 
 they had many instances of. 

 (3.) What provision he made to be ready to attend them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 He <I>spoke to his disciples,</I> who were fishermen, and had 
 fisher-boats at command, that a <I>small ship should</I> constantly 
 <I>wait on him,</I> to carry him from place to place on the same coast; 
 that, when he had despatched the necessary business he had to do in one 
 place, he might easily remove to another, where his presence was 
 requisite, without pressing through the crowds of people that followed 
 him for curiosity. Wise men, as much as they can, decline a crowd.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What abundance of good he did in his retirement. He did not withdraw 
 to be idle, nor did he send back those who rudely crowded after him 
 when he withdrew, but took it kindly, and gave them what they came for; 
 for he never said to any that sought him diligently, <I>Seek ye me in 
 vain.</I> 

 (1.) Diseases were effectually cured; He <I>healed many;</I> divers 
 sorts of patients, ill of divers sorts of diseases; though numerous, 
 though various, he <I>healed them.</I> 

 (2.) <I>Devils</I> were effectually <I>conquered;</I> those whom 
 unclean spirits had got possession of, <I>when they saw him,</I> 
 trembled at his presence, and they also <I>fell down before him,</I> 
 not to supplicate his favour, but to deprecate his wrath, and by their 
 own terrors were compelled to own that <I>he was the Son of God,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It is sad that this great truth should be denied by any of the children
 of men, who may have the benefit of it, when a confession of it has so 
 often been extorted from devils, who are excluded from having benefit 
 by it.

 (3.) Christ sought not applause to himself in doing those great things,
 for <I>he strictly charged</I> those for whom he did them, <I>that they 
 should not make him known</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 that they should not be <I>industrious</I> to spread the notice of his 
 cures, as it were by advertisements in the newspapers, but let them 
 leave <I>his own works to praise him,</I> and let the report of them 
 <I>diffuse itself,</I> and make its own way. Let not those that are 
 cured, be forward to divulge it, lest it should feed their pride who 
 are so <I>highly favoured;</I> but let the <I>standers-by</I> carry 
 away the intelligence of it. When we do that which is 
 <I>praiseworthy,</I> and yet covet not to be <I>praised of men</I> for 
 it, then <I>the same mind is in us,</I> which was <I>in Christ 
 Jesus.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth <I>unto him</I> whom
 he would: and they came unto him.
 &nbsp; 14  And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and
 that he might send them forth to preach,
 &nbsp; 15  And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out
 devils:
 &nbsp; 16  And Simon he surnamed Peter;
 &nbsp; 17  And James the <I>son</I> of Zebedee, and John the brother of
 James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of
 thunder:
 &nbsp; 18  And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and
 Thomas, and James the <I>son</I> of Alph&aelig;us, and Thadd&aelig;us, and Simon
 the Canaanite,
 &nbsp; 19  And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went
 into a house.
 &nbsp; 20  And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could
 not so much as eat bread.
 &nbsp; 21  And when his friends heard <I>of it,</I> they went out to lay
 hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The choice Christ made of the <I>twelve apostles</I> to be his 
 constant followers and attendants, and to be sent abroad as there was 
 occasion, to preach the gospel. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The introduction to this <I>call</I> or <I>promotion</I> of 
 disciples; He <I>goes up into a mountain,</I> and his errand thither 
 was <I>to pray.</I> Ministers must be set apart with solemn prayer for 
 the pouring out of the Spirit upon them; though Christ had authority to 
 confer the gifts of the Holy Ghost, yet, to set us an example, he 
 prayed for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The rule he went by in his choice, and that was his own good 
 pleasure; <I>He called unto him whom he would.</I> Not such as we 
 should have thought <I>fittest to be called, looking upon the 
 countenance, and the height of the stature;</I> but such as he 
 <I>thought fit</I> to call, and determined to <I>make fit</I> for the 
 service to which he called them: <I>even so,</I> blessed Jesus, 
 <I>because it seemed good in thine eyes.</I> Christ calls <I>whom he 
 will;</I> for he is a free Agent, and his grace is his own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The efficacy of the call; He <I>called them</I> to separate 
 themselves from the crowd, and stand by him, and they <I>came unto 
 him.</I> Christ calls those who were <I>given him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:6">John xvii. 6</A>);

 and <I>all that the Father gave him, shall come to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:37">John vi. 37</A>.
 
 Those whom it was his <I>will</I> to call, he made <I>willing to 
 come;</I> his <I>people shall be willing in the day of his power.</I> 
 Perhaps they came to him readily enough, because they were in 
 expectation of <I>reigning with him</I> in temporal pomp and power; but 
 when afterward they were <I>undeceived</I> in that matter, yet they had 
 such a prospect given them of better things, that they would not say 
 they were <I>deceived</I> in their Master, nor repented their leaving 
 all to be with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The end and intention of this call; He <I>ordained them</I> 
 (probably by the imposition of hands, which was a ceremony used among 
 the Jews), <I>that they should be with him</I> constantly, to be 
 witnesses of <I>his doctrine, manner of life, and patience,</I> that 
 they might <I>fully know it,</I> and be able to give an account of it; 
 and especially that they might attest the truth of his miracles; they 
 must be <I>with him</I> to receive instructions <I>from him,</I> that 
 they might be qualified to give instructions <I>to others.</I> It would 
 <I>require time</I> to fit them for that which he designed them for; 
 for they must be <I>sent forth to preach;</I> not to preach till they 
 were <I>sent,</I> and not to be <I>sent</I> till by a long and intimate 
 acquaintance with Christ they were fitted. Note, Christ's ministers 
 must be much <I>with him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The power he gave them to work miracles; and hereby he put a very 
 great honour upon them, beyond that of the great men of the earth. He 
 ordained them to <I>heal sicknesses and to cast out devils.</I> This 
 showed that the power which Christ had to work these miracles was an 
 <I>original</I> power; that he had it not <I>as a Servant,</I> but 
 <I>as a Son in his own house,</I> in that he could confer it upon 
 others, and invest them with it: they have a rule in the law, 
 <I>Deputatus non potest deputare--He that is only deputed himself,
 cannot depute another;</I> but our Lord Jesus had <I>life in 
 himself,</I> and the Spirit without measure; for he could give this 
 power even to the <I>weak</I> and <I>foolish things</I> of the 
 world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Their number and names; He <I>ordained twelve,</I> according to the 
 number of the twelve tribes of Israel. They are here named not just in 
 the same order as they were in Matthew, nor by couples, as they were 
 there; but as there, so here, Peter is put first and Judas last. Here 
 Matthew is put before Thomas, probably being called in that order; but 
 in that catalogue which Matthew himself drew up, he puts himself after 
 Thomas; so far was he from insisting upon the precedency of his 
 consecration. But that which Mark only takes notice of in this list of 
 the apostles, is, that Christ called James and John <I>Boanerges,</I> 
 which is, <I>The sons of thunder;</I> perhaps they were remarkable for 
 a loud commanding voice, they were thundering preachers; or, rather, it 
 denotes the zeal and fervency of their spirits, which would make them 
 active for God above their brethren. These two (saith Dr. Hammond) were 
 to be special eminent ministers of the gospel, which is called <I>a 
 voice shaking the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:26">Heb. xii. 26</A>.

 Yet John, one of those <I>sons of thunder,</I> was full of love and
 tenderness, as appears by his epistles, and was the beloved 
 disciple.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. Their retirement with their Master, and close adherence to him; 
 <I>They went into a house.</I> Now that this jury was impanelled, they 
 <I>stood together, to hearken to their evidence.</I> They went together 
 into the house, to settle the orders of their infant college; and now, 
 it is likely, the bag was given to Judas, which pleased him, and made 
 him easy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The continual crowds that attended Christ's motions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 The <I>multitude cometh together again,</I> unsent for, and 
 unseasonably pressing upon him, some with one errand and some with 
 another; so that he and his disciples could not get time <I>so much as 
 to eat bread,</I> much less for a set and full meal. Yet he did not 
 shut his doors against the petitioners, but bade them welcome, and gave 
 to each of them <I>an answer of peace.</I> Note, They whose hearts are 
 enlarged in the work of God, can easily bear with great inconveniences 
 to themselves, in the prosecution of it, and will rather lose a meal's 
 meat at any time than slip an opportunity of doing good. It is happy 
 when zealous <I>hearers</I> and zealous <I>preachers</I> thus 
 <I>meet,</I> and encourage one another. Now the <I>kingdom of God was 
 preached,</I> and men pressed into it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:16">Luke xvi. 16</A>.

 This was a gale of opportunity worth improving; and the disciples might
 well afford to adjourn their meals, to lay hold on it. It is good 
 striking while the iron is hot.</P>

 III. The care of his relations concerning him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 <I>When his friends</I> in Capernaum heard how he was followed, and 
 what pains he took, they <I>went out, to lay hold on him,</I> and fetch 
 him home, for they said, <I>He is beside himself.</I> 

 1. Some understand it of an absurd preposterous care, which had more
 in it of reproach to him than of respect; and so we must take it as we 
 read it, <I>He is beside himself;</I> either they suspected it 
 themselves, or it was suggested to them, and they gave credit to the 
 suggestion, that he was <I>gone distracted,</I> and therefore his 
 friends ought to bind him, and put him in a dark room, to bring him to 
 his right mind again. His kindred, many of them, had mean thoughts of
 him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:5">John vii. 5</A>),

 and were willing to hearken to this ill construction which some put 
 upon his great zeal, and to conclude him crazed in his intellects, and 
 under that pretence to take him off from his work. The prophets were 
 called <I>mad fellows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:11">2 Kings ix. 11</A>.

 2. Others understand it of a <I>well-meaning</I> care; and then they
 read <B><I>exeste</I></B>--"<I>He fainteth,</I> he has no time to 
 <I>eat bread,</I> and therefore his strength will fail him; he will be 
 stifled with the crowd of people, and will have his spirits quite 
 exhausted with constant speaking, and the virtue that <I>goes out of 
 him</I> in his miracles; and therefore let us use a friendly violence 
 with him, and get him a little <I>breathing-time.</I>" In his 
 preaching-work, as well as his suffering-work, he was attacked with, 
 <I>Master, spare thyself.</I> Note, They who go on with vigour and zeal 
 in the work of God, must expect to meet with hindrances, both from the 
 groundless disaffection of their enemies, and the mistaken affections 
 of their friends, and they have need to stand upon their guard against 
 both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
 Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.
 &nbsp; 23  And he called them <I>unto him,</I> and said unto them in
 parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
 &nbsp; 24  And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom
 cannot stand.
 &nbsp; 25  And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot
 stand.
 &nbsp; 26  And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he
 cannot stand, but hath an end.
 &nbsp; 27  No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his
 goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will
 spoil his house.
 &nbsp; 28  Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the
 sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall
 blaspheme:
 &nbsp; 29  But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath
 never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:
 &nbsp; 30  Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is, The impudent impious brand which the scribes fastened upon 
 Christ's casting out devils, that they might evade and invalidate the 
 conviction of it, and have a poor excuse for not yielding to it. These 
 <I>scribes came down from Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 It should seem they came this long journey on purpose to hinder the
 progress of the doctrine of Christ; such pains did they take to do 
 mischief; and, coming from Jerusalem, where were the most polite and 
 learned scribes, and where they had opportunity of <I>consulting</I> 
 together <I>against the Lord and his Anointed,</I> they were in the 
 greater capacity to do mischief; the reputation of scribes from 
 Jerusalem would have an influence not only upon the <I>country 
 people,</I> but upon the <I>country scribes;</I> they had never thought 
 of this base suggestion concerning Christ's miracles till the 
 <I>scribes from</I> Jerusalem put it into their heads. They could not 
 deny but that he cast out devils, which plainly bespoke him sent of 
 God; but they insinuated that <I>he had Beelzebub</I> on his side, was 
 in league with him, and by <I>the prince of the devils cast out 
 devils.</I> There is a trick in the case; Satan is not <I>cast out,</I> 
 he only <I>goes out</I> by consent. There was nothing in the manner of 
 Christ's <I>casting out devils,</I> that gave any cause to suspect 
 this; he did it <I>as one having authority;</I> but so they will have 
 it, who resolve not to believe him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The rational answer which Christ gave to this objection, 
 demonstrating the absurdity of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Satan is so <I>subtle,</I> that he will never voluntarily quit his 
 possession; <I>If Satan cast out Satan, his kingdom is divided against 
 itself,</I> and it <I>cannot stand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:23-26"><I>v.</I> 23-26</A>.

 He <I>called them to him,</I> as one desirous they should be convinced;
 he treated them with all the freedom, friendliness, and familiarity 
 that could be; he vouchsafed to reason the case with them, <I>that 
 every mouth may be stopped.</I> It was plain that the doctrine of 
 Christ <I>made war</I> upon the devil's kingdom, and had a direct 
 tendency to break his power, and crush his interest in the souls of 
 men; and it was as plain that the casting of him out of the bodies of 
 people confirmed that doctrine, and gave it the setting on; and 
 therefore it cannot be imagined that he should come into such a design; 
 every one knows that Satan is no <I>fool,</I> nor will act so directly 
 against his own interest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ is so <I>wise,</I> that, being engaged in war with him, he 
 will attack his forces wherever he meets them, whether in the bodies or 
 souls of people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 It is plain, Christ's design is to <I>enter into the strong man's
 house,</I> to take possession of the interest he has in the world, and 
 to <I>spoil his goods,</I> and convert them to his own service; and 
 therefore it is natural to suppose that he will thus <I>bind the strong 
 man,</I> will forbid him to <I>speak</I> when he would, and to 
 <I>stay</I> where he would, and thus show that he has gained a victory 
 over him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The awful warning Christ gave them to take heed how they spoke 
 such dangerous words as these; however they might make light of them, 
 as only conjectures, and the language of <I>free-thinking,</I> if they 
 persisted in it, it would be of fatal consequence to them; it would be 
 found a sin against the last remedy, and consequently 
 <I>unpardonable;</I> for what could be imagined possible to bring 
 <I>them</I> to repentance for their sin in blaspheming Christ, who 
 would set aside such a <I>strong</I> conviction with such a <I>weak</I> 
 evasion? It is true, the gospel <I>promiseth,</I> because Christ hath 
 <I>purchased,</I> forgiveness for the greatest sins and sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.
 
 Many of those who reviled Christ on the cross (which was a
 <I>blaspheming of the Son of man,</I> aggravated to the highest 
 degree), found mercy, and Christ himself prayed, <I>Father, forgive 
 them;</I> but this was <I>blaspheming the Holy Ghost,</I> for it was by 
 the Holy Spirit that he <I>cast out</I> devils, and they said, It was 
 <I>by the unclean spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 By this method they would outface the conviction of all the gifts of
 the Holy Ghost after Christ's ascension, and defeat them all, after 
 which there remained no more proof, and therefore they should <I>never 
 have forgiveness,</I> but were <I>liable to eternal damnation.</I> They 
 were in imminent danger of that everlasting punishment, from which 
 there was <I>no redemption,</I> and in which there was no 
 <I>intermission,</I> no <I>remission.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing
 without, sent unto him, calling him.
 &nbsp; 32  And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him,
 Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
 &nbsp; 33  And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my
 brethren?
 &nbsp; 34  And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and
 said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
 &nbsp; 35  For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my
 brother, and my sister, and mother.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The <I>disrespect</I> which Christ's <I>kindred, according to the
 flesh,</I> showed to him, when he was preaching (and they knew very 
 well that he was then in his element); they not only <I>stood 
 without,</I> having no desire to come in, and hear him, but they sent 
 in a message to <I>call him out to them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>),

 as if he must leave his work, to hearken to their <I>impertinences;</I> 
 it is probable that they had <I>no business with him,</I> only sent for 
 him on purpose to oblige him to <I>break off,</I> lest he should 
 <I>kill himself.</I> He knew how far his strength would go, and 
 preferred the salvation of souls before his own life, and soon after 
 made it to appear with a witness; it was therefore an <I>idle thing</I> 
 for them, under pretence of his sparing himself, to interrupt him; and 
 it was worse, if really they had business with him, when they knew he 
 preferred his business, as a Saviour, so much before any other 
 business.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The <I>respect</I> which Christ showed to his spiritual kindred upon 
 this occasion. Now, as at other times, he put a <I>comparative 
 neglect</I> upon his mother, which seemed purposely designed to obviate 
 the prevent the extravagant respect which men in aftertimes would be 
 apt to pay her. <I>Our</I> respect ought to be guided and governed by 
 Christ's; now the virgin Mary, or Christ's mother, is not equalled 
 with, but postponed to, ordinary believers, on whom Christ here puts a 
 <I>superlative</I> honour. He looked upon those that <I>at about</I> 
 him, and pronounced those of them that not only heard, but did, the
 will of God, to be to him as <I>his brother, and sister, and 
 mother;</I> as much esteemed, loved, and cared for, as his nearest 
 relations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:33-35"><I>v.</I> 33-35</A>.

 This is a good reason why we should <I>honour those that fear the
 Lord,</I> and choose them for our people; why we should be not hearers 
 of the word only, but doers of the work, that we may share with the 
 saints in this honour, Surely it is good to be akin to those who are 
 thus nearly allied to Christ, and to have fellowship with those that 
 have fellowship with Christ; and woe to those that hate and persecute 
 Christ's kindred, that are <I>his bone and his flesh,</I> every one 
 <I>resembling the children of a king</I> (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:18,19">Judg. viii. 18, 19</A>);

 for he will with jealously plead their cause, and avenge their 
 blood.</P>
