 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them
 power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.
 &nbsp; 2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal
 the sick.
 &nbsp; 3 And he said unto them, Take nothing for <I>your</I> journey,
 neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither
 have two coats apiece.
 &nbsp; 4 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence
 depart.
 &nbsp; 5 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that
 city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony
 against them.
 &nbsp; 6 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the
 gospel, and healing every where.
 &nbsp; 7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and
 he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was
 risen from the dead;
 &nbsp; 8 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one
 of the old prophets was risen again.
 &nbsp; 9 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of
 whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 

 I. The method Christ took to spread his gospel, to diffuse and enforce 
 the light of it. He had <I>himself</I> travelled about, preaching and 
 healing; but he could be only in one place at a time, and therefore now 
 he <I>sent</I> his twelve disciples abroad, who by this time were 
 pretty well instructed in the nature of the present dispensation, and 
 able to instruct others and <I>deliver to them</I> what they had 
 <I>received from the Lord.</I> Let them disperse themselves, some one 
 way and some another, to <I>preach the kingdom of God,</I> as it was 
 now about to be set up by the Messiah, to make people acquainted with 
 the spiritual nature and tendency of it, and to persuade them to come 
 into the interests and measures of it. For the confirming of their 
 doctrine, because it was new and surprising, and very different from 
 what they had been taught by the scribes and Pharisees, and because so 
 much depended upon men's receiving, or not receiving it, he empowered 
 them to work miracles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 He <I>gave them authority over all devils,</I> to dispossess them, and 
 cast them out, though ever so numerous, so subtle, so fierce, so 
 obstinate. Christ designed a total rout and ruin to the kingdom of
 darkness, and therefore gave them power over <I>all</I> devils. He 
 authorized and appointed them likewise to <I>cure disease,</I> and to 
 <I>heal the sick,</I> which would make them welcome wherever they came, 
 and not only convince people's judgments, but gain their affections. 
 This was their commission. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What Christ directed them to do, in prosecution of this commission 
 at this time, when they were not to <I>go far</I> or be <I>out 
 long.</I> 

 (1.) They must not be solicitous to recommend themselves to people's 
 esteem by their outward appearance. Now that they begin to set up for 
 themselves, they must have no dress, nor study to make any other figure 
 than what they made while they followed him: they must <I>go as they 
 were,</I> and not change their clothes, or so much as put on a pair of 
 new shoes.

 (2.) They must depend upon Providence, and the kindness of their 
 friends, to furnish them with what was convenient for them. They must 
 not take with them <I>either bread or money,</I> and yet believe they 
 should not want. Christ would not have his disciples <I>shy</I> of 
 receiving the kindnesses of their friends, but rather to <I>expect</I> 
 them. Yet St. Paul saw cause not to go by this rule, when he 
 <I>laboured with his hands</I> rather than be burdensome. 

 (3.) They must not change their lodgings, as suspecting that those who 
 entertained them were <I>weary</I> of them; they have no reason to be 
 so, for the ark is a guest that always pays well for its entertainment: 
 "<I>Whatsoever house ye enter into there abide</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that people may know where to find you, that your friends may know you 
 are not backward to <I>serve</I> them, and your enemies may know you 
 are not ashamed nor afraid to <I>face</I> them; <I>there abide</I> till 
 you <I>depart</I> out of that city; stay with those you are used to." 
 
 (4.) They must put on authority, and speak <I>warning</I> to those who 
 <I>refused</I> them as well as comfort to those that <I>received</I> 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 "If there be any place that will not entertain you, if the magistrates 
 deny you admission and threaten to treat you as vagrants, leave them, 
 do not force yourselves upon them, nor run yourselves into danger among 
 them, but at the same time bind them over to the judgment of God for 
 it; <I>shake off the dust of your feet</I> for a <I>testimony against 
 them.</I>" This will, as it were, be produced in evidence against them, 
 that the messengers of the gospel had been among them, to make them a 
 fair offer of grace and peace, for this dust they left behind there; so 
 that when they perish at last in their infidelity this will lay and 
 leave their blood upon their own heads. <I>Shake off the dust of your 
 feet,</I> as much as to say you abandon their city, and will have no 
 more to do with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What they did, in prosecution of this commission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>They departed</I> from their Master's presence; yet, having still 
 his spiritual presence with them, his <I>eye</I> and his <I>arm</I> 
 going along with them, and, thus borne up in their work, they <I>went 
 through the towns,</I> some or other of them, all the towns within the 
 circuit appointed them, <I>preaching the gospel, and healing every 
 where.</I> Their work was the same with their Master's, doing good both 
 to souls and bodies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have here Herod's perplexity and vexation at this. The 
 communicating of Christ's power to those who were sent forth in his 
 name, and acted by authority from him, was an <I>amazing</I> and 
 <I>convincing</I> proof of his being the Messiah, above any thing else; 
 that he could not only work miracles <I>himself,</I> but empower others 
 to work miracles too, this spread his fame more than any thing, and 
 made the rays of this <I>Sun of righteousness</I> the stronger by the 
 <I>reflection</I> of them even from <I>the earth,</I> from such mean 
 illiterate men as the apostles were, who had nothing else to recommend 
 them, or to raise any expectations from them, but that <I>they had been 
 with Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:13">Acts iv. 13</A>.

 When the country sees such as these <I>healing the sick</I> in the name
 of Jesus it gives it an alarm. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The <I>various speculations</I> it <I>raised</I> among the 
 <I>people,</I> who, though they thought not <I>rightly,</I> yet could 
 not but think <I>honourably,</I> of our Lord Jesus, and that he was an 
 extraordinary person, one come from the other world; that either John 
 Baptist, who was lately persecuted and slain for the cause of God, or 
 <I>one of the old prophets,</I> that had been persecuted and slain long 
 since in that cause, was <I>risen again,</I> to be recompensed for his 
 sufferings by this honour put upon him; or that Elias, who was taken 
 alive to heaven in a fiery chariot, <I>had appeared</I> as an express 
 from heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The <I>great perplexity</I> it <I>created</I> in the mind of Herod: 
 <I>When he had heard of all that was done</I> by Christ, his guilty 
 conscience flew in his face, and he was ready to conclude with them 
 that <I>John was risen from the dead.</I> He thought he had got clear 
 of John, and should never be troubled with him any more, but, it seems, 
 he is mistaken; either John is come to life again or here is another in 
 his spirit and power, for God will never <I>leave himself without 
 witness.</I> "What shall I do now?" saith Herod. "John <I>have I 
 beheaded, but who is this?</I> Is he carrying on John's work, or is he 
 come to avenge John's death? John baptized, but he does not; <I>John 
 did no miracle,</I> but he does, and therefore appears more formidable 
 than John." Note, Those who oppose God will find themselves more and 
 more <I>embarrassed.</I> However, he <I>desired to see him,</I> whether 
 he resembled John or no; but he might soon have been put out of this 
 pain if he would but have informed himself of that which thousands 
 knew, that Jesus preached, and wrought miracles, a great while before 
 John was beheaded, and therefore could not be John raised from the 
 dead. He <I>desired to see him;</I> and why did he not go and see him? 
 Probably, because he thought it <I>below him</I> either to go to him or 
 to send for him; he had enough of John Baptist, and cared not for 
 having to do with any more such reprovers of sin. He desired to see 
 him, but we do not find that ever he did, till he saw him at his bar, 
 and then <I>he and his men of war set him at nought,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:11">Luke xxiii. 11</A>.

 Had he prosecuted his convictions now, and gone to see him, who knows
 but a happy change might have ben wrought in him? But, delaying it now, 
 his heart was hardened, and when he did see him he was as much 
 prejudiced against him as any other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that
 they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a
 desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
 &nbsp; 11 And the people, when they knew <I>it,</I> followed him: and he
 received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and
 healed them that had need of healing.
 &nbsp; 12 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve,
 and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into
 the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals:
 for we are here in a desert place.
 &nbsp; 13 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said,
 We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should
 go and buy meat for all this people.
 &nbsp; 14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his
 disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.
 &nbsp; 15 And they did so, and made them all sit down.
 &nbsp; 16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking
 up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the
 disciples to set before the multitude.
 &nbsp; 17 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken
 up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 

 I. The account which the twelve gave their Master of the success of 
 their ministry. They were not long out; but, <I>when they returned, 
 they told him all that they had done,</I> as became servants who were 
 sent on an errand. They told him <I> what they had done,</I> that, if 
 they had done any thing amiss, they might mend it next time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their <I>retirement,</I> for a little <I>breathing:</I> He <I>took 
 them, and went aside privately into a desert place,</I> that they might 
 have some relaxation from business and not be always upon the stretch. 
 Note, He that hath appointed our man-servant and maid-servant to rest 
 would have his servants to rest too. Those in the most public stations, 
 and that are most publicly useful, must sometimes go aside privately, 
 both for the repose of their bodies, to recruit them, and for the 
 furnishing of their minds by meditation for further public work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The <I>resort</I> of the people to him, and the kind 
 <I>reception</I> he gave them. They <I>followed</I> him, though it was 
 into a <I>desert place;</I> for that is no desert where Christ is. And, 
 though they hereby disturbed the repose he designed here for himself 
 and his disciples, yet he <I>welcomed</I> them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Note, Pious zeal may excuse a little rudeness; it did with Christ, and 
 should with us. Though they came unseasonably, yet Christ gave them
 what they came for.

 1. He <I>spoke unto them of the kingdom of God,</I> the laws of that
 kingdom with which they must be bound, and the privileges of that 
 kingdom with which they might be blessed. 

 2. He <I>healed them that had need of healing,</I> and, in a sense of
 their need, made their application to him. Though the disease was ever 
 so inveterate, and incurable by the physicians, though the patients 
 were ever so poor and mean, yet Christ <I>healed them.</I> There is 
 healing in Christ for all that <I>need</I> it, whether for soul or 
 body. Christ hath still a power over bodily diseases, and heals his
 people that <I>need healing.</I> Sometimes he sees that we need the 
 <I>sickness</I> for the good of our souls, more than the <I>healing</I> 
 for the ease of our bodies, and then we must be willing <I>for a 
 season,</I> because <I>there is need,</I> to be in <I>heaviness;</I> 
 but, when he sees that we <I>need healing,</I> we shall have it. Death 
 is his servant, to heal the saints of <I>all diseases.</I> He heals 
 spiritual maladies by his graces, by his comforts, and has for each 
 what the case calls for; relief for every exigence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The plentiful provision Christ made for the multitude that attended 
 him. With <I>five loaves</I> of bread, and <I>two fishes,</I> he fed 
 <I>five thousand men.</I> This narrative we had twice before, and shall 
 meet with it again; it is the only miracle of our Saviour's that is 
 recorded by all the four evangelists. Let us only observe out of it, 

 1. Those who diligently attend upon Christ in the way of duty, and
 therein deny or expose themselves, or are made to forget themselves and 
 their outward conveniences by their zeal for God's house, are taken 
 under his particular care, and may depend upon <I>Jehovah-jireh--The 
 Lord will provide.</I> He will not see those that fear him, and serve 
 him faithfully, want any good thing. 

 2. Our Lord Jesus was of a free and generous spirit. His disciples
 said, <I>Send them away, that they may get victuals;</I> but Christ 
 said, "No, <I>give ye them to eat;</I> let what we have go as far as it 
 will reach, and they are welcome to it." Thus he has taught both 
 ministers and Christians to <I>use hospitality without grudging,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:9">1 Pet. iv. 9</A>.

 Those that have but a little, let them do what they can with that
 little, and that is the way to make it more. <I>There is that
 scatters, and yet increases.</I>

 3. Jesus Christ has not only physic, but food, for all those that by
 faith apply themselves to him; he not only <I>heals them that need 
 healing,</I> cures the diseases of the soul, but feeds them too that 
 need feeding, supports the spiritual life, relieves the necessities of 
 it, and satisfies the desires of it. Christ has provided not only to
 save the soul from perishing by its diseases, but to nourish the soul 
 unto life eternal, and strengthen it for all spiritual exercises. 

 4. All the gifts of Christ are to be received by the church in a
 regular orderly manner; <I>Make them sit down by fifties in a 
 company,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Notice is here taken of the number of each company which Christ
 appointed for the better distribution of the meat and the easier 
 computation of the number of the guests. 

 5. When we are receiving our creature-comforts, we must <I>look up to
 heaven.</I> Christ did so, to teach us to do so. We must acknowledge
 that we receive them from God, and that we are unworthy to receive 
 them,--that we owe them all, and all the comfort we have in them, to 
 the mediation of Christ, by whom the curse is removed, and the covenant 
 of peace settled,--that we depend upon God's blessing upon them to make 
 them serviceable to us, and desire that blessing. 

 6. The blessing of Christ will make a little go a great way. The
 <I>little that the righteous man has is better than the riches of many 
 wicked, a dinner of herbs better than a stalled ox.</I> 

 7. Those whom Christ <I>feeds</I> he <I>fills;</I> to whom he gives, he
 gives enough; as there is in him enough for <I>all,</I> so there is 
 enough for <I>each.</I> He replenishes every hungry soul, abundantly 
 satisfies it with the <I>goodness of his house.</I> Here were 
 <I>fragments taken up,</I> to assure us that in our Father's house 
 there is <I>bread enough, and to spare.</I> We are not straitened, or 
 stinted, in him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples
 were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people
 that I am?
 &nbsp; 19 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some <I>say,</I>
 Elias; and others <I>say,</I> that one of the old prophets is risen
 again.
 &nbsp; 20 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter
 answering said, The Christ of God.
 &nbsp; 21 And he straitly charged them, and commanded <I>them</I> to tell
 no man that thing;
 &nbsp; 22 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be
 rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be
 slain, and be raised the third day.
 &nbsp; 23 And he said to <I>them</I> all, If any <I>man</I> will come after me,
 let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
 &nbsp; 24 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but
 whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
 &nbsp; 25 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world,
 and lose himself, or be cast away?
 &nbsp; 26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him
 shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own
 glory, and <I>in his</I> Father's, and of the holy angels.
 &nbsp; 27 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here,
 which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses, we have Christ discoursing with his disciples about 
 the great things that <I>pertained to the kingdom of God;</I> and one 
 circumstance of this discourse is taken notice of here which we had not 
 in the other evangelists-that Christ was <I>alone praying,</I> and his 
 <I>disciples with him,</I> when he entered into this discourse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. Though Christ had much public work to do, yet he found some time to 
 be <I>alone</I> in private, for converse with himself, with his Father, 
 and with his disciples. 

 2. When Christ was alone he was <I>praying.</I> It is good for us to
 improve our solitude for devotion, that, <I>when we are alone,</I> we 
 may <I>not be alone,</I> but may have <I>the Father with us.</I> 

 3. When Christ was alone, praying, his <I>disciples were with him,</I>
 to join with him in his prayer; so that this was a family-prayer.
 Housekeepers ought to pray with their households, parents with their 
 children, masters with their servants, teachers and tutors with their 
 scholars and pupils. 

 4. Christ <I>prayed</I> with them before he <I>examined</I> them, that
 they might be directed and encouraged to answer him, by his prayers for 
 them. Those we give instructions to we should put up prayers for and
 with. He discourses with them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning himself; and enquires,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What <I>the people</I> said of him: <I>Who say the people that I 
 am?</I> Christ knew better than they did, but would have his disciples 
 made sensible, by the mistakes of others concerning him, how happy they 
 were that were led into the knowledge of him and of the truth 
 concerning him. We should take notice of the ignorance and errors of 
 others, that we may be the more thankful to him who has <I>manifested 
 himself to us, and not unto the world,</I> and may <I>pity</I> them, 
 and do what we can to help them and to teach them better. They tell him 
 what conjectures concerning him they had heard in their converse with 
 the common people. Ministers would know better how to suit their 
 instructions, reproofs, and counsels, to the case of ordinary people, 
 if they did but converse more frequently and familiarly with them; they 
 would then be the better able to say what is proper to rectify their 
 notions, correct their irregularities, and remove their prejudices. The 
 more conversant the physician is with his patient, the better he knows 
 what to do for him. Some said that he was John Baptist, who was 
 beheaded but the other day; others Elias, or <I>one of the old 
 prophets;</I> any thing but what he was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What <I>they</I> said of him. "Now see what an advantage you have by 
 your discipleship; you know better." "So we do," saith Peter, "thanks 
 be to our Master for it; we know that thou art <I>the Christ of 
 God,</I> the <I>Anointed</I> of God, the Messiah promised." It is 
 matter of unspeakable comfort to us that our Lord Jesus is <I>God's 
 anointed,</I> for then he has unquestionable authority and ability for 
 his undertaking; for his being <I>anointed</I> signifies his being both 
 appointed to it and qualified for it. Now one would have expected that 
 Christ should have charged his disciples, who were so fully apprized 
 and assured of this truth, to publish it to every one they met with; 
 but no, he <I>strictly charged them to tell no man that thing</I> as 
 yet, because there is a time for all things. After his resurrection, 
 which completed the proof of it, Peter made the temple ring of it, that 
 <I>God had made this same Jesus both Lord and Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:36">Acts ii. 36</A>);
 
 but as yet the evidence was not ready to be summed up, and therefore it 
 must be concealed; while it was so, we may conclude that the belief of 
 it was not necessary to salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning his own <I>sufferings</I> and <I>death,</I> of which he 
 had yet said little. Now that his disciples were well established in 
 the belief of his being the Christ, and able to bear it, he speaks of 
 them expressly, and with great assurance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 It comes in as a reason why they must not yet preach that he was <I>the 
 Christ,</I> because the wonders that would attend his death and 
 resurrection would be the most convincing proof of his being<I> the 
 Christ of God.</I> It was by his <I>exaltation</I> to the <I>right hand 
 of the Father</I> that he was fully declared to be <I>the Christ,</I> 
 and by the sending of the Spirit thereupon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:33">Acts ii. 33</A>);

 and therefore wait till that is done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Concerning their sufferings for him. So far must they be from 
 thinking how to <I>prevent</I> his sufferings that they must rather 
 prepare for their own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must <I>accustom</I> ourselves to all instances of 
 <I>self-denial</I> and <I>patience,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 This is the best preparative for martyrdom. We must live a life of 
 self-denial, mortification, and contempt of the world; we must not 
 indulge our ease and appetite, for then it will be hard to bear toil, 
 and weariness, and want, for Christ. We are <I>daily</I> subject to 
 affliction, and we must <I>accommodate</I> ourselves to it, and 
 <I>acquiesce</I> in the will of God in it, and must learn to endure 
 hardship. We frequently meet with crosses in the way of duty; and, 
 though we must not pull them upon our own heads, yet, when they are 
 laid for us, we must <I>take them up,</I> carry them after Christ, and 
 make the best of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We must <I>prefer the salvation and happiness of our souls</I> 
 before any <I>secular concern</I> whatsoever. Reckon upon it, 

 (1.) That he who to preserve his liberty or estate, his power or 
 preferment, nay, or to save his life, denies Christ and his truths, 
 wilfully wrongs his conscience, and sins against God, will be, not only 
 not a <I>saver,</I> but an unspeakable <I>loser,</I> in the issue, when 
 <I>profit</I> and <I>loss</I> come to be balanced: <I>He that will save 
 his life upon these terms will lose it,</I> will lose that which is of 
 infinitely more value, his precious soul. 

 (2.) We must firmly believe also that, if we lose our life for cleaving 
 to Christ and our religion, we shall <I>save</I> it to our unspeakable 
 advantage; for we shall be abundantly recompensed in the resurrection 
 of the just, when we shall have it again a new and an eternal life. 
 
 (3.) That the gain of all the world, if we should forsake Christ, and 
 fall in with the interests of the world, would be so far from 
 countervailing the eternal loss and ruin of the soul that it would bear 
 no manner of proportion to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 If we could be supposed to gain all the wealth, honour, and pleasure, 
 in the world, by denying Christ, yet when, by <I>so doing,</I> we 
 <I>lose ourselves</I> to all eternity, and are <I>cast away</I> at 
 last, what good will our worldly gain do us? Observe, In Matthew and 
 Mark the dreadful issue is a man's <I>losing his own soul,</I> here it 
 is <I>losing himself,</I> which plainly intimates that <I>our souls</I> 
 are <I>ourselves. Animus cujusque is est quisque--The soul is the 
 man;</I> and it is well or ill with us according as it is well or ill 
 with our souls. If they perish for ever, under the weight of their own 
 guilt and corruption, it is certain that <I>we</I> are undone. The body 
 cannot be happy if the soul be miserable in the other world; but the 
 soul may be happy though the body be greatly afflicted and oppressed in 
 this world. If a man be himself <I>cast away,</I> <B><I>e 
 zemiotheis</I></B>--<I>if he be damaged,</I>--or if he be punished, 
 <I>si mulctetur--if he have a mulct put upon his soul</I> by the 
 righteous sentence of Christ, whose cause and interest he has 
 treacherously deserted,--if it be adjudged a forfeiture of all his 
 blessedness, and the forfeiture be taken, where is his gain? What is 
 his hope?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We must therefore <I>never be ashamed</I> of Christ and his gospel, 
 nor of any disgrace or reproach that we may undergo for our faithful 
 adherence to him and it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 <I>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall 
 the Son of man be ashamed,</I> and justly. When the service and honour 
 of Christ called for his testimony and agency, he denied them, because 
 the interest <I>of Christ</I> was a <I>despised</I> interest, and 
 <I>every where spoken against;</I> and therefore he can expect no other 
 than that in the great day, when his case calls for Christ's appearance 
 on his behalf, Christ will be ashamed to own such a cowardly, worldly, 
 sneaking spirit, and will say, "He is none of mine; he belongs not to 
 me." As Christ had a state of <I>humiliation</I> and of 
 <I>exaltation,</I> so likewise has his cause. They, and they only,
 that are willing to suffer with it when it suffers, shall reign with it 
 when it reigns; but those that cannot find in their hearts to share 
 with it in its <I>disgrace,</I> and to say, <I>If this be to be vile, I 
 will be yet more vile,</I> shall certainly have no share with it in its 
 <I>triumphs.</I> Observe here, How Christ, to support himself and his 
 followers under present disgraces, speaks <I>magnificently</I> of the 
 lustre of his second coming, in prospect of which he <I>endured the 
 cross, despising the shame.</I>

 (1.) He shall come <I>in his own glory.</I> This was not mentioned in 
 Matthew and Mark. He shall come in the glory of the Mediator, <I>all 
 the glory</I> which the Father <I>restored to him,</I> which he had 
 with God before the worlds were, which he had <I>deposited</I> and 
 <I>put in pledge,</I> as it were, for the accomplishing of his 
 undertaking, and demanded again when he had gone through it. <I>Now, O
 Father, glorify thou me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:4,5">John xvii. 4, 5</A>.

 He shall come in <I>all that glory</I> which the Father <I>conferred
 upon him</I> when <I>he set him at his own right hand,</I> and <I>gave 
 him to be head over all things to the church;</I> in all the glory that 
 is due to him as the assertor of the glory of God, and the author of 
 the glory of all the saints. This is <I>his own glory.</I>

 (2.) He shall come <I>in his Father's glory.</I> The Father will judge 
 the world by him, having committed all judgment to him; and therefore 
 will publicly own him in the judgment as the <I>brightness of his 
 glory</I> and the <I>express image</I> of his person. 

 (3.) He shall come in <I>the glory of the holy angels.</I> They shall 
 all <I>attend</I> him, and <I>minister</I> to him, and add every thing 
 they can to the lustre of his appearance. What a figure will the 
 blessed Jesus make in that day! Did we believe it, we should never be 
 ashamed of him or his words now.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> To encourage them in suffering for him, he assures them 
 that <I>the kingdom of God</I> would now <I>shortly be set up,</I> 
 notwithstanding the great opposition that was made to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 
 "Though the second coming of the Son of man is at a great distance, the 
 kingdom of God shall come in its power in the present age, while some 
 here present are alive." They <I>saw the kingdom of God</I> when the 
 Spirit was poured out, when the gospel was preached to all the world 
 and nations were brought to Christ by it; they saw the kingdom of God 
 triumph over the Gentile nations in their <I>conversion,</I> and over 
 the Jewish nation in its <I>destruction.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings,
 he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to
 pray.
 &nbsp; 29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was
 altered, and his raiment <I>was</I> white <I>and</I> glistering.
 &nbsp; 30 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses
 and Elias:
 &nbsp; 31 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he
 should accomplish at Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 32 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep:
 and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men
 that stood with him.
 &nbsp; 33 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said
 unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make
 three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
 Elias: not knowing what he said.
 &nbsp; 34 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed
 them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
 &nbsp; 35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my
 beloved Son: hear him.
 &nbsp; 36 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they
 kept <I>it</I> close, and told no man in those days any of those
 things which they had seen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the narrative of Christ's transfiguration, which was 
 designed for a specimen of that glory of his in which he will come to 
 judge the world, of which he had lately been speaking, and, 
 consequently, an encouragement to his disciples to suffer for him, and 
 never to be ashamed of him. We had this account before in Matthew and 
 Mark, and it is well worthy to be repeated to us, and reconsidered by 
 us, for the <I>confirmation of our faith</I> in the Lord Jesus, as 
 <I>the brightness of his Father's glory</I> and the light of the world, 
 for the <I>filling</I> of our minds with <I>high</I> and 
 <I>honourable</I> thoughts of him, notwithstanding his being clothed 
 with a body, and <I>giving</I> us <I>some idea</I> of the <I>glory</I> 
 which he entered into at his <I>ascension,</I> and in which he now 
 <I>appears</I> within the veil, and for the <I>raising</I> and 
 <I>encouraging</I> of our <I>hopes</I> and <I>expectations</I> 
 concerning the glory reserved for all believers in the future 
 state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is one circumstance of the narrative that seems to differ from 
 the other two evangelists that related it. They said that it was <I>six 
 days</I> after the foregoing sayings; Luke says that it was <I>about 
 eight days after,</I> that is, it was that day sevennight, six whole 
 days intervening, and it was the eighth day. Some think that it was 
 <I>in the night</I> that Christ was transfigured, because the disciples 
 were sleepy, as in his agony, and <I>in the night</I> his appearance in 
 splendour would be the more illustrious; if in the night, the 
 computation of the time would be the more doubtful and uncertain; 
 probably, in the night, between the seventh and eighth day, and so 
 about eight days.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are divers circumstances added and explained, which are very 
 material.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We are <I>here</I> told that Christ had this honour put upon him 
 when he was <I>praying:</I> He <I>went up into a mountain to pray,</I> 
 as he frequently did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 and <I>as he prayed</I> he was <I>transfigured.</I> When Christ 
 <I>humbled</I> himself to pray, he was thus <I>exalted.</I> He knew 
 before that this was designed for him at this time, and therefore seeks 
 it by prayer. Christ himself must <I>sue out</I> the favours that were 
 purposed for him, and promised to him: <I>Ask of me, and I will give 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8">Ps. ii. 8</A>.

 And thus he intended to put an <I>honour</I> upon the duty of prayer,
 and to <I>recommend</I> it to us. It is a transfiguring, transforming 
 duty; if our hearts be elevated and enlarged in it, so as in it to 
 <I>behold the glory of the Lord,</I> we shall be <I>changed into the 
 same image from glory to glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>.

 By prayer we fetch in the wisdom, grace, and joy, which <I>make the
 face to shine.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Luke does not use the word 
 <I>transfigured</I>--<B><I>metamorphothe</I></B> (which Matthew and Mark
 used), perhaps because it had been used so much in the Pagan theology, 
 but makes use of a phrase equivalent, <B><I>to eidos tou prosopou 
 heteron</I></B>--<I>the fashion of his countenance was another thing
 from what it had been:</I> his face shone far beyond what Moses's did 
 when he came down from the mount; and <I>his raiment</I> was <I>white 
 and glistering:</I> it was <B><I>exastrapton</I></B>--<I>bright like
 lightning</I> (a word used only here), so that he seemed to be arrayed 
 all with light, to <I>cover himself with light as with a 
 garment.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It was said in Matthew and Mark that Moses and Elias <I>appeared to 
 them;</I> here it is said that they <I>appeared in glory,</I> to teach 
 us that saints departed are <I>in glory,</I> are in a <I>glorious</I> 
 state; they shine in glory. He being in glory, they <I>appeared with 
 him in glory,</I> as all the saints shall shortly do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. We are here told what was the subject of the discourse between 
 Christ and the two great prophets of the Old Testament: <I>They spoke 
 of his decease, which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</I> 
 <B><I>Elegon ten exodon autou</I></B>--<I>his exodus, his departure;</I>
 that is, <I>his death.</I> 

 (1.) The death of Christ is here called his <I>exit,</I> his <I>going 
 out,</I> his <I>leaving the world.</I> Moses and Elias spoke of it to 
 him under that notion, to reconcile him to it, and to make the 
 foresight of it the more easy to his human nature. The death of the 
 saints is their <I>exodus,</I> their departure out of the Egypt of this 
 world, their release out of a <I>house of bondage.</I> Some think that 
 the ascension of Christ is included here in his departure; for the 
 departure of Israel out of Egypt was a departure in <I>triumph,</I> so 
 was <I>his</I> when he went from earth to heaven.

 (2.) This departure of his he <I>must accomplish;</I> for thus it was 
 determined, the matter was immutably fixed in the counsel of God, and 
 could not be altered. 

 (3.) He must accomplish it at Jerusalem, though his residence was 
 mostly in Galilee; for his most spiteful enemies were at Jerusalem, and 
 there the sanhedrim sat, that took upon them to judge of prophets.
 
 (4.) Moses and Elias spoke of this, to intimate that the 
 <I>sufferings</I> of Christ, and his <I>entrance into his glory,</I> 
 were what Moses and <I>the prophets</I> had <I>spoken of;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:26,27,1Pe+1:11">Luke xxiv. 26, 27; 1 Pet. i. 11</A>.

 (5.) Our Lord Jesus, even in his transfiguration, was willing to enter
 into a discourse concerning his death and sufferings, to teach us that 
 meditations on death, as it is our departure out of this world to 
 another, are never unseasonable, but in a special manner season able 
 when at any time we are <I>advanced,</I> lest we should be <I>lifted up 
 above measure.</I> In our greatest glories on earth, let us remember 
 that here <I>we have no continuing city.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. We are here told, which we were not before, that the disciples were 
 <I>heavy with sleep,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 When the vision first began, Peter, and James, and John were drowsy, 
 and inclined to sleep. Either it was late, or they were weary, or had 
 been disturbed in their rest the night before; or perhaps a charming 
 composing air, or some sweet and melodious sounds, which disposed them 
 to soft and gentle slumbers, were a preface to the vision; or perhaps 
 it was owing to a sinful carelessness: when Christ was at prayer with 
 them, they did not regard his prayer as they should have done, and, to 
 punish them for that, they were left to <I>sleep on now,</I> when he 
 began to be <I>transfigured,</I> and so lost an opportunity of seeing 
 how that work of wonder was wrought. These three were now asleep, when 
 Christ was in <I>his glory,</I> as afterwards they were, when he was in 
 <I>his agony;</I> see the <I>weakness</I> and <I>frailty</I> of human 
 nature, even in the best, and what need they have of the grace of God.
 Nothing could be more affecting to these disciples, one would think, 
 than the <I>glories</I> and the <I>agonies</I> of their Master, and 
 both in the highest degree; and yet neither the one nor the other would 
 serve to <I>keep them awake.</I> What need have we to pray to God for 
 quickening grace, to make us not only <I>alive,</I> but <I>lively!</I> 
 Yet that they might be competent witnesses of <I>this sign from 
 heaven,</I> to those that demanded one, after awhile they <I>recovered 
 themselves,</I> and became perfectly awake; and then they took an exact 
 view of all those glories, so that they were able to give a particular 
 account, as we find one of them does, of all that passed when they were 
 with Christ <I>in the holy mount,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:18">2 Pet. i. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. It is here observed that it was when Moses and Elias were now about 
 to <I>depart</I> that Peter said, <I>Lord, it is good to be here, let 
 us make three tabernacles.</I> Thus we are often not sensible of the 
 worth of our mercies till we are about to lose them; nor do we covet 
 and court their continuance till they are upon the departure. Peter 
 said this, <I>not knowing what he said.</I> Those know not what they 
 say that talk of making tabernacles on earth for glorified saints in 
 heaven, who have better mansions in the temple there, and long to 
 return to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. It is here added, concerning the <I>cloud</I> that <I>overshadowed 
 them,</I> that they <I>feared as they entered into the cloud.</I> This 
 cloud was a token of God's more peculiar presence. It was in a cloud 
 that God of old took possession of the tabernacle and temple, and, when 
 the cloud <I>covered the tabernacle, Moses was not able to enter</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+40:34,35">Exod. xl. 34, 35</A>),

 and, when it filled the temple, the <I>priests could not stand to 
 minister by reason of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:14">2 Chron. v. 14</A>.

 Such a cloud was this, and then no wonder that the disciples were 
 <I>afraid to enter into it.</I> But never let any be afraid to enter 
 into a cloud with Jesus Christ; for he will be sure to bring them 
 safely through it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. The <I>voice</I> which came from heaven is here, and in Mark, 
 related not so fully as in Matthew: <I>This is my beloved Son, hear 
 him:</I> though those words, <I>in whom I am well pleased,</I> which we 
 have both in Matthew and Peter, are not expressed, they are implied in 
 that, <I>This is my beloved Son;</I> for whom he <I>loves,</I> and in 
 whom he is <I>well pleased,</I> come all to one; we are <I>accepted in 
 the Beloved.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The apostles are here said to have kept this vision
 private.  They <I>told no man in those days,</I> reserving the 
 discovery of it for another opportunity, when the evidences of Christ's 
 being the Son of God were completed in the pouring out of the Spirit, 
 and that doctrine was to be published to all the world. As there is a 
 time <I>to speak,</I> so there is a time to <I>keep silence.</I> Every 
 thing is beautiful and useful in its season.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>37  And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were
 come down from the hill, much people met him.
 &nbsp; 38 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master,
 I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.
 &nbsp; 39 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out;
 and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly
 departeth from him.
 &nbsp; 40 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could
 not.
 &nbsp; 41 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse
 generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring
 thy son hither.
 &nbsp; 42 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and
 tare <I>him.</I> And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the
 child, and delivered him again to his father.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This passage of story in Matthew and Mark follows immediately upon that 
 of Christ's transfiguration, and his discourse with his disciples after 
 it; but here it is said to be <I>on the next day, as they were coming 
 down from the hill,</I> which confirms the conjecture that Christ was 
 transfigured <I>in the night,</I> and, it should seem, though they did 
 not <I>make tabernacles</I> as Peter proposed, yet they found some 
 shelter to repose themselves in all night, for it was not till next day 
 that they <I>came down from the hill,</I> and then he found things in 
 some disorder among his disciples, though not so bad as Moses did when 
 he came down from the mount. When wise and good men are in their 
 beloved retirements, they would do well to consider whether they are 
 not wanted in their <I>public stations.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this narrative here, observe, 

 1. How forward the people were to receive Christ at his return to them.
 Though he had been but a little while absent, <I>much people met 
 him,</I> as, at other times, much people <I>followed</I> him; for so it 
 was foretold concerning him, that <I>to him should the gathering of the 
 people be.</I> 

 2. How importunate the father of the lunatic child was with Christ for
 help for him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>I beseech thee, look upon my son;</I> this is his request, and it is 
 a very modest one; one compassionate look from Christ is enough to set 
 every thing to rights. Let us bring ourselves and our children to 
 Christ, to be <I>looked upon.</I> His plea is, <I>He is my only 
 child.</I> They that have many children may balance their affliction in 
 one with their comfort in the rest; yet, if it be an only child that is 
 a grief, the affliction in that may be balanced with the love of God in 
 giving his only-begotten Son for us. 

 3. How <I>deplorable</I> the case of the <I>child</I> was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 He was under the power of an evil spirit, that <I>took him;</I> and 
 diseases of that nature are more frightful than such as arise merely 
 from natural causes: when the fit seized him without any warning given, 
 he suddenly <I>cried out,</I> and many a time his shrieks had pierced 
 the heart of his tender father. This malicious spirit <I>tore him,</I>
 and <I>bruised</I> him, and <I>departed not from him</I> but with great 
 difficulty, and a deadly gripe at parting. O the afflictions of the 
 afflicted in this world! And what mischief doth Satan do where he gets 
 possession! But happy they that have access to Christ! 

 4. How defective the disciples were in their faith. Though Christ had
 given them <I>power over unclean spirits,</I> yet they <I>could not</I> 
 cast out this <I>evil spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 Either they distrusted the power they were to fetch in strength from, 
 or the commission given to them, or they did not exert themselves in 
 prayer as they ought; for this Christ reproved them. O <I>faithless and 
 perverse generation.</I> Dr. Clarke understands this as spoken to his 
 disciples: "<I>Will ye be</I> yet so faithless and full of distrust 
 that ye cannot execute the commission I have given you?" 

 5. How effectual the cure was, which Christ wrought upon this child,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.
 
 Christ can do that for us which his disciples cannot: <I>Jesus rebuked 
 the unclean spirit</I> then when he raged most. The devil <I>threw the 
 child down, and tore him,</I> distorted him, as if he would have pulled 
 him to pieces. But one word from Christ <I>healed the child,</I> and 
 made good the damage the devil had done him. And it is here added that 
 he <I>delivered him again to his father.</I> Note, When our children 
 are recovered from sickness, we must receive them as delivered to us 
 again, receive them as life from the dead, and as when we first 
 received them. It is comfortable to receive them from the hand of 
 Christ, to see him delivering them to us again: "Here, take this child, 
 and be thankful; take it, and bring it up for me, for thou hast it 
 again from me. Take it, and do not set thy heart too much upon it." 
 With such cautions as these, parents should receive their children 
 <I>from Christ's hands,</I> and then with comfort put them again 
 <I>into his hands.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>43  And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But
 while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he
 said unto his disciples,
 &nbsp; 44 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of
 man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
 &nbsp; 45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from
 them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of
 that saying.
 &nbsp; 46 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them
 should be greatest.
 &nbsp; 47 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a
 child, and set him by him,
 &nbsp; 48 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my
 name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him
 that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall
 be great.
 &nbsp; 49 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out
 devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not
 with us.

 not against us is for us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here, 

 I. The impression which Christ's miracles made upon all that beheld 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>They were all amazed at the mighty power of God,</I> which they 
 could not but see in all the miracles Christ wrought. Note, The works 
 of God's almighty power are amazing, especially those that are wrought 
 by the hand of the Lord Jesus; for he is <I>the power of God,</I> and 
 his name is <I>Wonderful.</I> Their wonder was universal: they wondered 
 <I>every one.</I> The causes of it were universal: they wondered at 
 <I>all things which Jesus did;</I> all his actions had something 
 uncommon and surprising in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The notice Christ gave to his disciples of his approaching 
 sufferings: <I>The Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of 
 men,</I> wicked men, men of the worst character; they shall be 
 permitted to abuse him at their pleasure. That is here <I>implied</I> 
 which is <I>expressed</I> by the other evangelists: <I>They shall kill 
 him.</I> But that which is peculiar here is, 

 1. The connection of this with what goes next before, of the admiration
 with which the people were struck at beholding Christ's miracles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>While they all wondered at all things which Jesus did, he said this 
 to his disciples.</I> They had a fond conceit of his temporal kingdom, 
 and that he should reign, and they with him, in secular pomp and power; 
 and now they thought that this <I>mighty power</I> of his would easily 
 effect the thing, and his interest gained by his miracles in the people 
 would contribute to it; and therefore Christ, who knew what was in 
 their hearts, takes this occasion to tell them again, what he had told 
 them before, that he was so far from having men <I>delivered into his 
 hands</I> that he must be <I>delivered into the hands of men,</I> so 
 far from living in honour that he must die in disgrace; and all his 
 miracles, and the interest he has by them gained in the hearts of the 
 people, will not be able to prevent it. 

 2. The solemn preface with which it is introduced: "<I>Let these
 sayings sink down into your ears;</I> take special notice of what I 
 say, and mix faith with it; let not the notions you have of the 
 temporal kingdom of the Messiah stop your ears against it, nor make you 
 unwilling to believe it. Admit what I say, and submit to it." <I>Let it 
 sink down into your hearts;</I> so the Syriac and Arabic read it. The 
 word of Christ does us no good, unless we let it sink down into our 
 heads and hearts. 

 3. The unaccountable stupidity of the disciples, with reference to this
 prediction of Christ's sufferings. It was said in Mark, <I>They 
 understood not that saying.</I> It was plain enough, but they <I>would 
 not</I> understand it in the literal sense, because it agreed not with 
 their notions; and they <I>could not</I> understand it in any other, 
 <I>and were afraid to ask him</I> lest they should be undeceived and 
 awaked out of their pleasing dream. But it is here added that <I>it was 
 hidden from them, that they perceived it not,</I> through the weakness 
 of faith and the power of prejudice. We cannot think that it was <I>in 
 mercy</I> hidden from them, lest they should be swallowed up with 
 overmuch sorrow at the prospect of it; but that it was a paradox, 
 because they <I>made it so</I> to themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The rebuke Christ gave to his disciples for their disputing among 
 themselves which should be greatest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:46-48"><I>v.</I> 46-48</A>.

 This passage we had before, and, the more is the pity, we shall meet 
 with the like again. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Ambition of honour, and strife for superiority and precedency, are 
 sins that most easily beset the disciples of our Lord Jesus, for which 
 they deserve to be severely rebuked; they flow from corruptions which 
 they are highly concerned to subdue and mortify, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.

 They that expect to be <I>great</I> in this world commonly aim high, 
 and nothing will serve them short of being <I>greatest;</I> this 
 exposes them to a great deal of temptation and trouble, which they are 
 safe from that are content to be <I>little,</I> to be <I>least,</I> to 
 be <I>less than the least.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Jesus Christ is perfectly acquainted with the thoughts and intents 
 of our hearts: He <I>perceived their thoughts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 Thoughts are <I>words</I> to him, and <I>whispers</I> are loud cries. 
 It is a good reason why we should keep up a strict government of our 
 thoughts because Christ takes a strict cognizance of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ will have his disciples to aim at that honour which is to be 
 obtained by a quiet and condescending humility, and not at that which 
 is to be obtained by a restless and aspiring ambition. Christ <I>took a 
 child, and set him by him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>

 (for he always expressed a tenderness and kindness for little
 children), and he proposed <I>this child</I> to them for an example. 
 
 (1.) Let them be of the <I>temper</I> of this child, <I>humble</I> and 
 <I>quiet,</I> and <I>easy</I> to itself; let them not affect worldly 
 pomp, or grandeur, or high titles, but be as dead to them as this 
 child; let them bear no more malice to their rivals and competitors 
 than this child did. Let them be willing to be <I>the least,</I> if 
 that would contribute any thing to their usefulness, to stoop to the 
 meanest office whereby they might <I>do good.</I> 

 (2.) Let them assure themselves that this was the way to preferment; 
 for this would recommend them to the esteem of their brethren: they 
 that loved Christ would <I>therefore receive</I> them <I>in his 
 name,</I> because they did most resemble him, and they would likewise 
 recommend themselves to his favour, for Christ would take the 
 kindnesses done to them as done to himself: <I>Whosoever shall receive 
 one such child,</I> a preacher of the gospel that is of such a 
 disposition as this, he placeth his respect aright, and <I>receiveth 
 me;</I> and <I>whosoever receiveth me,</I> in such a minister, 
 <I>receiveth him that sent me;</I> and what greater honour can any man 
 attain to in this world than to be received by men as a messenger of 
 God and Christ, and to have God and Christ own themselves received and 
 welcomed in him? This honour have all the humble disciples of Jesus 
 Christ, and thus they shall be truly great that are least among 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The rebuke Christ gave to his disciples for discouraging one that 
 honoured him and served him, but was not of their communion, not only 
 not one of the twelve, nor one of the seventy, but not one of those 
 that ever associated with them, or attended on them, but, upon 
 occasional hearing of Christ, believed in him, and made use of his name 
 with faith and prayer in a serious manner, for the casting out of 
 devils. Now, 

 1. This man they <I>rebuked and restrained;</I> they would not let him
 pray and preach, though it was to the honour of Christ, though it did 
 good to men and weakened Satan's kingdom, because he did not <I>follow 
 Christ with them;</I> he separated from their church, was not ordained 
 as they were, paid them no respect, nor gave them the right hand of 
 fellowship. Now, if ever any society of Christians in this world had 
 reason to silence those that were not of their communion, the twelve 
 disciples at this time had; and yet, 

 2. Jesus Christ chid them for what they did, and warned them not to do
 the like again, nor any that profess to be successors of the apostles: 
 "<I>Forbid him not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>),

 but rather encourage him, for he is carrying on the same design that 
 you are, though, for reasons best known to himself, he does not follow 
 <I>with you;</I> and he will meet you in <I>the same end,</I> though he 
 does not accompany you in <I>the same way.</I> You <I>do well</I> to do 
 as you do, but it does not therefore follow that he <I>does ill</I> to 
 do as he does, and that you do well to put him under an interdict, for 
 <I>he that is not against us is for us,</I> and therefore ought to be 
 countenanced by us." We need not lose any of our friends, while we have 
 so few, and so many enemies. Those may be found faithful followers of
 Christ, and, as such, may be accepted of him, though they do not follow 
 <I>with us.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:38,39">Mark ix. 38, 39</A>.

 O what a great deal of mischief to the church, even from those that
 boast of relation to Christ, and pretend to <I>envy for his sake,</I> 
 would be prevented, if this passage of story were but duly 
 considered!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>51  And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should
 be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,
 &nbsp; 52 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and
 entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
 &nbsp; 53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though
 he would go to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 54 And when his disciples James and John saw <I>this,</I> they said,
 Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven,
 and consume them, even as Elias did?
 &nbsp; 55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what
 manner of spirit ye are of.
 &nbsp; 56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but
 to save <I>them.</I> And they went to another village.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This passage of story we have not in any other of the evangelists, and 
 it seems to come in here for the sake of its affinity with that next 
 before, for in this also Christ rebuked his disciples, because they 
 envied for his sake. There, under colour of zeal for Christ, they were 
 for silencing and restraining separatists: here, under the same colour, 
 they were for putting infidels to death; and, as for <I>that,</I> so 
 for <I>this</I> also, Christ reprimanded them, for a spirit of bigotry 
 and persecution is directly contrary to the spirit of Christ and 
 Christianity. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>readiness</I> and <I>resolution</I> of our Lord Jesus, in 
 prosecuting his great undertaking for our redemption and salvation. Of 
 this we have an instance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>:

 <I>When the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly 
 set his face to go to Jerusalem.</I> Observe 

 1. There was a time fixed for the sufferings and death of our Lord
 Jesus, and he knew well enough when it was, and had a clear and certain 
 foresight of it, and yet was so far from keeping out of the way that 
 then he appeared most publicly of all, and was most busy, knowing that 
 his time was short. 

 2. When he saw his death and sufferings approaching, he looked through
 them and beyond them, to the glory that should follow; he looked upon 
 it as the time when he should be <I>received up into glory</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16">1 Tim. iii. 16</A>),

 received up into the highest heavens, to be enthroned there. Moses and 
 Elias spoke of his death as his departure out of this world, which made 
 it not <I>formidable;</I> but he went further, and looked upon it as 
 his translation to a better world, which made it very <I>desirable.</I> 
 All good Christians may frame to themselves the same notion of death, 
 and may call it their being <I>received up,</I> to be with Christ where 
 he is; and, when the <I>time</I> of their being <I>received up</I> is 
 at hand, let them lift up their heads, knowing that <I>their redemption 
 draws nigh.</I> 

 3. On this prospect of the joy set before him, he <I>stedfastly set his
 face to go to Jerusalem</I> the place where he was to suffer and die. 
 He was fully <I>determined</I> to go, and would not be dissuaded; he 
 went <I>directly</I> to Jerusalem, because there now his business lay, 
 and he did not go about to other towns, or fetch a compass, which if he 
 had done, as commonly he did, he might have avoided going through 
 Samaria. He went cheerfully and courageously thither, though he knew 
 the things that should befal him there. He <I>did not fail nor was 
 discouraged,</I> but <I>set his face as a flint, knowing</I> that he 
 should be not only <I>justified,</I> but glorified

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7">Isa. l. 7</A>),

 not only not <I>run down,</I> but <I>received up.</I> How should this 
 shame us <I>for,</I> and shame <I>us out of,</I> our backwardness to do 
 and suffer for Christ! We draw back, and turn our faces another way 
 from his service who stedfastly set his face against all opposition, to 
 go through with the work of our salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The <I>rudeness</I> of the Samaritans in a <I>certain village</I> 
 (not named, nor deserving to be so) who would not <I>receive him,</I> 
 nor suffer him to bait in their town, though his way lay through it. 
 Observe here, 

 1. How <I>civil</I> he was to them: <I>He sent messengers before his
 face,</I> some of his disciples, that went to take up lodgings, and to 
 know whether he might have leave to accommodate himself and his company 
 among them; for he would not come to give <I>offence,</I> or if they 
 took any umbrage at the number of his followers. He sent some to 
 <I>make ready</I> for him, not for state, but convenience, and that his 
 coming might be no surprise. 
 
 2. How <I>uncivil</I> they were to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>.

 They did not <I>receive him,</I> would not suffer him to come into 
 their village, but ordered their watch to keep him out. He would have 
 <I>paid</I> for all he <I>bespoke,</I> and been a generous guest among 
 them, would have done them good, and preached the gospel to them, as he 
 had done some time ago to another city of the Samaritans, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:41">John iv. 41</A>.

 He would have been, if they pleased, the greatest blessing that ever
 came to their village, and yet they forbid him entrance. Such treatment 
 his gospel and ministers have often met with. Now the reason was 
 <I>because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem;</I> they 
 observed, by his motions, that he was steering his course that way. The 
 great controversy between the Jews and the Samaritans was about the 
 place of worship--whether Jerusalem or mount Gerizim near Sychar; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:20">John iv. 20</A>.
 
 And so hot was the controversy between them that the <I>Jews would have
 no dealings with the Samaritans,</I> nor they with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:9">John iv. 9</A>.

 Yet we may suppose that they did not deny other Jews lodgings among
 them, no, not when they went up to the feast; for if that had been 
 their constant practice Christ would not have attempted it, and it 
 would have been a great way about for some of the Galileans to go to 
 Jerusalem any other way than through Samaria. But they were 
 particularly incensed against Christ, who was a celebrated teacher, for 
 owning and adhering to the temple at Jerusalem, when the priests of 
 that temple were such bitter enemies to him, which, they hoped, would 
 have driven him to come and worship at <I>their</I> temple, and bring 
 that into reputation; but when they saw that he would go forward to 
 Jerusalem, notwithstanding this, they would not show him the common 
 civility which probably they used formerly to show him in his journey 
 thither.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The <I>resentment</I> which James and John expressed of this 
 affront, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.

 When these two heard this message brought, they were all in a flame 
 presently, and nothing will serve them but Sodom's doom upon this 
 village: "Lord," say they, "give us leave to command fire to come down 
 from heaven, not to <I>frighten</I> them only, but to <I>consume</I> 
 them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here indeed was something commendable, for they showed, 

 (1.) A great confidence in the power they had received from Jesus 
 Christ; though this had not been particularly mentioned in their 
 commission, yet they could with a word's speaking fetch <I>fire from 
 heaven.</I> <B><I>Theleis eipomen</I></B>--<I>Wilt thou that we speak 
 the word,</I> and the thing will be done. 

 (2.) A great zeal for the honour of their Master. They took it very ill 
 that he who did good wherever he came and found a hearty welcome should 
 be denied the liberty of the road by a parcel of paltry Samaritans; 
 they could not think of it without indignation that their Master should 
 be thus slighted. 

 (3.) A submission, notwithstanding, to their Master's good will and 
 pleasure. They will not offer to do such a thing, unless Christ give
 leave: <I>Wilt thou</I> that we do it? 

 (4.) A regard to the examples of the prophets that were before them. It 
 is doing <I>as Elias did?</I> they would not have thought of such a 
 thing if Elijah had not done it upon the soldiers that came to take 
 him, once and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:10,12">2 Kings i. 10, 12</A>.

 They thought that this <I>precedent</I> would be their <I>warrant;</I>
 so apt are we to misapply the examples of good men, and to think to 
 justify ourselves by them in the irregular liberties we give ourselves, 
 when the case is not parallel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But though there was something right in what they said, yet there 
 was much more amiss, for 

 (1.) This was not the first time, by a great many, that our Lord Jesus 
 had been thus affronted, witness the Nazarenes thrusting him out of 
 their city, and the Gadarenes desiring him to depart out of their 
 coast; and yet he never called for any judgment upon them, but 
 patiently put up with the injury. 

 (2.) These were Samaritans, from whom better was not to be expected, 
 and perhaps they had heard that Christ had forbidden his disciples to 
 <I>enter into any of the cities of the Samaritans</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:5">Matt. x. 5</A>),

 and therefore it was not so bad in them as in others who knew more of 
 Christ, and had received so many favours from him. 

 (3.) Perhaps it was only some few of the town that knew any thing of 
 the matter, or that sent that rude message to him, while, for aught 
 they knew, there were many in the town who, if they had heard of 
 Christ's being so near them, would have gone to meet him and welcomed 
 him; and must the whole town be laid in ashes for the wickedness of a 
 few? Will they have the righteous destroyed with the wicked? 

 (4.) Their Master had never yet upon any occasion called for <I>fire 
 from heaven,</I> nay, he had refused to give the Pharisees any <I>sign 
 from heaven</I> when they demanded it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:1,2">Matt. xvi. 1, 2</A>);

 and why should they think to introduce it? James and John were the two
 disciples whom Christ had called <I>Boanerges--sons of thunder</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:17">Mark iii. 17</A>);

 and will not that serve them, but they must be <I>sons of lightning</I> 
 too? 

 (5.) The example of Elias did not reach the case. Elijah was sent to
 display the terrors of the law, and to give proof of that, and to 
 witness as a bold reprover against the idolatries and wickednesses of 
 the court of Ahab, and it was agreeable enough to him to have his 
 commission thus proved; but it is a dispensation of grace that is now 
 to be introduced, to which such a terrible display of divine justice 
 will not be at all agreeable. Archbishop Tillotson suggests that their 
 being now near Samaria, where Elijah called for fire from heaven, might 
 help to put it in their heads; perhaps at the very place; but, though 
 the <I>place</I> was the same, the <I>times</I> were altered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The <I>reproof</I> he gave to James and John for their fiery, 
 furious zeal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>):

 He <I>turned</I> with a just displeasure, and <I>rebuked them;</I> for 
 <I>as many as he loves he rebukes and chastens,</I> particularly for 
 what they do, that is irregular and unbecoming them, under colour of 
 zeal for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He shows them in particular their mistake: <I>Ye know not what 
 manner of spirit ye are of;</I> that is, 

 (1.) "You <I>are not aware</I> what an <I>evil spirit</I> and 
 disposition you are of; how much there is of pride, and passion, and 
 personal revenge, covered under this pretence of zeal for your Master." 
 Note, There may be much corruption lurking, nay, and stirring too, in 
 the hearts of good people, and they themselves not be sensible of it. 
 
 (2.) "You <I>do not consider</I> what a <I>good spirit,</I> directly 
 contrary to this, you <I>should be of.</I> Surely you have yet to 
 learn, though you have been so long learning, what the spirit of Christ 
 and Christianity is. Have you not been taught to <I>love your 
 enemies,</I> and to <I>bless them that curse you,</I> and to call for 
 grace from heaven, not fire from heaven, upon them? You know not how 
 contrary your disposition herein is to that which it was the design of 
 the gospel you should be <I>delivered</I> into. You are not now under 
 the dispensation of bondage, and terror, and death, but under the 
 dispensation of love, and liberty, and grace, which was ushered in with 
 a proclamation of <I>peace on earth</I> and <I>good will toward 
 men,</I> to which you ought to accommodate yourselves, and not by such 
 imprecations as these oppose yourselves."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He shows them the general design and tendency of his religion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>):

 <I>The Son of man</I> is not himself come, and therefore does not send 
 you abroad <I>to destroy men's lives, but to save them.</I> He designed 
 to propagate his holy religion by love and sweetness, and every thing 
 that is inviting and endearing, not by fire and sword, and blood and 
 slaughter; by miracles of healing, not by plagues and miracles of 
 destruction, as Israel was brought out of Egypt. Christ came to 
 <I>slay</I> all <I>enmities,</I> not to foster them. Those are 
 certainly destitute of the spirit of the gospel that are for 
 anathematizing and rooting out by violence and persecution all that are 
 not of their mind and way, that cannot in conscience say as they say, 
 and do as they do. Christ came, not only to save men's <I>souls,</I> 
 but to save their <I>lives</I> too--witness the many miracles he 
 wrought for the healing of diseases that would otherwise have been 
 <I>mortal,</I> by which, and a thousand other instances of beneficence, 
 it appears that Christ would have his disciples do good to all, to the 
 utmost of their power, but hurt to none, to draw men into his church 
 with the <I>cords of a man and the bands of love,</I> but not think to 
 drive men into it with a <I>rod of violence</I> or the <I>scourge of 
 the tongue.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His <I>retreat</I> from this village. Christ would not only not 
 punish them for their rudeness, but would not insist upon his right of 
 travelling the road (which was as free to him as to his neighbours),
 would not attempt to force his way, but quietly and peaceably <I>went 
 to another village,</I> where they were not so stingy and bigoted, and 
 there refreshed himself, and went on his way. Note, When a stream of 
 opposition is strong, it is wisdom to get out of the way of it, rather 
 than to contend with it. If some be very rude, instead of revenging it, 
 we should try whether others will not be more civil.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>57  And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a
 certain <I>man</I> said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee
 whithersoever thou goest.
 &nbsp; 58 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the
 air <I>have</I> nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay <I>his</I>
 head.
 &nbsp; 59 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord,
 suffer me first to go and bury my father.
 &nbsp; 60 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go
 thou and preach the kingdom of God.
 &nbsp; 61 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me
 first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.
 &nbsp; 62 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the
 plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of three several persons that offered 
 themselves to follow Christ, and the answers that Christ gave to each 
 of them. The two former we had an account of in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:21">Matt. xix. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is one that is extremely forward to follow Christ immediately, 
 but seems to have been too rash, hasty, and inconsiderate, and not to 
 have set down and counted the cost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He makes Christ a very large promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>):

 <I>As they went in the way,</I> going up to Jerusalem, where it was 
 expected Christ would first appear in his glory, one said to him, 
 <I>Lord, I will follow thee withersoever thou goest.</I> This must be 
 the resolution of all that will be found Christ's disciples indeed; 
 they <I>follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:4">Rev. xiv. 4</A>),

 though it be through fire and water, to prisons and deaths.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ gives him a necessary caution, not to promise himself great 
 things in the world, in following him, but, on the contrary, to count 
 upon poverty and meanness; for <I>the Son of man has not where to lay 
 his head.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may look upon this, 

 (1.) As <I>setting forth</I> the <I>very low condition</I> that our 
 Lord Jesus was in, in this world. He not only wanted the delights and 
 ornaments that great princes usually have, but even such accommodations 
 for mere necessity as the <I>foxes</I> have, and the <I>birds of the 
 air.</I> See what a <I>depth of poverty</I> our Lord Jesus submitted to 
 for us, to increase the worth and merit of his satisfaction, and to 
 purchase for us a larger <I>allowance of grace, that we through his
 poverty might be rich,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:9">2 Cor. viii. 9</A>.

 He that made all did not make a dwelling-place for himself, not a house
 of his own to put his head in, but what he was beholden to others for. 
 He here calls himself the <I>Son of man,</I> a Son of Adam, partaker of 
 flesh and blood. He glories in his condescension towards us, not only 
 to the meanness of our nature, but to the meanest condition in that 
 nature, to testify his love to us, and to teach us a holy contempt of 
 the world and of great things in it, and a continual regard to another 
 world. Christ was thus poor, to sanctify and sweeten poverty to his
 people; the apostles had not certain dwelling-place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:11">1 Cor. iv. 11</A>),

 which they might the better bear when they knew their Master had not; 
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:11">2 Sam. xi. 11</A>.

 We may well be content to fare as Christ did. 

 (2.) As proposing this to the consideration of those who intend to be 
 his disciples. If we mean to follow Christ, we must lay aside the 
 thoughts of great things in the world, and not reckon upon making any 
 thing <I>more than heaven</I> of our religion, as we must resolve not 
 to take up with any thing <I>less.</I> Let us not go about to compound 
 the profession of Christianity with secular advantages; Christ has 
 <I>put them asunder,</I> let us not think of <I>joining them 
 together;</I> on the contrary, we must expect to enter into the kingdom 
 of heaven through many tribulations, must <I>deny ourselves,</I> and 
 <I>take up our cross.</I> Christ tells this man what he must count upon 
 if he followed him, to lie cold and uneasy, to fare hard, and live in 
 contempt; if he could not submit to this, let him not pretend to follow 
 Christ. This word sent him back, for aught that appears; but it will be 
 no discouragement to any that know what there is in Christ and heaven 
 to set in the scale against this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is another, that seems <I>resolved</I> to follow Christ, but 
 he <I>begs a day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>.

 To this man Christ first gave the call; he said to him, <I>Follow 
 me.</I> He that proposed the thing of himself fled off when he heard of 
 the difficulties that attended it; but this man to whom Christ gave a 
 call, though he hesitated at first, yet, as it should seem, afterwards 
 yielded; so true was that of Christ, <I>You have not chosen me, but I 
 have chosen you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:16">John xv. 16</A>.

 It is not of <I>him that willeth,</I> nor <I>of him that runneth</I> 
 (as that forward spark in the foregoing verses), but of God that 
 showeth mercy, that <I>gives</I> the call, and <I>makes</I> it 
 <I>effectual,</I> as to this man here. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The excuse he made: "<I>Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my 
 father.</I> I have an aged father at home, who cannot live long, and 
 will need me while he does live; let me go and attend on him until he 
 is dead, and I have performed my last office of love to him, and then I 
 will do any thing." We may here see three temptations, by which we are 
 in danger of being drawn and kept from following Christ, which 
 therefore we should guard against:--

 (1.) We are tempted to <I>rest</I> in a <I>discipleship at large,</I> 
 in which we may be <I>at a loose end,</I> and not to come <I>close,</I> 
 and give up ourselves to be <I>strict</I> and <I>constant.</I> 

 (2.) We are tempted to <I>defer</I> the doing of that which we know to 
 be our duty, and to put if off to some other time. When we have got 
 clear of such a care and difficulty, when we have despatched such a 
 business, raised an estate to such a pitch, then we will begin to think 
 of being religious; and so we are cozened out of all our time, by being 
 cozened out of the present time.

 (3.) We are tempted to think that our duty to our relations will excuse 
 us from our duty to Christ. It is a plausible excuse indeed: "<I>Let me 
 go and bury my father,</I>--let me take care of my family, and provide 
 for my children, and then I will think of serving Christ;" whereas the 
 <I>kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof</I> must be sought ad 
 minded <I>in the first place.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ's answer to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>):

 "<I>Let the dead bury their dead.</I> Suppose (which is not likely)
 that there are none but the dead to bury their dead, or none but those 
 who are themselves aged and dying, who are <I>as good as dead,</I> and 
 fit for no other service, yet thou hast other work to do; <I>go thou, 
 and preach the kingdom of God.</I>" Not that Christ would have his 
 followers or his ministers to be <I>unnatural;</I> our religion teaches 
 us to be kind and good in every relation, to <I>show piety at home,</I> 
 and to <I>requite our parents.</I> But we must not make these offices 
 an excuse from our duty to God. If the nearest and dearest relation we 
 have in the world stand in our way to keep us from Christ, it is 
 necessary that we have a zeal that will make us forget <I>father and 
 mother,</I> as Levi did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">Deut. xxxiii. 9</A>.

 This disciple was called to be a minister, and therefore must not
 <I>entangle himself</I> with the <I>affairs of this world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:4">2 Tim. ii. 4</A>.

 And it is a rule that, whenever Christ calls to any duty, we must not
 <I>consult with flesh and blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:15,16">Gal. i. 15, 16</A>.

 No excuses must be admitted against a present obedience to the call of
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is another that is willing to follow Christ, but he must have 
 a <I>little time</I> to <I>talk with his friends</I> about it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. His request for a dispensation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>.

 He said, "<I>Lord, I will follow thee;</I> I design no other, I am 
 determined to do it: but <I>let me first go bid them farewell that are 
 at home.</I>" This seemed reasonable; it was what Elisha desired when 
 Elijah called him,<I>Let me kiss my father and my mother;</I> and it 
 was allowed him: but the ministry of the gospel is <I>preferable,</I> 
 and the service of it more urgent than that of the prophets; and 
 therefore here it would not be allowed. Suffer me <B><I>apotaxasthai
 tois eis ton oikon mou</I></B>--<I>Let me go and set in order my 
 household affairs,</I> and give direction concerning them; so some 
 understand it. Now that which was amiss in this is,

 (1.) That he looked upon his following Christ as a melancholy, 
 troublesome, dangerous thing; it was to him as if he were <I>going to 
 die</I> and therefore he must take <I>leave</I> of all his friends, 
 never to <I>see them again,</I> or never <I>with any comfort;</I> 
 whereas, in following Christ, he might be more a comfort and blessing 
 to them than if he had continued with them. 

 (2.) That he seemed to have his worldly concerns more upon his heart 
 than he ought to have, and than would consist with a close attendance 
 to his duty as a follower of Christ. He seemed to hanker after his 
 relations and family concerns, and he could not part easily and 
 suitably from them, but they stuck to him. It may be he had bidden them 
 <I>farewell</I> once, but <I>Loth to depart bids oft farewell,</I> and 
 therefore he must bid them <I>farewell</I> once more, for they are 
 <I>at home at his house.</I> 

 (3.) That he was willing to enter into a temptation from his purpose of 
 following Christ. To go and bid them <I>farewell</I> that were <I>at 
 home at his house</I> would be to expose himself to the strongest 
 solicitations imaginable to alter his resolution; for they would all be 
 against it, and would <I>beg</I> and <I>pray</I> that he would not 
 <I>leave them.</I> Now it was presumption in him to thrust himself into 
 such a temptation. Those that resolve to walk with their Maker, and 
 follow their Redeemer, must resolve that they will not so much as 
 parley with their tempter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The rebuke which Christ gave him for this request 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:62"><I>v.</I> 62</A>):

 "<I>No man, having put his hand to the plough,</I> and designing to 
 make good work of his ploughing, will <I>look back,</I> or look behind 
 him, for then he makes balks with his plough, and the ground he ploughs 
 is <I>not fit</I> to be sown; so thou, if thou hast a design to follow 
 me and to reap the advantages of those that do so, yet if thou 
 <I>lookest back</I> to a worldly life again and hankerest after that, 
 if thou <I>lookest back</I> as Lot's wife did to Sodom, which seems to 
 be alluded to here, <I>thou art not fit for the kingdom of God.</I>" 
 
 (1.) "Thou art not <I>soil</I> fit to receive the <I>good seed</I> of 
 the kingdom of God if thou art thus <I>ploughed</I> by the 
 <I>halves,</I> and not gone through with." 

 (2.) "Thou art not a <I>sower</I> fit to <I>scatter</I> the good seed 
 of the kingdom if thou canst <I>hold the plough</I> no better." 
 Ploughing is in order to sowing. As those are not fit to be <I>sown</I> 
 with divine comforts whose <I>fallow ground</I> is not first <I>broken 
 up,</I> so those are not fit to be employed in sowing who know not how 
 to break up the fallow ground, but, when they have <I>laid their hand 
 to the plough,</I> upon every occasion look back and think of quitting 
 it. Note, Those who begin with the work of God must resolve to <I>go
 on</I> with it, or they will make nothing of it. Looking back inclines 
 to <I>drawing back,</I> and <I>drawing back</I> is to <I>perdition.</I> 
 Those are not fit for heaven who, having set their faces heavenward, 
 face about. But he, and he only, that <I>endures to the end, shall be 
 saved.</I></P>
