 that cast two mites into the treasury, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 enquiries concerning them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 1. Of what should happen between that and the destruction of
 Jerusalem--false Christs arising, bloody wars and persecutions of
 Christ's followers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:8-19">ver. 8-19</A>.

 2. Of that destruction itself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:20-24">ver. 20-24</A>.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts
 into the treasury.
 &nbsp; 2 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two
 mites.
 &nbsp; 3 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow
 hath cast in more than they all:
 &nbsp; 4 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the
 offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the
 living that she had.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This short passage of story we had before in Mark. It is thus recorded 
 twice, to teach us, 

 1. That <I>charity</I> to the poor is a <I>main matter</I> in religion. 
 Our Lord Jesus took all occasions to commend it and recommend it. He 
 had just mentioned the barbarity of the scribes, who devoured <I>poor 
 widows</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:1-47"><I>ch.</I> xx.</A>);

 and perhaps this is designed as an aggravation of it, that the poor
 widows were the best benefactors to the public funds, of which the 
 scribes had the disposal. 

 2. That Jesus Christ has his eye upon us, to observe what we give to 
 the poor, and what we contribute to works of piety and charity. Christ, 
 though intent upon his preaching, looked up, to see what <I>gifts were 
 cast into the treasury,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He observes whether we give largely and liberally, in proportion to
 what we have, or whether we be sneaking and paltry in it; nay, his eye 
 goes further, he observes whether we give charitably and with a willing 
 mind, or grudgingly and with reluctance. This should make us afraid of
 coming short of our duty in this matter; men may be deceived with 
 excuses which Christ knows to be frivolous. And this should encourage
 us to be abundant in it, without desiring that men should know it; it 
 is enough that Christ does; he sees in secret, and will reward openly. 
 
 3. That Christ observes and accepts the charity of the poor in a
 particular manner. Those that have nothing <I>to give</I> may yet 
 <I>do</I> a great deal in charity by ministering to the poor, and 
 helping them, and begging for them, that cannot <I>help</I> themselves, 
 or <I>beg</I> for themselves. But here was one that was herself poor 
 and yet <I>gave</I> what little she had to the treasury. It was but 
 <I>two mites,</I> which make a farthing; but Christ magnified it as a 
 piece of charity exceeding all the rest: <I>She has cast in more than 
 they all.</I> Christ does not blame her for indiscretion, in giving 
 what she wanted herself, nor for vanity in giving among the rich to the 
 treasury; but commended her liberality, and her willingness to part 
 with what little she had for the glory of God, which proceeded from a 
 belief of and dependence upon God's providence to take care of her.
 <I>Jehovah-jireh--the Lord will provide.</I> 

 4. That, whatever may be called <I>the offerings of God,</I> we ought 
 to have a respect for, and to our power, yea, and beyond our power, to 
 contribute cheerfully to. These have <I>cast in unto the offerings of
 God.</I> What is given to the support of the ministry and the gospel, 
 to the spreading and propagating of religion, the education of youth, 
 the release of prisoners, the relief of widows and strangers, and the 
 maintenance of poor families, is given to the <I>offerings of God,</I> 
 and it shall be so accepted and recompensed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with
 goodly stones and gifts, he said,
 &nbsp; 6 <I>As for</I> these things which ye behold, the days will come, in
 the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that
 shall not be thrown down.
 &nbsp; 7 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these
 things be? and what sign <I>will there be</I> when these things shall
 come to pass?
 &nbsp; 8 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many
 shall come in my name, saying, I am <I>Christ;</I> and the time
 draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.
 &nbsp; 9 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not
 terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end
 <I>is</I> not by and by.
 &nbsp; 10 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation,
 and kingdom against kingdom:
 &nbsp; 11 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and
 famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs
 shall there be from heaven.
 &nbsp; 12 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and
 persecute <I>you,</I> delivering <I>you</I> up to the synagogues, and into
 prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's
 sake.
 &nbsp; 13 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
 &nbsp; 14 Settle <I>it</I> therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before
 what ye shall answer:
 &nbsp; 15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your
 adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
 &nbsp; 16 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
 kinsfolks, and friends; and <I>some</I> of you shall they cause to be
 put to death.
 &nbsp; 17 And ye shall be hated of all <I>men</I> for my name's sake.
 &nbsp; 18 But there shall not a hair of your head perish.
 &nbsp; 19 In your patience possess ye your souls.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 I. With what admiration some spoke of the external pomp and 
 magnificence of the temple, and they were some of Christ's own 
 disciples too; and they took notice of it to him <I>how it was adorned 
 with goodly stones and gifts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The outside was built up with goodly stones, and within it was
 beautified and enriched with the <I>presents</I> that were offered up 
 for that purpose, and were <I>hung up</I> in it. They thought their 
 Master should be as much affected with those things as they were, and 
 should as much regret the destruction of them as they did. When we 
 <I>speak of the temple,</I> it should be of the presence of God in it, 
 and of the ordinances of God administered in it, and the communion 
 which his people there have with him. It is a poor thing, when we speak 
 of the church, to let our discourse dwell upon its pomps and revenues, 
 and the dignities and powers of its officers and rulers; for the king's 
 daughter is all <I>glorious within.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. With what contempt Christ spoke of them, and with what assurance of 
 their being all made desolate very shortly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>As for those things which you behold,</I> those dear things which 
 you are so much in love with, <I>behold, the days will come,</I> and 
 some now living may live to see them, <I>in which there shall not be 
 left one stone upon another.</I> This building, which seems so 
 beautiful that one would think none could, for pity, pull it down, and 
 which seems so strong that one would think none would be able to pull 
 it down, shall yet be utterly ruined; and this shall be done as soon as 
 ever the spiritual temple of the gospel church (the substance of that 
 shadow) begins to flourish in the world." Did we by faith foresee the 
 blasting and withering of all external glory, we should not set our 
 hearts upon it as those do that cannot see, or will not look, so far 
 before them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. With what curiosity those about him enquire concerning the time 
 when this great desolation should be: <I>Master, when shall these 
 things be?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It is natural to us to covet to know future things and the time of
 them, which <I>it is not for us to know,</I> when we are more concerned 
 to ask what is our duty in the prospect of these things, and how we may 
 prepare for them, which it is for us to know. They enquire <I>what
 sign there shall be when these things shall come to pass.</I> They ask 
 not for a <I>present</I> sign, to confirm the prediction itself, and to 
 induce them to believe it (Christ's word was enough for that), but what 
 the future signs will be of the approaching accomplishment of the 
 prediction, by which they may be put in mind of it. These <I>signs of 
 the times</I> Christ had taught them to observe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. With what clearness and fulness Christ answers their enquiries, as 
 far as was necessary to direct them in their duty; for all knowledge is 
 desirable as far as it is in order to practice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must expect to hear of false Christs and false prophets 
 appearing, and false prophecies given out 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Many shall come in my name;</I> he does not mean <I>in the name of 
 Jesus,</I> though there were some deceivers who pretended commissions 
 from him (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:13">Acts xix. 13</A>),

 but usurping the title and character of the Messiah. Many pretended to 
 be the deliverers of the Jewish church and nation from the Romans, and 
 to fix the time when the deliverance should be wrought, by which 
 multitudes were drawn into a snare, to their ruin. They shall say,
 <B><I>hoti ego eimi</I></B>--<I>I am he,</I> or <I>I am,</I> as if they 
 would assume that incommunicable name of God, by which he made himself 
 known when he came to deliver Israel out of Egypt, <I>I am;</I> and, to 
 encourage people to follow them, they added, "<I>The time draws 
 near</I> when the kingdom shall be restored to Israel, and all who will 
 follow me shall share in it." Now as to this, he gives them a needful 
 caution 

 (1.) <I>"Take heed that you be not deceived;</I> do not imagine that I 
 shall myself come again in external glory, to take possession of the 
 throne of kingdoms. No, you must not expect any such thing, for my 
 kingdom is not of this world." When they asked solicitously and 
 eagerly, <I>Master, when shall these things be?</I> the first word 
 Christ said was, <I>Take heed that you be not deceived.</I> Note, Those 
 that are most <I>inquisitive</I> in the things of God (though it is 
 very good to be so) are in most danger of being imposed upon, and have 
 most need to be upon their guard. 

 (2.) "<I>Go you not after them.</I> You know the Messiah is come, and 
 you are not to look for any other; and therefore do not so much as 
 hearken to them, nor have any thing to do with them." If we are sure 
 that Jesus is the Christ, and his doctrine is the <I>gospel, of 
 God,</I> we must be deaf to all intimations of another Christ and 
 another gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must expect to hear of great commotions in the nations, and 
 many terrible judgments inflicted upon the Jews and their neighbours. 
 
 (1.) There shall be <I>bloody wars</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Nation shall rise against nation,</I> one part of the Jewish nation 
 against another, or rather the whole against the Romans. Encouraged by 
 the false Christs, they shall wickedly endeavour to throw off the Roman 
 yoke, by taking up arms against the Roman powers; when they had 
 rejected the liberty with which Christ would have made them free they 
 were left to themselves, to grasp at their civil liberty in ways that 
 were <I>sinful,</I> and therefore could not be <I>successful.</I> 

 (2.) There shall be <I>earthquakes,</I> great earthquakes, <I>in divers 
 places,</I> which shall not only frighten people, but destroy towns and 
 houses, and bury many in the ruins of them. 

 (3.) There shall be <I>famines</I> and <I>pestilences,</I> the common 
 effects of war, which destroys the fruits of the earth, and, by 
 exposing men to ill weather and reducing them to ill diet, occasions 
 infectious diseases. God has various ways of punishing a provoking 
 people. The four sorts of judgments which the Old-Testament prophets so 
 often speak of are threatened by the New-Testament prophets too; for, 
 though spiritual judgments are more commonly inflicted in gospel times, 
 yet God makes use of temporal judgments also. 

 (4.) There shall be <I>fearful sights</I> and <I>great signs from 
 heaven,</I> uncommon appearances in the clouds, comets and blazing 
 stars, which frighten the ordinary sort of beholders, and have always 
 been looked upon as <I>ominous,</I> and <I>portending</I> something 
 <I>bad.</I> Now, as to these, the caution he gives them is, "<I>Be not 
 terrified.</I> Others will be frightened at them, but be not you 
 frightened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 As to the <I>fearful sights,</I> let them not be fearful to you, who
 look above the visible heavens to the throne of God's government in the 
 highest heavens. <I>Be not dismayed at the signs of heaven, for the 
 heathen are dismayed at them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:2">Jer. x. 2</A>.

 And, as to the <I>famines</I> and <I>pestilences,</I> you fall into the
 hands of God, who has promised to those who are his that <I>in the days 
 of famine they shall be satisfied,</I> and that he will keep them from 
 the <I>noisome pestilence;</I> trust therefore in him, and <I>be not 
 afraid.</I> Nay, when you hear of wars, when without are fightings and 
 within are fears, yet then <I>be not you terrified;</I> you know the 
 worst that any of these judgments can do to you, and therefore be not 
 afraid of them; for,"

 [1.] "It is your interest to <I>make the best of that which is,</I> for 
 all your fears cannot alter it: <I>these things must first come to 
 pass;</I> there is no remedy; it will be your wisdom to make yourselves 
 easy by accommodating yourselves to them."

 [2.] "There is <I>worse behind;</I> flatter not yourselves with a fancy 
 that you will soon see an end of these troubles, no, not so soon as you 
 think of: <I>the end is not by and by,</I> not <I>suddenly.</I> Be not 
 <I>terrified,</I> for, if you begin so quickly to be discouraged, how 
 will you bear up under what is yet before you?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They must expect to be themselves for <I>signs</I> and 
 <I>wonders</I> in Israel; their being <I>persecuted</I> would be a 
 prognostic of the destruction of the city and temple, which he had now 
 foretold. Nay, this would be the <I>first</I> sign of their ruin 
 coming: "<I>Before all these, they shall lay their hands on you.</I> 
 The judgment shall begin at the house of God; you must smart first, for 
 warning to them, that, if they have any consideration, they may 
 consider, <I>If this be done to the green tree, what shall be done to 
 the dry?</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17,18">1 Pet. iv. 17, 18</A>.

 But this is not all; this must be considered not only as the
 <I>suffering</I> of the <I>persecuted,</I> but as the <I>sin</I> of the 
 <I>persecutors. Before</I> God's judgments are brought upon them, they 
 shall fill up the measure of their iniquity by <I>laying their</I> 
 hands on you." Note, The ruin of a people is always introduced by their 
 sin; and nothing introduces a surer or sorer ruin than the sin of 
 persecution. This is a <I>sign</I> that God's wrath is coming upon a 
 people to the uttermost when their <I>wrath</I> against the servants of 
 God <I>comes to the uttermost.</I> Now as to this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ tells them what hard things they should suffer for his
 name's sake, much to the same purport with what he had told them when 
 he first called them to follow him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:1-42">Matt. x.</A>:

 They should know the wages of it, that they might <I>sit down and count
 the cost.</I> St. Paul, who was the greatest labourer and sufferer of 
 them all, not being now among them, was told by Christ himself what 
 <I>great things he should suffer for</I> his <I>name's sake</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:16">Acts ix. 16</A>),

 so necessary is it that all who will live godly in Christ Jesus should 
 count upon persecution. The Christians, having themselves been 
 originally Jews, and still retaining an equal veneration with them for 
 the Old Testament and all the essentials of their religion, and
 differing only in ceremony, might expect fair quarter with them; but 
 Christ bids them not expect it: "No, they shall be the most forward to 
 <I>persecute you.</I>" 

 [1.] "They shall use their own church-power against you: <I>They shall
 deliver you up to the synagogues</I> to be scourged there, and 
 stigmatized with their <I>anathemas.</I>" 

 [2.] "They shall incense the magistrates against you: they shall
 <I>deliver you into prisons,</I> that you may be <I>brought before 
 kings and rulers for my name's sake,</I> and be punished by them."

 [3.] "Your own relations will betray you

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>your parents, brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends;</I> so that you 
 will not know whom to put a confidence in, or where to be safe." 

 [4.] "Your religion will be made a capital crime, and you will be 
 called to <I>resist unto blood. Some of you shall they cause to be put 
 to death;</I> so far must you be from expecting honour and wealth that 
 you must expect nothing but death in its most frightful shapes, death 
 in all its dreadful pomp. Nay."

 [5.] <I>"You shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.</I>" This is
 worse than death itself, and was fulfilled when the apostles were not
 only <I>appointed to death,</I> but made a <I>spectacle to the
 world,</I> and counted as the <I>filth of the world,</I> and the
 <I>offscouring of all things,</I> which every body loathes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:9,13">1 Cor. iv. 9, 13</A>.

 They were hated of <I>all men,</I> that is, of all bad men, who could
 not bear the light of the gospel (because it discovered their evil 
 deeds), and therefore hated those who brought in that light, flew in 
 their faces, and would have pulled them to pieces. The wicked world,
 which hated to be reformed, hated Christ the great Reformer, and all 
 that were his, for his sake. The rulers of the Jewish church, knowing 
 very well that if the gospel obtained among the Jews their usurped 
 abused power was at an end, raised all their forces against it, put it 
 into an ill name, filled people's minds with prejudices against it, and 
 so made the preachers and professors of it odious to the mob.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He encourages them to bear up under their trials, and to go on in 
 their work, notwithstanding the opposition they would meet with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] God will bring glory both to himself and them out of their 
 sufferings: "<I>It shall turn to you for a testimony,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Your being set up thus for a mark, and publicly <I>persecuted,</I> will
 make you the more taken notice of and your doctrine and miracles the 
 more enquired into; your being brought <I>before kings and rulers</I> 
 will give you an opportunity of preaching the gospel to them, who 
 otherwise would never have come within hearing of it; your suffering 
 such severe things, and being so hated by the worst of men, men of the 
 most vicious lives, will be a testimony that you are good, else you 
 would not have such bad men for your enemies; your courage, and 
 cheerfulness, and constancy under your sufferings will be a testimony 
 for you, that you believe what you preach, that you are supported by a 
 divine power, and that the Spirit of God and glory rests upon you."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] "God will stand by you, and own you, and assist you, in your 
 trials; you are his advocates, and you shall be well furnished with 
 instructions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 Instead of setting your hearts on work to contrive an answer to
 informations, indictments, articles, accusations, and interrogatories, 
 that will be exhibited against you in the ecclesiastical and civil 
 courts, on the contrary, <I>settle it in your hearts,</I> impress it 
 upon them, take pains with them to persuade them <I>not to meditate 
 before what you shall answer;</I> do not <I>depend</I> upon your own 
 wit and ingenuity, your own prudence and policy, and do not 
 <I>distrust</I> or <I>despair</I> of the immediate and extraordinary 
 aids of the divine grace. Think not to bring yourselves off in the 
 cause of Christ as you would in a cause of your own, by your own parts 
 and application, with the common assistance of divine Providence, but 
 promise yourselves, for I promise you, the special assistance of divine 
 grace: <I>I will give you a mouth and wisdom.</I>" This proves Christ 
 to be God; for it is God's prerogative to <I>give wisdom,</I> and he it 
 is that <I>made man's mouth.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> A <I>mouth</I> and 
 <I>wisdom</I> together completely fit a man both for services and 
 sufferings; <I>wisdom</I> to know what to say, and a <I>mouth</I> 
 wherewith to say it as it should be said. It is a great happiness to 
 have both <I>matter</I> and <I>words</I> wherewith to honour God and do 
 good; to have in the mind a <I>storehouse</I> well furnished with 
 things <I>new and old,</I> and a <I>door of utterance</I> by which 
 <I>to bring them forth. Secondly,</I> Those that plead Christ's cause 
 may depend upon him to give them <I>a mouth and wisdom,</I> which way 
 soever they are called to plead it, especially when they are brought 
 before magistrates for his name's sake. It is not said that he will 
 send an angel from heaven to answer for them, though he could do this, 
 but that he will give them a <I>mouth</I> and <I>wisdom</I> to enable 
 them to answer for themselves, which puts a greater honour upon them, 
 which requires them to use the gifts and graces Christ furnishes them 
 with, and redounds the more to the glory of God, who <I>stills the 
 enemy and the avenger out of the mouths of babes and sucklings.
 Thirdly,</I> When Christ gives to his witnesses a <I>mouth and 
 wisdom,</I> they are enabled to say that both for him and themselves 
 which <I>all their adversaries are not able to gainsay or resist,</I> 
 so that they are silenced, and put to confusion. This was remarkably 
 fulfilled presently after the pouring out of the Spirit, by whom Christ 
 gave his disciples this <I>mouth</I> and <I>wisdom,</I> when the 
 apostles were brought before the priest sand rulers, and answered them 
 so as to make them ashamed,

 [3.] "You shall suffer no real damage by all the hardships they shall 
 put upon you 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>There shall not a hair of your head perish.</I>" Shall some of them 
 lose their heads, and yet not lose a hair? It is a proverbial 
 expression, denoting the greatest indemnity and security imaginable; it 
 is frequently used both in the Old Testament and New, in that sense. 
 Some think that it refers to the preservation of the lives of all the 
 Christians that were among the Jews when they were cut off by the 
 Romans; historians tell us that not one Christian perished in that 
 desolation. Others reconcile it with the deaths of multitudes in the 
 cause of Christ, and take it figuratively in the same sense that Christ 
 saith, <I>He that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</I> "Not a 
 hair of your head shall perish but," <I>First,</I> "I will take 
 <I>cognizance</I> of it." To this end he had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:30">Matt. x. 30</A>),

 <I>The hairs of your head are all numbered;</I> and an account is kept 
 of them, so that none of them shall perish but he will miss it.
 <I>Secondly,</I> "It shall be upon a <I>valuable consideration.</I>" We 
 do not reckon that <I>lost</I> or <I>perishing</I> which is laid out 
 for good purposes, and will turn to a good account. If we drop the body 
 itself for Christ's name's sake, it does not perish, but is well 
 bestowed. <I>Thirdly,</I> "It shall be abundantly recompensed; when you 
 come to balance profit and loss, you will find that nothing has 
 perished, but, on the contrary, that you have great gain in present 
 comforts, especially in the joys of a life eternal;" so that though we 
 may be losers for Christ we shall not, we cannot, be losers by him in 
 the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] "It is therefore your duty and interest, in the midst of your own 
 sufferings and those of the nation, to maintain a holy sincerity and 
 serenity of mind, which will keep you always easy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>In your patience possess ye your souls;</I> get and keep possession 
 of your souls." Some read it as a promise, "You <I>may</I> or 
 <I>shall</I> possess your souls." It comes all to one. Note, 
 <I>First,</I> It is our duty and interest at all times, especially in 
 perilous trying times, to secure the possession of our own souls; not 
 only that they be not destroyed and lost for ever, but that they be not 
 distempered now, nor our possession of them disturbed and interrupted. 
 "<I>Possess your souls,</I> be your own men, keep up the authority and 
 dominion of reason, and keep under the tumults of passion, that neither 
 grief nor fear may tyrannize over you, nor turn you out of the 
 possession and enjoyment of yourselves." In difficult times, when we 
 can keep possession of nothing else, then let us make that sure which 
 may be made sure, and keep possession of our souls. <I>Secondly,</I> It 
 is by patience, Christian patience, that we keep possession of our own 
 souls. "In suffering times, set patience upon the guard for the
 preserving of your souls; by it keep your souls composed and in a good 
 frame, and keep out all those impressions which would ruffle you and 
 put you out of temper."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then
 know that the desolation thereof is nigh.
 &nbsp; 21 Then let them which are in Jud&aelig;a flee to the mountains; and
 let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not
 them that are in the countries enter thereinto.
 &nbsp; 22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which
 are written may be fulfilled.
 &nbsp; 23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
 suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the
 land, and wrath upon this people.
 &nbsp; 24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be
 led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden
 down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be
 fulfilled.
 &nbsp; 25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in
 the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with
 perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
 &nbsp; 26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after
 those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of
 heaven shall be shaken.
 &nbsp; 27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud
 with power and great glory.
 &nbsp; 28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up,
 and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having given them an idea of the times for about thirty-eight years 
 next ensuing, he here comes to show them what all those things would 
 issue in at last, namely, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the utter 
 dispersion of the Jewish nation, which would be a little day of 
 judgment, a type and figure of Christ's second coming, which was not so 
 fully spoken of here as in the parallel place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:1-51">Matt. xxiv.</A>),

 yet glanced at; for the destruction of Jerusalem would be as it were
 the destruction of the world to those whose hearts were bound up in 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He tells them that they should see Jerusalem besieged, <I>compassed 
 with armies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 the Roman armies; and, when they saw this, they might conclude that
 <I>its desolation was nigh,</I> for in this the siege would infallibly 
 <I>end,</I> though it might be a long siege. Note, As in mercy, so in
 judgment, when God begins, he will make an end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He warns them, upon this signal given, to shift for their own 
 safety 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>Then let them that are in Judea</I> quit the country and <I>flee to 
 the mountains; let them that are in the midst of it</I>" (Of Jerusalem) 
 "<I>depart out,</I> before the city be closely shut up, and" (as we say 
 now) "before the trenches be opened; and let not them that are in the 
 countries and villages about enter into the city, thinking to be safe 
 there. Do you abandon a city and country which you see God has 
 abandoned and given up to ruin. <I>Come out of her, my people.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He foretels the terrible havoc that should be made of the Jewish 
 nation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Those are the days of vengeance</I> so often spoken of by the 
 Old-Testament prophets, which would complete the ruin of that provoking 
 people. All their predictions must now be fulfilled, and the blood of 
 all the Old-Testament martyrs must now be required. <I>All things that 
 are written must be fulfilled</I> at length. After days of patience 
 long abused, there will come <I>days of vengeance;</I> for reprieves 
 are not pardons. The greatness of that destruction is set forth, 

 1. By the inflicting cause of it. It is <I>wrath upon this people,</I> 
 the wrath of God, that will kindle this devouring consuming fire. 

 2. By the particular terror it would be to women with child, and poor
 mothers that are nurses. <I>Woe to them,</I> not only because they are 
 most subject to frights, and least able to shift for their own safety, 
 but because it will be a very great torment to them to think of having 
 borne and nursed children for the murderers. 

 3. By the general confusion that should be all the nation over. There 
 shall be <I>great distress in the land,</I> for men will not know what 
 course to take, nor how to help themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He describes the issue of the struggles between the Jews and the 
 Romans, and what they will come to at last; in short, 

 1. Multitudes of them <I>shall fall by the edge of the sword.</I> It is 
 computed that in those wars of the Jews there fell by the sword above 
 eleven hundred thousand. And the siege of Jerusalem was, in effect, a 
 military execution. 

 2. The rest shall be <I>led away captive;</I> not into <I>one</I>
 nations, as when they were conquered by the Chaldeans, which gave them 
 an opportunity of keeping together, but <I>into all nations,</I> which 
 made it impossible for them to <I>correspond</I> with each other, much 
 less to <I>incorporate.</I> 

 3. Jerusalem itself was <I>trodden down of the Gentiles.</I> The 
 Romans, when they had made themselves masters of it, laid it quite 
 waste, as a <I>rebellious and bad city, hurtful to kings and 
 provinces,</I> and therefore hateful to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He describes the great frights that people should generally be in. 
 Many frightful <I>sights</I> shall be <I>in the sun, moon, and 
 stars,</I> prodigies in the heavens, and here in this lower world, the 
 <I>sea and the waves roaring,</I> with terrible storms and tempests, 
 such as had not been known, and above the ordinary working of natural 
 causes. The effect of this shall be universal confusion and 
 consternation <I>upon the earth, distress of nations with 
 perplexity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Dr. Hammond understands by the <I>nations</I> the several governments
 or tetrarchies of the Jewish nation, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee; these 
 shall be brought to the last extremity. <I>Men's hearts shall fail
 them for fear</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 <B><I>apopsychonton anthropon</I></B>--<I>men being quite 
 exanimated,</I> dispirited, <I>unsouled,</I> dying away for fear. Thus 
 those are <I>killed all the day long</I> by whom Christ's apostles were 
 so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:36">Rom. viii. 36</A>),

 that is, they are all the day long in fear of being killed; sinking 
 under that which lies upon them, and yet still trembling for fear of 
 worse, and <I>looking after those things which are coming upon the 
 world.</I> When <I>judgment begins at the house of God,</I> it will not 
 end there; it shall be as if all the world were falling in pieces; and 
 where can any be secure then? The <I>powers of heaven shall be 
 shaken,</I> and then the pillars of the earth cannot but tremble. Thus 
 shall the present Jewish policy, religion, laws, and government, be all 
 entirely dissolved by a series of unparalleled calamities, attended 
 with the utmost confusion. So Dr. Clarke. But our Saviour makes use of 
 these figurative expressions because at the end of time they shall be 
 literally accomplished, when the <I>heavens shall be rolled together as 
 a scroll,</I> and all their powers not only shaken, but broken, and the 
 <I>earth</I> and <I>all the works that are therein</I> shall be burnt 
 up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:10,12">2 Pet. iii. 10, 12</A>.

 As that day was all terror and destruction to the unbelieving Jews, so
 the great day will be to all unbelievers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He makes this to be a kind of <I>appearing of the Son of man: Then 
 shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with power and great 
 glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 The destruction of Jerusalem was in a particular manner an act of
 Christ's judgment, the judgment committed to the Son of man; his 
 religion could never be thoroughly established but by the destruction 
 of the temple, and the abolishing of the Levitical priesthood and 
 economy, after which even the converted Jews, and many of the Gentiles 
 too, were still hankering, till they were destroyed; so that it might 
 justly be looked upon as <I>a coming of the Son of man, in power and 
 great glory,</I> yet not visibly, but <I>in the clouds;</I> for in 
 executing such judgments as these <I>clouds and darkness are round 
 about him.</I> Now this was, 

 1. An <I>evidence</I> of the first coming of the Messiah; so some 
 understand it. Then the unbelieving Jews shall be confined, when it is 
 too late, that Jesus was the Messiah; those that would not see him 
 coming in the power of his grace to <I>save them</I> shall be made to 
 see him coming in the power of his wrath to <I>destroy them;</I> those 
 that would not have him to <I>reign over them</I> shall have him to 
 <I>triumph over them.</I> 

 2. It was an <I>earnest</I> of his second coming. <I>Then</I> in the
 terrors of that day they shall <I>see the Son of man coming in a 
 cloud,</I> and all the terrors of the last day. They shall see a
 <I>specimen</I> of it, a faint resemblance of it. If this be so 
 terrible, what will that be?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. He encourages all the faithful disciples in reference to the 
 terrors of that day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 "<I>When these things begin to come to pass,</I> when Jerusalem is 
 besieged, and every thing is concurring to the destruction of the Jews, 
 <I>then</I> do you look <I>up,</I> when others are looking down, look 
 heavenward, in faith, hope, and prayer, and <I>lift up your heads</I> 
 with cheerfulness and confidence, <I>for your redemption draws 
 night.</I>" 

 1. When Christ came to destroy the Jews, he came to redeem the 
 Christians that were persecuted and oppressed by them; <I>then had the 
 churches rest.</I> 

 2. When he comes to judge the world at the last day, he will 
 <I>redeem</I> all that are his, from all their grievances. And the
 foresight of that day is as pleasant to all good Christians as it is 
 terrible to the wicked and ungodly. Their death itself is so; when they 
 see that day approaching, they can <I>lift up their heads with joy,</I> 
 knowing that <I>their redemption draws nigh,</I> their removal to their 
 Redeemer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. Here is one word of prediction that looks further than the 
 destruction of the Jewish nation, which is not easily understood; we 
 have it in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>:

 <I>Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, till the times of
 the Gentiles be fulfilled.</I> 

 1. Some understand it of what is past; so Dr. Hammond. The Gentiles,
 who have conquered Jerusalem, shall keep possession of it, and it shall
 be purely Gentile, till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled, till a
 great part of the Gentile world shall have become Christian, and then
 after Jerusalem shall have been rebuilt by Adrian the emperor, with an
 exclusion of all the Jews from it, many of the Jews shall turn
 Christians, shall join with the Gentile Christians, to set up a church
 in Jerusalem, which shall flourish there for a long time. 

 2. Others understand it of what is yet to come; so Dr. Whitby.
 Jerusalem shall be possessed by the Gentiles, of one sort or other, for 
 the most part, till the time come when the nations that yet remain 
 infidels shall embrace the Christian faith, when the kingdoms of this 
 world shall become Christ's kingdoms, and then all the Jews shall be 
 converted. Jerusalem shall be inhabited by them, and neither they nor
 their city any longer trodden down by the Gentiles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all
 the trees;
 &nbsp; 30 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own
 selves that summer is now nigh at hand.
 &nbsp; 31 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know
 ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.
 &nbsp; 32 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away,
 till all be fulfilled.
 &nbsp; 33 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not
 pass away.
 &nbsp; 34 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
 overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this
 life, and <I>so</I> that day come upon you unawares.
 &nbsp; 35 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the
 face of the whole earth.
 &nbsp; 36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be
 accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to
 pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
 &nbsp; 37 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at
 night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called <I>the
 mount</I> of Olives.
 &nbsp; 38 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the
 temple, for to hear him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, in the close of this discourse,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ appoints his disciples to observe the signs of the times, 
 which they might judge by, if they had an eye to the foregoing 
 directions, with as much certainty and assurance as they could judge of 
 the approach of summer by the budding forth of the trees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:29-31"><I>v.</I> 29-31</A>.

 As in the kingdom of nature there is a chain of causes, so in the
 kingdom of providence there is a consequence of one event upon another. 
 When we see a nation filling up the measure of their iniquity, we may 
 conclude that their ruin is nigh; when we see the ruin of persecuting 
 powers hastening on, we may thence infer that <I>the kingdom of God is 
 nigh at hand,</I> that when the opposition given to it is removed it 
 shall gain ground. As we may lawfully prognosticate the change of the 
 seasons when second causes have begun to work, so we may, in the 
 disposal of events, expect something uncommon when God is already 
 <I>raised up out of his holy habitation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:13">Zech. ii. 13</A>);

 then <I>stand still and see his salvation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He charges them to look upon those things as neither 
 <I>doubtful</I> nor <I>distant</I> (for then they would not make a due 
 impression on them), but as <I>sure</I> and very <I>near.</I> The 
 destruction of the Jewish nation, 
 
 1. Was <I>near</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>This generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled.</I> There 
 were some now alive that should see it; some that now heard the 
 prediction of it. 

 2. It was <I>sure;</I> the sentence was irreversible; it was a
 <I>consumption determined;</I> the decree was gone forth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 "<I>Heaven and earth shall pass away</I> sooner than any word of mine: 
 nay, they certainly shall pass away, but <I>my words shall not;</I> 
 whether they <I>take hold</I> or no, they will <I>take effect,</I> and 
 not one of them <I>fall to the ground,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:19">1 Sam. iii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He cautions them against security and sensuality, by which they 
 would unfit themselves for the trying times that were coming on, and 
 make them to be a great surprise and terror to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>):
 
 <I>Take heed to yourselves.</I> This is the word of command given to 
 all Christ's disciples: "<I>Take heed to yourselves,</I> that you be 
 not overpowered by temptations, nor betrayed by your own corruptions." 
 Note, We cannot be <I>safe</I> if we be <I>secure.</I> It concerns us 
 at <I>all</I> times, but especially at <I>some</I> times, to be very 
 cautious. See here, 

 1. What our <I>danger</I> is: that <I>the day</I> of death and judgment 
 should <I>come upon us unawares,</I> when we do not <I>expect</I> it, 
 and are not <I>prepared</I> for it,--lest, when we are called to meet 
 our Lord, that be found the <I>furthest</I> thing from our thoughts 
 which ought always to be laid <I>nearest</I> our hearts, lest it 
 <I>come upon us as a snare;</I> for so <I>it will come upon</I> the 
 most of men, who <I>dwell upon the earth,</I> and mind <I>earthly 
 things only,</I> and have no converse with heaven; to them it will be 
 <I>as a snare.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:12">Eccl. ix. 12</A>.

 It will be a <I>terror</I> and a <I>destruction</I> to them; it will 
 put them into an inexpressible fright, and hold them fast for a doom 
 yet more frightful.

 2. What our <I>duty</I> is, in consideration of this danger: we must 
 <I>take heed lest our hearts be overcharged,</I> lest they be burdened 
 and overloaded, and so unfitted and disabled to do what must be done in 
 preparation for death and judgment. Two things we must watch against, 
 lest our hearts be overcharged with them:--

 (1.) The indulging of the appetites of the body, and allowing of 
 ourselves in the gratifications of sense to an excess: <I>Take heed 
 lest you be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness,</I> the 
 immoderate use of meat and drink, which burden the heart, not only with 
 the guilt thereby contracted, but by the ill influence which such 
 disorders of the body have upon the mind; they make men dull and 
 lifeless to their duty, dead and listless in their duty; they stupify 
 the conscience, and cause the mind to be <I>unaffected</I> with those 
 things that are most <I>affecting.</I> 

 (2.) The inordinate pursuit of the good things of this world. The heart 
 is overcharged with the <I>cares of this life.</I> The former is the 
 snare of those that are given to their pleasures: this is the snare of 
 the men of business, that <I>will be rich.</I> We have need to guard on 
 both hands, not only lest at the time when death comes, but lest <I>at 
 any time</I> our hearts should be thus overcharged. Our caution against 
 sin, and our care of our own souls, must be <I>constant.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He counsels them to prepare and get ready for this great day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.
 
 Here see, 

 1. What should be <I>our aim:</I> that we may be <I>accounted worthy to
 escape all these things;</I> that, when the judgments of God are 
 abroad, we may be preserved from the malignity of them; that either we 
 may not be involved in the common calamity or it may not be that to us 
 which it is to others; that in the day of death we may escape the sting 
 of it, which is the wrath of God, and the damnation of hell. Yet we 
 must aim not only to <I>escape that,</I> but to <I>stand before the Son 
 of man;</I> not only to stand <I>acquitted</I> before him as our Judge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:5">Ps. i. 5</A>),

 to have boldness in the day of Christ (that is supposed in our
 <I>escaping</I> all those things), but to <I>stand before him,</I> to 
 attend on him as our Master, to stand continually before his throne, 
 and serve him day and night in his temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:15">Rev. vii. 15</A>),

 always to <I>behold his face,</I> as the angels,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:10">Matt. xviii. 10</A>.

 The saints are here said to be <I>accounted worthy,</I> as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:35"><I>ch.</I> xx. 35</A>.

 God, by the good work of his grace in them, <I>makes them meet</I> for
 this happiness, and, by the good will of his grace towards them, 
 <I>accounts them worthy</I> of it: but, as Grotius here says, a great 
 part of our worthiness lies in an acknowledgment of our own 
 unworthiness. 

 2. What should be our <I>actings</I> in these aims: <I>Watch therefore,
 and pray always.</I> Watching and praying must go together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:9">Neh. iv. 9</A>.
 
 Those that would escape the wrath to come, and make sure of the joys to
 come, must <I>watch</I> and <I>pray,</I> and must do so always, must 
 make it the constant business of their lives,

 (1.) To keep a guard upon themselves. "Watch against sin, watch to
 every duty, and to the improvement of every opportunity of doing good. 
 Be awake, and keep awake, in expectation of your Lord's coming, that 
 you may be in a right frame to receive him, and bid him welcome." 

 (2.) To keep up their communion with God: "<I>Pray always;</I> be 
 always in an habitual disposition to that duty; keep up stated times 
 for it; abound in it; pray upon all occasions." Those shall be 
 accounted worthy to live a life of praise in the other world that live 
 a life of prayer in this world.</P>

 V. In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:37,38">last two verses</A>

 we have an account how Christ disposed of himself during those three or
 four days between his riding in triumph into Jerusalem and the night in 
 which he was betrayed. 

 1. He was <I>all day teaching in the temple.</I> Christ preached on 
 week-days as well as sabbath days. He was an indefatigable preacher; he 
 preached in the face of opposition, and in the midst of those that he 
 knew sought occasion against him. 

 2. At night he went out to lodge at a friend's house, in the mount of 
 Olives, about a mile out of town. It is probable that he had some 
 friends in the city that would gladly have lodged him, but he was 
 willing to retire in the evening out of the noise of the town, that he 
 might have more time for secret devotion, now that his hour was at 
 hand. 

 3. Early in the morning he was in the temple again, where he had a 
 morning lecture for those that were willing to attend it; and the 
 people were forward to hear one that they saw forward to preach

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>They all came early in the morning,</I> flocking to the temple, like 
 doves to their windows, <I>to hear him,</I> though the chief priests 
 and scribes did all they could to prejudice them against him.
 Sometimes the taste and relish which serious, honest, plain people have 
 of good preaching are more to be valued and judged by than the opinion 
 of the witty and learned, and those in authority.</P>
