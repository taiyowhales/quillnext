 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Christ in his pomp and glory transfigured, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:1-3">ver. 1-13</A>.

 II. Christ in his power and grace, casting the devil out of a child, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:14-21">ver. 14-21</A>.

 And, 

 III. Christ in his poverty and great humiliation, 
 
 1. Foretelling his own sufferings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:22,23">ver. 22, 23</A>.
 
 2. Paying tribute, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:24-27">ver. 24-27</A>.

 So that here is Christ, the Brightness of his Father's glory, by 
 himself purging our sins, paying our debts, and destroying for us him 
 that had the power of death, that is, the devil. Thus were the several
 indications of Christ's gracious intentions admirable interwoven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
 brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart,
 &nbsp; 2  And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as
 the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
 &nbsp; 3  And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
 with him.
 &nbsp; 4  Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good
 for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three
 tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
 &nbsp; 5  While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them:
 and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my
 beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
 &nbsp; 6  And when the disciples heard <I>it,</I> they fell on their face,
 and were sore afraid.
 &nbsp; 7  And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
 afraid.
 &nbsp; 8  And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save
 Jesus only.
 &nbsp; 9  And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
 saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen
 again from the dead.
 &nbsp; 10  And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the
 scribes that Elias must first come?
 &nbsp; 11  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall
 first come, and restore all things.
 &nbsp; 12  But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they
 knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed.
 Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.
 &nbsp; 13  Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of
 John the Baptist.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here thee story o Christ's transfiguration; he ha said that the 
 <I>Son of man should</I> shortly <I>come in his kingdom,</I> with which 
 promise all the three evangelists industriously connect this story; as 
 if Christ's transfiguration were intended for a specimen and an earnest 
 of the kingdom of Christ, and of that light and love of his, which 
 therein appears to his select and sanctified ones. Peter speaks of this 
 as <I>the power and coming of our Lord Jesus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:16">2 Pet. i. 16</A>);

 because it was an emanation of his power, and a previous notice of his 
 coming, which was fitly introduced by such prefaces.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When Christ was here in his humiliation, though his state, in the main, 
 was a state of abasement and afflictions, there were some glimpses of 
 his glory intermixed, that he himself might be the more encouraged in 
 his sufferings, and others the less offended. His birth, his baptism, 
 his temptation, and his death, were the most remarkable instances of 
 his humiliation; and these were each of them attended with some signal 
 points of glory, and the smiles of heaven. But the series of his public 
 ministry being a continued humiliation, here, just in the midst of 
 that, comes in this discovery of his glory. As, now that he is in 
 heaven, he has his condescensions, so, when he was on earth, he had his 
 advancements.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now concerning Christ's transfiguration, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The circumstances of it, which are here noted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The time; <I>six days</I> after he had the solemn conference with 
 his disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:21"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 21</A>.

 St. Luke saith, <I>It was about eight days after,</I> six whole days
 intervening, and this the eighth day, that day seven-night. Nothing is 
 recorded to be said or done by our Lord Jesus for six days before his 
 transfiguration; thus, before some great appearances, <I>there was 
 silence in heaven for the space of half an hour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:1">Rev. viii. 1</A>.
 
 <I>Then</I> when Christ seems to be doing nothing for his church, 
 expect, ere long, something more than ordinary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The place; it was <I>on top of a high mountain apart.</I> Christ 
 chose a mountain, 

 (1.) As a secret place. He went apart; for though a city upon a hill 
 can hardly be hid, two or three persons upon a hill can hardly be 
 found; therefore their private oratories were commonly on mountains. 
 Christ chose a retired place to be transfigured in, because his 
 appearing publicly in his glory was not agreeable to his present state; 
 and thus he would show his humility, and teach us that privacy much 
 befriends our communion with God. Those that would maintain intercourse 
 with Heaven, must frequently withdraw from the converse and business of 
 this world; and they will find themselves never less alone than when 
 alone, for the Father is with them. 

 (2.) Though a sublime place, elevated above things below. Note, Those 
 that would have a transforming fellowship with God, must not only 
 retire, but ascend; lift up their hearts, and <I>seek things above.</I> 
 The call is, <I>Come up hither,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:1">Rev. iv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The witnesses of it. He took with him Peter and James and John. 

 (1.) He took three, a competent number to testify what they should see; 
 for <I>out of the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be 
 established.</I> Christ makes his appearances certain enough, but not 
 too common; <I>not to all the people, but to witnesses</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:41">Acts x. 41</A>),

 that they might be blessed, who have not seen, and yet have believed. 
 
 (2.) He took these three because they were the chief of his disciples,
 the first three of the worthies of the Son of David; probably they 
 excelled in gifts and graces; they were Christ's favourites, singled 
 out to be the witnesses of his retirements. They were present when he 
 raised the damsel to life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:37">Mark v. 37</A>.

 They were afterward to be the witnesses of his agony, and this was to
 prepare them for that. Note, A sight of Christ's glory, while we are 
 here in this world, is a good preparative for our sufferings with him, 
 as these are preparatives for the sight of his glory in the other 
 world. Paul, who had abundance of trouble, had abundance of 
 revelations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The manner of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 <I>He was transfigured before them.</I> The substance of his body 
 remained the same, but the accidents and appearances of it were greatly 
 altered; he was not turned into a spirit, but his body, which had 
 appeared in weakness and dishonour, now appeared in power and glory. 
 <I>He was transfigured,</I> <B><I>metamorphothe</I></B>--<I>he was 
 metamorphosed.</I> The profane poets amused and abused the world with 
 idle extravagant stories of metamorphoses, especially the metamorphoses 
 of their gods, such as were disparaging and diminishing to them, 
 equally false and ridiculous; to these some think Peter has an eye, 
 when, being about to mention this transfiguration of Christ, he saith, 
 <I>We have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made it known 
 unto you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:16">2 Pet. i. 16</A>.

 Christ was both God and man; but, in the days of his flesh, he took on
 him the <I>form of a servant</I>--<B><I>morphen doulou</I></B>, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:7">Phil. ii. 7</A>.

 He drew a veil over the glory of his godhead; but now, in his
 transfiguration, he put by that veil, appeared <B><I>en morphe 
 theou</I></B>--in the form of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:6">Phil. ii. 6</A>),

 and gave his disciples a glimpse of his glory, which could not but 
 change his form.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The great truth which we declare, is, that <I>God is light</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:5">1 John i. 5</A>),

 <I>dwells in the light</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:16">1 Tim. vi. 16</A>),

 <I>covers himself with light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:2">Ps. civ. 2</A>.

 And therefore when Christ would appear in the <I>form of God,</I> he
 appeared <I>in light,</I> the most glorious of all visible beings, the 
 first-born of the creation, and most nearly resembling the eternal 
 Parent. Christ is <I>the Light;</I> while he was in the world, he 
 <I>shined in darkness,</I> and therefore <I>the world knew him not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:5,10">John i. 5, 10</A>);

 but, at this time, that Light shined out of the darkness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now his transfiguration appeared in two things:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>His face did shine as the sun.</I> The face is the principal part 
 of the body, by which we are known; therefore such a brightness was put 
 on Christ's face, that face which afterward <I>he hid not from shame 
 and spitting.</I> It shone as the sun when he goes forth in his 
 strength, so clear, so bright; for he is the Sun of righteousness, the 
 Light of the world. The face of Moses shone but as the moon, with a 
 borrowed reflected light, but Christ's shone as the sun, with an innate 
 inherent light, which was the more sensibly glorious, because it 
 suddenly broke out, as it were, from behind a black cloud.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>His raiment was white as the light.</I> All his body was altered, 
 as his face was; so that beams of light, darting from every part 
 through his clothes, made them white and glittering. The shining of the 
 face of Moses was so weak, that it could easily be concealed by a thin 
 veil; but such was the glory of Christ's body, that his clothes were 
 enlightened by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The companions of it. He will come, at last, <I>with ten thousands 
 of his saints;</I> and, as a specimen of that, there now <I>appeared 
 unto them Moses and Elias talking with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. There were glorified saints attending him, that, when there were 
 <I>three to bear record on earth,</I> Peter, James, and John, there 
 might be some to bear record from heaven too. Thus here was a lively 
 resemblance of Christ's kingdom, which is made up of saints in heaven 
 and saints on earth, and to which belong <I>the spirits of just men 
 made perfect.</I> We see here, that they who are fallen asleep in 
 Christ are not perished, but exist in a separate state, and shall be 
 forthcoming when there is occasion. 

 2. These two were Moses and Elias, men very eminent in their day. They
 had both fasted forty days and forty nights, as Christ did, and wrought 
 other miracles, and were both remarkable at their going out of the 
 world as well as in their living in the world. Elias was carried to
 heaven in a fiery chariot, and died not. The body of Moses was never 
 found, possibly it was preserved from corruption, and reserved for this 
 appearance. The Jews had great respect for the memory of Moses and 
 Elias, and therefore they came to witness of him, they came to carry 
 tidings concerning him to the upper world. In them the law and the 
 prophets honoured Christ, and bore testimony to him. Moses and Elias
 appeared to the disciples; they saw them, and heard them talk, and, 
 either by their discourse or by information from Christ, they knew them 
 to be Moses and Elias; glorified saints shall know one another in 
 heaven. They talked with Christ. Note, Christ has communion with the 
 blessed, and will be no stranger to any of the members of that 
 glorified corporation. Christ was now to be sealed in his prophetic 
 office, and therefore these two great prophets were fittest to attend 
 him, as transferring all their honour and interest to him; for <I>in 
 these last days God speaks to us by his Son,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:1">Heb. i. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The great pleasure and satisfaction that the disciples took in the 
 sight of Christ's glory. Peter, as usual, spoke or the rest; <I>Lord, 
 it is good for us to be here.</I> Peter here expresses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The delight they had in this converse; <I>Lord, it is good to be 
 here.</I> Though upon a high mountain, which we may suppose rough and 
 unpleasant, bleak and cold, yet <I>it is good to be here.</I> He speaks 
 the sense of his fellow-disciples; It is good not only for <I>me,</I> 
 but for <I>us.</I> He did not covet to monopolize this favour, but 
 gladly takes them in. He saith this to Christ. Pious and devout 
 affections love to pour out themselves before the Lord Jesus. The soul 
 that loves Christ, and loves to be with him, loves to go and tell him 
 so; <I>Lord, it is good for us to be here.</I> This intimates a 
 thankful acknowledgment of his kindness in admitting them to this 
 favour. Note, Communion with Christ is the delight of Christians. All 
 the disciples of the Lord Jesus reckon it is good for them to be with 
 him in the holy mount. It is good to be here where Christ is, and 
 whither he brings us along with him by his appointment; it is good to 
 be here, retired and alone with Christ; to be here, where we may behold 
 the beauty of the Lord Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4">Ps. xxvii. 4</A>.

 It is pleasant to hear Christ compare notes with Moses and the
 prophets, to see how all the institutions of the law, and all the 
 predictions of the prophets, pointed at Christ, and were fulfilled in 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The desire they had of the continuance of it; <I>Let us make here 
 three tabernacles.</I> There was in this, as in many other of Peter's 
 sayings, a mixture of weakness and of goodwill, more zeal than 
 discretion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here was a zeal for this converse with heavenly things, a laudable 
 complacency in the sight they had of Christ's glory. Note, Those that 
 by faith <I>behold the beauty of the Lord</I> in his house, cannot but 
 desire to <I>dwell there all the days of their life.</I> It is good 
 having a nail in God's holy place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:8">Ezra ix. 8</A>),

 a constant abode; to be in holy ordinances as a man at home, not as a 
 wayfaring man. Peter thought this mountain was a fine spot of ground to 
 build upon, and he was for making tabernacles there; as Moses in the 
 wilderness made a tabernacle for the Shechinah, or divine glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It argued great respect for his Master and the heavenly guests, with 
 some commendable forgetfulness of himself and his fellow-disciples, 
 that he would have tabernacles for Christ, and Moses, and Elias, but 
 none for himself. He would be content to lie in the open air, on the 
 cold ground, in such good company; if his Master have but where to lay 
 his head, no matter whether he himself has or no.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Yet in this zeal he betrayed a great deal of weakness and 
 ignorance. What need had Moses and Elias of tabernacles? They belonged 
 to that blessed world, <I>where they hunger no more, nor doth the sun 
 light upon them.</I> Christ had lately foretold his sufferings, and 
 bidden his disciples expect the like; Peter forgets this, or, to 
 prevent it, will needs be building tabernacles in the mount of glory, 
 out of the way of trouble. Still he harps upon, <I>Master, spare 
 thyself,</I> though he had been so lately checked for it. Note, There 
 is a proneness in good men to expect the crown without the cross. Peter 
 was for laying hold of this as the prize, though he had not yet fought 
 his fight, nor finished his course, as those other disciples, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:21"><I>ch.</I> xx. 21</A>.

 We are out in our aim, if we look for a heaven here upon earth. It is
 not for strangers and pilgrims (such as we are in our best 
 circumstances in this world), to talk of building, or to expect a 
 continuing city.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Yet it is some excuse for the incongruity of Peter's proposal, not only 
 that <I>he knew not what he said</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:33">Luke ix. 33</A>),

 but also that he submitted the proposal to the wisdom of Christ; <I>If 
 thou wilt, let us make tabernacles.</I> Note, Whatever tabernacles we 
 propose to make to ourselves in this world, we must always remember to 
 ask Christ's leave.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now to this which Peter said, there was no reply made; the disappearing 
 of the glory would soon answer it. They that promise themselves great 
 things on earth will soon be undeceived by their own experience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The glorious testimony which God the Father gave to our Lord Jesus, 
 in which <I>he received from him honour and glory</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:17">2 Pet. i. 17</A>),
 
 when <I>there came this voice from the excellent glory.</I> This was 
 like proclaiming the titles of honour or the royal style of a prince, 
 when, at his coronation, he appears in his robes of state; and be it 
 known, to the comfort of mankind, the royal style of Christ is taken 
 from his mediation. Thus, in vision, he appeared with a rainbow, the 
 seal of the covenant, about his throne 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:3">Rev. iv. 3</A>);

 for it is his glory to be our Redeemer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now concerning this testimony from heaven to Christ, observe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How it came, and in what manner it was introduced.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) There was a cloud. We find often in the Old Testament, that a 
 cloud was the visible token of God's presence; he came down upon mount 
 Sinai in a cloud 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:9">Exod. xix. 9</A>),
 
 and so to Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:5,nu+11:25">Exod. xxxiv. 5; Num. xi. 25</A>.

 He took possession of the tabernacle in a cloud, and afterwards of the 
 temple; where Christ was in his glory, the temple was, and there God 
 showed himself present. We know not the balancing of the clouds, but we 
 know that much of the intercourse and communication between heaven and 
 earth is maintained by them. By the clouds vapours <I>as</I>cend, and 
 rains <I>des</I>cend; therefore God is said to make <I>the clouds his 
 chariots;</I> so he did here when he descended upon this mount.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was a bright cloud. Under the law it was commonly a thick and 
 dark cloud that God made the token of his presence; he came down upon 
 mount Sinai in a thick cloud 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:16">Exod. xix. 16</A>),

 and said he would <I>dwell in thick darkness;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:12">1 Kings viii. 12</A>.

 But <I>we are now come, not to the mount that was covered with thick 
 blackness and darkness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18">Heb. xii. 18</A>),

 but to the mount that is crowned with a bright cloud. Both the 
 Old-Testament and the New-Testament dispensation had tokens of God's 
 presence; but that was a dispensation of darkness, and terror, and 
 bondage, this of light, love, and liberty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It overshadowed them. This cloud was intended to break the force 
 of that great light which otherwise would have overcome the disciples, 
 and have been intolerable; it was like the veil which Moses put upon 
 his face when it shone. God, in manifesting himself to his people, 
 considers their frame. This cloud was to their eyes as parables to 
 their understandings, to convey spiritual things by things sensible, as 
 they were able to bear them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) <I>There came a voice out of the cloud,</I> and it was the voice 
 of God, who now, as of old, <I>spake in the cloudy pillar,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:7">Ps. xcix. 7</A>.

 Here was no thunder, or lightning, or voice of a trumpet, as there was
 when the law was given by Moses, but only a voice, a still small voice, 
 and that not ushered in with a strong wind, or an earthquake, or fire, 
 as when God spake to Elias,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:11,12">1 Kings xix. 11, 12</A>.

 Moses then and Elias were witnesses, that <I>in these last days God
 hath spoken to us by his Son,</I> in another way than he spoke formerly 
 to them. This voice came from the excellent glory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:17">2 Pet. i. 17</A>),

 the glory which excelleth, in comparison of which the former had no 
 glory; though the excellent glory was clouded, yet thence came a voice, 
 for <I>faith comes by hearing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What this testimony from heaven was; <I>This is my beloved Son, hear 
 ye him.</I> Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The great gospel mystery revealed; <I>This is my beloved Son, in 
 whom I am well pleased.</I> This was the very same that was spoken from 
 heaven at his baptism 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:17"><I>ch.</I> iii. 17</A>);

 and it was the best news that ever came from heaven to earth since man
 sinned. It is to the same purport with that great doctrine 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:19">2 Cor. v. 19</A>),

 <I>That God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.</I> 
 Moses and Elias were great men, and favourites of Heaven, yet they were 
 but servants, and servants that God was not always well pleased in; for 
 Moses spoke unadvisedly, and Elias was a man subject to passions; but 
 Christ is <I>a Son,</I> and in him God was always well pleased. Moses 
 and Elias were sometimes instruments of reconciliation between God and 
 Israel; Moses was a great intercessor, and Elias a great reformer; but 
 in Christ God is reconciling the world; his intercession is more 
 prevalent than that of Moses, and his reformation more effectual than 
 that of Elias.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This repetition of the same voice that came from heaven at his baptism 
 was no vain repetition; but, like the doubling of Pharaoh's dream, was
 to show the thing was established. What God hath thus spoken once, yea 
 twice, no doubt he will stand to, and he expects we should take notice 
 of it. It was spoken at his baptism, because then he was entering upon 
 his temptation, and his public ministry; and now it was repeated, 
 because he was entering upon his sufferings, which are to be dated from 
 hence; for now, and not before, he began to foretel them, and 
 immediately after his transfiguration it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:51">Luke ix. 51</A>),

 that <I>the time was come that he should be received up;</I> this 
 therefore was then repeated, to arm him against the terror, and his 
 disciples against the offence, of the cross. When sufferings begin to 
 abound, consolations are given in more abundantly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:5">2 Cor. i. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The great gospel duty required, and it is the condition of our 
 benefit by Christ; <I>Hear ye him.</I> God is well pleased with none in 
 Christ but those that hear him. It is not enough to give him the 
 hearing (what will that avail us?) but we must hear him and believe 
 him, as the great Prophet and Teacher; hear him, and be ruled by him, 
 as the great Prince and Lawgiver; hear him, and heed him. Whoever would 
 know the mind of God, must hearken to Jesus Christ; for by him God has 
 in these last days spoken to us. This voice from heaven has made all 
 the sayings of Christ as authentic as if they had been thus spoken out 
 of a cloud. God does here, as it were, turn us over to Christ for all 
 the revelations of his mind; and it refers to that prediction 
 concerning <I>the Prophet God would raise up like unto Moses</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:18">Deut. xviii. 18</A>);
 
 <I>him shall ye hear.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ now appeared in glory; and the more we see of Christ's glory, 
 the more cause we shall see to hearken to him: but the disciples were 
 gazing on that glory of his which they saw; they are therefore bid not 
 to look at him, but to hear him. Their sight of his glory was soon 
 intercepted by the cloud, but their business was to hear him. We walk 
 <I>by faith,</I> which <I>comes by hearing,</I> not <I>by sight,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:7">2 Cor. v. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses and Elias were now with him; the law and the prophets; hitherto 
 it was said, <I>Hear them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:29">Luke xvi. 29</A>.

 The disciples were ready to equal them with Christ, when they must have
 tabernacles for them as well as for him. They had been talking with 
 Christ, and probably the disciples were very desirous to know what they 
 said, and to hear something more from them; No, saith God, <I>hear 
 him,</I> and that is enough; him, and not Moses and Elias, who were 
 present, and whose silence gave consent to this voice; they had nothing 
 to say to the contrary; whatever interest they had in the world as 
 prophets, they were willing to see it all transferred to Christ, that 
 in <I>all things he might have the pre-eminence.</I> Be not troubled 
 that Moses and Elias make so short a stay with you; hear Christ, and 
 you will not want them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The fright which the disciples were put into by this voice, and the 
 encouragement Christ gave them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The disciples <I>fell on their faces, and were sore afraid.</I> The 
 greatness of the light, and the surprise of it, might have a natural 
 influence upon them, to dispirit them. But that was not all, ever since 
 man sinned, and heard God's voice in the garden, extraordinary 
 appearances of God have ever been terrible to man, who, knowing he has 
 no reason to expect any good, has been afraid to hear any thing 
 immediately from God. Note, even then when <I>fair weather</I> comes 
 <I>out of the secret place,</I> yet <I>with God</I> is <I>terrible 
 majesty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:22">Job xxxvii. 22</A>.

 See what dreadful work <I>the voice of the Lord makes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:4">Ps. xxix. 4</A>.

 It is well for us that God speaks to us by men like ourselves, whose
 terror shall not make us afraid.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ graciously raised them up with abundance of tenderness. Note, 
 The glories and advancements of our Lord Jesus do not at all lessen his 
 regard to, and concern for, his people that are compassed about with 
 infirmity. It is comfortable to think, that now, in his exalted state, 
 he has a compassion for, and condescends to, the meanest true believer. 
 Observe here, 

 (1.). What he did; <I>he came, and touched them.</I> His approaches 
 banished their fears; and when they apprehended that they were 
 apprehended of Christ, there needed no more to make them easy. Christ
 laid his right hand upon John is a like case, and upon Daniel, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:17,Da+8:18,10:18">Rev. i. 17; Dan. viii. 18; x. 18</A>.

 Christ's touches were often healing, and here they were strengthening 
 and comforting.

 (2.) What he said; <I>Arise, and be not afraid.</I> Note, Though a fear 
 of reverence in our converse with Heaven is pleasing to Christ, yet a 
 fear of amazement is not so, but must be striven against. Christ said, 
 <I>Arise.</I> Note, It is Christ by his word, and the power of his 
 grace going along with it, that raises up good men from their 
 dejections, and silences their fears; and none but Christ can do it; 
 <I>Arise, be not afraid.</I> Note, causeless fears would soon vanish, 
 if we would not yield to them, and lie down under them, but get up, and 
 do what we can against them. Considering what they had seen and heard,
 they had more reason to rejoice than to fear, and yet, it seems, they 
 needed this caution. Note, Through the infirmity of the flesh, we
 often frighten ourselves with that wherewith we should encourage 
 ourselves. Observe, After they had an express command from heaven to 
 hear Christ, the first word they had from him was, <I>Be not 
 afraid,</I> hear that. Note, Christ's errand into the world was to give 
 comfort to good people, that, being delivered out of the hands of their 
 enemies, they might <I>serve God without fear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74,75">Luke i. 74, 75</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The disappearing of the vision 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 <I>They</I> lift up themselves, and then <I>lift up their eyes,</I> and 
 <I>saw no man, save Jesus only.</I> Moses and Elias were gone, the rays 
 of Christ's glory were laid aside, or veiled again. They hoped this had 
 been the day of Christ's entrance into his kingdom, and his public 
 appearance in that external splendour which they dreamed of; but see 
 how they are disappointed. Note, It is not wisdom to raise our 
 expectations high in this world, for the most valuable of our glories 
 and joys here are vanishing, even those of near communion with God are 
 so, not a continual feast, but a running banquet. If sometimes we are 
 favoured with special manifestations of divine grace, glimpses and 
 pledges of future glory, yet they are withdrawn presently; two heavens 
 are too much for those to expect that never deserve one. Now <I>they 
 saw no man, save Jesus only.</I> Note, Christ will tarry with us when 
 Moses and Elias are gone. The <I>prophets do not live for ever</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:5">Zec. i. 5</A>),

 and we see the period of our ministers' conversation; but <I>Jesus 
 Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:7,8">Heb. xiii. 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. The discourse between Christ and his disciples as they came down
 from the mountain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:9-13"><I>v.</I> 9-13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. <I>They came down from the mountain.</I> Note, We must come down
 from the holy mountains, where we have communion with God, and 
 complacency in that communion, and of which we are saying. <I>It is 
 good to be here;</I> even there we have no continuing city. Blessed be 
 God, there is a mountain of glory and joy before us, whence we shall 
 never come down. But observe, When the disciples came down, Jesus came 
 with them. Note, When we return to the world again after an ordinance, 
 it must be our care to take Christ with us, and then it may be our 
 comfort that he is with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As they came down, they talked of Christ. Note, When we are 
 returning from holy ordinance, it is good to entertain ourselves and 
 one another with discourse suitable to the work we have been about. 
 That communication which is good to the use of edifying is then in a 
 special manner seasonable; as, on the contrary, that which is corrupt, 
 is worse then than at another time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 (1.) The charge that Christ gave the disciples to keep the vision very 
 private for the present 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 <I>Tell it to no man till the Son of man is risen.</I> If they had 
 proclaimed it, the credibility of it would have been shocked by his 
 sufferings, which were now hastening on. But let the publication of it
 be adjourned till after his resurrection, and then that and his 
 subsequent glory will be a great confirmation of it. Note, Christ 
 observed a method in the manifestation of himself; he would have his 
 works put together, mutually to explain and illustrate each other, that 
 they might appear in their full strength and convincing evidence. Every 
 thing is beautiful in its season. Christ's resurrection was properly 
 the beginning of the gospel state and kingdom, to which all before was 
 but preparatory and by way of preface; and therefore, though this was 
 transacted before, it must not be produced as evidence till then (and 
 then it appears to have been much insisted on by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:16-18">2 Pet. i. 16-18</A>),

 when the religion it was designed for the confirmation of was brought
 to its full consistence and maturity. Christ's time is the best and
 fittest for the manifesting of himself and must be attended to by 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) An objection which the disciples made against something Christ had 
 said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 "<I>Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?</I> If Elias 
 make so short a stay, and is gone so suddenly, and we must say nothing 
 of him; why have we been taught out of the law to expect his public 
 appearance in the world immediately before the setting up of the 
 Messiah's kingdom? Must the coming of Elias be a secret, which every 
 body looks for?" or thus; "If the resurrection of the Messiah, and with 
 it the beginning of his kingdom, be at hand, what becomes of that 
 glorious preface and introduction to it, which we expect in the coming 
 of Elias?" The scribes, who were the public expositors of the law, said 
 this according to the scripture 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:5">Mal. iv. 5</A>);

 <I>Behold I send you Elijah the prophet.</I> The disciples spoke the 
 common language of the Jews, who made that the saying of the scribes 
 which was the saying of the scripture, whereas of that which ministers 
 speak to us according to the word of God, we should say, "<I>God</I> 
 speaks to us, not the <I>ministers;</I>" for we must not receive it 
 <I>as the word of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:13">1 Thess. ii. 13</A>.

 Observe, When the disciples could not reconcile what Christ said with
 what they had heard out of the Old Testament, they desired him to 
 explain it to them. Note, When we are puzzled with scripture 
 difficulties, we must apply ourselves to Christ by prayer for his 
 Spirit to open our understandings and to lead us into all truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The solving of this objection. <I>Ask, and it shall be given,</I> 
 ask instruction, and it shall be given.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Christ allows the prediction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 "<I>Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things;</I> so far 
 you are in the right." Christ did not come to alter or invalidate any 
 thing foretold in the Old Testament. Note, Corrupt and mistaken glosses 
 may be sufficiently rejected and exploded, without diminishing or 
 derogating from the authority or dignity of the sacred text. 
 New-Testament prophecies are true and good, and are to be received and 
 improved, though some hot foolish men may have misinterpreted them and 
 drawn wrong inferences from them. He shall come, and restore all 
 things; not restore them to their former state (John Baptist went not 
 about to do that), but he shall accomplish all things (so it may be 
 read), all things that were written of him, all the predictions of the 
 coming of Elias. John Baptist came to restore things spiritually, to 
 revive the decays of religion, to <I>turn the hearts of the fathers to 
 the children;</I> which means the same with this, <I>he shall restore 
 all things.</I> John preached repentance, and that restores all 
 things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He asserts the accomplishment. The scribes say true, that <I>Elias 
 is come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, God's promises are often fulfilled, and men perceive it not, but 
 enquire, <I>Where is the promise?</I> when it is already performed. 
 <I>Elias is come, and they knew him not;</I> they knew him not to be 
 the Elias promised, the forerunner of the Messiah. The scribes busied
 themselves in criticizing upon the scripture, but understood not by the 
 signs of the times the fulfilling of the scripture. Note, It is easier 
 to explain the word of God than to apply it and make a right use of it. 
 But it is no wonder that the morning star was not observed, when he who 
 is the Sun itself, was <I>in the world, and the world knew him 
 not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Because they knew him not, <I>they have done to him whatsoever they 
 listed;</I> if they had known, they would not have crucified Christ, or 
 beheaded John, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>.

 They ridiculed John, persecuted him, and at last put him to death;
 which was Herod's doing, but is here charged upon the whole generation 
 of unbelieving Jews, and particularly the scribes, who, though they 
 could not prosecute John themselves, were pleased with what Herod did. 
 He adds, <I>Likewise also shall the Son of man suffer of them.</I> 
 Marvel not that Elias should be abused and killed by those who 
 pretended, with a great deal of reverence, to expect him, when the 
 Messiah himself will be in like manner treated. Note, The sufferings
 of Christ took off the strangeness of all other sufferings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:18">John xv. 18</A>);

 when they had imbrued their hands in the blood of John Baptist, they 
 were ready to do the like to Christ. Note, As men deal with Christ's 
 servants, so they would deal with him himself; and they that are drunk 
 with the blood of the martyrs still cry, <I>Give, give,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:1-3">Acts xii. 1-3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The disciples' satisfaction in Christ's reply to their objection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 <I>They understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.</I> He 
 did not name John, but gives them such a description of him as would 
 put them in mind of what he had said to them formerly concerning him; 
 <I>This is Elias.</I> This is a profitable way of teaching; it engages 
 the learners' own thoughts, and makes them, if not their own teachers, 
 yet their own remembrancers; and thus knowledge becomes easy to him 
 that understands. When we diligently use the means of knowledge, how 
 strangely are mists scattered and mistakes rectified!</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him
 a <I>certain</I> man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
 &nbsp; 15  Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatic, and sore
 vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the
 water.
 &nbsp; 16  And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure
 him.
 &nbsp; 17  Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse
 generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer
 you? bring him hither to me.
 &nbsp; 18  And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and
 the child was cured from that very hour.
 &nbsp; 19  Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could
 not we cast him out?
 &nbsp; 20  And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for
 verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard
 seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder
 place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto
 you.
 &nbsp; 21  Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the miraculous cure of a child that was lunatic and vexed 
 with a devil. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A melancholy representation of the case of this child, made to 
 Christ by the afflicted father. This was immediately upon his coming 
 down from the mountain where he was transfigured. Note, Christ's 
 glories do not make him unmindful of us and of our wants and miseries. 
 Christ, when he came down from the mount, where had conversation with 
 Moses and Elias, did not take state upon him, but was as easy of 
 access, as ready to poor beggars, and as familiar with the multitude, 
 as ever he used to be. This poor man's address was very importunate; he 
 came kneeling to Christ. Note, Sense of misery will bring people to 
 their knees. Those who see their need of Christ will be earnest, will 
 be in good earnest, in their applications to him; and he delights to be 
 thus wrestled with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things the father of the child complains of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The distress of his child 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 <I>Lord have mercy on my son.</I> The affliction of the children cannot 
 but affect the tender parents, for they are pieces of themselves. And 
 the case of afflicted children should be presented to God by faithful 
 and fervent prayer. This child's distemper, probably, disabled him to 
 pray for himself. Note, Parents are doubly concerned to pray for their 
 children, not only that are weak and cannot, but much more that are 
 wicked and will not, pray for themselves. Now, 

 (1.). The nature of this child's disease was very sad; <I>He was 
 lunatic and sore vexed.</I> A lunatic is properly one whose distemper 
 lies in the brain, and returns with the change of the moon. The devil,
 by the divine permission, either caused this distemper, or at least 
 concurred with it, to heighten and aggravate it. The child had the 
 falling-sickness, and the hand of Satan was in it; by it he tormented 
 then, and made it much more grievous than ordinarily it is. Those whom
 Satan got possession of, he afflicted by those diseases of the body 
 which do most affect the mind; for it is the soul that he aims to do 
 mischief to. The father, in his complain, saith, <I>He is lunatic,</I> 
 taking notice of the effect; but Christ, in the cure, rebuked the 
 devil, and so struck at the cause. Thus he doth in spiritual cures.
 
 (2.) The effects of the disease were very deplorable; <I>He oft falls 
 into the fire, and into the water.</I> If the force of the disease made 
 him to fall, the malice of the devil made him to fall into the fire or 
 water; so mischievous is he where he gains possession and power in any 
 soul. He <I>seeks to devour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:8">1 Pet. v. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The disappointment of his expectation from the disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);
 
 <I>I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cured him.</I> 
 Christ gave his disciples power to cast out devils 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:1,8"><I>ch.</I> x. 1, 8</A>),

 and therein they were successful 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:17">Luke x. 17</A>);

 yet at this time they failed in the operation, though there were nine 
 of them together, and before a great multitude. Christ permitted this, 
 
 (1.) To keep them humble, and to show their dependence upon him, that 
 without him they could do nothing. 

 (2.) To glorify himself and his own power. It is for the honour of 
 Christ to come in with help at a dead-lift, when other helpers cannot 
 help. Elisha's staff in Gehazi's hand will not raise the child: he must 
 come himself. Note, There are some special favours which Christ 
 reserves the bestowment of to himself; and sometimes he keeps the 
 cistern empty; that he may bring us to himself, the Fountain. But the 
 failures of instruments shall not hinder the operations of his grace, 
 which will work, if not <I>by</I> them, yet <I>without</I> them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The rebukes that Christ gave to the people first, and then to the 
 devil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He chid those about him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 <I>O faithless and perverse generation!</I> This is not spoken to the 
 disciples, but to the people, and perhaps especially to the scribes, 
 who are mentioned in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:14">Mark ix. 14</A>,

 and who, as it should seem, insulted over the disciples, because they
 had now met with a case that was too hard for them. Christ himself 
 could not do many mighty works among a people in whom unbelief reigned.
 It was here owing to the faithlessness of this generation, that they 
 could not obtain those blessings from God, which otherwise they might 
 have had; as it was owing to the weakness of the disciples' faith, that 
 they could not do those works for God, which otherwise they might have 
 done. They were faithless and perverse. Note, Those that are faithless 
 will be perverse; and perverseness is sin in its worst colours. Faith 
 is compliance with God, unbelief is opposition and contradiction to 
 God. Israel of old was perverse, because faithless

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:9">Ps. xcv. 9</A>),

 forward, for in them is no faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:20">Deut. xxxii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things he upbraids them with. 

 (1.) His presence with them so long; "<I>How long shall I be with 
 you?</I> Will you always need my bodily presence, and never come to 
 such maturity as to be fit to be left, the people to the conduct of the 
 disciples, and the disciples to the conduct of the Spirit and of their 
 commission? Must the child be always carried, and will it never learn 
 to go alone?" 

 (2.) His patience with them so long; <I>How long shall I suffer 
 you?</I> Note,

 [1.] The faithlessness and perverseness of those who enjoy the means of 
 grace are a great grief to the Lord Jesus. Thus did he suffer the 
 manners of Israel of old, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:18">Acts xiii. 18</A>.

 [2.] The longer Christ has borne with a perverse and faithless people, 
 the more he is displeased with their perverseness and unbelief; and he 
 is God, and not man, else he would not suffer so long, nor bear so 
 much, as he doth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He cured the child, and set him to-rights again. He called, <I>Bring 
 him hither to me.</I> Though the people were perverse, and Christ was 
 provoked, yet care was taken of the child. Note, Though Christ may be 
 angry, he is never unkind, nor doth he, in the greatest of his 
 displeasure, shut up the bowels of his compassion from the miserable; 
 <I>Bring him to me.</I> Note, When all other helps and succours fail, 
 we are welcome to Christ, and may be confident in him and in his power 
 and goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here an emblem of Christ's undertaking as our Redeemer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He breaks the power of Satan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 <I>Jesus rebuked the devil,</I> as one having authority, who could back 
 with force his word of command. Note, Christ's victories over Satan are 
 obtained by the power of his word, the sword that comes out of his 
 mouth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:21">Rev. xix. 21</A>.

 Satan cannot stand before the rebukes of Christ, though his possession 
 has been ever so long. It is comfortable to those who are wrestling 
 with principalities and powers, that Christ hath spoiled them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Colos. ii. 15</A>.

 The lion of the tribe of Judah will be too hard for the roaring lion
 that seeks to devour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He redresses the grievances of the children of men; <I>The child 
 was cured from that very hour.</I> It was an immediate cure, and a 
 perfect one. This is an encouragement to parents to bring their 
 children to Christ, whose souls are under Satan's power; he is able to 
 heal them, and as willing as he is able. Not only bring them to Christ 
 by prayer, but bring them to the word of Christ, the ordinary means by 
 which Satan's strongholds are demolished in the soul. Christ's rebukes, 
 brought home to the heart, will ruin Satan's power there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's discourse with his disciples hereupon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They ask the reason why they could not cast out the devil at this 
 time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 <I>They came to Jesus apart.</I> Note, Ministers, who are to deal for 
 Christ in public, have need to keep up a private communion with him, 
 that they may in secret, where no eye sees, bewail their weakness and 
 straitness, their follies and infirmities, in their public 
 performances, and enquire into the cause of them. We should make use of 
 the liberty of access we have to Jesus apart, where we may be free and 
 particular with him. Such questions as the disciples put to Christ, we 
 should put to ourselves, in communing with our own hearts upon our 
 beds; Why were we so dull and careless at such a time? Why came we so 
 much short in such a duty? That which is amiss may, when found out, be 
 amended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ gives them two reasons why they failed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It was <I>because of their unbelief,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 When he spake to the father of the child and to the people, he charged 
 it upon their unbelief; when he spake to his disciples, he charged it 
 upon theirs; for the truth was, there were faults on both sides; but we 
 are more concerned to hear of our own faults than of other people's, 
 and to impute what is amiss to ourselves than to others. When the 
 preaching of the word seems not to be so successful as sometimes it has 
 been, the people are apt to lay all the fault upon the ministers, and 
 the ministers upon the people; whereas, it is more becoming for each to 
 own his own faultiness, and to say, "It is owing to me." Ministers, in 
 reproving, must learn thus to give to each his portion of the word; and 
 to take people off from judging others, by teaching all to judge 
 themselves; <I>It is because of your unbelief.</I> Though they had 
 faith, yet that faith was weak and ineffectual. Note,

 [1.] As far as faith falls short of its due strength, vigour, and 
 activity, it may truly be said, "There is unbelief." Many are 
 chargeable with unbelief, who yet are not to be called 
 <I>unbelievers.</I> 

 [2.] It is because of our unbelief, that we bring so little to pass in 
 religion, and so often miscarry, and come short, in that which is 
 good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus takes this occasion to show them the power of faith, 
 that they might not be defective in that, another time, as they were 
 now; <I>If ye have faith as a grain of mustard-seed,</I> ye shall do 
 wonders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Some make the comparison to refer to the quality of the mustard-seed, 
 which is, when bruised, sharp and penetrating; "If you have an active 
 growing faith, not dead, flat, or insipid, you will not be baffled 
 thus." But it rather refers to the quantity; "If you had but a grain of 
 true faith, though so little that it were like that which is the least 
 of all seeds, you would do wonders." Faith in general is a firm assent 
 to, a compliance with, and a confidence in, all divine revelation. The 
 faith here required, is that which had for its object that particular 
 revelation by which Christ gave his disciples power to work miracles in 
 his name, for the confirmation of the doctrine they preached. It was a 
 faith in this revelation that they were defective in; either doubting 
 the validity of their commission, or fearing that it expired with their 
 first mission, and was not to continue when they were returning to 
 their Master; or that it was some way or other forfeited or withdrawn. 
 Perhaps their Master's absence with the three chief of his disciples, 
 with a charge to the rest not to follow them, might occasion some 
 doubts concerning their power, or rather the power of the Lord with 
 them, to do this; however, there were not, at present, such a strong 
 actual dependence upon, and confidence in, the promise of Christ's 
 presence with them, as there should have been. It is good for us to be 
 diffident of ourselves and of our own strength; but it is displeasing 
 to Christ, when we distrust any power derived from him or granted by 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If ye have ever so little of this faith in sincerity, if ye truly rely 
 upon the powers committed to you, <I>ye shall say to this mountain, 
 Remove.</I> This is a proverbial expression, denoting that which 
 follows, and no more, <I>Nothing shall be impossible to you.</I> They 
 had a full commission, among other things, to cast out devils without 
 exception; but, this devil being more than ordinarily malicious and 
 inveterate, they distrusted the power they had received, and so failed. 
 To convince them of this, Christ shows them what they might have done. 
 Note, An active faith can remove mountains, not of itself, but in the 
 virtue of a divine power engaged by a divine promise, both which faith 
 fastens upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Because there was something in the kind of the malady, which 
 rendered the cure more than ordinarily difficult 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 "<I>This kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting.</I> This 
 possession, which works by a falling-sickness, or this kind of devils 
 that are thus furious, is not cast out ordinarily but by great acts of 
 devotion, and wherein ye were defective." Note,

 [1.] Though the adversaries we wrestle, be all principalities and 
 powers, yet some are stronger than others, and their power more hardly 
 broken. 

 [2.] The extraordinary power of Satan must not discourage our faith, 
 but quicken us to a greater intenseness in the acting of it, and more 
 earnestness in praying to God for the increase of it; so some 
 understand it here; "This kind of faith (which removeth mountains) doth 
 not proceed, is not obtained, from God, nor is it carried up to its 
 full growth, nor drawn out into act and exercise, but by earnest 
 prayer." 

 [3.] Fasting and prayer are proper means for the bringing down of 
 Satan's power against us, and the fetching in of divine power to our 
 assistance. Fasting is of use to put an edge upon prayer; it is an 
 evidence and instance of humiliation which is necessary in prayer, and 
 is a means of mortifying some corrupt habits, and of disposing the body 
 to serve the soul in prayer. When the devil's interest in the soul is 
 confirmed by the temper and constitution of the body, fasting must be 
 joined with prayer, to keep under the body.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The
 Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:
 &nbsp; 23  And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be
 raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ here foretels his own sufferings; he began to do it before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:21"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 21</A>);

 and, finding that it was to his disciples a hard saying, he saw it
 necessary to repeat it. There are some things which <I>God speaketh 
 once, yea twice, and yet man perceiveth it not.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he foretold concerning himself--that he should be betrayed and
 killed. He perfectly knew, before, all things that should come to him, 
 and yet undertook the work of our redemption, which greatly commends 
 his love; nay, his clear foresight of them was a kind of ante-passion, 
 had not his love to man made all easy to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He tells them that he should <I>be betrayed into the hands of 
 men.</I> He <I>shall be delivered up</I> (so it might be read and 
 understood of his Father's delivering him up <I>by his determined 
 counsel and fore-knowledge,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23,Ro+8:32">Acts ii. 23; Rom. viii. 32</A>);

 but as we render it, it refers to Judas's betraying him into the hands
 of the priests, and their betraying him into the hands of the Romans. 
 He was <I>betrayed into the hands of men;</I> men to whom he was allied 
 by nature, and from whom therefore he might expect pity and tenderness; 
 men whom he had undertaken to save, and from whom therefore he might 
 expect honour and gratitude; yet these are his persecutors and 
 murderers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That <I>they should kill him;</I> nothing less than that would 
 satisfy their rage; it was his blood, his precious blood, that they 
 thirsted after. <I>This is the heir, come, let us kill him.</I> Nothing 
 less would satisfy God's justice, and answer his undertaking; if he be 
 a Sacrifice of atonement, he must be killed; without blood no 
 remission.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That <I>he shall be raised again the third day.</I> Still, when he 
 spoke of his death, he gave a hint of his resurrection, <I>the joy set 
 before him,</I> in the prospect of which <I>he endured the cross, and 
 despised the shame.</I> This was an encouragement, not only to him, but 
 to his disciples; for if he rise the third day, his absence from them 
 will not be long, and his return to them will be glorious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How the disciples received this; <I>They were exceedingly sorry.</I> 
 Herein appeared their love to their Master's person, but with all their 
 ignorance and mistake concerning his undertaking. Peter indeed durst 
 not say any thing against it, as he had done before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:22"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 22</A>),

 having then been severely chidden for it; but he, and the rest of them,
 greatly lamented it, as it would be their own loss, their Master's 
 grief, and the sin and ruin of them that did it.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received
 tribute <I>money</I> came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay
 tribute?
 &nbsp; 25  He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus
 prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the
 kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children,
 or of strangers?
 &nbsp; 26  Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him,
 Then are the children free.
 &nbsp; 27  Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the
 sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up;
 and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of
 money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of Christ's paying tribute.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Observe how it was demanded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Christ was now at Capernaum, his headquarters, where he mostly resided; 
 he did not keep from thence, to decline being called upon for his dues, 
 but rather came thither, to be ready to pay them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The tribute demanded was not any civil payment to the Roman powers, 
 that was strictly exacted by the publicans, but the church-duties, the 
 half shekel, about fifteen pence, which were required from every person 
 or the service of the temple, and the defraying of the expenses of the 
 worship there; it is called <I>a ransom for the soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:12">Exod. xxx. 12</A>,
 
 &c. This was not so strictly exacted now as sometimes it had been,
 especially not in Galilee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The demand was very modest; the collectors stood in such awe of 
 Christ, because of his mighty works, that they durst not speak to him 
 about it, but applied themselves to Peter, whose house was in 
 Capernaum, and probably in his house Christ lodged; he therefore was 
 fittest to be spoken to as the housekeeper, and they presumed he knew 
 his Master's mind. Their question is, <I>Doth not your master pay 
 tribute?</I> Some think that they sought an occasion against him, 
 designing, if he refused, to represent him as disaffected to the 
 temple-service, and his followers as lawless people, that would pay 
 <I>neither toll, tribute, nor custom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:13">Ezra iv. 13</A>.

 It should rather seem, they asked this with respect, intimating, that
 if he had any privilege to exempt him from this payment, they would not 
 insist upon it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Peter presently his word for his Master; "<I>Yes,</I> certainly; my 
 <I>Master pays tribute;</I> it is his principle and practice; you need 
 not fear moving it to him." 

 (1.) <I>He was made under the law</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:4">Gal. iv. 4</A>);

 therefore under this law he was paid for at forty days old 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:22">Luke ii. 22</A>),
 
 and now he paid for himself, as one who, in his state of humiliation, 
 <I>had taken upon him the form of a servant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:7,8">Phil. ii. 7, 8</A>.

 (2.) <I>He was made sin for us,</I> and was <I>sent forth in the 
 likeness of sinful flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Rom. viii. 3</A>.

 Now this tax paid to the temple is called <I>an atonement for the
 soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:15">Exod. xxx. 15</A>.

 Christ, that in every thing he might <I>appear in the likeness of
 sinners,</I> paid it though he had no sin to atone for.

 (3.) <I>Thus it became him to fulfil all righteousness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:15"><I>ch.</I> iii. 15</A>.

 He did this to set an example, 

 [1.] Of <I>rendering to all their due, tribute to whom tribute is
 due,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:7">Rom. xiii. 7</A>.

 The kingdom of Christ not being of this world, the favourites and
 officers of it are so far from having a power granted them, as such, to 
 tax other people's purses, that theirs are made liable to the powers 
 that are.

 [2.] Of contributing to the support of the public worship of God in the 
 places where we are. If we reap spiritual things, it is fit that we 
 should return carnal things. The temple was now made a den of thieves, 
 and the temple-worship a pretence for the opposition which the chief 
 priests gave to Christ and his doctrine; and yet Christ paid this 
 tribute. Note, Church-duties, legally imposed, are to be paid, 
 notwithstanding church-corruptions. We must take care not to use <I>our 
 liberty as a cloak of covetousness or maliciousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:16">1 Pet. ii. 16</A>.

 If Christ pay tribute, who can pretend an exemption?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How it was disputed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 not with the collectors themselves, lest they should be irritated, but 
 with Peter, that he might be satisfied in the reason why Christ paid 
 tribute, and might not mistake about it. He brought the collectors into 
 the house; but Christ anticipated him, to give him a proof of his 
 omniscience, and that no thought can be withholden from him. The 
 disciples of Christ are never attacked without his knowledge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 1. He appeals to the way of the kings of the earth, which is, to take 
 tribute of strangers, of the subjects of their kingdom, or foreigners 
 that deal with them, but not of their own children that are of their 
 families; there is such a community of goods between parents and 
 children, and a joint-interest in what they have, that it would be 
 absurd for the parents to levy taxes upon the children, or demand any 
 thing from them; it is like one hand taxing the other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He applies this to himself; <I>Then are the children free.</I> 
 Christ is the Son of God, and Heir of all things; the temple is his 
 temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal. iii. 1</A>),

 his Father's house 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:16">John ii. 16</A>),

 in it <I>he is faithful as a Son in his own house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:6">Heb. iii. 6</A>),

 and therefore not obliged to pay this tax for the service of the 
 temple. Thus Christ asserts his right, lest his paying this tribute
 should be misimproved to the weakening of his title as the Son of God, 
 and the King of Israel, and should have looked like a disowning of it 
 himself. These immunities of the children are to be extended no
 further than our Lord Jesus himself. God's children are freed by grace 
 and adoption from the slavery of sin and Satan, but not from their 
 subjection to civil magistrates in civil things; here the law of Christ 
 is express; <I>Let every soul</I> (sanctified souls not excepted) <I>be 
 subject to the higher powers. Render to C&aelig;sar the things that are 
 C&aelig;sar's.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How it was paid, notwithstanding, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For what reason Christ waived his privilege, and paid this tribute, 
 though he was entitled to an exemption--<I>Lest we should offend
 them.</I> Few knew, as Peter did, that he was <I>the Son of God;</I> 
 and it would have been a diminution to the honour of that great truth, 
 which was yet a secret, to advance it now, to serve such a purpose as 
 this. Therefore Christ drops that argument, and considers, that if he 
 should refuse this payment, it would increase people's prejudice 
 against him and his doctrine, and alienate their affections from him, 
 and therefore he resolves to pay it. Note, Christian prudence and 
 humility teach us, in many cases, to recede from our right, rather than 
 give offence by insisting upon it. We must never decline our duty for 
 fear of giving offence (Christ's preaching and miracles offended them, 
 yet he went on with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:12,13"><I>ch.</I> xv. 12, 13</A>,

 better offend men than God); but we must sometimes deny ourselves in
 that which is our secular interest, rather than give offence; as Paul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:13,Ro+14:13">1 Cor. viii. 13; Rom. xiv. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What course he took for the payment of this tax; he furnished 
 himself with money for it out of the mouth of a fish 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 wherein appears,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The poverty of Christ; he had not fifteen pence at command to pay 
 his tax with, though he cured so many that were diseased; it seems, he 
 did all gratis; <I>for our sakes he became poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:9">2 Cor. viii. 9</A>.

 In his ordinary expenses, he lived upon alms

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:3">Luke viii. 3</A>),

 and in extraordinary ones, he lived upon miracles. He did not order 
 Judas to pay this out of the bag which he carried; that was for 
 subsistence, and he would not order that for his particular use, which 
 was intended for the benefit of the community.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The power of Christ, in fetching money out of a fish's mouth for 
 this purpose. Whether his omnipotence put it there, or his omniscience 
 knew that it was there, it comes all to one; it was an evidence of his 
 divinity, and that he is Lord of hosts. Those creatures that are most
 remote from man are at the command of Christ, even the fishes of the 
 sea are under his feet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:5">Ps. viii. 5</A>);

 and to evidence his dominion in this lower world, and to accommodate 
 himself to his present state of humiliation, he chose to take it out of 
 a fish's mouth, when he could have taken it out of an angel's hand. Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Peter must catch the fish by angling. Even in miracles he would 
 use means to encourage industry and endeavour. Peter has something to 
 do, and it is in the way of his own calling too; to teach us diligence 
 in the employment we are called <I>to,</I> and called <I>in.</I> Do we 
 expect that Christ should give to us? Let us be ready to work for 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The fish came up, with money in the mouth of it, which represents 
 to us the reward of obedience in obedience. What work we do at Christ's 
 command brings its own pay along with it: <I>In</I> keeping God's 
 commands, as well as <I>after</I> keeping them, <I>there is great 
 reward,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:11">Ps. xix. 11</A>.

 Peter was made a fisher of men, and those that he caught thus, came up;
 where the heart is opened to entertain Christ's word, the hand is open 
 to encourage his ministers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The piece of money was just enough to pay the tax for Christ and 
 Peter. Thou shalt find <I>a stater,</I> the value of a Jewish shekel, 
 which would pay the poll-tax for two, for it was half a shekel, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:13">Exod. xxx. 13</A>.

 Christ could as easily have commanded a bag of money as a piece of
 money; but he would teach us not to covet superfluities, but, having 
 enough for our present occasions, therewith to be content, and not to 
 distrust God, though we live but from hand to mouth. Christ made the 
 fish his cash-keeper; and why may not we make God's providence our 
 storehouse and treasury? If we have a competency for today, <I>let 
 to-morrow take thought for the things of itself.</I> Christ paid for 
 himself and Peter, because it is probable that here <I>he</I> only was 
 assessed, and of him it was at this time demanded; perhaps the rest had 
 paid already, or were to pay elsewhere. The papists make a great 
 mystery of Christ's paying for Peter, as if this made him the head and 
 representative of the whole church; whereas the payment of tribute for 
 him was rather a sign of subjection than of superiority. His pretended 
 successors pay no tribute, but exact it. Peter fished for this money, 
 and therefore part of it went for his use. Those that are <I>workers 
 together with Christ</I> in winning souls shall shine with him. <I>Give 
 it for thee and me.</I> What Christ paid for himself was looked upon as 
 a debt; what he paid for Peter was a courtesy to him. Note, it is a 
 desirable thing, if God so please, to have wherewithal of this world's 
 goods, not only to be just, but to be kind; not only to be charitable 
 to the poor, but obliging to our friends. What is a great estate good 
 for, but that it enables a man to do so much the more good?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Observe, The evangelist records here the orders Christ 
 gave to Peter, the warrant; the effect is not particularly mentioned,
 but taken for granted, and justly; for, with Christ, saying and doing 
 are the same thing.</P>
