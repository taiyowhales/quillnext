 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is a continuation of Christ's discourses in the temple, 
 two or three days before he died. His discourses then are largely 
 recorded, as being of special weight and consequence. In this chapter, 
 we have, 

 I. Instruction given, by the parable of the marriage-supper, concerning
 the rejection of the Jews, and the calling of the Gentiles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>),

 and, by the doom of the guest that had not the wedding-garment, the
 danger of hypocrisy in the profession of Christianity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.

 II. Disputes with the Pharisees, Sadducees, and scribes, who opposed
 Christ, 
 
 1. Concerning paying tribute to C&aelig;sar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:15-22">ver. 15-22</A>.

 2. Concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the future state,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:23-33">ver. 23-33</A>.

 3. Concerning the great commandment of the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:34-40">ver. 34-40</A>.
 
 4. Concerning the relation of the Messiah to David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:41-46">ver. 41-46</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and
 said,
 &nbsp; 2  The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made
 a marriage for his son,
 &nbsp; 3  And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to
 the wedding: and they would not come.
 &nbsp; 4  Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which
 are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and <I>my</I>
 fatlings <I>are</I> killed, and all things <I>are</I> ready: come unto the
 marriage.
 &nbsp; 5  But they made light of <I>it,</I> and went their ways, one to his
 farm, another to his merchandise:
 &nbsp; 6  And the remnant took his servants, and entreated <I>them</I>
 spitefully, and slew <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 7  But when the king heard <I>thereof,</I> he was wroth: and he sent
 forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up
 their city.
 &nbsp; 8  Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
 which were bidden were not worthy.
 &nbsp; 9  Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall
 find, bid to the marriage.
 &nbsp; 10  So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
 together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the
 wedding was furnished with guests.
 &nbsp; 11  And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a
 man which had not on a wedding garment:
 &nbsp; 12  And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not
 having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
 &nbsp; 13  Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot,
 and take him away, and cast <I>him</I> into outer darkness; there
 shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
 &nbsp; 14  For many are called, but few <I>are</I> chosen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the parable of the guests invited to <I>the 
 wedding-feast.</I> In this it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>Jesus answered,</I> not to what his opposers <I>said</I> (for they
 were put to silence), but to what they <I>thought,</I> when they were 
 wishing for an opportunity to <I>lay hands on him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:46"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 46</A>.

 Note, Christ knows how to answer men's thoughts, for he is a Discerner
 of them. Or, He <I>answered,</I> that is, he continued his discourse to 
 the same purport; for this parable represents the gospel offer, and the 
 entertainment it meets with, as the former, but under another 
 similitude. The parable of the vineyard represents the sin of the 
 rulers that persecuted the prophets; it shows also the sin of the 
 people, who generally neglected the message, while their great ones 
 were persecuting the messengers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Gospel preparations are here represented by a feast which a king 
 made <I>at the marriage of his son;</I> such is <I>the kingdom of 
 heaven,</I> such the provision made for precious souls, in and by the 
 new covenant. The <I>King</I> is God, <I>a great King, King of 
 kings.</I> Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is <I>a marriage made for his son,</I> Christ is the 
 Bridegroom, the church is the bride; the gospel-day is <I>the day of 
 his espousals,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:11">Cant. iii. 11</A>.

 Behold by faith <I>the church of the first-born, that are written in 
 heaven,</I> and were given to Christ by him whose they were; and in 
 them you see <I>the bride, the Lamb's wife,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:9">Rev. xxi. 9</A>.

 The gospel covenant is a marriage covenant betwixt Christ and
 believers, and it is a marriage of God's making. This branch of the 
 similitude is only mentioned, and not prosecuted here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is <I>a dinner prepared for this marriage,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 All the privileges of church-membership, and all the blessings of the 
 new covenant, pardon of sin, the favour of God, peace of conscience, 
 the promises of the gospel, and all the riches contained in them, 
 access to the throne of grace, the comforts of the Spirit, and a 
 well-grounded hope of eternal life. These are the preparations for this 
 feast, a heaven upon earth now, and a heaven in heaven shortly. God has 
 prepared it in his counsel, in his covenant. It is a dinner, denoting 
 present privileges in the midst of our day, beside the supper at night 
 in glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is <I>a feast.</I> Gospel preparations were prophesied of as 
 <I>a feast</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:6">Isa. xxv. 6</A>),

 <I>a feast of fat things,</I> and were typified by the many festivals
 of the ceremonial law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:8">1 Cor. v. 8</A>);

 <I>Let us keep the feast.</I> A <I>feast is a good day</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+7:17">Esth. vii. 17</A>);

 so is the gospel; it is a continual feast. <I>Oxen and fatlings are 
 killed</I> for this feast; no niceties, but substantial food; enough, 
 and enough of the best. The day of a feast is <I>a day of 
 slaughter,</I> or sacrifice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:5">Jam. v. 5</A>.

 Gospel preparations are all founded in the death of Christ, his
 sacrifice of himself. A feast was made for love, it is a reconciliation 
 feast, a token of God's goodwill toward men. It was made <I>for 
 laughter</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:19">Eccl. x. 19</A>),

 it is a rejoicing feast. It was made for fulness; the design of the
 gospel was to fill every <I>hungry soul with good things.</I> It was 
 made for fellowship, to maintain an intercourse between heaven and 
 earth. We are sent for <I>to the banquet of wine, that we may tell what 
 is our petition, and what is our request.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is a <I>wedding feast.</I> Wedding feasts are usually rich, 
 free, and joyful. The first miracle Christ wrought, was, to make 
 plentiful provision for a wedding feast 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:7">John ii. 7</A>);

 and surely then he will not be wanting in provision for his own wedding 
 feast, when <I>the marriage of the Lamb is come, and the bride hath 
 made herself ready,</I> a victorious triumphant feast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:7,17,18">Rev. xix. 7, 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It is a <I>royal wedding feast;</I> it is <I>the feast of a 
 king</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:36">1 Sam. xxv. 36</A>),

 at the marriage, not of a servant, but of a son; and then, if ever, he 
 will, like Ahasuerus, show <I>the riches of his glorious kingdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:4">Esth. i. 4</A>.

 The provision made for believers in the covenant of grace, is not such
 as worthless worms, like us, had any reason to expect, but such as it 
 becomes <I>the King of glory</I> to give. He gives like himself; for he 
 gives himself to be to them <I>El shaddai--a God that is enough,</I> a 
 feast indeed for a soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Gospel calls and offers are represented by an invitation to this 
 feast. Those that make a feast will have guests to grace the feast 
 with. God's guests are the children of men. <I>Lord, what is man,</I> 
 that he should be thus dignified! <I>The guests</I> that were first 
 invited were the Jews; wherever the gospel is preached, this invitation 
 is given; ministers are the <I>servants</I> that are sent to invite, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:4,5">Prov. ix. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 1. The guests <I>are called, bidden</I> to the wedding. All that are 
 within hearing of the joyful sound of the gospel, to them is the word 
 of this invitation sent. The servants that bring the invitation do not 
 set down their names in a paper; there is no occasion for that, since 
 none are excluded but those that exclude themselves. <I>Those that are 
 bidden to the dinner are bidden to the wedding;</I> for all that 
 partake of gospel privileges are to give a due and respectful 
 attendance on the Lord Jesus, as the faithful friends and humble 
 servants of the Bridegroom. They are <I>bidden to the wedding,</I> that 
 they may <I>go forth to meet the bridegroom;</I> for it is the Father's 
 will that <I>all men should honour the Son.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The guests are called upon; for in the gospel there are not only 
 gracious proposals made, but gracious persuasives. <I>We persuade men, 
 we beseech them in Christ's stead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:11,20">2 Cor. v. 11, 20</A>.

 See how much Christ's heart is set upon the happiness of poor souls! He
 not only provides for them, in consideration of their want, but sends 
 to them, in consideration of their weakness and forgetfulness. When the 
 invited guests were slack in coming, the king <I>sent forth other 
 servants,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 When the prophets of the Old Testament prevailed not, nor John the 
 Baptist, nor Christ himself, who told them the entertainment was almost 
 ready (<I>the kingdom of God was at hand</I>), the apostles and 
 ministers of the gospel were sent after Christ's resurrection, to tell 
 them it was come, it was quite ready; and to persuade them to accept 
 the offer. One would think it had been enough to give men an intimation 
 that they had leave to come, and should be welcome; that, during the 
 solemnity of the wedding, the king kept open house; but, because <I>the 
 natural man discerns not,</I> and therefore desires not, <I>the things 
 of the Spirit of God,</I> we are pressed to accept the call by the most 
 powerful inducements, <I>drawn with the cords of a man, and all the 
 bonds of love.</I> If the repetition of the call will move us, 
 <I>Behold, the Spirit saith, Come; and the bride saith, Come; let him 
 that heareth say, Come; let him that is athirst come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:17">Rev. xxii. 17</A>.
 
 If the reason of the call will work upon us, <I>Behold, the dinner is 
 prepared, the oxen and fatlings are killed, and all things are 
 ready;</I> the Father is ready to accept of us, the Son to intercede 
 for us, the Spirit to sanctify us; pardon is ready; peace is ready, 
 comfort is ready; the promises are ready, as <I>wells of living 
 water</I> for supply; ordinances are ready, as golden pipes for 
 conveyance; angels are ready to attend us, creatures are ready to be in 
 league with us, providences are ready to work for our good, and heaven, 
 at last, is ready to receive us; it is <I>a kingdom prepared, ready to 
 be revealed in the last time.</I> Is all this ready; and shall we be 
 unready? Is all this preparation made for us; and is there any room to 
 doubt of our welcome, if we come in a right manner? Come, therefore, O 
 <I>come to the marriage; we beseech you, receive not</I> all this 
 <I>grace of God in vain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:1">2 Cor. vi. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The cold treatment which the gospel of Christ often meets with 
 among the children of men, represented by the cold treatment that this 
 message met with and the hot treatment that the messengers met with, in 
 both which the king himself and the royal bridegroom are affronted. 
 This reflects primarily upon the Jews, who rejected the counsel of God 
 against themselves; but it looks further, to the contempt that would, 
 by many in all ages, be put upon, and the opposition that would be 
 given to, the gospel of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The message was basely slighted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 <I>They would not come.</I> Note, The reason why sinners come not to 
 Christ and salvation by him is, not because they <I>cannot,</I> but 
 because <I>they will not</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:40">John v. 40</A>);

 <I>Ye will not come to me.</I> This will aggravate the misery of 
 sinners, that they might have had happiness for the coming for, but it 
 was their own act and deed to refuse it. <I>I would, and ye would 
 not.</I> But this was not all 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 <I>they made light of it;</I> they thought it not worth coming for; 
 thought the messengers made more ado than needs; let them magnify the 
 preparations ever so much, they could feast as well at home. Note, 
 Making light of Christ, and of the great salvation wrought out by him, 
 is the damning sin of the world. <B><I>Amelesantes</I></B>--<I>They
 were careless.</I> Note, Multitudes perish eternally through mere 
 carelessness, who have not any direct aversion, but a prevailing 
 indifference, to the matters of their souls, and an unconcernedness 
 about them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And the reason why <I>they made light of the marriage feast</I> was, 
 because they had other things that they minded more, and had more mind 
 to; <I>they went their ways, one to his farm, and another to his 
 merchandise.</I> Note, The business and profit of worldly employments 
 prove to many a great hindrance in closing with Christ: none turn their 
 back on the feast, but with some plausible excuse or other, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:18">Luke xiv. 18</A>.
 
 The country people have their farms to look after, about which there is
 always something or other to do; the town's people must tend their 
 shops, and be constant upon the exchange; they must <I>buy, and sell, 
 and get gain.</I> It is true, that both farmers and merchants must be 
 diligent in their business but not so as to keep them from making 
 religion their main business. <I>Licitis perimus omnes--These lawful
 things undo us,</I> when they are unlawfully managed, when we are so 
 <I>careful and troubled about many things</I> as to neglect the <I>one 
 thing needful.</I> Observe, Both the city and the country have their 
 temptations, the merchandise in the one, and the farms in the other; so 
 that, whatever we have of the world in our hands, our care must be to 
 keep it out of our hearts, lest it come between us and Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The messengers were basely abused; <I>The remnant,</I> or the rest 
 of them, that is, those who did not go the <I>farms,</I> or 
 <I>merchandise,</I> were neither husbandmen nor tradesmen, but 
 ecclesiastics, <I>the scribes, and Pharisees, and chief priests;</I> 
 these were the persecutors, these <I>took the servants, and treated 
 them spitefully, and slew them.</I> This, in the parable, is 
 unaccountable, never any could be so rude and barbarous as this, to 
 servants that came to invite them to a feast; but, in the application 
 of the parable, it was matter of fact; they whose <I>feet</I> should 
 have been <I>beautiful,</I> because they brought <I>the glad tidings of 
 the solemn feasts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:15">Nahum i. 15</A>),

 were <I>treated as the offscouring of all things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:13">1 Cor. iv. 13</A>.

 The prophets and John the Baptist had been thus abused already, and the 
 apostles and ministers of Christ must count upon the same. The Jews 
 were, either directly or indirectly, agents in most of the persecutions 
 of the first preachers of the gospel; witness the history of <I>the 
 Acts,</I> that is, the sufferings <I>of the apostles.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The utter ruin that was coming upon the Jewish church and nation is 
 here represented by the revenge which the king, in wrath, took on these 
 insolent recusants 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 <I>He was wroth.</I> The Jews, who had been the people of God's love 
 and blessing, by rejecting the gospel became the generation of his 
 wrath and curse. <I>Wrath came upon them to the uttermost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:16">1 Thess. ii. 16</A>.
 
 Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was the crying sin that brought the ruin; it was their being 
 <I>murderers.</I> He does not say, he destroyed those <I>despisers of 
 his call,</I> but <I>those murderers of his servants;</I> as if God 
 were more jealous for the lives of his ministers than for the honour of 
 his gospel; he that <I>toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his 
 eye.</I> Note, Persecution of Christ's faithful ministers fills the 
 measure of guilt more than any thing. <I>Filling Jerusalem with 
 innocent blood</I> was that sin of Manasseh which <I>the Lord would not 
 pardon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:4">2 Kings xxiv. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What was the ruin itself, that was coming; <I>He sent forth his 
 armies.</I> The Roman armies were his armies, of his raising, of his 
 sending against the people of his wrath; and he <I>gave them a charge 
 to tread them down,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6">Isa. x. 6</A>.

 God is the Lord of men's host, and makes what use he pleases of them,
 to serve his own purposes, though they <I>mean not so, neither doth 
 their heart think so,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7">Isa. x. 7</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:11,12">Mic. iv. 11, 12</A>.

 <I>His armies destroyed those murderers, and burnt up their city.</I>
 This points out very plainly the destruction of the Jews, and the 
 burning of Jerusalem, by the Romans, forty years after this. No age 
 ever saw a greater desolation than that, nor more of the direful 
 effects of fire and sword. Though Jerusalem had been a <I>holy city, 
 the city that God had chosen, to put his name there, beautiful for 
 situation, the joy of the whole earth;</I> yet that city being now 
 <I>become a harlot, righteousness being no longer lodged in it, but 
 murderers, the worst of murderers</I> (as the prophet speaks,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:21">Isa. i. 21</A>),

 judgment came upon it, and ruin without remedy; and it is set forth for
 an example to all that should oppose Christ and his gospel. It was the
 Lord's doing, to avenge the quarrel of his covenant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The replenishing of the church again, by the bringing in of the 
 Gentiles, is here represented by the furnishing of the feast with 
 guests <I>out of the high-ways,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The complaint of the master of the feast concerning those that were 
 first bidden 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>The wedding is ready,</I> the covenant of grace ready to be sealed,
 a church ready to be founded; <I>but they which were bidden,</I> that
 is, the Jews, <I>to whom pertained the covenant and the promises,</I>
 by which they were of old invited to the <I>feast of fat things,</I>
 they <I>were not worthy,</I> they were utterly unworthy, and, by their
 contempt of Christ, had forfeited all the privileges they were invited
 to. Note, It is not owing to God, that sinners perish, but to
 themselves. Thus, when Israel of old was within sight of Canaan, the
 land of promise was ready, the milk and honey ready, but their unbelief
 and murmuring, and contempt of that pleasant land, shut them out, and
 their carcases were left to perish in the wilderness; and <I>these
 things happened to them for ensamples.</I> See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:11,Heb+3:16-4:1">1 Cor. x. 11; Heb. iii. 16-iv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The commission he gave to the servants, to invite other guests. The 
 inhabitants of the <I>city</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 had refused; <I>Go into the high-ways</I> then; into <I>the way of the 
 Gentiles,</I> which at first they were to decline,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:5"><I>ch.</I> x. 5</A>.
 
 Thus by the fall of the Jews salvation
 is come to the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:11,12,Eph+3:8">Rom. xi. 11, 12; Eph. iii. 8</A>.

 Note, Christ will have a <I>kingdom in the world,</I> though many
 reject the grace, and resist the power, of that kingdom. <I>Though 
 Israel be not gathered, he will be glorious.</I> The offer of Christ 
 and salvation to the Gentiles was, 

 (1.) Unlooked for and unexpected; such a surprise as it would be to 
 wayfaring men upon the road to be met with an invitation to a wedding 
 feast. The Jews had notice of the gospel, long before, and expected the 
 Messiah and his kingdom; but to the Gentiles it was all new, what they 
 had never heard of before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:19,20">Acts xvii. 19, 20</A>),

 and, consequently, what they could not conceive of as belonging to 
 them. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1,2">Isa. lxv. 1, 2</A>.

 (2.) It was universal and undistinguishing; <I>Go, and bid as many as 
 you find.</I> The highways are public places, and there <I>Wisdom 
 cries,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:20">Prov. i. 20</A>.
 
 "Ask them that go by the way, ask any body

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:29">Job xxi. 29</A>),

 high and low, rich and poor, bond and free, young and old, Jew and 
 Gentile; tell them all, that they shall be welcome to gospel-privileges 
 upon gospel-terms; whoever will, let him come, without exception."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The success of this second invitation; if some will not come, others 
 will 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 <I>They gathered together all, as many as they found.</I> The servants 
 obeyed their orders. Jonah was sent <I>into the high-ways,</I> but was 
 so tender of the honour of his country, that he avoided the errand; but 
 Christ's apostles, though Jews, preferred the service of Christ before 
 their respect to their nation; and St. Paul, though sorrowing for the 
 Jews, yet magnifies his office as the apostle of Gentiles. <I>They
 gathered together all.</I> The design of the gospel is, 

 (1.) To gather souls together; not the nation of the Jews only, but 
 <I>all the children of God</I> who were <I>scattered abroad</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52">John xi. 52</A>),
 
 <I>the other sheep that were not of that fold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:16">John x. 16</A>.
 
 They were gathered into one body, one family, one corporation.
 
 (2.) To gather them together to the wedding-feast, to pay their respect 
 to Christ, and to partake of the privileges of the new covenant. Where 
 the dole is, there will the poor be gathered together.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the guests that were gathered were, 

 [1.] A multitude, <I>all, as many as they found;</I> so many, that the 
 guest-chamber was filled. The sealed ones of the Jews were numbered, 
 but those of other nations <I>were without number, a very great 
 multitude,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:4,8">Isa. lx. 4, 8</A>.

 [2.] A mixed multitude, <I>both bad and good;</I> some that before 
 their conversion were sober and well-inclined, as the devout Greeks

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:4">Acts xvii. 4</A>)

 and Cornelius; others that had run to an excess of riot, as the
 Corinthians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11">1 Cor. vi. 11</A>);

 <I>Such were some of you;</I> or, some that after their conversion 
 proved bad, that <I>turned not to the Lord with all their heart,</I> 
 but feignedly; others that were upright and sincere, and proved of the 
 right class. Ministers, in casting the net of the gospel, enclose 
 <I>both good</I> fish <I>and bad;</I> <I>but the Lord knows them that 
 are his.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The case of hypocrites, who are <I>in</I> the church, but not 
 <I>of</I> it, who have a name to live, but are not alive indeed, is 
 represented by <I>the guest that had not on a wedding garment;</I> one 
 of the bad that were gathered in. Those come short of salvation by 
 Christ, not only who refuse to take upon them the profession of 
 religion, but who are not sound at heart in that profession. Concerning 
 this hypocrite observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His discovery, how he was found out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>The king came in to see the guests,</I> to bid those welcome 
 who came prepared, and to turn those out who came otherwise. Note, The 
 God of heaven takes particular notice of those who profess religion, 
 and have a place and name in the visible church. Our Lord Jesus 
 <I>walks among the golden candlesticks</I> and therefore <I>knows their 
 works.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:1,2,So+7:12">Rev. ii. 1, 2; Cant. vii. 12</A>.

 Let this be a warning to us against hypocrisy, that disguises will 
 shortly be stripped off, and every man will appear in his own colours; 
 and an encouragement to us in our sincerity, that God is a witness to 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, This hypocrite was never discovered to be without <I>a wedding 
 garment,</I> till <I>the king himself came in to see the guests.</I> 
 Note, It is God's prerogative to know who are sound at heart in their 
 profession, and who are not. We may be deceived in men, either one way 
 or other; but He cannot. The day of judgment will be the great 
 discovering day, when all the guests will be presented to the King: 
 then <I>he will separate between the precious and the vile</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:32"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 32</A>),

 <I>the secrets of all hearts will then be made manifest,</I> and we
 shall infallibly discern <I>between the righteous and the wicked,</I> 
 which now it is not easy to do. It concerns all the guests, to prepare 
 for the scrutiny, and to consider how they will pass the piercing eye 
 of the heart-searching God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) As soon as he came in, he presently espied the hypocrite; <I>He 
 saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment;</I> though but one, 
 he soon had his eye upon him; there is no hope of being hid in a crowd 
 from the arrests of divine justice; he had not on a wedding garment; he 
 was not dressed as became a nuptial solemnity; he had not his best 
 clothes on. Note, Many come to the wedding feast without a wedding 
 garment. If the gospel be the wedding feast, then the wedding garment 
 is a frame of heart, and a course of life agreeable to the gospel and 
 our profession of it, <I>worthy of the vocation wherewith we are 
 called</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:1">Eph. iv. 1</A>),

 <I>as becomes the gospel of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:27">Phil. i. 27</A>.

 <I>The righteousness of saints,</I> their real holiness and 
 sanctification, and Christ, <I>made Righteousness to them, is the clean 
 linen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:8">Rev. xix. 8</A>.

 This man was not naked, or in rags; some raiment he had, but not a 
 wedding garment. Those, and those only, who <I>put on the Lord 
 Jesus,</I> that have a Christian temper of mind, and are adorned with 
 Christian graces, who live by faith in Christ, and to whom he is all in 
 all, have the wedding garment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His trial 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);
 
 and here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How he was arraigned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 <I>Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment?</I> 
 A startling question to one that was priding himself in the place he 
 securely possessed at the feast. <I>Friend!</I> That was a cutting 
 word; a seeming friend, a pretended friend, a friend in profession, 
 under manifold ties and obligations to be a friend. Note, There are 
 many in the church who are false friends to Jesus Christ, who say that 
 they love him while their hearts are not with him. <I>How camest thou
 in hither?</I> He does not chide the servants for letting him in (the 
 wedding garment is an inward thing, ministers must go according to that 
 which falls within their cognizance); but he checks his presumption in 
 crowding in, when he knew that his heart was not upright; "How durst 
 thou claim a share in gospel benefits, when thou hadst no regard to 
 gospel rules? <I>What has thou to do to declare my statutes?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:16,17">Ps. l. 16, 17</A>.

 Such are spots in the feast, dishonour the bridegroom, affront the
 company, and disgrace themselves; and therefore, <I>How camest thou in 
 hither?</I> Note, The day is coming, when hypocrites will be called to 
 an account for all their presumptuous intrusion into gospel ordinances, 
 and usurpation of gospel privileges. <I>Who hath required this at your
 hand?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:12">Isa. i. 12</A>.

 Despised sabbaths and abused sacraments must be reckoned for, and
 judgment taken out upon an action of waste against all those who 
 <I>received the grace of God in vain.</I> "How camest thou to the 
 Lord's table, at such a time, unhumbled and unsanctified? What brought 
 thee to sit before God's prophets, as his people do, when thy heart 
 went after thy covetousness? <I>How camest thou in?</I> Not by the
 door, but <I>some other way, as a thief and a robber.</I> It was a 
 tortuous entry, a possession without colour of a title." Note, It is 
 good for those that have a place in the church, often to put it to 
 themselves, "How came I in hither? Have I a wedding-garment?" If we 
 would thus <I>judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How he was convicted; <I>he was speechless:</I> 
 <B><I>ephimothe</I></B>--<I>he was muzzled</I> (so the word is used, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:9">1 Cor. ix. 9</A>);

 the man stood mute, upon his arraignment, being convicted and condemned 
 by his own conscience. They who live within the church, and die without 
 Christ, will not have one word to say for themselves in the judgment of 
 the great day, they will be without excuse; should they plead, <I>We 
 have eaten and drunk in thy presence,</I> as they do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:26">Luke xiii. 26</A>,

 that is to plead guilty; for the crime they are charged with, is
 thrusting themselves into the presence of Christ, and to his table, 
 before they were called. They who never heard a word of this wedding 
 feast will have more to say for themselves; their sin will be more 
 excusable, and their condemnation more tolerable, than theirs who came 
 to the feast without the wedding garment, and so sin against the 
 clearest light and dearest love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His sentence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);
 
 <I>Bind him hand and foot,</I> &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He is ordered to be pinioned, as condemned malefactors are, to be 
 manacled and shackled. Those that will not work and walk as they 
 should, may expect to be bound hand and foot. There is a binding in 
 this world by the servants, the ministers, whose suspending of persons 
 that walk disorderly, to the scandal of religion, is called binding of 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:18"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 18</A>.

 "Bind them up from partaking of special ordinances, and the peculiar
 privileges of their church-membership; bind them over to the righteous 
 judgment of god." <I>In the day of judgment,</I> hypocrites will be 
 bound; <I>the angels shall bind up these tares in bundles for the 
 fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:41"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 41</A>.

 Damned sinners are bound hand and foot by an irreversible sentence;
 this signifies the same with the fixing of the great gulf; they can 
 neither resist nor outrun their punishment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He is ordered to be carried off from the wedding feast; <I>Take 
 him away.</I> When the wickedness of hypocrites appears, they are to be 
 taken away from the communion of the faithful, to be cut of as withered 
 branches. This bespeaks the punishment of loss in the other world; they 
 shall be taken away from the king, from the kingdom, from the wedding 
 feast, <I>Depart from me, ye cursed.</I> It will aggravate their 
 misery, that (like the unbelieving lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:2">2 Kings vii. 2</A>),

 <I>they shall see all this plenty with their eyes, but shall not taste 
 of it.</I> Note, Those that walk unworthy of their Christianity, 
 forfeit all the happiness they presumptuously laid claim to, and 
 complimented themselves with a groundless expectation of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He is ordered into a doleful dungeon; <I>Cast him into utter
 darkness.</I> Our Saviour here insensibly slides out of this parable 
 into that which it intimates--the damnation of hypocrites in the other
 world. Hell is utter darkness, it is darkness out of heaven, the land 
 of light; or it is extreme darkness, darkness to the last degree, 
 without the least ray or spark of light, or hope of it, like that of 
 Egypt; <I>darkness which might be felt; the blackness of darkness, as 
 darkness itself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:22">Job x. 22</A>.

 Note, Hypocrites go by the light of the gospel itself down to utter
 darkness; and hell will be hell indeed to such, a condemnation more 
 intolerable; <I>there shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth.</I> This 
 our Saviour often uses as part of the description of hell-torments, 
 which are hereby represented, not so much by the misery itself, as by 
 the resentment sinners will have of it; there shall be <I>weeping,</I> 
 an expression of great sorrow and anguish; not a gush of tears, which 
 gives present ease, but constant weeping, which is constant torment; 
 and the <I>gnashing of teeth</I> is an expression of the greatest rage 
 and indignation; they will be <I>like a wild bull in a net, full of the 
 fury of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:20,Isa+8:21,22">Isa. li. 20; viii. 21, 22</A>.

 Let us therefore hear and fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The parable is concluded with that remarkable saying 
 which we had before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:16"><I>ch.</I> xx. 16</A>),

 <I>Many are called, but few are chosen,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Of the many that are called to the wedding feast, if you set aside all
 those as unchosen that make light of it, and avowedly prefer other 
 things before it; if then you set aside all that make a profession of 
 religion, but the temper of whose spirits and the tenour of whose 
 conversation are a constant contradiction to it; if you set aside all 
 the profane, and all the hypocritical, you will find that they are few, 
 very few, that are chosen; many called to the wedding feast, but few 
 chosen to the wedding garment, that is, to <I>salvation, by 
 sanctification of the Spirit.</I> This <I>is the strait gate, and 
 narrow way,</I> which <I>few find.</I></P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
 entangle him in <I>his</I> talk.
 &nbsp; 16  And they sent out unto him their disciples with the
 Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and
 teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any
 <I>man:</I> for thou regardest not the person of men.
 &nbsp; 17  Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
 tribute unto Caesar, or not?
 &nbsp; 18  But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye
 me, <I>ye</I> hypocrites?
 &nbsp; 19  show me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a
 penny.
 &nbsp; 20  And he saith unto them, Whose <I>is</I> this image and
 superscription?
 &nbsp; 21  They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render
 therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God
 the things that are God's.
 &nbsp; 22  When they had heard <I>these words,</I> they marvelled, and left
 him, and went their way.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was not the least grievous of the sufferings of Christ, that <I>he 
 endured the contradiction of sinners against himself,</I> and had 
 snares laid for him by those that sought how to take him off with some 
 pretence. In these verses, we have him attacked by the Pharisees and 
 Herodians with a question about paying tribute to C&aelig;sar. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the design was, which they proposed to themselves; <I>They took 
 counsel to entangle him in his talk.</I> Hitherto, his encounters had 
 been mostly with the chief priests and the elders, men in authority, 
 who trusted more to their power than to their policy, and examined him 
 concerning his commission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:23"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 23</A>);

 but now he is set upon from another quarter; the Pharisees will try
 whether they can deal with him by their learning in the law, and in 
 casuistical divinity, and they have a <I>tentamen novum--a new 
 trial</I> for him. Note, It is in vain for the best and wisest of men 
 to think that, by their ingenuity, or interest, or industry, or even by 
 their innocence and integrity, they can escape the hatred and ill will 
 of bad men, or screen themselves from <I>the strife of tongues.</I> See 
 how unwearied the enemies of Christ and his kingdom are in their 
 opposition!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>They took counsel.</I> It was foretold concerning him, that 
 <I>the rulers</I> would <I>take counsel against him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:2">Ps. ii. 2</A>);

 and <I>so persecuted they the prophets. Come, and let us devise devices 
 against Jeremiah.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:18,20:10">Jer. xviii. 18; xx. 10</A>.

 Note, The more there is of contrivance and consultation about sin, the 
 worse it is. There is a particular <I>woe to them that devise 
 iniquity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:1">Mic. ii. 1</A>.

 The more there is of the wicked wit in the contrivance of a sin, the
 more there is of the wicked will in the commission of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That which they aimed at was <I>to entangle him in his talk.</I> 
 They saw him free and bold in speaking his mind, and hoped by that, if 
 they could bring him to some nice and tender point, to get an advantage 
 against him. It has been the old practice of Satan's agents and 
 emissaries, to make a man an offender for a word, a word misplaced, or 
 mistaken, or misunderstood; a word, though innocently designed, yet 
 perverted by strained inuendos: thus they lay a snare for him that 
 <I>reproveth in the gate</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:21">Isa. xxix. 21</A>),

 and represent the greatest teachers as the greatest troublers of
 Israel: thus <I>the wicked plotteth against the just,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:12,13">Ps. xxxvii. 12, 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There are two ways by which the enemies of Christ might be revenged on 
 him, and be rid of him; either by law or by force. By law they could 
 not do it, unless they could make him obnoxious to the civil 
 government; for <I>it was not lawful for them to put any man to 
 death</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:31">John xviii. 31</A>);

 and the Roman powers were not apt to concern themselves about 
 <I>questions of words, and names, and their law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:15">Acts xviii. 15</A>.

 By force they could not do it, unless they could make him obnoxious to 
 the people, who were always the hands, whoever were the heads, in such 
 acts of violence, which they call the beating of the rebels; but the 
 people took Christ for a Prophet, and therefore his enemies could not 
 raise the mob against him. Now (as the old serpent was from the 
 beginning <I>more subtle than any beast of the field</I>), the design 
 was, to bring him into such a dilemma, that he must make himself liable 
 to the displeasure either of the Jewish multitude, or of the Roman 
 magistrates; let him take which side of the question he will, he shall 
 run himself into a premunire; and so they will gain their point, and 
 make his own tongue to fall upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The question which they put to him pursuant to this design, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 Having devised this iniquity in secret, in a close cabal, behind the 
 curtain, when they went abroad without loss of time they practised it.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The persons they employed; they did not go themselves, lest the 
 design should be suspected and Christ should stand the more upon his 
 guard; but they sent their disciples, who would look less like 
 tempters, and more like learners. Note, Wicked men will never want 
 wicked instruments to be employed in carrying on their wicked counsels. 
 Pharisees have their disciples at their beck, who will go any errand 
 for them, and say as they say; and they have this in their eyes, when 
 they are so industrious to make proselytes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 With them they sent the Herodians, a party among the Jews, who were for 
 a cheerful and entire subjection to the Roman emperor, and to Herod his 
 deputy; and who made it their business to reconcile people to that 
 government, and pressed all to pay their tribute. Some think that they 
 were the collectors of the land tax, as the publicans were of the 
 customs, and that they went with the Pharisees to Christ, with this 
 blind upon their plot, that while the Herodians demanded the tax, and 
 the Pharisees denied it, they were both willing to refer it to Christ, 
 as a proper Judge to decide the quarrel. Herod being obliged, by the 
 charter of the sovereignty, to take care of the tribute, these 
 Herodians, by assisting him in that, helped to endear him to his great 
 friends at Rome. The Pharisees, on the other hand, were zealous for the 
 liberty of the Jews, and did what they could to make them impatient of 
 the Roman yoke. Now, if he should countenance the paying of tribute, 
 the Pharisees would incense the people against him; if he should 
 discountenance or disallow it, the Herodians would incense the 
 government against him. Note, It is common for those that oppose one 
 another, to continue in an opposition to Christ and his kingdom. 
 Samson's foxes looked several ways, but met in one firebrand. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:3,5,7,8">Ps. lxxxiii. 3, 5, 7, 8</A>.

 If they are unanimous in opposing, should not we be so in maintaining,
 the interests of the gospel?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The preface, with which they were plausibly to introduce the 
 question; it was highly complimentary to our Saviour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);
 
 <I>Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in 
 truth.</I> Note, It is a common thing for the most spiteful projects to 
 be covered with the most specious pretences. Had they come to Christ 
 with the most serious enquiry, and the most sincere intention, they 
 could not have expressed themselves better. Here is <I>hatred covered 
 with deceit,</I> and a <I>wicked heart with burning lips</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:23">Prov. xxvi. 23</A>);

 as Judas, who kissed, and betrayed, as Joab, who kissed, and 
 killed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 (1.) What they said of Christ was right, and whether they knew it or 
 no, blessed be God, we know it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That Jesus Christ was a faithful Teacher; <I>Thou art true, and 
 teachest the way of God in truth.</I> For himself, <I>he is true, the 
 Amen, the faithful Witness;</I> he is the Truth itself. As for his 
 doctrine, the matter of his teaching was the way of God, the way that 
 God requires us to walk in, the way of duty, that leads to happiness; 
 that is the way of God. The manner of it was in truth; he showed people 
 <I>the right way, the way in which they should go.</I> He was a skilful 
 Teacher, and knew the way of God; and a faithful Teacher, that would be 
 sure to let us know it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:6-9">Prov. viii. 6-9</A>.

 This is the character of a good teacher, to preach the truth, the whole 
 truth, and nothing but the truth, and not to suppress, pervert, or 
 stretch, any truth, for favour or affection, hatred or good will, 
 either out of a desire to please, or a fear to offend, any man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That he was a bold Reprover. In preaching, he <I>cared not for 
 any;</I> he valued no man's frowns or smiles, he did not court, he did 
 not dread, either the great or the many, for he <I>regarded not the 
 person of man.</I> In his evangelical judgment, he did not know faces; 
 that <I>Lion of the tribe of Judah, turned not away for any</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:30">Prov. xxx. 30</A>),

 turned not a step from the truth, nor from his work, for fear of the 
 most formidable. He <I>reproved with equity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:4">Isa. xi. 4</A>),

 and never with partiality.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Though what they said was true for the matter of it, yet there was 
 nothing but flattery and treachery in the intention of it. They called 
 him <I>Master,</I> when they were contriving to treat him as the worst 
 of malefactors; they pretended respect for him, when they intended 
 mischief against him; and they affronted his wisdom as Man, much more 
 his omniscience as God, of which he had so often given undeniable 
 proofs, when they imagined that they could impose upon him with these 
 pretences, and that he could not see through them. It is the grossest 
 atheism, that is the greatest folly in the world, to think to put a 
 cheat upon Christ, who searches the heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:23">Rev. ii. 23</A>.

 Those that mock God do but deceive themselves. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:7">Gal. vi. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The proposal of the case; <I>What thinkest thou?</I> As if they had 
 said, "Many men are of many minds in this matter; it is a case which 
 relates to practice, and occurs daily; let us have thy thought freely 
 in the matter, <I>Is it lawful to give tribute to C&aelig;sar or not?</I>"
 This implies a further question; Has C&aelig;sar a right to demand it? The
 nation of the Jews was lately, about a hundred years before this, 
 conquered by the Roman sword, and so, as other nations, made subject to 
 the Roman yoke, and became a province of the empire; accordingly, toll, 
 tribute, and custom, were demanded from them, and sometimes poll-money. 
 By this it appeared that <I>the sceptre was departed from Judah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>);

 and therefore, if they had understood the signs of the times, they must 
 have concluded that <I>Shiloh was come,</I> and either that this was 
 he, or they must find out another more likely to be so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the question was, Whether it was lawful to pay these taxes 
 voluntarily, or, Whether they should not insist upon the ancient 
 liberty of their nation, and rather suffer themselves to be distrained 
 upon? The ground of the doubt was, that they <I>were Abraham's 
 seed,</I> and should not by consent be <I>in bondage to any man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:33">John viii. 33</A>.

 God had given them a law, that they should not <I>set a stranger over
 them.</I> Did not that imply, that they were not to yield any willing 
 subjection to any prince, state, or potentate, that was not of their 
 own nation and religion? This was an old mistake, arising from that 
 <I>pride and</I> that<I>haughty spirit</I> which bring <I>destruction 
 and a fall.</I> Jeremiah, in his time, though he spoke in God's name, 
 could not possibly beat them off it, nor persuade them to submit to the 
 king of Babylon; and their obstinacy in that matter was then their ruin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:12,13">Jer. xxvii. 12, 13</A>):

 and now again they stumbled at the same stone; and it was the very 
 thing which, in a few years after, brought final destruction upon them 
 by the Romans. They quite mistook the sense both of the precept and of 
 the privilege, and, under colour of God's word, contended with his 
 providence, when they should have kissed the rod, and accepted the 
 punishment of their iniquity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 However, by this question they hoped to entangle Christ, and, which way 
 soever he resolved it, to expose him to the fury either of the jealous 
 Jews, or of the jealous Romans; they were ready to triumph, as Pharaoh 
 did over Israel, that <I>the wilderness had shut him in,</I> and his 
 doctrine would be concluded either injurious to the rights of the 
 church, or hurtful to kings and provinces.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The breaking of this snare by the wisdom of the Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He discovered it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 <I>He perceived their wickedness;</I> for, <I>surely in vain is the net 
 spread in the sight of any bird,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:17">Prov. i. 17</A>.

 A temptation perceived is half conquered, for our greatest danger lies 
 from snakes under the green grass; <I>and he said, Why tempt ye me, ye 
 hypocrites?</I> Note, Whatever vizard the hypocrite puts on, our Lord 
 Jesus sees through it; he perceives all the wickedness that is in the 
 hearts of pretenders, and can easily convict them of it, and set it in 
 order before them. He cannot be imposed upon, as we often are, by 
 flatteries and fair pretences. He that searches the heart can call 
 hypocrites by their own name, as Ahijah did the wife of Jeroboam 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:6">1 Kings xiv. 6</A>),

 <I>Why feignest thou thyself to be another? Why tempt ye me, ye
 hypocrites?</I> Note, Hypocrites tempt Jesus Christ; they try his 
 knowledge, whether he can discover them through their disguises; they 
 try his holiness and truth, whether he will allow of them in this 
 church; but if they that of old <I>tempted Christ,</I> when he was but 
 darkly revealed, <I>were destroyed of serpents, of how much sorer 
 punishment shall they be thought worthy</I> who tempt him now in the 
 midst of gospel light and love! Those that presume to tempt Christ will 
 certainly find him too hard for them, and that he is of more piercing 
 eyes than not to see, and more pure eyes than not to hate, the 
 disguised wickedness of hypocrites, that dig deep to hide their counsel 
 from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He evaded it; his convicting them of hypocrisy might have served for 
 an answer (such captious malicious questions deserve a reproof, not a 
 reply): but our Lord Jesus gave a full answer to their question, and
 introduced it by an argument sufficient to support it, so as to lay
 down a rule for his church in this matter, and yet to avoid giving
 offence, and to break the snare.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He forced them, ere they were aware, to confess C&aelig;sar's
 authority over them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 In dealing with those that are captious, it is good to give our 
 reasons, and, if possible, reasons of confessed cogency, before we give 
 our resolutions. Thus the evidence of truth may silence gainsayers by 
 surprise, while they only stood upon their guard against the truth 
 itself, not against the reason of it; <I>Show me the tribute-money.</I> 
 He had none of his own to convince them by; it should seem, he had not 
 so much as one piece of money about him, for for our sakes he emptied 
 himself, and became poor; he despised the wealth of this world, and 
 thereby taught us not to over-value it; silver and gold he had none; 
 why then should we covet to load ourselves with the thick clay? The 
 Romans demanded their tribute in their own money, which was current 
 among the Jews at that time: that therefore is called the 
 <I>tribute-money;</I> he does not name what piece but the <I>tribute 
 money,</I> to show that he did not mind things of that nature, nor 
 concern himself about them; his heart was upon better things, the 
 kingdom of God and the riches and righteousness thereof, and ours 
 should be so too. They presently <I>brought him a penny,</I> a Roman 
 penny in silver, in value about sevenpence half-penny of our money, the 
 most common piece then in use: it was stamped with the emperor's image 
 and superscription, which was the warrant of the public faith for the 
 value of the pieces so stamped; a method agreed on by most nations, for 
 the more easy circulation of money with satisfaction. The coining of
 money has always been looked upon as a branch of the prerogative, a 
 flower of the crown, a royalty belonging to the sovereign powers; and 
 the admitting of that as the good and lawful money of a country is an 
 implicit submission to those powers, and an owning of them in money 
 matters. How happy is our constitution, and how happy we, who live in a 
 nation where, though the image and superscription be the sovereign's, 
 the property is the subject's, under the protection of the laws, and 
 what we have we can call our own!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ asked them, <I>Whose image is this?</I> They owned it to be 
 C&aelig;sar's, and thereby convicted those of falsehood who said, <I>We were
 never in bondage to any;</I> and confirmed what afterward they said, 
 <I>We have no king but C&aelig;sar.</I> It is a rule in the Jewish Talmud,
 that "he is the king of the country whose coin is current in the 
 country." Some think that the superscription upon this coin was a 
 memorandum of the conquest of Judea by the Romans, <I>anno post captam 
 Jud&aelig;am--the year after that event;</I> and that they admitted that
 too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) From thence he inferred the lawfulness of paying tribute to C&aelig;sar
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 <I>Render therefore to C&aelig;sar the things that are 
 C&aelig;sar's;</I> not, "<I>Give</I> it him" (as they expressed it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 but, "<I>Render</I> it; Return," or "Restore it; if C&aelig;sar fill 
 the purses, let C&aelig;sar command them. It is too late now to dispute 
 paying tribute to C&aelig;sar; for you are become a province of the 
 empire, and, when once a relation is admitted, the duty of it must be 
 performed. <I>Render to all their due,</I> and particularly <I>tribute
 to whom tribute is due.</I>" Now by this answer,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] No offence was given. It was much to the honour of Christ and his 
 doctrine, that he did not interpose as a Judge or a Divider in matters 
 of this nature, but left them as he found them, for <I>his kingdom is 
 not of this world;</I> and in this he hath given an example to his 
 ministers, who deal in sacred things, not to meddle with disputes about 
 things secular, not to wade far into controversies relating to them, 
 but to leave that to those whose proper business it is. Ministers that 
 would mind their business, and please their master, must not 
 <I>entangle themselves in the affairs of this life:</I> they forfeit 
 the guidance of God's Spirit, and the convoy of his providence when 
 they thus to out of their way. Christ discusses not the emperor's 
 title, but enjoins a peaceable subjection to <I>the powers that be.</I> 
 The government therefore had no reason to take offence at his 
 determination, but to thank him, for it would strengthen C&aelig;sar's 
 interest with the people, who held him for a Prophet; and yet such was 
 the impudence of his prosecutors, that, though he had expressly charged 
 them to <I>render to C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's,</I> 
 they laid the direct contrary in his indictment, that he <I>forbade to 
 give tribute to C&aelig;sar,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:2">Luke xxiii. 2</A>.

 As to the people, the Pharisees could not accuse him to them, because
 they themselves had, before they were aware, yielded the premises, and
 then it was too late to evade the conclusion. Note, Though truth seeks 
 not a fraudulent concealment, yet it sometimes needs a prudent 
 management, to prevent the offence which may be taken at it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] His adversaries were reproved. <I>First,</I> Some of them would 
 have had him make it unlawful to give tribute to C&aelig;sar, that they
 might have a pretence to save their money. Thus many excuse themselves 
 from that which they must do, by arguing whether they may do it or no. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> They all withheld from God his dues, and are reproved 
 for that: while they were vainly contending about their civil 
 liberties, they had lost the life and power of religion, and needed to 
 be put in mind of their duty to God, with that to C&aelig;sar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] His disciples were instructed, and standing rules left to the 
 church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> That the Christian religion is no enemy to civil 
 government, but a friend to it. Christ's kingdom doth not clash or 
 interfere with the kingdoms of the earth, in any thing that pertains to 
 their jurisdiction. By Christ kings reign.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> It is the duty of subjects to render to magistrates 
 that which, according to the laws of their country, is their due. The 
 higher powers, being entrusted with the public welfare, the protection 
 of the subject, and the conservation of the peace, are entitled, in 
 consideration thereof, to a just proportion of the public wealth, and 
 the revenue of the nation. <I>For this cause pay we tribute,</I> 
 because <I>they attend continually to this very thing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:6">Rom. xiii. 6</A>);
 
 and it is doubtless a greater sin to cheat the government than to cheat 
 a private person. Though it is the constitution that determines what is 
 C&aelig;sar's, yet, when that is determined, Christ bids us render it to
 him; my coat is my coat, by the law of man; but he is a thief, by the 
 law of God, that takes it from me.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> When we render to C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's,
 we must remember withal to render to God the things that are God's. If 
 our purses be C&aelig;sar's, our consciences are God's; he hath said, <I>My
 son, give me thy heart:</I> he must have the innermost and uppermost 
 place there; we must render to God that which is his due, out of our 
 time and out of our estates; from them he must have his share as well 
 as C&aelig;sar his; and if C&aelig;sar's commands interfere with God's <I>we must
 obey God rather than men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Observe how they were nonplussed by this answer; they
 <I>marvelled, and left him, and went their way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They admired his sagacity in discovering and evading a snare which they 
 thought so craftily laid. Christ is, and will be, the Wonder, not only 
 of his beloved friends, but of his baffled enemies. One would think 
 they should have marvelled and followed him, marvelled and submitted to 
 him; no, they marvelled and left him. Note, There are many in whose 
 eyes Christ is marvellous, and yet not precious. They admire his 
 wisdom, but will not be guided by it, his power, but will not submit to 
 it. <I>They went their way,</I> as persons ashamed, and made an 
 inglorious retreat. The stratagem being defeated, they quitted the
 field. Note, There is nothing got by contending with Christ.</P>

 <TR><TD><FONT SIZE=+1><I>The Question Respecting Marriage.</I></FONT></TD>
 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there
 is no resurrection, and asked him,
 &nbsp; 24  Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no
 children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed
 unto his brother.
 &nbsp; 25  Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when
 he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his
 wife unto his brother:
 &nbsp; 26  Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
 &nbsp; 27  And last of all the woman died also.
 &nbsp; 28  Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
 seven? for they all had her.
 &nbsp; 29  Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing
 the scriptures, nor the power of God.
 &nbsp; 30  For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
 marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
 &nbsp; 31  But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not
 read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
 &nbsp; 32  I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
 of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
 &nbsp; 33  And when the multitude heard <I>this,</I> they were astonished at
 his doctrine.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's dispute with the Sadducees concerning the 
 resurrection; it was the same day on which he was attacked by the 
 Pharisees about paying tribute. Satan was now more busy than ever to 
 ruffle and disturb him; it was <I>an hour of temptation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:10">Rev. iii. 10</A>.
 
 The truth as it is in Jesus will still meet with contradiction, in some 
 branch or other of it. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The opposition which the Sadducees made to a very great truth of 
 religion; they say, <I>There is no resurrection,</I> as there are some 
 fools who say, <I>There is no God.</I> These heretics were called 
 <I>Sadducees</I> from one Sadoc, a disciple of Antigonus Soch&aelig;us, who
 flourished about two hundred and eighty-four years before our Saviour's 
 birth. They lie under heavy censures among the writers of their own 
 nation, as men of base and debauched conversations, which their 
 principles led them to. They were the fewest in number of all the
 sects among the Jews, but generally persons of some rank. As the 
 Pharisees and Essenes seemed to follow Plato and Pythagoras, so the 
 Sadducees were much of the genius of the Epicureans; they denied the 
 resurrection, they said, There is no future state, no life after this; 
 that, when the body dies, the soul is annihilated, and dies with it; 
 that there is no state of rewards or punishments in the other world; no 
 judgment to come in heaven or hell. They maintained, that, except God, 
 there is not spirit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:8">Acts xxiii. 8</A>),

 nothing but matter and motion. They would not own the divine 
 inspiration of the prophets, nor any revelation from heaven, but what 
 God himself spoke upon mount Sinai. Now the doctrine of Christ carried
 that great truth of the resurrection and a future state much further 
 than it had yet been revealed, and therefore the Sadducees in a 
 particular manner set themselves against it. The Pharisees and 
 Sadducees were contrary to each other, and yet confederates against 
 Christ. Christ's gospel hath always suffered between superstitious 
 ceremonious hypocrites and bigots on the one hand, and profane deists 
 and infidels on the other. The former abusing, the latter despising, 
 the <I>form</I> of godliness, but both denying the <I>power</I> of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The objection they made against the truth, which was taken from a 
 supposed case of a woman that had seven husbands successively; now they 
 take it for granted, that, if there be a resurrection, it must be a 
 return to such a state as this we are now in, and to the same 
 circumstances, like the imaginary Platonic year; and if so, it is an 
 invincible absurdity for this woman in the future state to have seven 
 husbands, or else an insuperable difficulty which of them should have 
 her, he whom she had first, or he whom she had last, or he whom she 
 loved best, or he whom she lived longest with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They suggest the law of Moses in this matter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 that the next of kin should marry the widow of him that died childless 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:5">Deut. xxv. 5</A>);

 we have it practised 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:5">Ruth iv. 5</A>.

 It was a political law, founded in the particular constitution of the
 Jewish commonwealth, to preserve the distinction of families and 
 inheritances, of both which there was special care taken in that 
 government.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They put a case upon this statute, which, whether it were a <I>case 
 in fact</I> or only a <I>moot case,</I> is not at all material; if it 
 had not really occurred, yet possibly it might. It was of seven 
 brothers, who married the same woman, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:25-27"><I>v.</I> 25-27</A>.

 Now this case supposes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The desolations that death sometimes makes in families when it 
 comes with commission; how it often sweeps away a whole fraternity in a 
 little time;: seldom (as the case is put) according to seniority (the
 land of darkness is without any order,) but <I>heaps upon heaps;</I> it
 diminishes families that had multiplied greatly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:38,39">Ps. cvii. 38, 39</A>.

 When there were seven brothers grown up to man's estate, there was a
 family very likely to be built up; and yet this numerous family leaves
 <I>neither son nor nephew, nor any remaining in their dwellings,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:19">Job xviii. 19</A>.

 Well may we say then, <I>Except the Lord build the house, they labour 
 in vain that build it.</I> Let none be sure of the advancement and 
 perpetuity of their names and families, unless they could <I>make a 
 covenant</I> of peace <I>with death,</I> or be at an <I>agreement with 
 the grave.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The obedience of these seven brothers to the law, though they had
 a power of refusal under the penalty of a reproach, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:7">Deut. xxv. 7</A>.

 Note, Discouraging providences should not keep us from doing our duty
 because we must be governed by the rule, not by the event. The seventh, 
 who ventured last to marry the widow (many a one would say) was 
 a<I>bold</I> man. I would say, if he did it purely in obedience to God, 
 he was a <I>good</I> man, and one that made conscience of his duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But, <I>last of all, the woman died also.</I> Note, Survivorship is but 
 a reprieve; they that live long, and bury their relations and 
 neighbours one after another, do not thereby acquire an immortality; 
 no, their day will come to fall. Death's bitter cup goes round, and, 
 sooner or later, we must all pledge in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:26">Jer. xxv. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They propose a doubt upon this case 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);

 "<I>In the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven?</I> You 
 cannot tell whose; and therefore we must conclude <I>there is no 
 resurrection.</I>" The Pharisees, who professed to believe a 
 resurrection, had very gross and carnal notions concerning it, and 
 concerning the future state; expecting to find there, as the Turks in 
 their paradise, the delights and pleasures of the animal life, which 
 perhaps drove the Sadducees to deny the thing itself; for nothing gives 
 greater advantage to atheism and infidelity than the carnality of those 
 that make religion, either in its professions or in its prospects, a 
 servant to their sensual appetites and secular interests; while those 
 that are erroneous deny the truth, those that are superstitious betray 
 it to them. Now they, in this objection, went upon the Pharisees' 
 hypothesis. Note, It is not strange that carnal minds have very false 
 notions of spiritual and eternal things. The natural man receiveth not 
 these things, <I>for they are foolishness to him.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:14">1 Cor. ii. 14</A>.

 Let truth be set in a clear light, and then it appears in its full
 strength.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's answer to this objection; by reproving their ignorance, 
 and rectifying their mistake, he shows the objection to be fallacious 
 and unconcluding.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He reproves their ignorance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>);

 <I>Ye do err.</I> Note, Those do greatly err, in the judgment of 
 Christ, who deny the resurrection and a future state. Here Christ 
 reproves with the meekness of wisdom, and is not so sharp upon them 
 (whatever was the reason) as sometimes he was upon the chief priests 
 and elders; <I>Ye do err, not knowing.</I> Note, Ignorance is the cause 
 of error; those that are in the dark, miss their way. The patrons of 
 error do <I>therefore</I> resist the light, and do what they can to 
 take away the key of knowledge; <I>Ye do err</I> in this matter, <I>not 
 knowing.</I> Note, Ignorance is the cause of error about the 
 resurrection and the future state. <I>What</I> it is in its particular 
 instances, the wisest and best know not; it doth not yet appear what we 
 shall be, it is a glory that is to be revealed: when we speak of the 
 state of separate souls, the resurrection of the body, and of eternal 
 happiness and misery, we are soon at a loss; we cannot order our 
 speech, by reason of darkness, but that it <I>is</I> a thing about 
 which we are not left in the dark; blessed be God, we are not; and 
 those who deny it are guilty of a willing and affected ignorance. It 
 seems, there were some Sadducees, some such monsters, among professing 
 Christians, <I>some among you, that say, There is no resurrection of 
 the dead</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:12">1 Cor. xv. 12</A>)

 and some that did in effect deny it, by turning it into an allegory, 
 saying, The <I>resurrection is past already.</I> Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>They know not the power of God;</I> which would lead men to 
 infer that there <I>may be</I> a resurrection and a future state. Note, 
 The ignorance, disbelief, or weak belief, of God's power, is at the 
 bottom of many errors, particularly theirs who deny the resurrection. 
 When we are told of the soul's existence and agency in a state of 
 separation from the body, and especially that a dead body, which had 
 lain many ages in the grave, and is turned into common and 
 indistinguished dust, that this shall be raised the same body that it 
 was, and live, move, and act, again; we are ready to say, <I>How can 
 these things be?</I> Nature allows it for a maxim, <I>A privatione ad 
 habitum non datur regressus--The habits attaching to a state of
 existence vanish irrecoverably with the state itself.</I> If a man die, 
 shall he live again? And vain men, because they cannot comprehend the 
 <I>way</I> of it, question the <I>truth</I> of it; whereas, if we 
 firmly believe in God the Father Almighty, that nothing is impossible 
 with God, all these difficulties vanish. This therefore we must fasten 
 upon, in the first place, that God is omnipotent, and can do what he 
 will; and then no room is left for doubting but that he will do what he 
 has promised; and, if so, <I>why should it be thought a thing 
 incredible with you that God should raise the dead?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:8">Acts xxvi. 8</A>.

 His power far exceeds the power of nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>They know not the scriptures,</I> which decidedly affirm that 
 there shall be a resurrection and a future state. The power of God, 
 determined and engaged by his promise, is the foundation for faith to 
 build upon. Now the scriptures speak plainly, that the soul is 
 immortal, and there is another life after this; it is the scope both of 
 the law and of the prophets, <I>that there shall be a resurrection of 
 the dead, both of the just and of the unjust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:14,15">Acts xxiv. 14, 15</A>.

 Job knew it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:26">Job xix. 26</A>),
 
 Ezekiel foresaw it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:1-28">Ezek. xxxvii.</A>),

 and Daniel plainly foretold it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:2">Dan. xii. 2</A>.

 Christ rose again <I>according to the scriptures</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:3">1 Cor. xv. 3</A>);

 and so shall we. Those therefore who deny it, either have not conversed 
 with the Scriptures, or do not believe them, or do not take the true 
 sense and meaning of them. Note, Ignorance of the scripture is the rise 
 of abundance of mischief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He rectifies their mistake, and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 corrects those gross ideas which they had of the resurrection and a 
 future state, and fixes these doctrines upon a true and lasting basis. 
 Concerning that state, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is not like the state we are now in upon earth; <I>They neither 
 marry, nor are given in marriage.</I> In our present state marriage is 
 necessary; it was instituted in innocency; whatever intermission or 
 neglect there has been of other institutions, this was never laid 
 aside, nor will be till the end of time. In the old world, they were 
 <I>marrying, and giving in marriage;</I> the Jews in Babylon, when cut
 off from other ordinances, yet were bid to <I>take them wives,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:6">Jer. xxix. 6</A>.

 All civilized nations have had a sense of the obligation of the
 marriage covenant; and it is requisite for the gratifying of the 
 desires, and recruiting the deficiencies, of the human nature. But, in 
 the resurrection, there is no occasion for marriage; whether in 
 glorified bodies there will be any distinction of sexes some too 
 curiously dispute (the ancients are divided in their opinions about 
 it); but, whether there will be a distinction or not, it is certain 
 that there will be no conjunction; where God will be <I>all in all,</I> 
 there needs no other <I>meet-help;</I> the body will be 
 <I>spiritual,</I> and there will be in it no carnal desires to be 
 gratified: when the mystical body is completed, there will be no 
 further occasion to <I>seek a godly seed,</I> which was one end of the 
 institution of marriage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:15">Mal. ii. 15</A>.

 In heaven there will be no decay of the individuals, and therefore no 
 eating and drinking; no decay of the species, and therefore no 
 marrying; <I>where there shall be no more deaths</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:4">Rev. xxi. 4</A>),

 there need be no more births. The married state is a composition of
 joys and cares; those that enter upon it are taught to look upon it as 
 subject to changes, <I>richer and poorer, sickness and health;</I> and 
 therefore it is fit for this mixed, changing world; but as in hell, 
 where there is no joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the 
 bride shall be heard no more at all, so in heaven, where there is all 
 joy, and no care or pain or trouble, there will be no marrying. The 
 joys of that state are pure and spiritual, and arise from the marriage 
 of all of them to the Lamb, not of any of them to one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is like the state angels are now in in heaven; <I>They are as 
 the angels of God in heaven;</I> they <I>are</I> so, that is, 
 undoubtedly they shall be so. They are so already in Christ their Head, 
 who has made them <I>sit with him in heavenly places,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:6">Eph. ii. 6</A>.

 The spirits of just men already made perfect are of the same
 corporation with the innumerable company of angels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22,23">Heb. xii. 22, 23</A>.

 Man in his creation was <I>made a little lower than the angels</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:5">Ps. viii. 5</A>);

 but in his complete redemption and renovation will be as the angels;
 pure and spiritual as the angels, knowing and loving as those blessed 
 seraphim, ever praising God like them and with them. The bodies of the 
 saints shall be raised incorruptible and glorious, like the 
 uncompounded vehicles of those pure and holy spirits

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:42">1 Cor. xv. 42</A>,
 
 &c.), swift and strong, like them. We should <I>therefore</I> desire
 and endeavour to do the will of God now as the angels do it in heaven, 
 because we hope shortly to be like the angels who always behold our 
 Father's face. He saith nothing of the state of the wicked in the 
 resurrection; but, by consequence, they shall be like the devils, whose 
 lusts they have done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ's argument to confirm this great truth of the resurrection 
 and a future state; the matters being of great concern, he did not 
 think it enough (as in some other disputes) to discover the fallacy and 
 sophistry of the objection, but backed the truth with a solid argument; 
 for Christ <I>brings forth judgment to truth</I> as well as victory, 
 and enables his followers to give a reason of the hope that is in them. 
 Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Whence he fetched his argument--from the scripture; that is the great
 magazine or armoury whence we may be furnished with spiritual weapons, 
 offensive and defensive. <I>It is written</I> is Goliath's sword. 
 <I>Have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God?</I> Note, 

 (1.) What the scripture speaks God speaks. 

 (2.) What was spoken to Moses was spoken to us; it was spoken and 
 <I>written for our learning.</I> 

 (3.) It concerns us to read and hear what God hath spoken, because it 
 is spoken to us. It was spoken to you Jews in the first place, for to
 them were committed the oracles of God. The argument is fetched from
 the books of Moses, because the Sadducees received <I>them</I> only, as 
 some think, or, at least, them chiefly, for canonical scriptures; 
 Christ therefore fetched his proof from the most indisputable fountain.
 The latter prophets have more express proofs of a future state than the 
 law of Moses has; for though the law of Moses supposes the immortality 
 of the soul and a future state, as principles of what is called natural 
 religion, yet no express revelation of it is made by the law of Moses; 
 because so much of that law was peculiar to that people, and was 
 therefore guarded as municipal laws used to be with temporal promises 
 and threatenings, and the more express revelation of a future state was 
 reserved for the latter days; but our Saviour finds a very solid 
 argument for the resurrection even in the writings of Moses. Much 
 scripture lies under ground, that must be digged for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What his argument was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 <I>I am the God of Abraham.</I> This was not an express proof, 
 <I>totidem verbis--in so many words;</I> and yet it was really a 
 conclusive argument. Consequences from scripture, if rightly deduced, 
 must be received as scripture; for it was written for those that have 
 the use of reason.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the drift of the argument is to prove,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That there is a future state, another life after this, in which 
 the righteous shall be truly and constantly happy. This is proved from 
 what God said; <I>I am the God of Abraham.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] For God to be any one's God supposes some very extraordinary 
 privilege and happiness; unless we know fully what God is, we could not 
 comprehend the riches of that word, <I>I will be to thee a God,</I> 
 that is, a Benefactor like myself. The God <I>of</I> Israel is a God 
 <I>to</I> Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:24">1 Chron. xvii. 24</A>),

 a spiritual Benefactor; for he is the Father of spirits, and blesseth 
 with spiritual blessings: it is to be an all-sufficient Benefactor, a 
 God that is enough, a complete Good, and an eternal Benefactor; for he 
 is himself an everlasting God, and will be to those that are in 
 covenant with him an everlasting Good. This great word God had often
 said to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and it was intended as a recompence 
 for their singular faith and obedience, in quitting the country at 
 God's call. The Jews had a profound veneration for those three 
 patriarchs, and would extend the promise God made them to the 
 uttermost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It is manifest that these good men had no such extraordinary 
 happiness, in <I>this</I> life, as might look any thing like the 
 accomplishment of so great a word as that. They were strangers in the 
 land of promise, wandering, pinched with famine; they had not a foot of 
 ground of their own but a burying-place, which directed them to look 
 for something beyond this life. In present enjoyments they came far 
 short of their neighbours that were strangers to this covenant. What 
 was there in this world to distinguish them and the heirs of their 
 faith from other people, any whit proportionable to the dignity and 
 distinction of this covenant? If no happiness had been reserved for 
 these great and good men on the other side of death, that melancholy 
 word of poor Jacob's, when he was old 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+47:9">Gen. xlvii. 9</A>),

 <I>Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been,</I> would 
 have been an eternal reproach to the wisdom, goodness, and 
 faithfulness, of that God who had so often called himself <I>the God of 
 Jacob.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Therefore there must certainly be a future state, in which, as God 
 will ever live to be eternally rewarding, so Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 
 will ever live to be eternally rewarded. That of the apostle 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16">Heb. xi. 16</A>),

 is a key to this argument, where, when he had been speaking of the 
 faith and obedience of the patriarchs in the land of their pilgrimage, 
 he adds, <I>Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God;</I> 
 because <I>he has provided for them a city,</I> a heavenly city; 
 implying, that if he had not provided so well for them in the other 
 world, considering how they sped in this, he would have been ashamed to 
 have called himself <I>their God;</I> but now he is not, having done 
 that for them which answers it in its true intent and full extent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That the soul is immortal, and the body shall rise again, to be 
 united; if the former point be gained, these will follow; but they are 
 likewise proved by considering the time when God spoke this; it was to 
 Moses at the bush, long after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were dead and 
 buried; and yet God saith, not, "<I>I was,</I>" or "<I>have been,</I>" 
 but <I>I am the God of Abraham.</I> Now <I>God is not God of the dead, 
 but of the living.</I> He is a living God, and communicates vital 
 influences to those to whom he is a God. If, when Abraham died, there 
 had been an end of him, there had been an end likewise of God's 
 relation to him as his God; but at that time, when God spoke to Moses, 
 he was the God of Abraham, and therefore Abraham must be then alive; 
 which proves the immortality of the soul in a state of bliss; and that, 
 by consequence, infers the resurrection of the body; for there is such 
 an inclination in the human soul to its body, as would make a final and 
 eternal separation inconsistent with the bliss of those that have God 
 for <I>their God.</I> The Sadducees' notion was, that the union between 
 body and soul is so close, that, when the body dies, the soul dies with 
 it. Now, upon the same hypothesis, if the soul lives, as it certainly 
 does, the body must some time or other live with it. And besides, the 
 Lord is for the body, it is an essential part of the man; there is a 
 covenant with the dust, which will be remembered, otherwise <I>the 
 man</I> would not be happy. The charge which the dying patriarchs gave 
 concerning their bones, and that <I>in faith,</I> was an evidence that 
 they had some expectation of the resurrection of their bodies. But this 
 doctrine was reserved for a more full revelation after the resurrection 
 of Christ, who <I>was the first-fruits of them that slept.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> We have the issue of this dispute. The Sadducees were
 <I>put to silence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 and so put to shame. They thought by their subtlety to put Christ to 
 shame, when they were preparing shame for themselves. But the multitude 
 <I>were astonished at this doctrine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 1. Because it was new to them. See to what a sad pass the exposition of 
 scripture was come among them, when people were astonished at it as a 
 miracle to hear the fundamental promise applied to this great truth; 
 they had sorry scribes, or this had been no news to them. 

 2. Because it had something in it very good and great. Truth often
 shows the brighter, and is the more admired, for its being opposed. 
 Observe, Many gainsayers are silenced, and many hearers astonished, 
 without being savingly converted; yet even in the silence and 
 astonishment of unsanctified souls God magnifies his law, magnifies his 
 gospel, and makes both honourable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>34  But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the
 Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
 &nbsp; 35  Then one of them, <I>which was</I> a lawyer, asked <I>him a
 question,</I> tempting him, and saying,
 &nbsp; 36  Master, which <I>is</I> the great commandment in the law?
 &nbsp; 37  Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
 all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
 &nbsp; 38  This is the first and great commandment.
 &nbsp; 39  And the second <I>is</I> like unto it, Thou shalt love thy
 neighbour as thyself.
 &nbsp; 40  On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a discourse which Christ had with a Pharisee-lawyer, about the 
 great commandment of the law. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The combination of the Pharisees against Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 They heard <I>that he had put the Sadducees to silence,</I> had stopped 
 their mouths, though their understandings were not opened; and they 
 were <I>gathered together,</I> not to return him the thanks of their 
 party, as they ought to have done, for his effectually asserting and 
 confirming of the truth against the Sadducees, the common enemies of 
 their religion, but to <I>tempt him,</I> in hopes to get the reputation 
 of puzzling him who had puzzled the Sadducees. They were more vexed 
 that Christ was honoured, than pleased that the Sadducees were 
 silenced; being more concerned for their own tyranny and traditions, 
 which Christ opposed, than for the doctrine of the resurrection and a 
 future state, which the Sadducees opposed. Note, It is an instance of 
 Pharisaical envy and malice, to be displeased at the maintaining of a 
 confessed truth, when it is done by those we do not like; to sacrifice 
 a public good to private piques and prejudices. Blessed Paul was 
 otherwise minded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:18">Phil. i. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The lawyer's question, which he put to Christ. The lawyers were 
 students in, and teachers of, the law of Moses, as the scribes were; 
 but some think that in <I>this</I> they differed, that they dealt more 
 in practical questions than the scribes; they studied and professed 
 casuistical divinity. This lawyer <I>asked him a question, tempting 
 him;</I> not with any design to ensnare him, as appears by St. Mark's 
 relation of the story, where we find that this was he to whom Christ 
 said, <I>Thou are not far from the kingdom of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:34">Mark xii. 34</A>,

 but only to see what he would say, and to draw on discourse with him,
 to satisfy his own and his friends' curiosity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The question was, <I>Master, which is the greatest commandment of 
 the law?</I> A needless question, when all the things of God's law are 
 great things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:12">Hos. viii. 12</A>),

 and the wisdom from above is without partiality, partiality in the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:9">Mal. ii. 9</A>),

 and hath respect to them all. Yet it is true, there are some commands 
 that are the principles of the oracles of God, more extensive and 
 inclusive than others. Our Saviour speaks of the <I>weightier matters 
 of the law,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:23"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The design was to try him, or tempt him; to try, not so much his 
 knowledge as his judgment. It was a question disputed among the critics 
 in the law. Some would have the law of circumcision to be the great 
 commandment, others the law of the sabbath, others the law of 
 sacrifices, according as they severally stood affected, and spent their 
 zeal; now they would try what Christ said to this question, hoping to 
 incense the people against him, if he should not answer according to 
 the vulgar opinion; and if he should magnify one commandment, they 
 would reflect on him as vilifying the rest. The question was harmless 
 enough; and it appears by comparing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:27,28">Luke x. 27, 28</A>,

 that it was an adjudged point among the lawyers, that the <I>love of
 God</I> and our <I>neighbour</I> is the great commandment, and the sum 
 of all the rest, and Christ had there approved it; so the putting of it 
 to him here seems rather a scornful design to catechise him as a child, 
 than spiteful design to dispute with him as an adversary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's answer to this question; it is well for us that such a 
 question was asked him, that we might have his answer. It is no 
 disparagement to great men to answer plain questions. Now Christ 
 recommends to us those as the great commandments, not which are so 
 exclusive of others, but which are <I>therefore</I> great because 
 inclusive of others. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Which these great commandments are 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:37-39"><I>v.</I> 37-39</A>);

 not the judicial laws, those could not be the greatest now that the 
 people of the Jews, to whom they pertained, were so little; not the 
 ceremonial laws, those could not be the greatest, now that they were 
 waxen old, and were ready to vanish away; nor any particular moral 
 precept; but the love of God and our neighbour, which are the spring 
 and foundation of all the rest, which (these being supposed) will 
 follow of course.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) All the law is fulfilled in one word, and that is, <I>love.</I> 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:10">Rom. xiii. 10</A>.

 All obedience begins in the affections, and nothing in religion is done 
 right, that is not done there first. Love is the leading affection, 
 which gives law, and gives ground, to the rest; and therefore that, as 
 the main fort, is to be first secured and garrisoned for God. Man is a 
 creature cut out for love; thus therefore is the law written in the 
 heart, that it is a <I>law of love.</I> Love is a short and sweet word; 
 and, if that be <I>the fulfilling of the law,</I> surely the yoke of 
 the command is very easy. Love is the rest and satisfaction of the 
 soul; if we walk in this good old way, we shall find rest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>love of God</I> is the first and great commandment of all, 
 and the summary of all the commands of the first table. The proper act 
 of love being complacency, good is the proper object of it. Now God, 
 being good infinitely, originally, and eternally, is to be loved in the 
 first place, and nothing loved beside him, but what is loved for him. 
 <I>Love</I> is the first and great thing that God demands from us, and 
 therefore the first and great thing that we should devote to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now here we are directed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] To love God as ours; <I>Thou shalt love the Lord they God</I> as 
 thine. The first commandment is, <I>Thou shalt have no other God;</I> 
 which implies that we must have him for our God, and that will engage 
 our love to him. Those that made the sun and moon their gods, loved 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:2,Jdg+18:24">Jer. viii. 2; Judges xviii. 24</A>.

 To love God as ours is to love him because he is ours, our Creator,
 Owner, and Ruler, and to conduct ourselves to him as ours, with 
 obedience to him, and dependence on him. We must love God as
 reconciled to us, and made ours by covenant; that is the foundation of 
 this, <I>Thy God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] To love him <I>with all our heart, and soul, and mind.</I> Some 
 make these to signify one and the same thing, to love him with all our 
 powers; others distinguish them; the heart, soul, and mind, are the 
 will, affections, and understanding; or the vital, sensitive, and 
 intellectual faculties. Our love of God must be a sincere love, and not 
 in word and tongue only, as theirs is who say they love him, but their 
 hearts are not with him. It must be a strong love, we must love him in 
 the most intense degree; as we must <I>praise</I> him, so we must 
 <I>love</I> him, with <I>all that is within us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:1">Ps. ciii. 1</A>.

 It must be a singular and superlative love, we must love him more than
 any thing else; this way the stream of our affections must entirely 
 run. The heart must be united to love God, in opposition to a divided
 heart. All our love is too little to bestow upon him, and therefore
 all the powers of the soul must be engaged for him, and carried out 
 toward him. <I>This is the first and great commandment;</I> for
 obedience to this is the spring of obedience to all the rest; which is 
 <I>then</I> only acceptable, when it flows from love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) To <I>love our neighbour as ourselves</I> is the <I>second</I> 
 great commandment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>);

 <I>It is like unto that first;</I> it is inclusive of all the precepts 
 of the second table, as that is of the first. It is <I>like</I> it, for 
 it is founded upon it, and flows from it; and a right love to our 
 brother, whom we have seen, is both an instance and an evidence of our 
 <I>love to God, whom we have not seen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:20">1 John iv. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] It is implied, that we do, and should, love ourselves. There is a 
 self-love which is corrupt, and the root of the greatest sins, and it 
 must be put off and mortified: but there is a self-love which is 
 natural, and the rule of the greatest duty, and it must be preserved 
 and sanctified. We must love ourselves, that is, we must have a due 
 regard to the dignity of our own natures, and a due concern for the 
 welfare of our own souls and bodies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It is prescribed, that we <I>love our neighbour as ourselves.</I> 
 We must honour and esteem all men, and must wrong and injure none; must 
 have a good will to all, and good wishes for all, and, as we have 
 opportunity, must do good to all. We must love our neighbour as 
 ourselves, as truly and sincerely as we love ourselves, and in the same 
 instances; nay, in many cases we must deny ourselves for the good of 
 our neighbour, and must make ourselves servants to the true welfare of 
 others, and be willing to <I>spend and be spent for them,</I> to <I>lay 
 down our lives for the brethren.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Observe what the weight and greatness of these commandments is 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>);

 <I>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets;</I> 
 that is, This is the sum and substance of all those precepts relating 
 to practical religion which were written in men's hearts by nature, 
 revived by Moses, and backed and enforced by the preaching and writing 
 of the prophets. All hang upon the law of love; take away this, and all 
 falls to the ground, and comes to nothing. Rituals and ceremonials
 must give way to these, as must all spiritual gifts, for love is the 
 more excellent way. This is the spirit of the law, which animates it, 
 the cement of the law, which joins it; it is the root and spring of all 
 other duties, the compendium of the whole Bible, not only of the law 
 and the prophets, but of the gospel too, only supposing this love to be 
 the fruit of faith, and that we love God in Christ, and our neighbour 
 for his sake. All hangs on these two commandments, as the effect doth 
 both on its efficient and on its final cause; for <I>the fulfilling of 
 the law is love</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:10">Rom. xiii. 10</A>)
 
 and <I>the end of the law is love,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:5">1 Tim. i. 5</A>.

 The law of love is the nail, is the <I>nail in the sure place, fastened 
 by the masters of assemblies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:11">Eccl. xii. 11</A>),

 on which is hung all <I>the glory of the law and the prophets</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:24">Isa. xxii. 24</A>),

 a nail that shall never be drawn; for on this nail all the glory of the 
 new Jerusalem shall eternally hang. <I>Love never faileth.</I> Into 
 these two great commandments therefore let our hearts be delivered as 
 into a mould; in the defence and evidence of these let us spend our 
 zeal, and not in notions, names, and strifes of words, as if those were 
 the mighty things on which the law and the prophets hung, and to them 
 the love of God and our neighbour must be sacrificed; but to the 
 commanding power of these let every thing else be made to bow.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>41  While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked
 them,
 &nbsp; 42  Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say
 unto him, <I>The Son</I> of David.
 &nbsp; 43  He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him
 Lord, saying,
 &nbsp; 44  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> 
 said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till
 I make thine enemies thy footstool?
 &nbsp; 45  If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
 &nbsp; 46  And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any
 <I>man</I> from that day forth ask him any more <I>questions.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Many questions the Pharisees had asked Christ, by which, though they 
 thought to pose him, they did but <I>ex</I>pose themselves; but now let 
 him ask them a question; and he will do it when they are gathered 
 together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 He did not take some one of them apart from the rest (<I>ne Hercules 
 contra duos--Hercules himself may be overmatched</I>), but, to shame 
 them the more, he took them all together, when they were in confederacy 
 and consulting against him, and yet puzzled them. Note, God delights to 
 baffle his enemies when they most strengthen themselves; he gives them 
 all the advantages they can wish for, and yet conquers them. 
 <I>Associate yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:9,10">Isa. iii. 9, 10</A>.

 Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ proposes a question to them, which they could easily answer; 
 it was a question in their own catechism; "<I>What think ye of Christ? 
 Whose Son is He?</I> Whose Son do you expect the Messiah to be, who was 
 promised to the fathers?" This they could easily answer, <I>The Son of 
 David.</I> It was the common periphrasis of the Messiah; they called 
 him <I>the Son of David.</I> So the scribes, who expounded the 
 scripture, had taught them, from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:35,36">Ps. lxxxix. 35, 36</A>,

 <I>I will not lie unto David; his seed shall endure for ever</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:7">Isa. ix. 7</A>),
 
 <I>upon the throne of David.</I> And 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1">Isa. xi. 1</A>,

 <I>A rod out of the stem of Jesse.</I> The covenant of royalty made
 with David was a figure of the covenant of redemption made with Christ, 
 who as David, was made King <I>with an oath,</I> and was first humbled 
 and then advanced. If Christ was the Son of David, he was really and 
 truly Man. Israel said, <I>We have ten parts in David;</I> and Judah
 said, <I>He is our bone and our flesh;</I> what part have we then in 
 the Son of David, who took our nature upon him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>What think ye of Christ?</I> They had put questions to him, one 
 after another, out of the law; but he comes and puts a question to them 
 upon the promise. Many are so full of the law, that they forget Christ, 
 as if their duties would save them without his merit and grace. It 
 concerns each of us seriously to ask ourselves, What think we of 
 Christ? Some think not of him at all, he is not in all, not in any, of 
 their thoughts; some think meanly, and some think hardly, of him; but 
 <I>to them that believe he is precious;</I> and <I>how precious then 
 are the thoughts of him!</I> While <I>the daughters of Jerusalem</I> 
 think no more of Christ than of <I>another beloved;</I> the spouse 
 thinks of him as <I>the Chief of ten thousands.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He starts a difficulty upon their answer, which they could not 
 easily solve, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:43-45"><I>v.</I> 43-45</A>.

 Many can so readily affirm the truth, that they think they have 
 knowledge enough to be proud of, who, when they are called to confirm 
 the truth, and to vindicate and defend it, show they have ignorance 
 enough to be ashamed of. The objection Christ raised was, <I>If Christ 
 be David's son, how then doth David, in spirit, call him Lord?</I> He 
 did not hereby design to ensnare them, as they did him, but to instruct 
 them in a truth they were loth to believe--that the expected Messiah is 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is easy to see that David calls Christ <I>Lord,</I> and this in 
 spirit being divinely inspired, and actuated therein by a spirit of 
 prophecy; for it was <I>the Spirit of the Lord that spoke by him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:1,2">2 Sam. xxiii. 1, 2</A>.

 David was one of those <I>holy men that spoke as</I> they were <I>moved 
 by the Holy Ghost,</I> especially in calling Christ <I>Lord;</I> for it 
 was then, as it is still

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:3">1 Cor. xii. 3</A>)

 that <I>no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy 
 Ghost.</I> Now, to prove that David, in spirit, called Christ 
 <I>Lord,</I> he quotes 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>,

 which psalm the scribes themselves understood of Christ; of him, it is
 certain, the prophet there speaks, of him and of no other man; and it 
 is a prophetical summary of the doctrine of Christ, it describes him 
 executing the offices of a Prophet, Priest, and King, both in his 
 humiliation and also in his exaltation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ quotes the whole verse, which shows the Redeemer in his 
 exaltation; 

 (1.) <I>Sitting at the right hand of God.</I> His sitting denotes both 
 rest and rule; his sitting at God's right hand denotes superlative 
 honour and sovereign power. See in what great words this is expressed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:1">Heb. viii. 1</A>);

 <I>He is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:9,Eph+1:20">Phil. ii. 9; Eph. i. 20</A>.

 He did not take this honour to himself, but was entitled to it by 
 covenant with his Father, and invested in it by commission from him, 
 and here is that commission.

 (2.) Subduing his enemies. There he shall sit, till they be all made 
 either his friends or his footstool. <I>The carnal mind,</I> wherever 
 it is, <I>is enmity to Christ;</I> and that is subdued in the 
 <I>conversion of the willing people that are called to his foot</I> (as 
 the expression is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:2">Isa. xli. 2</A>),

 and in the confusion of his impenitent adversaries, who shall be 
 brought under his foot, as the kings of Canaan were under the feet of 
 Joshua.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But that which this verse is quoted for is, that David calls the 
 Messiah <I>his Lord; the Lord,</I> Jehovah, <I>said unto my Lord.</I> 
 This intimates to us, that in expounding scripture we must take notice 
 of, and improve, not only that which is the main scope and sense of a 
 verse, but of the words and phrases, by which they Spirit chooses to 
 express that sense, which have often a very useful and instructive 
 significance. Here is a good note from that word, <I>My Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is not so easy for those who believe not the Godhead of the 
 Messiah, to clear this from an absurdity, if Christ b David's son. It 
 is incongruous for the father to speak of his son, the predecessor of 
 his successor, as his <I>Lord.</I> If David call him <I>Lord,</I> that 
 is laid down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>)

 as the <I>magis notum--the more evident truth;</I> for whatever is said 
 of Christ's humanity and humiliation must be construed and understood 
 in consistency with the truth of his divine nature and dominion. We 
 must hold this fast, that he is David's Lord, and by that explain his 
 being David's son. The seeming differences of scripture, as here, may 
 not only be accommodated, but contribute to the beauty and harmony of 
 the whole. <I>Amic&aelig; scripturarum lites, utinam et 
 nostr&aelig;--The differences observable in the scriptures are of a 
 friendly kind; would to God that our differences were of the same 
 kind!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have here the success of this gentle trial which Christ made of 
 the Pharisees' knowledge, in two things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It puzzled them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>);

 <I>No man was able to answer him a word.</I> Either it was their 
 ignorance that they did not know, or their impiety that they would not 
 own, the Messiah to be God; which truth was the only key to unlock this 
 difficulty. What those Rabbies could not then answer, blessed be God,
 the plainest Christian that is led into the understanding of the gospel 
 of Christ, can now account for; that Christ, as God, was David's 
 <I>Lord;</I> and Christ, as Man, was David's <I>son.</I> This he did 
 not now himself explain, but reserved it till the proof of it was 
 completed by his resurrection; but we have it fully explained by him in 
 his glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:16">Rev. xxii. 16</A>);

 <I>I am the root and the offspring of David.</I> Christ, as God, was 
 David's <I>Root;</I> Christ, as Man, was David's <I>Offspring.</I> If 
 we hold not fast this truth, that Jesus Christ is over all God blessed 
 for ever, we run ourselves into inextricable difficulties. And well 
 might David, his remote ancestor, call him <I>Lord,</I> when Mary, his 
 immediate mother, after she had conceived him, <I>called him, Lord and 
 God, her Saviour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:46,47">Luke i. 46, 47</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It silenced them, and all others that sought occasion against him; 
 <I>Neither durst any man, from that day forth, ask him any more</I> 
 such captious, tempting, ensnaring <I>questions.</I> Note, God will 
 glorify himself in the silencing of many whom he will not glorify
 himself in the salvation of. Many are convinced, that are not 
 converted, by the word. Had these been converted, they would have asked 
 him more questions, especially that great question, <I>What must we do 
 to be saved?</I> But since they could not gain their point, they would 
 have no more to do with him. But, thus all that strive with their 
 Master shall be convinced, as these Pharisees and lawyers here were, of 
 the inequality of the match.</P>
