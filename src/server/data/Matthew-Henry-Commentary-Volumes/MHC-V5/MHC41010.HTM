 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of
 Jud&aelig;a by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto
 him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
 &nbsp; 2  And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful
 for a man to put away <I>his</I> wife? tempting him.
 &nbsp; 3  And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command
 you?
 &nbsp; 4  And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement,
 and to put <I>her</I> away.
 &nbsp; 5  And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of
 your heart he wrote you this precept.
 &nbsp; 6  But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
 female.
 &nbsp; 7  For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
 cleave to his wife;
 &nbsp; 8  And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more
 twain, but one flesh.
 &nbsp; 9  What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
 asunder.
 &nbsp; 10  And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
 <I>matter.</I>
 &nbsp; 11  And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife,
 and marry another, committeth adultery against her.
 &nbsp; 12  And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to
 another, she committeth adultery.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus was an itinerant Preacher, did not continue long in a 
 place, for the whole land of Canaan was his parish, or diocese, and 
 therefore he would visit every part of it, and give instructions to 
 those in the remotest corners of it. Here we have him in the 
 <I>coasts</I> of Judea, by the further side of Jordan eastward, as we 
 found him, not long since, in the utmost borders westward, near Tyre 
 and Sidon. Thus was his circuit like that of the sun, from whose light 
 and heat nothing is hid. Now here we have him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>Resorted to</I> by the <I>people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Wherever he was, they flocked after him in crowds; they came to him 
 <I>again,</I> as they had done when he had formerly been in these 
 parts, and, <I>as he was wont, he taught them again.</I> Note, 
 Preaching was Christ's constant practice; it was what he was used to, 
 and, wherever he came, he did <I>as he was wont.</I> In Matthew it is 
 said, <I>He healed them;</I> here it is said, <I>He taught them:</I> 
 his cures were to confirm his doctrine, and to recommend it, and his 
 doctrine was to explain his cures, and illustrate them. He <I>taught 
 them again.</I> Note, Even those whom Christ hath taught, have need to 
 be taught <I>again.</I> Such is the fulness of the Christian doctrine, 
 that there is still more to be learned; and such our forgetfulness, 
 that we need to be reminded of what we do know.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have him <I>disputed with</I> by the Pharisees, who envied the 
 progress of his spiritual arms, and did all they could to obstruct and
 oppose it; to divert him, to perplex him, and to prejudice the people 
 against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A question they started concerning divorce 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 <I>Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?</I> This was a good 
 question, if it had been well put, and with a humble desire to know the 
 mind of God in this matter; but they proposed it, <I>tempting him,</I> 
 seeking an occasion against him, and an opportunity to expose him, 
 which side soever he should take of the question. Ministers must stand 
 upon their guard, lest, under pretence of being advised with, they be 
 ensnared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ's reply to them with a question 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 <I>What did Moses command you?</I> This he asked them, to testify his 
 respect to the law of Moses, and to show that he came not to destroy 
 it; and to engage them to a universal impartial respect for Moses's 
 writings and to compare one part of them with another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The fair account they gave of what they found in the law of Moses, 
 expressly concerning divorce, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Christ asked, <I>What did Moses command you?</I> They own that Moses 
 only <I>suffered,</I> or <I>permitted,</I> a man to write his wife a 
 <I>bill of divorce,</I> and to put <I>her away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:1">Deut. xxiv. 1</A>.

 "If you <I>will</I> do it, you must do it <I>in writing,</I> delivered
 into her own hand, and so put her away, and never return to her 
 again."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The answer that Christ gave to their question, in which he abides by 
 the doctrine he had formerly laid down in this case 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:32">Matt. v. 32</A>),

 <I>That whosoever puts away his wife, except for fornication, causeth 
 her to commit adultery.</I> And to clear this he here shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That the reason why Moses, in his <I>law,</I> permitted divorce, 
 was such, as that they ought not to make use of that permission; for it 
 was only <I>for the hardness of their hearts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 lest, if they were not permitted to divorce their wives, they should 
 murder them; so that none must put away their wives but such as are 
 willing to own that their hearts were so hard as to need this 
 permission.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That the account which Moses, in this <I>history, gives</I> of the 
 institution of marriage, affords such a reason against divorce, as 
 amounts to a prohibition of it. So that if the question be, <I>What did
 Moses command?</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 it must be answered, "Though by a temporary proviso he allowed divorce 
 to the Jews, yet by an eternal reason he forbade it to all the children 
 of Adam and Eve, and that is it which we must abide by."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Moses tells us, 

 [1.] That God made man <I>male and female, one</I> male, and <I>one</I> 
 female; so that <I>Adam could not</I> put away his wife and take 
 another, for there was no other to take, which was an intimation to all 
 his sons, that they <I>must not.</I>

 [2.] When this male and this female were, by the ordinance of God, 
 joined together in holy marriage, the law was, That a man must <I>leave 
 his father and mother, and cleave to his wife</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 which intimates not only the nearness of the relation, but the 
 perpetuity of it; he shall so cleave to his wife as not to be separated 
 from her. 

 [3.] The result of the relation is, That, though they are <I>two,</I> 
 yet they are <I>one,</I> they are <I>one flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 The union between them is the most intimate that can be, and, as Dr. 
 Hammond expresses it, a sacred thing that must not be violated. 

 [4.] God himself was <I>joined them together;</I> he has not only, as 
 Creator, fitted them to be comforts and helps meet for each other, but 
 he has, in wisdom and goodness, appointed them who are thus joined 
 together, to live together in love till death parts them. Marriage is 
 not an invention of men, but a divine institution, and therefore is to 
 be religiously observed, and the more, because it is a figure of the 
 mystical inseparable union between Christ and his church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now from all this he infers, that men ought not to <I>put</I> their 
 wives <I>asunder</I> from them, whom God has put so near them. The bond 
 which God himself has tied, is not to be lightly untied. They who are
 divorcing their wives for every offence, would do well to consider what
 would become of them, if God should in like manner deal with them. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:1,Jer+3:1">
 Isa. l. 1; Jer. iii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Christ's discourse with his disciples, in private, about this 
 matter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>.

 It was an advantage to them, that they had opportunity of personal 
 converse with Christ, not only about gospel mysteries, but about moral 
 duties, for further satisfaction. No more is here related of this 
 private conference, that the law Christ laid down in this case--That it 
 is adultery for a man to put away his wife, and marry another; it is 
 adultery <I>against the wife</I> he puts away, it is a wrong to her, a 
 breach of his contract with her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He adds, <I>If a woman shall put away her husband,</I> that is, elope 
 from him, leave him by consent, and <I>be married to another,</I> she 
 <I>commits adultery</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and it will be no excuse at all for her to say that it was with the 
 consent of her husband. Wisdom and grace, holiness and love, reigning 
 in the heart, will make those commands easy which to the carnal mind 
 may be as a heavy yoke.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And they brought young children to him, that he should touch
 them: and <I>his</I> disciples rebuked those that brought <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 14  But when Jesus saw <I>it,</I> he was much displeased, and said
 unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid
 them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
 &nbsp; 15  Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the
 kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
 &nbsp; 16  And he took them up in his arms, put <I>his</I> hands upon them,
 and blessed them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is looked upon as the indication of a kind and tender disposition to 
 take notice of little children, and this was remarkable in our Lord 
 Jesus, which is an encouragement not only to little children to apply 
 themselves to Christ when they are very young, but to grown people, who 
 are conscious to themselves of weakness and childishness, and of being, 
 through manifold infirmities, helpless and useless, like little 
 children. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Little children brought to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Their parents, or whoever they were that had the nursing of them, 
 brought them to him, that he should <I>touch them,</I> in token of his 
 commanding and conferring a blessing on them. It doth not appear that 
 they needed any bodily <I>cure,</I> nor were they capable of being 
 <I>taught:</I> but it seems, 

 1. That they had the care of them were mostly concerned <I>about their
 souls,</I> their better part, which ought to be the principal care of 
 all parents for their children; for that is the principal part, and it 
 is well with them, it if be well with their souls. 

 2. They believed that Christ's blessing would do their souls good; and
 therefore to him they brought them, that he might <I>touch</I> them, 
 knowing that he could reach their hearts, when nothing their parents 
 could say to them, or do for them, would reach them. We may present our 
 children to Christ, now that he is in heaven, for from thence he can 
 reach them with his blessing, and therein we may act faith upon the 
 fulness and extent of his grace, the kind intimations he hath always 
 given of favour to the seed of the faithful, the tenour of the covenant 
 with Abraham, and the promise <I>to us and to our children,</I> 
 especially that great promise of pouring his <I>Spirit upon our 
 seed,</I> and his <I>blessing</I> upon <I>our offspring,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:3">Isa. xliv. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The <I>dis</I>couragement which the disciples gave to the bringing 
 of children to Christ; <I>They rebuked them that brought them;</I> as 
 if they had been sure that they knew their Master's mind in this 
 matter, whereas he had lately cautioned them not to <I>despise the 
 little ones.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The <I>en</I>couragement Christ gave to it. 

 1. He took it very ill that his disciples should keep them off; <I>When
 he saw it, he was much displeased,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 "What do you mean? Will you hinder me from doing good, from doing good 
 to the rising generation, to the lambs of the flock?" Christ is very 
 angry with his own disciples, if they discountenance any in coming to 
 him themselves, or in bringing their children to him. 

 2. He ordered that they should be <I>brought to him,</I> and nothing
 said or done to hinder them; suffer <I>little children,</I> as soon as 
 they are capable, to <I>come to me,</I> to offer up their supplications 
 to me, and to receive instructions from me. Little children are welcome 
 betimes to the throne of grace with their Hosannas. 

 3. He owned them as members of his church, as they had been of the
 Jewish church. He came to set up the <I>kingdom of God</I> among men, 
 and took this occasion to declare that that kingdom admitted <I>little 
 children</I> to be the subjects of it, and gave them a title to the 
 privileges of subjects. Nay, the kingdom of God is to be kept up by
 such: they must be taken in when they are little children, that they 
 may be secured for hereafter, to bear up the name of Christ. 

 4. That there must be something of the temper and disposition of little
 children found in all that Christ will own and bless. We must 
 <I>receive the kingdom of God as little children</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 that is, we must stand affected to Christ and his grace as little 
 children do to their parents, nurses, and teachers. We must be 
 <I>inquisitive,</I> as children, must learn as children (that is the 
 learning age), and in learning must <I>believe, Oportet discentem 
 credere--A learner must believe.</I> The mind of a child is white paper 
 (<I>tabula rasa--a mere blank</I>), you may write upon it what you
 will; such must our minds be to the pen of the blessed Spirit. Children 
 are under government; so must we be. <I>Lord, what wilt thou have me to 
 do?</I> We must receive the kingdom of God as the child Samuel did, 
 <I>Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.</I> Little children depend 
 upon their parents' wisdom and care, are carried in their arms, go 
 where they send them, and take what they provide for them; and thus 
 must we receive the <I>kingdom of God,</I> with a humble resignation of 
 ourselves to Jesus Christ, and an easy dependence upon him, both for 
 strength and righteousness, for tuition, provision, and a portion. 

 5. He received the children, and gave them what was desired

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 <I>He took them up in his arms,</I> in token of his affectionate 
 concern for them; <I>put his hands upon them,</I> as was desired, and 
 <I>blessed them.</I> She how he out-did the desires of these parents; 
 they begged he would touch them, but he did more. 

 (1.) He <I>took them in his arms.</I> Now the scripture was fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11">Isa. xl. 11</A>),

 <I>He shall gather the lambs in his arms, and carry them in his 
 bosom.</I> Time was, when Christ himself was taken up in old Simeon's 
 arms, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:28">Luke ii. 28</A>.

 And now he took up these children, not complaining of the burthen (as
 Moses did, when he was bid to <I>carry Israel,</I> that peevish child, 
 <I>in his bosom, as a nursing father bears the sucking child,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:12">Num. xi. 12</A>),

 but pleased with it. If we in a right manner bring our children to
 Christ, he will take them up, not only in the arms of his power and 
 providence, but in the arms of his pity and grace (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:8">Ezek. xvi. 8</A>);
 
 underneath them are the <I>everlasting arms.</I> 

 (2.) He <I>put his hands upon them,</I> denoting the bestowing of his 
 Spirit upon them (for that is the hand of the Lord), and his setting 
 them apart for himself. 

 (3.) He <I>blessed</I> them with the spiritual blessings he came to 
 give. Our children are happy, if they have but the <I>Mediator's 
 blessing</I> for their portion. It is true, we do not read that he 
 baptized these children, baptism was not fully settled as the door of 
 admission into the church until after Christ's resurrection; but he 
 asserted their visible church-membership, and by another sign bestowed 
 those blessings upon them, which are now appointed to be conveyed and 
 conferred by baptism, the seal of the promise, which is <I>to us</I> 
 and <I>to our children.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one
 running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what
 shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
 &nbsp; 18  And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? <I>there
 is</I> none good but one, <I>that is,</I> God.
 &nbsp; 19  Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do
 not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not,
 Honour thy father and mother.
 &nbsp; 20  And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I
 observed from my youth.
 &nbsp; 21  Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One
 thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and
 give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and
 come, take up the cross, and follow me.
 &nbsp; 22  And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he
 had great possessions.
 &nbsp; 23  And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples,
 How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of
 God!
 &nbsp; 24  And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus
 answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it
 for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
 &nbsp; 25  It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,
 than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
 &nbsp; 26  And they were astonished out of measure, saying among
 themselves, Who then can be saved?
 &nbsp; 27  And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men <I>it is</I>
 impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are
 possible.
 &nbsp; 28  Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and
 have followed thee.
 &nbsp; 29  And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is
 no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father,
 or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the
 gospel's,
 &nbsp; 30  But he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time,
 houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and
 lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
 &nbsp; 31  But many <I>that are</I> first shall be last; and the last first.

 Matthew, which makes his address to Christ very promising.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He came <I>running</I> to Christ, which was an indication of his 
 humility; he laid aside the gravity and grandeur of a ruler, when he 
 came to Christ: thus too he manifested his earnestness and importunity; 
 he <I>ran</I> as one <I>in haste,</I> and longing to be in conversation 
 with Christ. He had now an opportunity of consulting this great 
 Prophet, in the things that belonged to his peace, and he would not let 
 slip the opportunity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He came to him when he was <I>in the way,</I> in the midst of 
 company: he did not insist upon a private conference with him by night, 
 as Nicodemus did, though like him he was a ruler, but <I>when he shall 
 find him without,</I> will <I>embrace</I> that opportunity of advising 
 with him, <I>and not be ashamed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:1">Cant. viii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He <I>kneeled to him,</I> in token of the great value and veneration 
 he had for him, as a teacher come from God, and his earnest desire to 
 be taught by him. He bowed the knee to the Lord Jesus, as one that 
 would not only <I>do obeisance</I> to him now, but would <I>yield 
 obedience</I> to him always; he <I>bowed the knee,</I> as one that 
 meant to <I>bow the soul</I> to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. His address to him was serious and weighty; <I>Good Master, what 
 shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?</I> Eternal life was an 
 article of his creed, though then denied by the Sadducees, a prevailing 
 party: he asks, What shall he do now that he may be happy for ever.
 Most men enquire for good to be <I>had</I> in this world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6">Ps. iv. 6</A>),
 
 <I>any good;</I> he asks for <I>good to be done</I> in this world, in 
 order to the enjoyment of the greatest good in the other world; not, 
 Who will make us to <I>see good?</I> But, "Who will make us to <I>do 
 good?</I>" He enquires for <I>happiness</I> in the way of <I>duty;</I> 
 the <I>summum bonum--chief good</I> which Solomon was in quest of, was
 <I>that good for the sons of men which they do should do,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:3">Eccl. ii. 3</A>.
 
 Now this was,

 (1.) A very serious question in itself; it was about eternal things,
 and his own concern in those things. Note, <I>Then</I> there begins to 
 be some hope of people, when they begin to enquire solicitously, what 
 they shall do to get to heaven. 

 (2.) It was proposed to a right person, one that was every way fit to 
 answer it, being himself <I>the Way, the Truth,</I> and <I>the 
 Life,</I> the true way to life, to eternal life; who came <I>from 
 heaven</I> on purpose, first to <I>lay open for us,</I> and then to 
 <I>lay open to us;</I> first to make, and then to make known, the way 
 to <I>heaven.</I> Note, Those who would know what they shall do to be 
 saved, must apply themselves to Christ, and enquire of him; it is 
 peculiar to the Christian religion, both to show eternal life, and to 
 show the way to it. 

 (3.) It was proposed with a good design--to be instructed. We find this 
 same question put by a lawyer, not <I>kneeling,</I> but standing up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:25">Luke x. 25</A>),

 with a bad design, to pick quarrels with him; he <I>tempted him, 
 saying, Master, what shall I do?</I> It is not so much the good 
 <I>words</I> as the good <I>intention</I> of them that Christ looks 
 at.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Christ encouraged this address, 

 (1.) By <I>assisting his faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 He called him <I>good Master;</I> Christ would have him mean thereby, 
 that he looked upon him to be <I>God,</I> since there is none good but 
 <I>one,</I> that is <I>God,</I> who is one, and his name one, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:9">Zech. xiv. 9</A>.

 Our English word <I>God</I> doubtless hath affinity with <I>good;</I>
 as the Hebrews name God by his power, <I>Elohim, the strong God;</I> so 
 we by his goodness, the <I>good God.</I>

 (2.) By directing his practice 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 <I>Keep the commandments;</I> and thou <I>knowest</I> what they are. He
 mentions the six commandments of the second table, which prescribe our 
 duty to our neighbour; he inverts the order, putting the seventh 
 commandment before the sixth, to intimate that <I>adultery</I> is a sin 
 no less heinous than <I>murder</I> itself. The fifth commandment is 
 here put last, as that which should especially be remembered and 
 observed, to keep us to all the rest. Instead of the tenth
 commandment, <I>Thou shalt not covet,</I> our Saviour here puts, 
 <I>Defraud not.</I> <B><I>Me apostereses</I></B>--that is, saith Dr.
 Hammond, "Thou shalt not rest contented with thy own, and not seek to 
 increase it by the diminution of other men's." It is a rule of justice 
 not to advance or enrich ourselves by doing wrong or injury to any 
 other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The young man bid fair for heaven, having been free from any open 
 gross violations of the divine commands. Thus far he was able to same 
 in some measure 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>Master, all these have I observed from my youth.</I> He thought he 
 had, and his neighbours thought so too. Note, Ignorance of the extent 
 and spiritual nature of the divine law, makes people think themselves 
 in a better condition than they really are. Paul was alive <I>without
 the law.</I> But when he saw that to be <I>spiritual,</I> he saw 
 himself to be <I>carnal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:9,14">Rom. vii. 9, 14</A>.

 However, he that could say he was free from scandalous sin, went
 further than many in the way to eternal life. But though we <I>know 
 nothing by ourselves, yet are we not thereby justified.</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:4">1 Cor. iv. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. Christ had a kindness for him; <I>Jesus, beholding him, loved 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 He was pleased to find that he had lived inoffensively, and pleased to 
 see that he was inquisitive how to live better than so. Christ
 particularly <I>loves</I> to see young people, and rich people, 
 <I>asking the way to heaven, with their faces thitherward.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a <I>sorrowful parting</I> between Christ and this young 
 man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ gave him a command of trial, by which it would appear whether 
 he did in sincerity aim at eternal life, and press towards it: he 
 seemed to have his heart much upon it, and if so, he is what he should 
 be; but has he indeed his heart upon it? Bring him to the touchstone.
 
 (1.) Can he find in his heart <I>to part with his riches</I> for the 
 service of Christ? He hath a good estate, and now, shortly, at the 
 first founding of the Christian church, the necessity of the case will 
 require that those who have <I>lands, sell them, and lay the money at 
 the apostles' feet;</I> and how will he dispense with that? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:34,35">Acts iv. 34, 35</A>.

 After awhile, tribulation and persecution will arise, because of the
 word; and he must be forced to sell his estate, or have it taken from 
 him, and how will he like that? Let him know the worst now; if he will 
 not come up to these terms, let him quit his pretensions; as good as 
 the first as at last. "<I>Sell whatsoever thou hast</I> over and above 
 what is necessary for thy support;" probably, he had no family to 
 provide for; let him therefore be a <I>father to the poor,</I> and make 
 them his heirs. Every man, according to his ability, must relieve the 
 poor, and be content, when there is occasion, to straiten himself to do 
 it. Worldly wealth is given us, not only as <I>maintenance</I> to bear
 our charges through this world, according to our place in it, but as 
 <I>talent,</I> to be used and employed for the glory of our great 
 Master in the world, who hath so ordered it, that the poor we should 
 have always with us as his receivers.

 (2.) Can he find it in his heart to go through the hardest costliest 
 services he may be called to as a disciple of Christ, and depend upon 
 him for a recompence <I>in heaven?</I> He asks Christ what he should do 
 more than he has done to obtain <I>eternal life,</I> and Christ puts it 
 to him, whether he has indeed that firm belief of, and that high value 
 for, eternal life that he seems to have. Doth he really believe there 
 is a true treasure in heaven sufficient to make up all he can leave, or 
 lose, or lay out, for Christ? Is he willing to deal with Christ <I>upon 
 trust?</I> Can he give him credit for all he is worth; and be willing 
 to bear a present cross, in expectation of a future crown?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Upon this he flew off 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);

 <I>He was sad at that saying;</I> was sorry that he could not be a 
 follower of Christ upon any easier terms than leaving all to follow 
 him; that he could not <I>lay hold</I> on eternal life, and <I>keep 
 hold</I> of his temporal possessions too. But since he could not come 
 up to the terms of discipleship, he was so fair as not to pretend to 
 it; <I>He went away grieved.</I> Here appeared the truth of that 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:24">Matt. vi. 24</A>),

 <I>Ye cannot serve God and mammon;</I> while he held to mammon he did 
 in effect <I>despise</I> Christ, as all those do who prefer the world 
 before him. He bids for what he has a mind for in the market, yet goes 
 away grieved, and leaves it, because he cannot have it at his own 
 price. Two words to a bargain. Motions are not marriages. That which
 ruined this young man was, <I>he had great possessions;</I> thus the 
 <I>prosperity of fools destroys them,</I> and those who spend their 
 days in wealth are tempted to say to God, <I>Depart from us;</I> or to 
 their hearts, <I>Depart from God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is Christ's discourse with his disciples. We are tempted to 
 wish that Christ had <I>mollified</I> that saying which frightened this 
 young gentleman from following him, and by an explanation taken off the 
 harshness of it: but he knew all men's hearts; he would not court him 
 to be his follower, because he was a <I>rich man</I> and a ruler; but, 
 if he will go, let him go. Christ will keep no man against his will; 
 and therefore we do not find that Christ called him back, but took this 
 occasion to instruct his disciples in two things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The difficulty of the salvation of those who have an abundance of 
 this world; because there are few who have <I>a deal to leave,</I> that 
 can be persuaded to <I>leave it</I> for Christ, or to lay it out in 
 doing good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ asserts this here; <I>He looked about</I> upon his 
 <I>disciples,</I> because he would have them all take notice of what he 
 said, that by it they might have their judgments rightly informed, and 
 their mistakes rectified, concerning worldly wealth, which they were 
 apt to over-rate; <I>How hardly shall they who have riches enter into 
 the kingdom of God!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 They have many temptations to grapple with, and many difficulties to 
 get over, which lie not in the way of poor people. But he explains 
 himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>,

 where he calls the disciples <I>children,</I> because as such they 
 should be <I>taught</I> by him, and <I>portioned</I> by him with better 
 things than this young man left Christ to cleave to; and whereas he had 
 said, <I>How hardly will those who have riches get to heaven;</I> here 
 he tells them, that the danger arose not so much from their 
 <I>having</I> riches as from their <I>trusting to them,</I> and placing 
 their confidence in them, expecting protection, provision, and a 
 portion from them; saying that <I>to their gold,</I> which they should 
 say only to their God, <I>Thou art my hope,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:24">Job xxxi. 24</A>.

 They have such a value as this for the wealth of the world, will never
 be brought to put a right value upon Christ and his grace. They that 
 <I>have</I> ever so much riches, but do not <I>trust in them,</I> that 
 see the vanity of them, and their utter insufficiency to make a soul 
 happy, have got over the difficulty, and can easily part with them for 
 Christ: but they have ever so little, if they set their hearts upon 
 that little, and place their happiness in it, it will keep them from 
 Christ. He enforces this assertion with,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>,

 <I>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for 
 a rich man,</I> that <I>trusts in riches,</I> or inclines to do so, 
 <I>to enter into the kingdom of God.</I> The disproportion here seems 
 so great (though the more it is so the more it answers the intention), 
 that some have laboured to bring the camel and the eye of the needle a 
 little nearer together. 

 [1.] Some imagine there might be some wicket-gate, or door, to 
 Jerusalem, commonly known by the name of <I>the needle's eye,</I> for 
 its straitness, through which a camel could not be got, unless he were 
 unloaded, and made to kneel, as those camel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:11">Gen. xxiv. 11</A>.

 So a rich man cannot get to heaven unless he is willing to part with
 the burthen of his worldly wealth, and stoop to the duties of a humble 
 religion, and so enter <I>at the strait gate.</I>

 [2.] Others suggest that the word we translate a <I>camel,</I> 
 sometimes signifies a cable-rope, which, though not to be got through a 
 needle's eye, yet is of great affinity to it. A rich man, compared with 
 the poor, is as a cable to a single thread, stronger, but not so 
 pliable, and it will not go through the <I>needle's eye,</I> unless it 
 be untwisted. So the rich man must be loosed and disentangled from his 
 riches, and then there is some hope of him, that thread by thread he 
 may be got through the eye of the needle, otherwise he is good for 
 nothing but to cast anchor in the earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) This truth was very surprising to the disciples; <I>They were 
 astonished at his words,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 <I>They were astonished out of measure, and said among themselves, Who 
 then can be saved?</I> They knew what were generally the sentiments of 
 the Jewish teachers, who affirmed that the Spirit of God chooses to 
 reside in rich men; nay, they knew what abundance of promises there 
 were, in the Old Testament, of temporal good things; they knew likewise 
 that all either are rich, or fain would be so, and that they who are 
 rich, have so much the larger opportunities of doing good, and 
 therefore were amazed to hear that it should be so hard for rich people 
 to go to heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Christ reconciled them to it, by referring it to the almighty
 power of God, to help even rich people over the difficulties that lie 
 in the way of their salvation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 He <I>looked upon them,</I> to engage their attention, and said, 
 "<I>With men it is impossible;</I> rich people cannot by their own 
 skill or resolution get over these difficulties, but the grace of God 
 can do it, for <I>with him all things are possible.</I>" If <I>the 
 righteous scarcely are saved,</I> much more may we say so of the 
 <I>rich;</I> and therefore when any get to heaven, they must give all 
 the glory to God, who worketh in them <I>both to will and to 
 do.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The greatness of the salvation of those that have but a little of 
 this world, and leave it for Christ. This he speaks of, upon occasion 
 of Peter's mentioning what he and the rest of the disciples had left to 
 follow him; <I>Behold,</I> (saith he), <I>we have left all to follow 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 "You have <I>done well,</I>" saith Christ, "and it will prove in the 
 end that you have done well <I>for yourselves;</I> you shall be 
 abundantly recompensed, and not only you shall be <I>reimbursed,</I> 
 who have left but a little, but those that have ever so much, though it 
 were so much as this young man had, that could not persuade himself to 
 quit it for Christ; yet they shall have much more than an equivalent 
 for it."

 (1.) The loss is supposed to be very great; he specifies, 

 [1.] Worldly wealth; <I>houses</I> are here put first, and <I>lands</I> 
 last: if a man quit his <I>house,</I> which should be for his 
 habitation, and his <I>land,</I> which should be for his maintenance, 
 and so make himself a beggar and an outcast. This has been the choice 
 of suffering saints; farewell houses and lands, though ever so 
 convenient and desirable, through the inheritance of fathers, for the 
 house which is from heaven, and the inheritance of the saints in light, 
 where are many mansions.

 [2.] Dear relations. <I>Father and mother, wife and children, brethren 
 and sisters.</I> In these, as much as in any temporal blessing, the 
 comfort of life is bound up; without these the world would be a 
 wilderness; yet, when we must either for sake these or Christ, we must 
 remember that we stand in nearer relation to Christ than we do to any 
 creature; and therefore to keep in with him, we must be content to 
 break with all the world, and to say to father and mother, as Levi did, 
 <I>I have not known you.</I> The greatest trial of a good man's 
 constancy is, when his love to Christ comes to stand in competition 
 with a love that is lawful, nay, that is his duty. It is easy to such a 
 one to forsake a <I>lust</I> for Christ, for he hath that within him, 
 that rises against it; but to forsake a <I>father,</I> a 
 <I>brother,</I> a <I>wife,</I> for Christ, that is, to forsake those 
 whom he knows he must love, is hard. And yet he must do so, rather than 
 deny or disown Christ. Thus great is the loss supposed to be; but it is 
 <I>for Christ's sake,</I> that he may be honoured, and the 
 <I>gospel's,</I> that it may be promoted and propagated. It is not the 
 <I>suffering,</I> but the <I>cause,</I> that makes the <I>martyr.</I> 
 And therefore, 

 (2.) The advantage will be great. 

 [1.] <I>They shall receive a hundred-fold in this time, houses, and 
 brethren, and sisters;</I> not <I>in specie,</I> but that which is 
 equivalent. He shall have abundance of comfort while he lives, 
 sufficient to make up for all his losses; his relation to Christ, his 
 communion with the saints, and his title to eternal life, shall be to 
 him <I>brethren,</I> and <I>sisters,</I> and <I>houses,</I> and all.
 God's providence gave Job double to what he had had, but suffering 
 Christians shall have a <I>hundred-fold</I> in the comforts of the 
 Spirit sweetening their creature comforts. But observe, It is added 
 here in Mark, <I>with persecutions.</I> Even when they are gainers by 
 Christ, let them still expect to be sufferers for him; and not be out 
 of the reach of persecution, till they come to heaven. Nay, The 
 <I>persecutions</I> seem to come in here among <I>the receivings</I> in 
 this present time; for unto you it is given, not only to believe in 
 Christ, but also to <I>suffer for his name;</I> yet this is not all,

 [2.] They shall have <I>eternal life in the world to come.</I> If they 
 receive a hundred-fold in this world, one would think they should not 
 be encouraged to expect any more. Yet, as if that were a small matter, 
 they shall have <I>life eternal</I> into the bargain; which is more 
 than ten thousand-fold, ten thousand times told, for all their losses.
 But because they talked so much, and really more than became them, of 
 <I>leaving all</I> for Christ, he tells them, though they were <I>first 
 called,</I> that there should be disciples called after them, that 
 should be preferred before them; as St. Paul, who was one <I>born out 
 of due time,</I> and yet laboured more abundantly than all the rest of 
 the apostles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:10">1 Cor. xv. 10</A>.

 Then the <I>first</I> were <I>last,</I> and the last <I>first.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>32  And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus
 went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed,
 they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell
 them what things should happen unto him,
 &nbsp; 33  <I>Saying,</I> Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man
 shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes;
 and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the
 Gentiles:
 &nbsp; 34  And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall
 spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall
 rise again.
 &nbsp; 35  And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him,
 saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever
 we shall desire.
 &nbsp; 36  And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for
 you?
 &nbsp; 37  They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on
 thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.
 &nbsp; 38  But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye
 drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the
 baptism that I am baptized with?
 &nbsp; 39  And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye
 shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the
 baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:
 &nbsp; 40  But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine
 to give; but <I>it shall be given to them</I> for whom it is prepared.
 &nbsp; 41  And when the ten heard <I>it,</I> they began to be much
 displeased with James and John.
 &nbsp; 42  But Jesus called them <I>to him,</I> and saith unto them, Ye know
 that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise
 lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon
 them.
 &nbsp; 43  But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be
 great among you, shall be your minister:
 &nbsp; 44  And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant
 of all.
 &nbsp; 45  For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but
 to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Christ's prediction of his own sufferings; this string he harped
 much upon, though in the ears of his disciples it sounded very harsh
 and unpleasing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See here how bold he was; when they were going up to Jerusalem, 
 <I>Jesus went before them,</I> as the <I>captain of our salvation,</I> 
 that was now to be <I>made perfect through sufferings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Thus he showed himself forward to go on with his undertaking, even when 
 he came to the hardest part of it. Now that the time was at hand, he 
 said, <I>Lo, I come;</I> so far was he from <I>drawing back,</I> that 
 now, more than ever, he <I>pressed forward.</I> <I>Jesus went before 
 them, and they were amazed.</I> They began now to consider what 
 imminent danger they ran themselves into, when they went to Jerusalem; 
 how very malicious the Sanhedrim which sat there was against their 
 Master and them; and they were ready to tremble at the thought of it. 
 To hearten them, therefore, Christ <I>went before them.</I> "Come," 
 saith he, "surely you will venture where your Master ventures." Note, 
 When we see ourselves entering upon sufferings, it is encouraging to 
 see our Master go before us. Or, <I>He went before them,</I> and 
 <I>therefore</I> they were <I>amazed;</I> they admired to see with what 
 cheerfulness and alacrity he went on, though he knew he was going to 
 suffer and die. Note, Christ's courage and constancy in going on with
 his undertaking for our salvation, are, and will be, the wonder of all 
 his disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See here how timorous and faint-hearted his disciples were; <I>As 
 they followed, they were afraid,</I> afraid for themselves, as being 
 apprehensive of their own danger; and justly might they be 
 <I>ashamed</I> of their being thus <I>afraid.</I> Their Master's 
 courage should have put spirit into them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. See here what method he took to silence their fears. He did not go 
 about to make the matter better than it was, nor to feed them with 
 hopes that he might escape the storm, but told them <I>again</I> what 
 he had often told them before, the <I>things that should happen to 
 him.</I> He knew the worst of it, and therefore went on thus boldly, 
 and he will let them know the worst of it. Come, <I>be not afraid;</I> 
 for, 

 (1.) There is no remedy, the matter is determined, and cannot be 
 avoided. 

 (2.) It is only the <I>Son of man</I> that shall suffer; their time of 
 suffering was now at hand, he will now provide for their security. 

 (3.) He <I>shall rise again;</I> the issue of his sufferings will be 
 glorious to himself, and advantageous to all that are his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>.
 
 The method and particulars of Christ's sufferings are more largely 
 foretold here than in any other of the predictions--that he shall first 
 be delivered up by Judas to the <I>chief priests and the scribes;</I> 
 that they shall condemn him to death, but, not having the power to put 
 him to death, shall <I>deliver him to the Gentiles,</I> to the Roman 
 powers, and they shall <I>mock him,</I> and <I>scourge him,</I> and 
 <I>spit upon him,</I> and <I>kill him.</I> Christ had a perfect 
 foresight, not only of his own death, but of all the aggravating 
 circumstances of it; and yet he thus went forth to meet it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The check he gave to two of his disciples for their ambitious 
 request. This story is much the same here as we had it 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:20">Matt. xx. 20</A>.

 Only there they are said to have made their request by their mother,
 here they are said to make it themselves; she introduced them, and 
 presented their petition, and then they seconded it, and assented to 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. As, on the one hand, there are some that do not <I>use,</I> so, on 
 the other hand, there are some that <I>abuse,</I> the great 
 encouragements Christ has given us in prayer. He hath said, <I>Ask, and 
 it shall be given you;</I> and it is a commendable faith to ask for the 
 great things he has promised; but it was a culpable presumption in 
 these disciples to make such a boundless demand upon their Master; 
 <I>We would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall 
 desire.</I> We had much better leave it to him to do for us what he 
 sees fit, and he will do more than we can desire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:20">Eph. iii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We must be cautious how we make general promises. Christ would not 
 engage to do for them whatever they desired, but would know from them 
 what it was they did desire; <I>What would ye that I should do for 
 you?</I> He would have them go on with their suit, that they might be 
 made ashamed of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Many have been led into a snare by false notions of Christ's 
 kingdom, as if it were <I>of this world,</I> and like the kingdoms of 
 the potentates of this world. James and John conclude, If Christ 
 <I>rise again,</I> he must be a king, and if he be a king, his apostles 
 must be peers, and one of these would willingly be the <I>Primus par 
 regni--The first peer of the realm,</I> and the other next him, like 
 Joseph in Pharaoh's court, or Daniel in Darius's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Worldly honour is a glittering thing, with which the eyes of 
 Christ's own disciples have many a time been dazzled. Whereas to <I>be 
 good</I> should be more our care than to <I>look great,</I> or to have 
 the pre-eminence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Our weakness and short-sightedness appear as much in our prayers as 
 in any thing. We cannot order our speech, when we speak to God, by 
 reason of darkness, both concerning him and concerning ourselves. It is 
 folly to <I>prescribe</I> to God, and wisdom to <I>sub</I>scribe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. It is the will of Christ that we should prepare for sufferings, and
 leave it to him to recompense us for them. He needs not be put in mind, 
 as Ahasuerus did, of the services of his people, nor can he forget 
 their <I>work of faith and labour of love.</I> Our care must be, that 
 we may have wisdom and grace to know how to suffer with him, and then 
 we may trust him to provide in the best manner how we shall reign with 
 him, and when, and where, and what, the degrees of our glory shall 
 be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The check he gave to the rest of the disciples, for their 
 uneasiness at it. <I>They began to be much displeased,</I> to have 
 <I>indignation about James and John,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 They were angry at them for affecting precedency, not because it did so 
 ill become the disciples of Christ, but because each of them hoped to 
 have it himself. When the Cynic trampled on Alexander's foot-cloth,
 with <I>Calco fastum Alexandri--Now I tread on Alexander's pride,</I> 
 he was seasonably checked with <I>Sed majori fastu--But with a greater 
 pride of thine own.</I> So these discovered their own ambition, in 
 their displeasure at the ambition of James and John; and Christ took 
 this occasion to warn them against it, and all their successors in the 
 ministry of the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:42-44"><I>v.</I> 42-44</A>.

 He <I>called them to him</I> in a familiar way, to give them an example 
 of condescension, then when he was reproving their ambition, and to 
 teach them never to bid their disciples keep their distance. He shows 
 them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That dominion was generally <I>abused in the world</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>);

 <I>That they seemed to rule over the</I> Gentiles, that have the name 
 and title of rulers, <I>they exercise lordship over them,</I> that is 
 all they study and aim at, not so much to protect them, and provide for 
 their welfare, as to <I>exercise authority upon them;</I> they <I>will 
 be obeyed,</I> aim to be arbitrary, and to have their will in every 
 thing. <I>Sic volo, sic jubeo, stat pro ratione voluntas--Thus I will, 
 thus I command; my good pleasure is my law.</I> Their care is, what 
 they shall get by their subjects to support their own pomp and 
 grandeur, not what they shall do for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That therefore it ought not to be <I>admitted into the church;</I> 
 "<I>It shall not be so among you;</I> those that shall be put under 
 your charge, must be as sheep under the charge of the <I>shepherd,</I> 
 who is to tend them and feed them, and be a servant to them, not as 
 horses under the command of the driver, that works them and beats them, 
 and gets his pennyworths out of them. He that affects to be great and 
 chief, that thrusts himself into a secular dignity and dominion, <I>he 
 shall be servant of all,</I> he shall be mean and contemptible in the 
 eyes of all that are wise and good; <I>he that exalteth himself shall 
 be abased.</I>" Or rather, "He that would be <I>truly</I> great and 
 chief, he must lay out himself to do good to all, must stoop to the 
 meanest services, and labour in the hardest services. Those not only 
 shall be most <I>honoured</I> hereafter, but are most <I>honourable</I> 
 now, who are most useful." To convince them of this, he sets before 
 them his own example 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>);

 "The <I>Son of man</I> submits first to the greatest hardships and 
 hazards, and then enters into his glory, and can you expect to come to 
 it any other way; or to have more ease and honour than he has?" 

 (1.) He takes upon him <I>the form of a servant,</I> comes not to be 
 <I>ministered to,</I> and waited upon, but <I>to minister,</I> and wait 
 to be gracious. 

 (2.) He comes <I>obedient to death,</I> and to its dominion, for he 
 <I>gives his life a ransom for many;</I> did he die for the benefit of 
 good people, and shall not we study to live for their benefit?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>46  And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with
 his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartim&aelig;us, the
 son of Tim&aelig;us, sat by the highway side begging.
 &nbsp; 47  And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to
 cry out, and say, Jesus, <I>thou</I> Son of David, have mercy on me.
 &nbsp; 48  And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he
 cried the more a great deal, <I>Thou</I> Son of David, have mercy on
 me.
 &nbsp; 49  And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And
 they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort,
 rise; he calleth thee.
 &nbsp; 50  And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
 &nbsp; 51  And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I
 should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I
 might receive my sight.
 &nbsp; 52  And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made
 thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed
 Jesus in the way.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This passage of story agrees with that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:29">Matt. xx. 29</A>,

 &c. Only that there were told of <I>two</I> blind men; here, and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:35">Luke xviii. 35</A>,

 only of <I>one:</I> but if there were <I>two,</I> there was <I>one.</I>
 This one is named here, being a <I>blind beggar that</I> was much 
 talked of; he was called <I>Bartimeus,</I> that is, <I>the son of 
 Timeus;</I> which, some think, signifies <I>the son of a blind man;</I> 
 he was the blind son of a blind father, which made the case worse, and 
 the cure more wonderful, and the more proper to typify the spiritual 
 cures wrought by the grace of Christ, on those that not only are born 
 blind, but are born of those that are blind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This blind man sat <I>begging;</I> as they do with us. Note, Those 
 who by the providence of God are disabled to get a livelihood by their
 own labour, and have not any other way of subsisting, are the most 
 proper objects of charity; and particular care ought to be taken of 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He cried out to the Lord Jesus for <I>mercy;</I> <I>Have mercy on
 me, O Lord, thou Son of David.</I> Misery is the object of mercy, his
 own miserable case he recommends to the compassion of the <I>Son of
 David,</I> of whom it was foretold, that, when he should come to save 
 us, <I>the eyes of the blind should be opened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:5">Isa. xxxv. 5</A>.

 In coming to Christ for help and healing, we should have an eye to him
 as the promised Messiah, the Trustee of mercy and grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ encouraged him to hope that he should find mercy; for he 
 <I>stood still, and commanded him to be called.</I> We must never 
 reckon it a hindrance to us in our way, to <I>stand still,</I> when it 
 is to do a good work. Those about him, who had discouraged him at 
 first, perhaps were now the persons that signified to him the gracious 
 call of Christ; "<I>Be of good comfort, rise, he calls thee;</I> and if 
 he calls thee, he will cure thee." Note, The gracious invitations 
 Christ gives us to come to him, are great encouragements to our hope, 
 that we shall speed well if we come to him, and shall have what we come 
 for. Let the guilty, the empty, the tempted, the hungry, the naked, be 
 of good comfort, for he <I>calls them</I> to be pardoned, to be 
 supplied, to be succoured, to be filled, to be clothed, to have all 
 that done for them, which their case calls for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The poor man, hereupon, made the best of his way to Christ; He 
 <I>cast away his</I> loose upper <I>garment,</I> and came to Jesus 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>);

 he cast away every thing that might be in danger of throwing him down, 
 or might in any way hinder him in coming to Christ, or retard his 
 motion. Those who would come to Jesus, must cast away the garment of 
 their own sufficiency, must strip themselves of all conceit of that, 
 and must free themselves from <I>every weight,</I> and the sin that, 
 like long garments, doth <I>most easily beset them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:1">Heb. xii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The particular favour he begged, was, that his <I>eyes might be 
 opened;</I> that so he might be able to work for his living, and might 
 be no longer burthensome to others. It is a very desirable thing to be 
 in a capacity of earning our own bread; and where God has given men 
 their limbs and senses, it is a shame for men by their foolishness and 
 slothfulness to make themselves, in effect, <I>blind</I> and 
 <I>lame.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. This favour he received; his eyes were opened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>);

 and two things Mark here adds, which intimate, 

 1. How Christ made it a double favour to him, by putting the honour of
 it upon his faith; "<I>Thy faith hath made thee whole;</I> faith in 
 Christ as the Son of David, and in his pity and power; not thy 
 importunity, but <I>thy faith,</I> setting Christ on work, or rather 
 Christ setting thy faith on work." Those supplies are most comfortable, 
 that are fetched in by our faith.

 2. How he made it a double favour to himself; When he had <I>received
 his sight,</I> he <I>followed Jesus by the way.</I> By this he made it 
 appear that he was thoroughly cured, that he no more needed one to lead 
 him, but could go himself; and by this he evidenced the grateful sense 
 he had of Christ's kindness to him, that, when he had his sight, he 
 made this use of it. It is not enough to <I>come to Christ</I> for 
 spiritual healing, but, when we are healed, we must continue to follow 
 him; that we may do honour to him, and receive instruction from him.
 Those that have spiritual eye-sight, see that beauty in Christ, that 
 will effectually draw them to <I>run after him.</I></P>
