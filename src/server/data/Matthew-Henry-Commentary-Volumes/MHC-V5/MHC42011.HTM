 In this chapter, 

 I. Christ teaches his disciples to pray, and quickens and encourages
 them to be frequent, instant, and importunate in prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:1-13">ver. 1-13</A>.

 II. He fully answers the blasphemous imputation of the Pharisees, who
 charged him with casting out devils by virtue of a compact and 
 confederacy with Beelzebub, the prince of the devils, and shows the 
 absurdity and wickedness of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:14-26">ver. 14-26</A>.

 III. He shows the honour of obedient disciples to be greater than that
 of his own mother, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:27,28">ver. 27, 28</A>.

 IV. He upbraids the men of that generation for their infidelity and
 obstinacy, notwithstanding all the means of conviction offered to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:29-36">ver. 29-36</A>.

 V. He severely reproves the Pharisees and consciences of those that 
 submitted to them, and their hating and persecuting those that 
 witnessed against their wickedness,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain
 place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord,
 teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
 &nbsp; 2 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which
 art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will
 be done, as in heaven, so in earth.
 &nbsp; 3 Give us day by day our daily bread.
 &nbsp; 4 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that
 is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver
 us from evil.
 &nbsp; 5 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
 shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me
 three loaves;
 &nbsp; 6 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have
 nothing to set before him?
 &nbsp; 7 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the
 door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot
 rise and give thee.
 &nbsp; 8 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because
 he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and
 give him as many as he needeth.
 &nbsp; 9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and
 ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
 &nbsp; 10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
 findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
 &nbsp; 11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father,
 will he give him a stone? or if <I>he ask</I> a fish, will he for a
 fish give him a serpent?
 &nbsp; 12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
 &nbsp; 13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
 your children: how much more shall <I>your</I> heavenly Father give
 the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Prayer is one of the great laws of natural religion. That man is a 
 brute, is a monster, that never prays, that never gives glory to his 
 Maker, nor feels his favour, nor owns his dependence upon him. One 
 great design therefore of Christianity is to <I>assist us in 
 prayer,</I> to enforce the duty upon us, to instruct us in it, and 
 encourage us to expect advantage by it. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We find Christ himself <I>praying in a certain place,</I> probably 
 where he used to pray, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 As God, he was <I>prayed to;</I> as man, he <I>prayed;</I> and, though
 he was a Son, yet learned he this obedience. This evangelist has taken 
 particular notice of Christ's <I>praying often,</I> more than any other 
 of the evangelists: when he was baptized

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:21"><I>ch.</I> iii. 21</A>),

 he was <I>praying;</I> he <I>withdrew into the wilderness, and
 prayed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:16"><I>ch.</I> v. 16</A>);

 he <I>went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in
 prayer</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:12"><I>ch.</I> vi. 12</A>);

 he was <I>alone praying</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:18"><I>ch.</I> ix. 18</A>);

 soon after, he <I>went up into a mountain to pray,</I> and <I>as he
 prayed he was transfigured</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:28,29"><I>ch.</I> ix. 28, 29</A>);

 and here he was <I>praying in a certain place.</I> Thus, like a genuine
 son of David, he <I>gave himself unto prayer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:4">Ps. cix. 4</A>.

 Whether Christ was now <I>alone</I> praying, and the disciples only
 knew that he was so, or whether he prayed with them, is uncertain; it 
 is most probable that they were joining with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His disciples applied themselves to him for direction in prayer. 
 When he was praying, they asked, <I>Lord, teach us to pray.</I> Note, 
 The gifts and graces of others should excite us to covet earnestly the 
 same. Their zeal should provoke us to a holy imitation and emulation; 
 why should not we do as well as they? Observe, They came to him with 
 this request, <I>when he ceased;</I> for they would not disturb him 
 when he was at prayer, no, not with this good motion. Every thing is 
 beautiful in its season. <I>One of his disciples,</I> in the name of 
 the rest, and perhaps by their appointment, said, <I>Lord, teach 
 us.</I> Note, Though Christ is <I>apt to teach,</I> yet he will for 
 this be enquired of, and his disciples must attend him for 
 instruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 1. Their request is, "<I>Lord, teach us to pray;</I> give us a rule or
 model by which to go in praying, and put words into our mouths." Note, 
 It becomes the disciples of Christ to apply themselves to him for 
 instruction in prayer. <I>Lord, teach us to pray,</I> is itself a good 
 prayer, and a very needful one, for it is a hard thing to <I>pray 
 well</I> and it is Jesus Christ only that can <I>teach us,</I> by his 
 word and Spirit, <I>how to pray.</I> "Lord, teach me what it is to 
 pray; Lord, excite and quicken me to the duty; Lord, direct me what to 
 pray for; Lord, give me praying graces, that I may serve God acceptably 
 in prayer; Lord, teach me to pray in proper words; give me a mouth and 
 wisdom in prayer, that I may speak as I ought; <I>teach me what I shall 
 say.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their plea is, "<I>As John also taught his disciples.</I> He took 
 care to instruct his disciples in this necessary duty, and we would be 
 taught as they were, for we have a better Master than they had." Dr. 
 Lightfoot's notion of this is, That whereas the Jews' prayers were 
 generally adorations, and praises of God, and doxologies, John taught 
 his disciples such prayers as were more filled up with petitions and 
 requests; for it is said of them that they did <B><I>deeseis 
 poiountai</I></B>--<I>make prayers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:33"><I>ch.</I> v. 33</A>.

 The word signifies such prayers as are properly petitionary. "Now,
 Lord, teach us this, to be added to those benedictions of the name of 
 God which we have been accustomed to from our childhood." According to 
 this sense, Christ did there teach them a prayer consisting wholly of 
 petitions, and even omitting the doxology which had been affixed; and 
 the <I>Amen,</I> which was usually said in the <I>giving of thanks</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:16">1 Cor. xiv. 16</A>),

 and in the Psalms, is added to doxologies only. This disciple needed 
 not to have urged John Baptist's example: Christ was more ready to 
 teach than ever John Baptist was, and particularly taught to pray 
 better than John did, or could, teach his disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ gave them direction, much the same as he had given them 
 before in his sermon upon the mount, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:9">Matt. vi. 9</A>,

 &c. We cannot think that they had forgotten it, but they ought to have
 had further and fuller instructions, and he did not, as yet, think fit 
 to give them any; when the Spirit should be poured out upon them from 
 on high, they would find all their requests couched in these few words, 
 and would be able, in words of their own, to expatiate and enlarge upon 
 them. In Matthew he had directed them to pray <I>after this manner;</I> 
 here, <I>When ye pray, say;</I> which intimates that the Lord's prayer 
 was intended to be used both as a form of prayer and a directory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There are some differences between the Lord's prayer in Matthew and 
 Luke, by which it appears that it was not the design of Christ that we 
 should be <I>tied up</I> to these very words, for then there would have 
 been no variation. Here is one difference in the translation only, 
 which ought not to have been, when there is none in the original, and 
 that is in the third petition: <I>As in heaven, so in earth;</I> 
 whereas the words are the very same, and in the same order, as in 
 Matthew. But there is a difference in the fourth petition. In Matthew 
 we pray, "Give us daily bread <I>this</I> day:" here, "Give it us 
 <I>day by day</I>"--<B><I>kath hemeran</I></B>. <I>Day by day;</I> that
 is, "Give us <I>each day</I> the bread which our bodies require, as 
 they call for it:" not, "Give us <I>this day</I> bread for many days to 
 come;" but as the Israelites had manna, "Let us have bread 
 <I>to-day</I> for <I>to-day,</I> and to-<I>morrow</I> for 
 to-<I>morrow;</I>" for thus we may be kept in a <I>continual 
 dependence</I> upon God, as children upon their parents, and may have 
 our mercies fresh from his hand daily, and may find ourselves under 
 <I>fresh</I> obligations to do the work of every day in the day, 
 according as the <I>duty of the day requires,</I> because we have from 
 God the supplies of every day in the day, according as the <I>necessity 
 of the day requires.</I> Here is likewise some difference in the fifth 
 petition. In Matthew it is, <I>Forgive us our debts,</I> as we forgive: 
 here it is, <I>Forgive us our sins;</I> which proves that our sins are 
 our debts. <I>For we forgive;</I> not that our forgiving those that 
 have offended us can <I>merit</I> pardon from God, or be an inducement 
 to him to forgive us (he forgives for his own name's sake, and his 
 Son's sake); but this is a very necessary qualification for 
 forgiveness, and, if God have wrought it in us, we may plead that work 
 of his grace for the enforcing of our petitions for the pardon of our 
 sins: "Lord, forgive us, for thou hast thyself inclined us to forgive 
 others." There is another addition here; we plead not only in general, 
 We forgive <I>our debtors,</I> but in particular, "We profess <I>to 
 forgive every one that is indebted to us,</I> without exception. We so 
 <I>forgive our debtors</I> as not to bear malice or ill-will to any, 
 but true love to all, without any exception whatsoever." Here also the 
 doxology in the close is wholly omitted, and the <I>Amen;</I> for 
 Christ would leave them at liberty to use that or any other doxology 
 fetched out of David's psalms; or, rather, he left a vacuum here, to be 
 filled up by a doxology more peculiar to the Christian institutes, 
 ascribing glory to <I>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Yet it is, for substance, the same; and we shall therefore here only 
 gather up some general lessons from it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That in prayer we ought to come to God as children to <I>a 
 Father,</I> a common Father to us and <I>all mankind,</I> but in a 
 peculiar manner a Father to all the disciples of Jesus Christ. Let us 
 therefore in our requests both for others and for ourselves, come to 
 him with a humble boldness, confiding in his power and goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That at the same time, and in the same petitions, which we address 
 to God for <I>ourselves,</I> we should take in with us <I>all the 
 children of men,</I> as God's creatures and our fellow-creatures. A 
 rooted principle of <I>catholic charity,</I> and of <I>Christian 
 sanctified humanity,</I> should go along with us, and dictate to us 
 throughout this prayer, which is so worded as to be accommodated to 
 that noble principle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That in order to the confirming of the habit of 
 heavenly-mindedness in us, which ought to actuate and govern us in the 
 whole course of our conversation, we should, in all our devotions, with 
 an eye of faith look <I>heavenward,</I> and view the God we pray to as 
 our Father <I>in heaven,</I> that we may make the <I>upper world</I> 
 more familiar to us, and may ourselves become better prepared for the 
 future state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That in prayer, as well as in the tenour of our lives, we must 
 <I>seek first the kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof,</I> by 
 ascribing honour to his name, his <I>holy</I> name, and power to his 
 government, both that of his providence in the world and that of his 
 grace in the church. O that both the one and the other may be more 
 manifested, and we and others more manifestly brought into subjection 
 to both!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) That the <I>principles</I> and <I>practices</I> of the 
 <I>upper</I> world, the <I>unseen</I> world (which therefore by 
 <I>faith</I> only we are <I>apprized of</I>), are the <I>great 
 original--the</I> <B><I>archetypon</I></B>, to which we should desire 
 that the principles and practices of this <I>lower</I> world, both in 
 others and in ourselves, may be more conformable. Those words, <I>As in 
 heaven, so on earth,</I> refer to all the first three petitions: 
 "Father, let <I>thy name be sanctified</I> and <I>glorified,</I> and 
 thy kingdom prevail, and thy will be done on this earth that is now 
 alienated from thy service, as it is in yonder heaven that is entirely 
 devoted to thy service."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) That those who faithfully and sincerely mind the kingdom of God, 
 and the righteousness thereof, may humbly hope that <I>all other 
 things,</I> as far as to Infinite Wisdom seems good, <I>shall be added 
 to them,</I> and they may in faith pray for them. If our first chief 
 desire and care be that God's name may be sanctified, his kingdom come, 
 and his will be done, we may then come boldly to the throne of grace 
 for our <I>daily bread,</I> which will <I>then</I> be sanctified to us 
 when we are sanctified to God, and God is sanctified by us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) That in our prayers for temporal blessings we must <I>moderate</I> 
 our desires, and confine them to a <I>competency.</I> The expression 
 here used of <I>day by day</I> is the very same with our <I>daily 
 bread;</I> and therefore some think that we must look for another 
 signification of the word <B><I>epiousios</I></B> than that of 
 <I>daily,</I> which we give it, and that it means our <I>necessary</I> 
 bread, that bread that is <I>suited</I> to the craving of our nature, 
 the fruit that is brought out of the earth for our bodies that are made 
 of the earth and are earthly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:14">Ps. civ. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (8.) That sins are debts which we are daily contracting, and which 
 therefore we should every day pray for the forgiveness of. We are not 
 only going behind with our rent every day by <I>omissions</I> of duty 
 and in duty, but are daily incurring the penalty of the law, as well as 
 the forfeiture of our bond, by our <I>commissions.</I> Every day adds 
 to the score of our guilt, and it is a miracle of mercy that we have so 
 much encouragement given us to come every day to the throne of grace, 
 to pray for the pardon of our sins of daily infirmity. God 
 <I>multiplies to pardon</I> beyond seventy times seven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (9.) That we have no reason to expect, nor can with any confidence 
 pray, that God would forgive our sins against him, if we do not 
 <I>sincerely,</I> and from a truly Christian principle of 
 <I>charity,</I> forgive those that have at any time affronted us or 
 been injurious to us. Though the <I>words of our mouth</I> be even 
 <I>this</I> prayer to God, if the meditation of our heart at the same 
 time be, as often it is, malice and revenge to our brethren, we are not 
 accepted, nor can we expect an answer of peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (10.) That temptations to sin should be as much dreaded and deprecated 
 by us as ruin by sin; and it should be as much our care and prayer to 
 get the power of sin broken in us as to get the guilt of sin removed 
 from us; and though temptation may be a charming, fawning, flattering 
 thing, we must be as earnest with God that we may not be led into it as 
 that we may not be led by that to sin, and by sin to ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (11.) That God is to be depended upon, and sought unto, for our 
 deliverance <I>from all evil;</I> and we should pray, not only that we 
 may not be left to ourselves to run into evil, but that we may not be 
 left to Satan to bring evil upon us. Dr. Lightfoot understands it of
 being delivered <I>from the evil one,</I> that is, the devil, and 
 suggests that we should pray particularly against the apparitions of 
 the devil and his possessions. The disciples were employed to <I>cast 
 out devils,</I> and therefore were concerned to pray that they might be 
 guarded against the particular spite he would always be sure to have 
 against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He stirs up and encourages importunity, fervency, and constancy, in 
 prayer, by showing,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That importunity will go far in our dealings with men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:5-8"><I>v.</I> 5-8</A>.
 
 Suppose a man, upon a sudden emergency, goes to borrow a loaf or two of
 bread of a neighbour, at an unseasonable time of night, not for 
 himself, but for his friend that came unexpectedly to him. His 
 neighbour will be loth to accommodate him, for he has wakened him with 
 his knocking, and put him out of humour, and he has a great deal to say 
 in his excuse. The door is shut and locked, his children are asleep in 
 bed, in the same room with him, and, if he make a noise, he shall 
 disturb them. His servants are asleep, and he cannot make them hear; 
 and, for his own part, he shall catch cold if he rise to give him. But 
 his neighbour will have no nay, and therefore he continues 
 <I>knocking</I> still, and tells him he will do so till he has what he 
 comes for; so that he must give it to him, to be rid of him: <I>He will 
 rise, and give him as many as he needs, because of his importunity.</I> 
 He speaks this parable with the same intent that he speaks that in 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:1"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 1</A>:

 <I>That men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</I> Not that God
 can be wrought upon by importunity; we cannot be troublesome to him, 
 nor by being so change his counsels. We prevail with men by importunity 
 because they are <I>displeased</I> with it, but with God because he is 
 <I>pleased</I> with it. Now this similitude may be of use to us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To <I>direct</I> us in prayer. 

 [1.] We must come to God with <I>boldness</I> and <I>confidence</I> for 
 what we need, as a man does to the house of his neighbour or friend, 
 who, he knows, loves him, and is inclined to be kind to him. 

 [2.] We must come for <I>bread,</I> for that which is <I>needful,</I> 
 and which we cannot be without. 

 [3.] We must come to him by prayer <I>for others</I> as well as <I>for 
 ourselves.</I> This man did not come for bread for himself, but for his 
 friend. The Lord <I>accepted Job,</I> when he prayed for his friends, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:10">Job xlii. 10</A>.

 We cannot come to God upon a more pleasing errand than when we come to
 him for grace to enable us to do good, to <I>feed many</I> with <I>our 
 lips,</I> to entertain and edify those that come to us.

 [4.] We may come with the more boldness to God in a strait, if it be a 
 strait that we have not brought ourselves into by our own folly and 
 carelessness, but Providence has led us into it. This man would not 
 have wanted bread if his friend had not come in <I>unexpectedly.</I> 
 The care which Providence casts upon us, we may with cheerfulness cast 
 back upon Providence. 

 [5.] We ought to <I>continue instant</I> in prayer, and watch in the 
 same with all perseverance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To <I>encourage</I> us in prayer. If importunity could prevail 
 thus with <I>a man</I> who was angry at it, much more with a God who is 
 infinitely more kind and ready to do good <I>to us</I> than we are 
 <I>to one another,</I> and is not angry at our importunity, but accepts 
 it, especially when it is for spiritual mercies that we are 
 importunate. If he do not answer our prayers presently, yet he will in 
 due time, if we continue to pray.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That God has promised to give us what we ask of him. We have not 
 only the goodness of nature to take comfort from, but the word which he 
 has spoken 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 "<I>Ask, and it shall be given you;</I> either the thing itself you 
 shall ask or that which is equivalent; either the thorn in the flesh 
 removed, or grace sufficient given in."--We had this before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:7,8">Matt. vii. 7, 8</A>.

 <I>I say unto you.</I> We have it from Christ's own mouth, who knows
 his Father's mind, and in whom all promises are yea and amen. We must 
 not only <I>ask,</I> but we must <I>seek,</I> in the use of means, must 
 second our prayers with our endeavours; and, in <I>asking</I> and 
 <I>seeking,</I> we must continue <I>pressing,</I> still knocking at the 
 same door, and we shall at length prevail, not only by our prayers in 
 concert, but by our particular prayers: <I>Every one that asketh 
 receiveth,</I> even the meanest saint that asks in faith. <I>This poor 
 man cried, and the Lord heard him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:6">Ps. xxxiv. 6</A>.

 When we ask of God those things which Christ has here directed us to
 ask, that his name may be sanctified, that his kingdom may come, and 
 his will be done, in these requests we must be importunate, must 
 <I>never hold our peace day or night;</I> we must not <I>keep 
 silence,</I> nor <I>give God any rest, until he establish, until he 
 make Jerusalem a praise in the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:6,7">Isa. lxii. 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He gives us both instruction and encouragement in prayer from the 
 consideration of our relation to God as a Father. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. An <I>appeal</I> to the <I>bowels</I> of <I>earthly fathers:</I> 
 "Let any of you that <I>is a father,</I> and knows the heart of a 
 father, a father's affection to a child and care for a child, tell me, 
 if his son <I>ask bread</I> for his breakfast, <I>will he give him a 
 stone</I> to breakfast on? <I>If he ask a fish</I> for his dinner (when 
 it may be a fish-day), <I>will he for a fish give him a serpent,</I> 
 that will poison and sting him? Or, <I>if he shall ask an egg</I> for 
 his supper (an egg and to bed), <I>will he offer him a scorpion?</I> 
 You know you could not be so unnatural to your own children," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. An <I>application</I> of this to the <I>blessings</I> of our 
 <I>heavenly Father</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>If ye then, being evil,</I> give, and know how to <I>give, good 
 gifts to your children, much more shall God give you the Spirit.</I> He
 shall give <I>good things;</I> so it is in Matthew. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The direction he gives us what to <I>pray for.</I> We must ask for 
 the <I>Holy Spirit,</I> not only a necessary in order to our <I>praying 
 well,</I> but as inclusive of all the good things we are to pray for; 
 we need no more to make us happy, for the Spirit is the worker of 
 spiritual life, and the earnest of eternal life. Note, The gift of the 
 Holy Ghost is a gift we are every one of us concerned earnestly and 
 constantly to pray for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>encouragement</I> he gives us to hope that we shall speed 
 in this prayer: <I>Your heavenly Father will give.</I> It is <I>in his 
 power</I> to give the Spirit; he has all good things to bestow, wrapped 
 up in that one; but that is not all, it is <I>in his promise,</I> the 
 gift of <I>the Holy Ghost</I> is in the covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:33,38">Acts ii. 33, 38</A>,

 and it is here inferred from parents' readiness to <I>supply</I> their
 children's <I>needs,</I> and <I>gratify</I> their <I>desires,</I> when 
 they are natural and proper. If the child ask for a <I>serpent,</I> or 
 a <I>scorpion,</I> the father, in kindness, will deny him, but not if 
 he ask for what is <I>needful,</I> and will be <I>nourishing.</I> When 
 God's children ask for the Spirit, they do, in effect, ask for 
 <I>bread;</I> for the Spirit is the staff of life; nay, he is the 
 Author of the soul's life. If our earthly parents, though <I>evil,</I> 
 be yet so kind, if they, though <I>weak,</I> be yet so <I>knowing,</I> 
 that they not only give, but give with discretion, give what is best, 
 in the best manner and time, much more will our <I>heavenly Father,</I> 
 who infinitely excels the fathers of our flesh both in wisdom and 
 goodness, give us his <I>Holy Spirit.</I> If earthly parents be willing 
 to lay out for the education of their children, to whom they design to 
 leave their estates, much more will our heavenly Father give the spirit 
 of sons to all those whom he has predestinated to the inheritance of 
 sons.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came
 to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the
 people wondered.
 &nbsp; 15 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through
 Beelzebub the chief of the devils.
 &nbsp; 16 And others, tempting <I>him,</I> sought of him a sign from
 heaven.
 &nbsp; 17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every
 kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a
 house <I>divided</I> against a house falleth.
 &nbsp; 18 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his
 kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through
 Beelzebub.
 &nbsp; 19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons
 cast <I>them</I> out? therefore shall they be your judges.
 &nbsp; 20 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt
 the kingdom of God is come upon you.
 &nbsp; 21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in
 peace:
 &nbsp; 22 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and
 overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he
 trusted, and divideth his spoils.
 &nbsp; 23 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth
 not with me scattereth.
 &nbsp; 24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
 through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I
 will return unto my house whence I came out.
 &nbsp; 25 And when he cometh, he findeth <I>it</I> swept and garnished.
 &nbsp; 26 Then goeth he, and taketh <I>to him</I> seven other spirits more
 wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the
 last <I>state</I> of that man is worse than the first.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The substance of these verses we had in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:22">Matt. xii. 22</A>,

 &c. Christ is here giving a general proof of his divine mission, by a
 particular proof of his power over Satan, his conquest of whom was an 
 indication of his great design in coming into the world, which was, to 
 <I>destroy the works of the devil.</I> Here too he gives an earnest of 
 the success of that undertaking. He is here casting out <I>a devil</I> 
 that made the poor possessed man <I>dumb:</I> in Matthew we are told 
 that he was <I>blind</I> and <I>dumb.</I> When the devil was forced out 
 by the word of Christ, the <I>dumb</I> spoke immediately, echoed to 
 Christ's word, and the lips were opened to show forth his praise.
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Some were <I>affected</I> with this miracle. The people 
 <I>wondered;</I> they admired the power of God, and especially that it 
 should be exerted by the hand of one who made so small a figure, that 
 one who did the work of the Messiah should have so little of that pomp 
 of the Messiah which they expected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Others were <I>offended</I> at it, and, to justify their 
 infidelity, suggested that it was by virtue of a league with Beelzebub, 
 the prince of the devils, that he did this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It seems, in the devil's kingdom there are chiefs, which supposes that
 there are subalterns. Now they would have it <I>thought,</I> or 
 <I>said</I> at least, that there was a correspondence settled between 
 Christ and the devil, that the devil should have the advantage in the 
 main and be victorious at last, but that in order hereto, in particular 
 instances, he should yield Christ the advantage and retire by consent. 
 Some, to <I>corroborate</I> this suggestion, and <I>confront</I> the 
 evidence of Christ's miraculous power, challenged him to <I>give them a 
 sign from heaven</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 to confirm his doctrine by some appearance in the <I>clouds,</I> such 
 as was upon mount Sinai when the law was given; as if a <I>sign from 
 heaven,</I> not disprovable by any sagacity of theirs, could not have 
 been given them as well by a compact and collusion with <I>the prince 
 of the power of the air, who works with power and lying wonders,</I> as 
 the <I>casting out of a devil;</I> nay, that would not have been any 
 present prejudice to his interest, which this manifestly was. Note, 
 Obstinate infidelity will never be at a loss for something to say in 
 its own excuse, though ever so frivolous and absurd. Now Christ here 
 returns a full and direct answer to this cavil of theirs; in which he 
 shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That it can by no means be imagined that such a subtle prince as 
 Satan is should ever agree to measures that had such a direct tendency 
 to his own overthrow, and the undermining of his own kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 What they objected they kept to themselves, afraid to speak it, lest it
 should be answered and baffled; but Jesus <I>knew their thoughts,</I> 
 even when they industriously thought to conceal them, and he said, "You 
 yourselves cannot but see the groundlessness, and consequently the 
 spitefulness, of this charge; for it is an allowed maxim, confirmed by 
 every day's experience, that no interest can stand that is divided 
 against itself; not the more <I>public</I> interest of a 
 <I>kingdom,</I> nor the <I>private</I> interest of a house or family; 
 if either the one or the other be <I>divided against itself,</I> it 
 cannot stand. Satan would herein act against himself; not only by the 
 miracle which turned him out of possession of the bodies of people, but 
 much more in the doctrine for the explication and confirmation of which 
 the miracle was wrought, which had a direct tendency to the ruin of 
 Satan's interest in the minds of men, by mortifying sin, and turning 
 men to the service of God. Now, if Satan should thus be <I>divided 
 against himself,</I> he would hasten his own overthrow, which you 
 cannot suppose an enemy to do that acts so subtlely for his own 
 establishment, and is so solicitous to have his kingdom stand."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That was a very partial ill-natured thing for them to impute that in 
 him to a compact with Satan which yet they applauded and admired in 
 others that were of their own nation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>By whom do your sons cast them out?</I> Some of your own 
 <I>kindred,</I> as Jews, nay, and some of your own <I>followers,</I> as 
 Pharisees, have undertaken, in the name of the God of Israel, to cast 
 out devils, and they were never charged with such a hellish combination 
 as I am charged with." Note, It is gross hypocrisy to <I>condemn</I> 
 that in those who <I>reprove</I> us which yet we <I>allow</I> in those 
 that <I>flatter</I> us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That, in opposing the conviction of this miracle, they were enemies 
 to themselves, stood in their own light, and put a bar in their own 
 door, for they thrust from them the kingdom of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:2"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>If I with the finger of God cast out devils,</I> as you may assure 
 yourselves I do, <I>no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you,</I> 
 the kingdom of the Messiah offers itself and all its advantages to you, 
 and, if you receive it not, it is at your peril." In Matthew it is 
 <I>by the Spirit of God,</I> here <I>by the finger of God;</I> the 
 Spirit is the <I>arm of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1">Isa. liii. 1</A>.

 His greatest and most mighty works were wrought by <I>his Spirit;</I>
 but, if the Spirit in this work is said to be the <I>finger of the 
 Lord,</I> it perhaps may intimate how <I>easily</I> Christ did and 
 could conquer Satan, even with the <I>finger of God,</I> the exerting 
 of the divine power in a less and lower degree than in many other 
 instances. He needed not make bare his <I>everlasting arm;</I> that 
 roaring lion, when <I>he</I> pleases, is crushed, like a moth, with a 
 touch of <I>a finger.</I> Perhaps here is an allusion to the 
 acknowledgment of Pharaoh's magicians, when they were run aground

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:19">Exod. viii. 19</A>):

 This is <I>the finger of God.</I> "Now if the <I>kingdom of God</I> be 
 herein <I>come to you,</I> and you be found by those cavils and 
 blasphemies fighting against it, it will come <I>upon you</I> as a 
 victorious force which you cannot stand before."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That his casting out devils was really the destroying of them and 
 their power, for it confirmed a doctrine which had a direct tendency to 
 the ruining of his kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 Perhaps there had been some who had cast out the inferior devils by
 compact with Beelzebub their chief, but that was without any real 
 damage or prejudice to Satan and his kingdom, what he lost one way he 
 gained another. The devil and such exorcists <I>played booty,</I> as we 
 say, and, while the forlorn hope of his army <I>gave ground,</I> the 
 main body thereby <I>gained ground;</I> the interest of Satan in the 
 souls of men was not weakened by it in the least. But, when Christ cast 
 out devils, he needed not do it by any compact with them, for he was 
 <I>stronger than they,</I> and could do it <I>by force,</I> and did it 
 so as to ruin Satan's power and blast his great design by that doctrine 
 and that grace which break the power of sin, and so rout Satan's main 
 body, take from him <I>all his armour,</I> and <I>divide his 
 spoils,</I> which no one devil ever did to another or ever will. Now 
 this is applicable to Christ's victories over Satan both in the world 
 and in the hearts of particular persons, by that power which went along 
 with the preaching of his gospel, and does still. And so we may
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The miserable condition of an unconverted sinner. In his heart, 
 which was fitted to be a habitation of God, the devil has his palace; 
 and all the powers and the faculties of the soul, being employed by him 
 in the service of sin, are <I>his goods.</I> Note, 

 [1.] The heart of every unconverted sinner is the <I>devil's 
 palace,</I> where he <I>resides</I> and where he <I>rules;</I> he 
 <I>works</I> in the <I>children of disobedience.</I> The heart is a 
 <I>palace,</I> a noble dwelling; but the unsanctified heart is the 
 <I>devil's palace.</I> His will is obeyed, his interests are served, 
 and the militia is in his hands; he <I>usurps</I> the throne in the 
 soul. 

 [2.] The devil, as a <I>strong man armed, keeps</I> this palace, does 
 all he can to secure it to himself, and to fortify it against Christ. 
 All the prejudices with which he hardens men's hearts against truth and 
 holiness are the <I>strong-holds</I> which he erects for the <I>keeping 
 of his palace;</I> this palace is his <I>garrison.</I> 

 [3.] There is a kind of <I>peace</I> in the palace of an unconverted 
 soul, while the devil, as a <I>strong man armed,</I> keeps it. The 
 sinner has a good opinion of himself, is very secure and merry, has no 
 doubt concerning the goodness of his state nor any dread of the 
 judgment to come; he flatters himself in his own eyes, and cries peace 
 to himself. Before Christ appeared, all was quiet, because all <I>went
 one way;</I> but the preaching of the gospel disturbed the peace of the 
 devil's palace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The wonderful change that is made in conversion, which is Christ's 
 victory over this usurper. <I>Satan</I> is a <I>strong man armed;</I> 
 but our Lord Jesus is <I>stronger than he,</I> as God, as Mediator. 
 <I>If we speak of strength, he is strong:</I> more are <I>with</I> us 
 than <I>against us.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] The manner of this victory: <I>He comes upon him</I> by surprise, 
 when his <I>goods are in peace</I> and the devil thinks it is all 
 <I>his own</I> for ever, and <I>overcomes</I> him. Note, The conversion 
 of a soul to God is Christ's victory over the devil and his power in 
 that soul, restoring the soul to its liberty, and recovering his own 
 interest in it and dominion over it. 

 [2.] The evidences of this victory. <I>First,</I> He <I>takes from him 
 all his armour wherein he trusted.</I> The devil is a <I>confident</I> 
 adversary; he <I>trusts</I> to his <I>armour,</I> as Pharaoh to his 
 rivers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:3">Ezek. xxix. 3</A>):

 but Christ disarms him. When the power of sin and corruption in the 
 soul is broken, when the mistakes are rectified, the eyes opened, the 
 heart humbled and changed, and made serious and spiritual, then Satan's 
 <I>armour</I> is <I>taken away. Secondly,</I> He <I>divides the
 spoils;</I> he <I>takes possession</I> of them for himself. All the 
 endowments of mind and body, the estate, power, interest, which before 
 were made use of in the service of sin and Satan, are now converted to 
 Christ's service and employed for him; yet this is not all; he <I>makes 
 a distribution</I> of them among his followers, and, and having 
 conquered Satan, gives to all believers the benefit of that victory.
 Hence Christ infers that, since the whole drift of his doctrine and 
 miracles was to break the power of the devil, that great enemy of 
 mankind, it was the duty of all to join with him and to follow his 
 guidance, to receive his gospel and come heartily into the interests of 
 it; for otherwise they would justly be reckoned as siding with the 
 enemy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>He that is not with me is against me.</I> Those therefore who 
 rejected the doctrine of Christ, and slighted his miracles, were looked 
 upon as adversaries to him, and in the devil's interest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That there was a vast difference between the devil's <I>going 
 out</I> by compact and his being <I>cast out</I> by compulsion. Those 
 out of whom Christ <I>cast him</I> he never entered into again, for so 
 was Christ's charge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:25">Mark ix. 25</A>);

 whereas, if he had <I>gone out,</I> whenever he saw fit he would have 
 made a re-entry, for that is the way of the unclean spirit, when he 
 voluntarily and with design <I>goes out of a man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:24-26"><I>v.</I> 24-26</A>.

 The prince of the devils may <I>give leave,</I> nay, may <I>give
 order,</I> to his forces to retreat, or make a feint, to draw the poor 
 deluded soul into an <I>ambush;</I> but Christ, as he gives a 
 <I>total,</I> so he gives a <I>final,</I> defeat to the enemy. In this
 part of the argument he has a further intention, which is to represent 
 the state of those who have had fair offers made them,--among whom, and 
 in whom, God has begun to break the devil's power and overthrow his 
 kingdom,--but they reject his counsel against themselves, and relapse 
 into a state of subjection to Satan. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The condition of a <I>formal hypocrite,</I> his <I>bright side</I> 
 and his <I>dark side.</I> His heart still remains the <I>devil's 
 house;</I> he calls it his own, and he retains his interest in it; and 
 yet, 

 [1.] The <I>unclean spirit is gone out.</I> He was not <I>driven 
 out</I> by the power of converting grace; there was none of that 
 <I>violence</I> which the kingdom of heaven suffers; but he <I>went 
 out,</I> withdrew for a time, so that the man seemed not to be under 
 the power of Satan as formerly, nor so followed with his temptations.
 Satan is <I>gone,</I> or has <I>turned himself into an angel of 
 light.</I> 

 [2.] The <I>house is swept</I> from common pollutions, by a forced 
 confession of sin, as Pharaoh's--a feigned contrition for it, as 
 Ahab's,--and a partial reformation, as Herod's. There are those that 
 have <I>escaped the pollutions of the world,</I> and yet are still 
 under the power of the <I>god of this world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:20">2 Pet. ii. 20</A>.

 The house is <I>swept,</I> but it is not <I>washed;</I> and Christ hath
 said, <I>If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me;</I> the house 
 must be <I>washed,</I> or it is <I>none of his.</I> Sweeping takes off 
 only the loose dirt, while the sin that <I>besets</I> the sinner, the 
 beloved sin, is untouched. It is swept from the filth that lies open to 
 the eye of the world, but it is not searched and ransacked for secret 
 filthiness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:25">Matt. xxiii. 25</A>.

 It is <I>swept,</I> but the <I>leprosy is in the wall,</I> and will be 
 till something more be done.

 [3.] The house is <I>garnished</I> with common gifts and graces. It is
 not <I>furnished</I> with any true grace, but <I>garnished</I> with the 
 pictures of all graces. Simon Magus was <I>garnished</I> with faith, 
 Balaam with good desires, Herod with a respect for John, the Pharisees 
 with many external performances. It is garnished, but it is like a 
 <I>potsherd covered with silver dross,</I> it is all paint and varnish, 
 not real, not lasting. The house is <I>garnished,</I> but the property 
 is not altered; it was never surrendered to Christ, nor inhabited by 
 the Spirit. Let us therefore take heed of resting in that which a man 
 may have and yet come short.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is the condition of a <I>final apostate,</I> into whom the 
 devil returns after he had <I>gone out: Then goes he, and takes seven 
 other spirits more wicked than himself</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);

 a certain number for an uncertain, as <I>seven devils</I> are said to 
 be cast out of Mary Magdalene. <I>Seven wicked spirits</I> are opposed 
 to the <I>seven spirits of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:1">Rev. iii. 1</A>.

 These are said to be more wicked than himself. It seems, even devils
 are not all alike wicked; probably, the degrees of their wickedness, 
 now that they are <I>fallen,</I> are as the degrees of their holiness 
 were while they stood. When the devil would do mischief most 
 effectually, he employs those that are more mischievous than himself. 
 These <I>enter in</I> without any difficulty or opposition; they are 
 welcomed, and they <I>dwell there;</I> there they <I>work,</I> there 
 they <I>rule;</I> and the <I>last state of that man is worse than the 
 first.</I> Note,

 [1.] Hypocrisy is the high road to apostasy. If the heart remains in 
 the interest of sin and Satan, the shows and shadows will <I>come to 
 nothing;</I> those that have not set that right will not long be 
 stedfast. Where secret haunts of sin are kept up, under the cloak of a 
 visible profession, conscience is debauched, God is provoked to 
 withdraw his restraining grace, and the <I>close</I> hypocrite commonly 
 proves an <I>open</I> apostate, 

 [2.] The last state of such is <I>worse than the first,</I> in respect 
 both of sin and punishment. Apostates are usually the worst of men, the 
 most vain and profligate, the most bold and daring; their consciences 
 are seared, and their sins of all others the most aggravated. God often 
 sets marks of his displeasure upon them in <I>this</I> world, and in 
 the other world they will <I>receive the greater damnation.</I> Let us 
 therefore hear, and fear, and hold fast our integrity.</P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:19"><I>ch.</I> viii. 19</A>),

 but it contains an interruption much like that, and, like that,
 occasion is taken from it for instruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The applause which an affectionate, honest, well-meaning woman gave 
 to our Lord Jesus, upon hearing his excellent discourses. While the 
 scribes and Pharisees despised and blasphemed them, this good woman 
 (and probably she was a person of some quality) admired them, and the 
 wisdom and power with which he spoke: <I>As he spoke these things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 with a convincing force and evidence, a <I>certain woman of the 
 company</I> was so pleased to hear how he had confounded the Pharisees, 
 and conquered them, and put them to shame, and cleared himself from 
 their vile insinuations, that she could not forbear crying out, 
 "<I>Blessed is the womb that bore thee.</I> What an admirable, what an 
 excellent man is this! Surely never was there a greater or better born 
 of a woman: happy the woman that has him for her son. I should have 
 thought myself very happy to have been the mother of one that <I>speaks 
 as never man spoke,</I> that has so much of the grace of heaven in him, 
 and is so great a blessing to this earth." This was <I>well said,</I> 
 as it expressed her high esteem of Christ, and that for the sake of his 
 doctrine; and it was not amiss that it reflected honour upon the virgin 
 Mary his mother, for it agreed with what she herself had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:48"><I>ch.</I> i. 48</A>),

 <I>All generations shall call me blessed;</I> some even of this
 generation, bad as it was. Note, To all that believe the word of Christ 
 the person of Christ is precious, and he is <I>an honour,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:7">1 Pet. ii. 7</A>.

 Yet we must be careful, lest, as this good woman, we too much magnify
 the honour of his natural kindred, and so <I>know him after the 
 flesh,</I> whereas we must now henceforth <I>know him so no 
 more.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The occasion which Christ took from this to pronounce <I>them</I> 
 more happy who are his faithful and obedient followers than she was who 
 bore and nursed him. He does not deny what this woman said, nor refuse 
 her respect to him and his mother; but leads her from this to that 
 which was of higher consideration, and which more concerned her: 
 <I>Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep 
 it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 He thinks them so; and his saying that they are so makes them so, and
 should make us of his mind. This is intended partly as a <I>check</I> 
 to her, for doting so much upon his bodily presence and his human 
 nature, partly as an <I>encouragement</I> to her to hope that she might 
 be as happy as his own mother, whose happiness she was ready to envy, 
 if she would <I>hear the word of God and keep it.</I> Note, Though it 
 is a great privilege to hear the word of God, yet those only are truly 
 blessed, that is, blessed of the Lord, that hear it and <I>keep</I> it, 
 that keep it in memory, and keep to it as their way and rule.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  And when the people were gathered thick together, he began
 to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there
 shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
 &nbsp; 30 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also
 the Son of man be to this generation.
 &nbsp; 31 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with
 the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from
 the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and,
 behold, a greater than Solomon <I>is</I> here.
 &nbsp; 32 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this
 generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the
 preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas <I>is</I> here.
 &nbsp; 33 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth <I>it</I> in a
 secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that
 they which come in may see the light.
 &nbsp; 34 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye
 is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when <I>thine
 eye</I> is evil, thy body also <I>is</I> full of darkness.
 &nbsp; 35 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not
 darkness.
 &nbsp; 36 If thy whole body therefore <I>be</I> full of light, having no
 part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright
 shining of a candle doth give thee light.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ's discourse in these verses shows two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What is the <I>sign</I> we may <I>expect</I> from God for the 
 <I>confirmation</I> of our <I>faith.</I> The great and most convincing 
 proof of Christ's being sent of God, and which they were yet to wait 
 for, after the many signs that had been given them, was the 
 resurrection of Christ from the dead. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A reproof to the people for demanding other signs than what had 
 already been given them in great plenty: <I>The people were gathered 
 thickly together</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 a vast crowd of them, expecting not so much to have their consciences 
 informed by the doctrine of Christ as to have their curiosity gratified 
 by his miracles. Christ knew what brought such a multitude together; 
 they came <I>seeking a sign,</I> they came to gaze, to have something 
 to talk of when they went home; and it is an <I>evil generation</I> 
 which nothing will awaken and convince, no, not the most sensible 
 demonstrations of divine power and goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A promise that yet there should be <I>one sign</I> more given them, 
 different from any that had yet been given them, even the <I>sign of 
 Jonas the prophet,</I> which in Matthew is explained as meaning the 
 <I>resurrection of Christ.</I> As Jonas being cast into the sea, and 
 lying there three days, and then coming up alive and preaching 
 repentance to the Ninevites, was a sign to them, upon which they turned 
 from their evil way, so shall the death and resurrection of Christ, and 
 the preaching of his gospel immediately after to the Gentile world, be 
 the last warning to the Jewish nation. If they be provoked to a <I>holy 
 jealousy</I> by this, well and good; but, if this do not work upon 
 them, let them look for nothing but utter ruin: <I>The Son of Man shall 
 be a sign to this generation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 a sign speaking to them, though a sign spoken against by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. A warning to them to improve this sign; for it was at their peril if 
 they did not. 

 (1.) The <I>queen of Sheba</I> would <I>rise up in judgment against 
 them,</I> and condemn <I>their unbelief,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 She was a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel, and yet so readily
 gave credit to the report she heard of the glories of a king of Israel, 
 that, notwithstanding the prejudices we are apt to conceive against 
 foreigners, she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to <I>hear 
 his wisdom,</I> not only to satisfy her curiosity, but to inform her 
 mind, especially in the knowledge of the true God and his worship, 
 which is upon record, to her honour; and, behold, a <I>greater than 
 Solomon in here,</I> <B><I>pleion Solomontos</I></B>--<I>more than a 
 Solomon is here;</I> that is, says Dr. Hammond, more of wisdom and more 
 heavenly divine doctrine than ever was in all Solomon's words or 
 writings; and yet these wretched Jews will give no manner of regard to 
 what Christ says to them, though he be in the midst of them.

 (2.) The Ninevites would rise up in judgment against them, and condemn 
 their impenitency 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 They <I>repented at the preaching of Jonas;</I> but here is preaching 
 which far exceeds that of Jonas, is more powerful and awakening, and 
 threatens a much sorer ruin than that of Nineveh, and yet none are 
 startled by it, to turn <I>from their evil way,</I> as the Ninevites 
 did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What is the <I>sign</I> that God <I>expects</I> from us for the 
 <I>evidencing</I> of our faith, and that is the serious practice of 
 that religion which we profess to believe, and a readiness to entertain 
 all divine truths, when brought to us in their proper evidence. Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They had <I>the light</I> with all the advantage they could desire. 
 For God, having <I>lighted the candle</I> of the gospel, did not put it 
 in a <I>secret place,</I> or <I>under a bushel;</I> Christ did not 
 preach in corners. The apostles were ordered to preach the gospel to 
 every creature; and both Christ and his ministers, Wisdom and her 
 maidens, cry in the <I>chief places of concourse,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 It is a great privilege that the light of the gospel is put on a
 <I>candlestick,</I> so that all that come in may <I>see it,</I> and may 
 <I>see by it</I> where they are and whither they are going, and what is 
 the true, and sure, and only way to happiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Having the <I>light,</I> their concern was to have the <I>sight,</I> 
 or else to what purpose had they the light? Be the <I>object</I> ever 
 so <I>clear,</I> if the <I>organ</I> be not <I>right,</I> we are never 
 the better: <I>The light of the body is the eye</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 which receives the light of the candle when it is brought into the 
 room. So the light of the soul is the understanding and judgment, and 
 its power of discerning between good and evil, truth and falsehood. 
 Now, according as this is, so the light of divine revelation is to us, 
 and our benefit by it; it is a savour of life unto life, or of death 
 unto death. 

 (1.) If this eye of the soul be <I>single,</I> if it see <I>clear,</I> 
 see things as they are, and judge impartially concerning them, if it 
 aim at <I>truth</I> only, and seek it for its own sake, and have not 
 any sinister by--looks and intentions, the <I>whole body,</I> that is, 
 the whole soul, is <I>full of light,</I> it receives and entertains the 
 gospel, which will bring along with it into the soul both 
 <I>knowledge</I> and <I>joy.</I> This denotes the same thing with that 
 of the good ground, <I>receiving the word</I> and <I>understanding</I> 
 it. If our understanding admits the gospel in its full light, it fills 
 the soul, and it has enough to <I>fill</I> it. And if the soul be thus 
 <I>filled</I> with the light of the gospel, <I>having no part 
 dark,</I>--if all its powers and faculties be subjected to the 
 government and influence of the gospel, and none left 
 unsanctified,--then <I>the whole soul shall be full of light,</I> full 
 of holiness and comfort. <I>It was darkness</I> itself, but now light 
 in the Lord, <I>as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee 
 light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 Note, The gospel will come into those souls whose doors and windows are
 thrown open to receive it; and where it comes it will bring light with 
 it. But,

 (2.) If the <I>eye of the</I> soul be <I>evil,</I>--if the judgment be
 <I>bribed</I> and <I>biassed</I> by the corrupt and vicious 
 dispositions of the mind, by pride and envy, by the love of the world 
 and sensual pleasures,--if the understanding be <I>prejudiced</I> 
 against divine truths, and resolved not to admit them, though brought 
 with ever so convincing an evidence,--it is no wonder that the <I>whole 
 body,</I> the whole soul, should be <I>full of darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 How can they have instruction, information, direction, or comfort, from
 the gospel, that wilfully shut their eyes against it? and what hope is 
 there of such? what remedy for them? The inference hence therefore is, 
 <I>Take heed that the light which is in thee be not darkness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Take heed that the eye of the mind be not blinded by partiality, and
 prejudice, and sinful aims. Be sincere in your enquiries after truth, 
 and ready to receive it in the light, and love, and power of it; and 
 not as the men of <I>this generation</I> to whom Christ preached, who 
 never sincerely <I>desired</I> to know God's will, nor <I>designed</I> 
 to do it, and therefore no wonder that they <I>walked on in 
 darkness,</I> wandered <I>endlessly,</I> and perished 
 <I>eternally.</I></P>

 <TR><TD><FONT SIZE=+1><I>Woes Denounced on That Generation; The Pharisees and Lawyers Reproved.</I></FONT></TD>
 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>37  And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine
 with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.
 &nbsp; 38 And when the Pharisee saw <I>it,</I> he marvelled that he had not
 first washed before dinner.
 &nbsp; 39 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean
 the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is
 full of ravening and wickedness.
 &nbsp; 40 <I>Ye</I> fools, did not he that made that which is without make
 that which is within also?
 &nbsp; 41 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold,
 all things are clean unto you.
 &nbsp; 42 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and
 all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God:
 these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
 &nbsp; 43 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in
 the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.
 &nbsp; 44 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are
 as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over <I>them</I> are
 not aware <I>of them.</I>
 &nbsp; 45 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,
 thus saying thou reproachest us also.
 &nbsp; 46 And he said, Woe unto you also, <I>ye</I> lawyers! for ye lade
 men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch
 not the burdens with one of your fingers.
 &nbsp; 47 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets,
 and your fathers killed them.
 &nbsp; 48 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your
 fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their
 sepulchres.
 &nbsp; 49 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them
 prophets and apostles, and <I>some</I> of them they shall slay and
 persecute:
 &nbsp; 50 That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the
 foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
 &nbsp; 51 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which
 perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you,
 It shall be required of this generation.
 &nbsp; 52 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of
 knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were
 entering in ye hindered.
 &nbsp; 53 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the
 Pharisees began to urge <I>him</I> vehemently, and to provoke him to
 speak of many things:
 &nbsp; 54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of
 his mouth, that they might accuse him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ here says many of those things to a Pharisee and his guests, in 
 a <I>private</I> conversation at table, which he afterwards said in a 
 <I>public</I> discourse in the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:1-39">Matt. xxiii.</A>);

 for what he said in public and private was <I>of a piece.</I> He would
 not say that in a corner which he durst not repeat and stand to in the 
 great congregation; nor would he give those reproofs to any sort of 
 sinners in general which he durst not apply to them in particular as he 
 met with them; for he was, and is, the <I>faithful Witness.</I> Here 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's going to dine with a Pharisee that very civilly invited him 
 to his house 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>);

 <I>As he spoke,</I> even while he was speaking, a <I>certain 
 Pharisee</I> interrupted him with a request to him to come and <I>dine 
 with him,</I> to come <I>forthwith,</I> for it was dinner-time. We are 
 willing to hope that the Pharisee was so well pleased with his 
 discourse that he was willing to show him respect, and desirous to have 
 more of his company, and therefore gave him this invitation and bade 
 him truly welcome; and yet we have some cause to suspect that it was 
 with an <I>ill design,</I> to break off his discourse to the people,
 and to have an opportunity of ensnaring him and getting something out 
 of him which might serve for matter of accusation or reproach, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:53,54"><I>v.</I> 53, 54</A>.

 We know not the mind of this Pharisee; but, whatever it was, Christ
 knew it: if he meant ill, he shall know Christ does not fear him; if 
 well, he shall know Christ is willing to do him good: so <I>he went in, 
 and sat down to meat.</I> Note, Christ's disciples must learn of him to 
 be <I>conversable,</I> and not <I>morose.</I> Though we have need to be 
 <I>cautious</I> what company we keep, yet we need not be <I>rigid,</I> 
 nor must we therefore <I>go out of the world.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The offence which the Pharisee took at Christ, as those of that 
 sort had sometimes done at the disciples of Christ, for not <I>washing 
 before dinner,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 He wondered that a man of his sanctity, a prophet, a man of so much
 devotion, and such a strict conversation, should sit down to meat, and 
 not first <I>wash his hands,</I> especially being newly come out of a 
 mixed company, and there being in the Pharisee's dining-room, no doubt, 
 all accommodations set ready for it, so that he need not fear being 
 <I>troublesome;</I> and the Pharisee himself and all his guests, no 
 doubt, <I>washing,</I> so that he could not be <I>singular;</I> what, 
 and yet not wash? What harm had it been if he had washed? Was it not 
 strictly commanded by the canons of their church? It was so, and 
 <I>therefore</I> Christ would not do it, because he would witness 
 against their assuming a power to impose that as a matter of religion 
 which <I>God commanded them not.</I> The ceremonial law consisted in 
 <I>divers washings,</I> but this was none of them, and therefore Christ 
 would not practise it, no not in <I>complaisance</I> to the Pharisee 
 who invited him, nor though he knew that offence would be taken at his 
 omitting it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The sharp reproof which Christ, upon this occasion, gave to the 
 Pharisees, without begging pardon even of the Pharisee whose guest he 
 now was; for we must not flatter our best friends in any evil 
 thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He reproves them for placing religion so much in those instances of 
 it which are only external, and fall under the eye of man, while those 
 were not only <I>postponed,</I> but quite <I>expunged,</I> which 
 respect the soul, and fall under the eye of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:39,40"><I>v.</I> 39, 40</A>.

 Now observe here,

 (1.) The absurdity they were guilty of: "<I>You Pharisees make clean 
 the outside</I> only, you wash your hands with water, but do not 
 <I>wash your hearts from wickedness;</I> these are full of covetousness 
 and malice, <I>covetousness</I> of men's goods, and malice against good 
 men." Those can never be reckoned <I>cleanly</I> servants that wash 
 only the <I>outside of the cup</I> out of which their master drinks, or 
 <I>the platter</I> out of which he eats, and take no care to make clean 
 the <I>inside,</I> the filth of which immediately <I>affects</I> the 
 meat or drink. The frame or temper of the mind in every religious 
 service is as the <I>inside</I> of the cup and platter; the impurity of 
 this <I>infects</I> the services, and therefore to keep ourselves free 
 from scandalous enormities, and yet to live under the dominion of 
 spiritual wickedness, is as great an affront to God as it would be for 
 a servant to give the cup into his master's hand, clean wiped from all 
 the dust on the outside, but <I>within</I> full of cobwebs and spiders.
 <I>Ravening and wickedness,</I> that is, <I>reigning worldliness</I> 
 and <I>reigning spitefulness,</I> which men think they can find some 
 cloak and cover for, are the dangerous damning sins of many who have 
 made the <I>outside of the cup</I> clean from the more gross, and 
 scandalous, and inexcusable sins of whoredom and drunkenness. 

 (2.) A particular instance of the absurdity of it: "<I>Ye fools, did 
 not he that made that which is without make that which is within 
 also?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 Did not that God who in the law of Moses appointed divers ceremonial
 washings, with which you justify yourselves in these practices and 
 impositions, appoint also that you should cleanse and purify your 
 hearts? He who made laws for that which is <I>without,</I> did not he 
 even in those laws further intend something within, and by other laws 
 show how little he regarded the <I>purifying of the flesh,</I> and the 
 <I>putting away of the filth</I> of that, if the heart be not made 
 clean?" Or, it may have regard to God not only as a <I>Lawgiver,</I> 
 but (which the words seem rather to import) as a Creator. Did not God, 
 who made us these bodies (and they <I>are fearfully and wonderfully 
 made</I>), make us <I>these souls</I> also, which are more fearfully 
 and wonderfully made? Now, if he made both, he justly expects we should 
 take care of both; and therefore not only wash the <I>body,</I> which 
 he is the <I>former</I> of, and make the hands clean in honour of his 
 work, but wash the spirit, which he is the Father of, and get the 
 leprosy in the heart cleansed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To this he subjoins a rule for making our creature-comforts clean to us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 "Instead of <I>washing your hands</I> before you go to meat, <I>give 
 alms of such things as you have</I>" (<B><I>ta enonta</I></B>--<I>of 
 such things as are set before you, and present with you</I>); "let the 
 poor have their share out of them, and then <I>all things are clean to 
 you,</I> and you may use them comfortably." Here is a plain allusion to 
 the law of Moses, by which it was provided that certain portions of the 
 increase of their land should be given <I>to the Levite, the stranger, 
 the fatherless, and the widow;</I> and, when that was done, what was 
 reserved for their own use was <I>clean to them,</I> and they could in 
 faith pray for a blessing upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:12-15">Deut. xxvi. 12-15</A>.

 <I>Then</I> we can with comfort enjoy the gifts of God's bounty
 ourselves when we <I>send portions to them for whom nothing is 
 prepared,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:10">Neh. viii. 10</A>.

 <I>Job ate not his morsel alone,</I> but <I>the fatherless ate
 thereof,</I> and so it was <I>clean to him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:17">Job xxxi. 17</A>);

 <I>clean,</I> that is, permitted and allowed to be used, and then only 
 can it be used comfortably. Note, What we have is not our own, unless 
 God have his dues out of it; and it is by <I>liberality to the poor</I> 
 that we clear up to ourselves our <I>liberty</I> to make use of our 
 creature-comforts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He reproves them for laying stress upon trifles, and neglecting the 
 weighty matters of the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 (1.) Those laws which related only to the <I>means of religion</I> they 
 were very exact in the observance of, as particularly those concerning 
 the maintenance of the priests: <I>Ye pay tithe of mint and rue,</I> 
 pay it in kind and to the full, and will not put off the priests with a 
 <I>modus decimandi</I> or <I>compound</I> for it. By this they would 
 gain reputation with the people as strict observers of the law, and 
 would make an interest in the priests, in whose power it was many a 
 time to do them a kindness; and no wonder if the priests and the 
 Pharisees contrived how to strengthen one another's hands. Now Christ 
 does not condemn them for being so exact in paying tithes (<I>these 
 things ought ye to have done</I>), but to think that this would atone 
 for the neglect of their greater duties; for, 

 (2.) Those laws which relate to the <I>essentials of religion</I> they 
 made nothing of: <I>You pass over judgment and the love of God,</I> you 
 make no conscience of giving men their <I>dues</I> and God your 
 <I>hearts.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He reproves them for their pride and vanity, and affectations of 
 precedency and praise of men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 "<I>Ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues</I>" (or consistories
 where the elders met for government); "if you have not those seats, you 
 are ambitious of them; if you have, you are proud of them; and <I>you 
 love greetings in the markets,</I> to be complimented by the people and 
 to have their cap and knee." It is not sitting uppermost, or being 
 greeted, that is reproved, but <I>loving it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He reproves them for their hypocrisy, and their colouring over the 
 wickedness of their hearts and lives with specious pretences 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):
 
 "<I>You are as graves</I> overgrown with grass, which therefore 
 <I>appear not,</I> and <I>the men that walk over them are not aware of 
 them,</I> and so they contract the ceremonial pollution which by the 
 law arose from the <I>touch of a grave.</I>" These Pharisees were 
 <I>within</I> full of <I>abominations,</I> as a grave of putrefaction; 
 full of covetousness, envy, and malice; and yet they concealed it so 
 artfully with a profession of devotion, that it did not appear, so that 
 they who conversed with them, and followed their doctrine, were defiled 
 with sin, infected with their corruptions and ill morals, and yet, they 
 making a show of piety, suspected no danger by them. The contagion 
 <I>insinuated</I> itself, and was <I>insensibly</I> caught, and those 
 that caught it thought themselves never the worse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The testimony which he bore also against the lawyers or scribes, 
 who made it their business to <I>expound</I> the law according to the 
 tradition of the elders, as the Pharisees did to <I>observe</I> the law 
 according to that tradition.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There was one of that profession who resented what he said against 
 the Pharisees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>):

 "<I>Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also,</I> for we are 
 scribes; and we are therefore hypocrites?" Note, It is a common thing 
 for unhumbled sinners to call and count reproofs reproaches. It is the 
 wisdom of those who desire to have their sin mortified to make a 
 <I>good use</I> of reproaches that come from <I>ill will,</I> and to 
 turn them into reproofs. If we can in this way hear of our faults, and 
 amend them, it is well: but it is the folly of those who are wedded to 
 their sins, and resolved not to part with them, to make an <I>ill 
 use</I> of the faithful and friendly admonitions given them, which come 
 from love, and to have their passions provoked by them as if they were 
 intended for <I>reproaches,</I> and therefore fly in the face of their 
 reprovers, and justify themselves in rejecting the reproof. Thus the 
 prophet complained 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:10">Jer. vi. 10</A>):

 <I>The word of the Lord is to them a reproach; they have no delight in 
 it.</I> This lawyer espoused the Pharisee's cause, and so made himself 
 partaker of his sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Our Lord Jesus thereupon took them to task 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>):

 <I>Woe unto you also, ye lawyers;</I> and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>):

 <I>Woe unto you lawyers.</I> They blessed themselves in the reputation 
 they had among the people, who thought them happy men, because they 
 studied the law, and were always conversant with that, and had the 
 honour of instructing the people in the knowledge of that; but Christ 
 denounced <I>woes</I> against them, for he sees not as man sees. This 
 was just upon him for taking the Pharisee's part, and quarrelling with 
 Christ because he reproved them. Note, Those who quarrel with the 
 reproofs of others, and suspect them to be reproaches to them, do but 
 get <I>woes of their own</I> by so doing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The lawyers are reproved for making the services of religion more 
 <I>burdensome</I> to others, but more <I>easy</I> to themselves, than 
 God had made them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>):

 "<I>You lade men with burdens grievous to be borne,</I> by your 
 traditions, which <I>bind them out from</I> many liberties God has 
 allowed them, and <I>bind them up</I> to many slaveries which God never 
 enjoined them, to show your authority, and to keep people in awe; 
 <I>but you yourselves touch them not with one of your fingers;</I>" 
 that is,

 [1.] "You will not <I>burden</I> yourselves with them, nor be 
 yourselves bound by those restraints with which you hamper others." 
 They would seem, by the hedges they pretended to make about the law, to 
 be very strict for the observance of the law; but, if you could see 
 their practices, you would find that they not only make nothing of 
 those hedges themselves, but make nothing of the law itself neither: 
 thus the confessors of the Romish church are said to do with their 
 penitents. 

 [2.] "You will not <I>lighten</I> them to those you have power over; 
 <I>you will not touch them,</I> that is, either to repeal them or to 
 dispense with them when you find them to be burdensome and grievous to 
 the people." They would come in with <I>both hands</I> to dispense with 
 a command of God, but not with a <I>finger</I> to mitigate the rigour 
 of any of the traditions of the elders.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They are reproved for pretending a veneration for the memory of 
 the prophets whom their fathers killed, when yet they hated and 
 persecuted those in their own day who were sent to them on the same 
 errand, to call them to repentance, and direct them to Christ, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:47-49"><I>v.</I> 47-49</A>.

 [1.] These hypocrites, among other pretences of piety, <I>built the 
 sepulchres of the prophets;</I> that is, they erected monuments over 
 their graves, in honour of them, probably with large inscriptions 
 containing high encomiums of them. They were not so superstitious as to 
 enshrine their relics, or to think their devotions the more acceptable 
 to God for being offered at the <I>tombs of the martyrs;</I> they did 
 not burn incense or pray to them, or plead their merits with God; they 
 did not add that iniquity to their hypocrisy; but, as if they owned 
 themselves the <I>children of the prophets,</I> their heirs and 
 executors, they <I>repaired</I> and <I>beautified</I> the monuments 
 sacred to their <I>pious memory.</I> 

 [2.] Notwithstanding this, they had an inveterate <I>enmity</I> to 
 those in their <I>own day</I> that came to them in the <I>spirit</I> 
 and <I>power</I> of those prophets; and, though they had not yet had an 
 opportunity of carrying it far, yet they would soon do it, for the 
 <I>Wisdom of God said,</I> that is, Christ himself would <I>so 
 order</I> it, and did <I>now foretel</I> it, that they would 
 <I>slay</I> and <I>persecute</I> the prophets and apostles that should 
 be sent them. The <I>Wisdom of God</I> would thus make trial of them, 
 and discover their odious hypocrisy, by sending them prophets, to 
 reprove them for their sins and warn them of the judgments of God. 
 Those prophets should prove themselves apostles, or messengers sent 
 from heaven, by signs, and wonders, and gifts of the Holy Ghost. Or, 
 "<I>I will send them prophets</I> under the style and title of 
 apostles, who yet shall produce as good an authority as any of the old 
 prophets did; and these they shall not only contradict and oppose, but 
 <I>slay</I> and <I>persecute,</I> and put to death." Christ foresaw 
 this, and yet did not otherwise than as became the <I>Wisdom of God</I> 
 in sending them, for he knew how to bring glory to himself in the 
 issue, by the recompences reserved both for the <I>persecutors</I> and 
 the <I>persecuted</I> in the future state. 

 [3.] That therefore God will justly put another construction upon their 
 <I>building</I> the <I>tombs</I> of the prophets than what they would 
 be thought to intend, and it shall be interpreted their <I>allowing the 
 deeds of their fathers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>);

 for, since by their present actions it appeared that they had no true 
 value for their prophets, the <I>building of their sepulchres</I> shall 
 have this sense put upon it, that they resolved to keep them in their 
 graves whom their fathers had hurried thither. Josiah, who had a real 
 value for prophets, thought it enough not to disturb the grave of the 
 <I>man of God at Bethel: Let no man move his bones,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:17,18">2 Kings xxiii. 17, 18</A>.

 If these lawyers will carry the matter further, and will build <I>their
 sepulchres,</I> it is such a piece of <I>over-doing</I> as gives cause 
 to suspect an ill design in it, and that it is meant as a cover for 
 some design against prophecy itself, like the kiss of a traitor, as 
 <I>he that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the 
 morning, it shall be counted a curse to him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:14">Prov. xxvii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] That they must expect no other than to be reckoned with, as the 
 <I>fillers up</I> of the <I>measure</I> of persecution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:50,51"><I>v.</I> 50, 51</A>.

 They keep up the trade as it were in succession, and therefore are
 responsible for the <I>debts of the company,</I> even those it has been 
 <I>contracting</I> all along from <I>the blood of Abel,</I> when the 
 world began, to that of Zacharias, and so forward to the end of the 
 Jewish state; it shall all be <I>required of this generation,</I> this 
 last generation of the Jews, whose sin in persecuting Christ's apostles 
 would exceed any of the sins of that kind that their fathers were 
 guilty of, and so would bring <I>wrath</I> upon them <I>to the 
 uttermost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15,16">1 Thess. ii. 15, 16</A>.

 Their destruction by the Romans was so terrible that it might well be
 reckoned the completing of God's vengeance upon that persecuting 
 nation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They are reproved for opposing the gospel of Christ, and doing all 
 they could to obstruct the progress and success of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.

 [1.] They had not, according to the duty of their place, faithfully 
 expounded to the people those scriptures of the Old Testament which 
 pointed at the Messiah, which if they had been led into the right 
 understanding of by the lawyers, they would readily have embraced him 
 and his doctrine: but, instead of that, they had perverted those texts, 
 and had cast a mist before the eyes of the people, by their corrupt 
 glosses upon them, and this is called <I>taking away the key of 
 knowledge;</I> instead of <I>using</I> that key for the people, and 
 helping them to use it aright, they <I>hid it</I> from them; this is 
 called, in Matthew, <I>shutting up the kingdom of heaven against 
 men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:13">Matt. xxiii. 13</A>.

 Note, those who take away the key of knowledge shut up the <I>kingdom
 of heaven.</I>

 [2.] They themselves did not embrace the gospel of Christ, though by 
 their acquaintance with the Old Testament they could not but know that 
 the <I>time was fulfilled,</I> and the <I>kingdom of God was at 
 hand;</I> they saw the prophecies accomplished in that kingdom which 
 our Lord Jesus was about to set up, and yet would not themselves 
 <I>enter into it.</I> Nay, 

 [3.] Them that without any guidance or assistance of theirs were 
 <I>entering in</I> they did all they could to <I>hinder</I> and 
 discourage, by threatening to <I>cast them out of the synagogue,</I> 
 and otherwise terrifying them. It is bad for people to be averse to 
 revelation, but much worse to be adverse to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> In the close of the chapter we are told how spitefully 
 and maliciously the scribes and <I>Pharisees</I> contrived to draw him 
 into a snare, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:53,54"><I>v.</I> 53, 54</A>.

 They could not bear those cutting reproofs which they must own to be
 just; but what he had said against them in particular would not <I>bear 
 an action,</I> nor could they ground upon it any <I>criminal</I> 
 accusation, and therefore, as if, because his reproofs were warm, they 
 hoped to stir him up to some intemperate heat and passion, so as to put 
 him off his guard, they <I>began to urge him vehemently,</I> to be very 
 fierce upon him, and to <I>provoke him to speak of many things,</I> to 
 propose dangerous questions to him, <I>laying wait</I> for something 
 which might serve the design they had of making him either 
 <I>odious</I> to the people, or <I>obnoxious</I> to the government, or 
 both. Thus did they seek occasion against him, like David's enemies 
 that did <I>every day wrest his words,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:5">Ps. lvi. 5</A>.

 <I>Evil men dig up mischief.</I> Note, Faithful reprovers of sin must
 expect to have many enemies, and have need to set a watch before the 
 door of their lips, because of <I>their observers</I> that watch for 
 their halting. The prophet complains of those in his time who <I>make
 a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in 
 the gate,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:21">Isa. xxix. 21</A>.

 That we may bear trials of this kind with patience, and get through
 them with prudence, let us <I>consider him who endured such 
 contradiction of sinners against himself.</I></P>
