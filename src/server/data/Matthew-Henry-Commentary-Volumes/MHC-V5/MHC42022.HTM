 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All the evangelists, whatever they omit, give us a particular account 
 of the death and resurrection of Christ, because he died for our sins 
 and rose for our justification, this evangelist as fully as any, and 
 with many circumstances and passages added which we had not before. In 
 this chapter we have, 

 I. The plot to take Jesus, and Judas's coming into it,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called
 the Passover.
 &nbsp; 2 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill
 him; for they feared the people.
 &nbsp; 3 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
 number of the twelve.
 &nbsp; 4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
 captains, how he might betray him unto them.
 &nbsp; 5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
 &nbsp; 6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto
 them in the absence of the multitude.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <I>year of the redeemed</I> is now <I>come,</I> which had been from 
 eternity fixed in the divine counsels, and long looked for by them that 
 waited for the consolation of Israel. After the revolutions of many 
 ages, it is at length <I>come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:4">Isa. lxiii. 4</A>.

 And, it is observable, it is in the very <I>first month</I> of that
 year that the redemption is wrought out, so much in haste was the 
 Redeemer to perform his undertaking, so was he <I>straitened</I> till 
 it was <I>accomplished.</I> It was in the same month, and at the same 
 time of the month (in the <I>beginning of months,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:2">Exod. xii. 2</A>),

 that God by Moses brought Israel out of Egypt, that the Antitype might 
 answer the type. Christ is here delivered up, <I>when the feast of 
 unleavened bread drew nigh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 About as long before that feast as they began to make preparation for
 it, here was preparation making for our Passover's being offered for 
 us. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His sworn enemies contriving it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>the chief priests,</I> men of sanctity, and the scribes, men of 
 learning, <I>seeking how they might kill him,</I> either by force of 
 fraud. Could they have had their will, it had been soon done, but they 
 <I>feared the people,</I> and the more for what they now saw of their 
 diligent attendance upon his preaching.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A treacherous disciple joining in with them, and coming to their 
 assistance, Judas surnamed <I>Iscariot.</I> He is here said to be <I>of 
 the number of the twelve,</I> that dignified distinguished number. One 
 would wonder that Christ, who <I>knew</I> all men, should take a 
 traitor into <I>that number,</I> and that one of <I>that number,</I> 
 who could not but <I>know Christ,</I> should be so base as to betray 
 him; but Christ had wise and holy ends in taking Judas to be a 
 disciple, and how he who knew Christ so well yet came to betray him we 
 are here told: <I>Satan entered into Judas,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It was the devil's work, who thought hereby to ruin Christ's
 undertaking, to have broken his head; but it proved only the bruising 
 of his heel. Whoever betrays Christ, or his truths or ways, it is Satan 
 that puts them upon it. Judas knew how desirous the chief priests were 
 to get Christ into their hands, and that they could not do it safely 
 without the assistance of some that knew his retirements, as he did.
 He therefore went himself, and made the motion to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Note, It is hard to say whether more mischief is done to Christ's
 kingdom by the power and policy of its open enemies, or by the 
 treachery and self-seeking of its pretended friends: nay, without the 
 latter its enemies could not gain their point as they do. When you see 
 Judas communing with the <I>chief priests,</I> be sure some mischief is 
 hatching; it is for no good that they are laying their heads 
 together.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The issue of the treaty between them. 

 1. Judas must <I>betray Christ to them,</I> must bring them to a place
 where they might seize him without danger of tumult, and this they 
 would be <I>glad of.</I> 

 2. They must give him a sum of money for doing it, and this he would
 be glad of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>They covenanted to give him money.</I> When the bargain was made, 
 Judas sought <I>opportunity to betray him.</I> Probably, he slyly 
 enquired of Peter and John, who were more intimate with their Master 
 than he was, where he would be at such a time, and whither he would 
 retire after the passover, and they were not sharp enough to suspect 
 him. Somehow or other, in a little time he gained the advantage he 
 sought, and fixed the time and place where it might be done, <I>in the 
 absence of the multitude,</I> and <I>without tumult.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must
 be killed.
 &nbsp; 8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the
 passover, that we may eat.
 &nbsp; 9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
 &nbsp; 10 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the
 city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water;
 follow him into the house where he entereth in.
 &nbsp; 11 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master
 saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the
 passover with my disciples?
 &nbsp; 12 And he shall show you a large upper room furnished: there
 make ready.
 &nbsp; 13 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they
 made ready the passover.
 &nbsp; 14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve
 apostles with him.
 &nbsp; 15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat
 this passover with you before I suffer:
 &nbsp; 16 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until
 it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
 &nbsp; 17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this,
 and divide <I>it</I> among yourselves:
 &nbsp; 18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the
 vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.
 &nbsp; 19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake <I>it,</I> and gave
 unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this
 do in remembrance of me.
 &nbsp; 20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup <I>is</I>
 the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What a hopeful prospect had we of Christ's doing a great deal of good 
 by his preaching in the temple during the feast of unleavened bread, 
 which continued seven days, when the people were <I>every</I> morning, 
 and <I>early</I> in the morning, so attentive to hear him! But here is 
 a stop put to it. He must enter upon work of another kind; in this, 
 however, he shall do more good than in the other, for neither Christ's 
 nor his church's suffering days are their idle empty days. Now here we 
 have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preparation that was made for Christ's eating the passover with 
 his disciples, upon the very <I>day of unleavened bread, when the 
 passover must be killed</I> according to the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Christ was made under the law, and observed the ordinances of it,
 particularly that of the passover, to teach us in like manner to 
 observe his gospel institutions, particularly that of the Lord's 
 supper, and not to neglect them. It is probable that he went to the 
 temple to preach in the morning, when he sent Peter and John another 
 way into the city to <I>prepare the passover.</I> Those who have 
 attendants about them, to do their secular business for them in a great 
 measure, must not think that this <I>allows</I> them to be <I>idle;</I> 
 it <I>engages</I> them to employ themselves more in <I>spiritual</I> 
 business, or service to <I>the public.</I> He directed those whom he 
 employed whither they should go

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 <I>they must follow a man bearing a pitcher of water,</I> and he must 
 be their guide to the house. Christ could have described the house to
 them; probably it was a house they knew, and he might have said no more 
 than, Go to such a one's house, or to a house in such a street, with 
 such a sign, &c. But he directed them thus, to teach them to depend 
 upon the conduct of Providence, and to follow that, <I>step by 
 step.</I> They went, not knowing <I>whither they went,</I> nor <I>whom 
 they followed.</I> Being come to the house, they must desire the master 
 of the house to show them a room 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and he will readily do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Whether it was a friend's house or a public house does not appear; but
 the disciples found their guide, and the house, and the room, just as 
 he had said to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 for <I>they</I> need not fear a disappointment who go upon Christ's 
 word; according to the orders given them, they got every thing in 
 readiness for <I>the passover,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The solemnizing of the passover, according to the law. When <I>the 
 hour was come</I> that they should go to supper <I>he sat down,</I> 
 probably at the head-end of the table, and <I>the twelve apostles with 
 him,</I> Judas not excepted; for it is possible that those whose hearts 
 are filled with Satan, and all manner of wickedness, may yet continue a 
 plausible profession of religion, and be found in the performance of 
 its external services; and while it is in the heart, and does not break 
 out into anything scandalous, such cannot be denied the external 
 privileges of their external profession. Though Judas has already been 
 guilty of an <I>overt act</I> of treason, yet, it not being publicly 
 known, Christ admits him to sit down with the rest at the passover. Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How Christ <I>bids this passover welcome,</I> to teach us in like 
 manner to welcome his passover, the Lord's supper, and to come to it 
 with an appetite 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>With desire I have desired,</I> I have most earnestly desired, to 
 <I>eat this passover with you before I suffer.</I>" He knew it was to 
 be the prologue to his sufferings, and <I>therefore</I> he desired it, 
 because it was in order to his Father's glory and man's redemption. He 
 <I>delighted</I> to do even this part of the <I>will of God</I> 
 concerning him as Mediator. Shall we be <I>backward</I> to any service 
 for him who was so <I>forward</I> in the work of our salvation? See the 
 love he had to his disciples; he desired to eat it <I>with them,</I> 
 that he and they might have a little time together, themselves, and 
 none besides, for private conversation, which they could not have in 
 Jerusalem but upon this occasion. He was now about to leave them, but 
 was very desirous to <I>eat this passover with them before he 
 suffered,</I> as if the comfort of that would carry him the more 
 cheerfully through his sufferings, and make them the easier to him. 
 Note, Our gospel passover, eaten by faith with Jesus Christ, will be an 
 excellent preparation for sufferings, and trials, and death itself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How Christ in it <I>takes his leave of all passovers,</I> thereby 
 signifying his abrogating all the ordinances of the ceremonial law, of 
 which that of the passover was one of the <I>earliest</I> and one of 
 the most <I>eminent</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>I will not any more eat thereof,</I> nor shall it by any more 
 celebrated by my disciples, <I>until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of 
 God.</I>" 

 (1.) It was fulfilled when <I>Christ our Passover was sacrificed for 
 us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:7">1 Cor. v. 7</A>.

 And <I>therefore</I> that type and shadow was laid aside, because now 
 in the <I>kingdom of God</I> the substance was come, which superseded 
 it. 

 (2.) It was fulfilled in the <I>Lord's supper,</I> an ordinance of the 
 gospel kingdom, in which the passover had its accomplishment, and which 
 the disciples, after the pouring out of the Spirit, did frequently 
 celebrate, as we find 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:42,46">Acts ii. 42, 46</A>.

 They ate of it, and Christ might be said to eat with them, because of 
 the spiritual communion they had with him in that ordinance. He is
 said to <I>sup with them</I> and <I>they with him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>.

 But,

 (3.) The complete accomplishment of that commemoration of liberty will
 be in the kingdom of glory, when all God's spiritual Israel shall be 
 released from the bondage of death and sin, and be put in possession of 
 the land of promise. What he had said of his eating of the paschal 
 lamb, he repeats concerning his drinking of the <I>passover wine,</I> 
 the cup of <I>blessing,</I> or of thanksgiving, in which all the 
 company pledged the Master of the feast, at the close of the passover 
 supper. This cup <I>he took,</I> according to the custom, and <I>gave 
 thanks</I> for the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, and the 
 preservation of their first-born, and then said, <I>Take this, and 
 divide it among yourselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 This is not said afterwards of the sacramental cup, which being
 probably of much more weight and value, being the <I>New Testament in 
 his blood,</I> he might give into every one's hand, to teach them to 
 make a particular application of it to their own souls; but, as for the 
 paschal cup which is to be abolished, it is enough to say, "<I>Take</I> 
 it, and <I>divide it among yourselves,</I> do what you will with it, 
 for we shall have no more occasion for it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 <I>I will not drink of the fruit of the vine any more,</I> I will not
 have it any more drank of, <I>till the kingdom of God shall come,</I> 
 till the Spirit be poured out, and then you shall in <I>the Lord's 
 supper</I> commemorate a much more glorious redemption, of which both 
 the deliverance out of Egypt and the passover commemoration of it were 
 types and figures. The kingdom of God is now so near being set up that 
 you will not need to eat or drink any more till it comes." Christ dying 
 next day opened it. As Christ with a great deal of pleasure took leave 
 of all the legal feasts (which fell of course with the passover) for 
 the evangelical ones, both spiritual and sacramental; so may good 
 Christians, when they are called to remove from the church militant to 
 that which is triumphant, cheerfully exchange even their spiritual 
 repasts, much more their sacramental ones, for the eternal feast.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The institution of the Lord's supper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 The <I>passover</I> and the <I>deliverance</I> out of Egypt were
 <I>typical</I> and <I>prophetic signs</I> of a Christ to come, who 
 should by dying deliver us from sin and death, and the tyranny of 
 Satan; but they shall no more say, <I>The Lord liveth, that brought us 
 up out of the land of Egypt;</I> a much greater deliverance shall 
 eclipse the lustre of that, and therefore the Lord's supper is 
 instituted to be a commemorative sign or memorial of a Christ already 
 come, that <I>has</I> by dying delivered us; and it is his death that 
 is in a special manner set before us in that ordinance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The <I>breaking of Christ's body</I> as a <I>sacrifice for us</I> is 
 here commemorated by the <I>breaking of bread;</I> and the sacrifices 
 under the law were called the <I>bread of our God</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:6,8,17">Lev. xxi. 6, 8, 17</A>):

 <I>This is my body which is given for you.</I> And there is a feast 
 upon that sacrifice instituted, in which we are to apply it to 
 ourselves, and to take the benefit and comfort of it. This bread that 
 was given for us is given <I>to us</I> to be food for our souls, for 
 nothing can be more <I>nourishing</I> and <I>satisfying</I> to our 
 souls than the doctrine of Christ's making atonement for sin, and the 
 assurance of our interest in that atonement; this bread that was 
 <I>broken</I> and <I>given for us,</I> to satisfy for the guilt of our 
 sins, is <I>broken</I> and <I>given to us,</I> to satisfy the desire of 
 our souls. And this we do in <I>remembrance</I> of what he did for us, 
 when he died for us, and for a <I>memorial</I> of what we <I>do,</I> in 
 making ourselves <I>partakers of him,</I> and joining ourselves to him 
 in an everlasting covenant; like the stone Joshua set up for a 
 <I>witness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:27">Josh. xxiv. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The <I>shedding</I> of <I>Christ's blood,</I> by which the atonement 
 was made (for <I>the blood made atonement for the soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:11">Lev. xvii. 11</A>),

 as represented by the wine in the cup; and that cup of wine is a sign 
 and token of the New Testament, or new covenant, made with us. It
 <I>commemorates</I> the purchase of the covenant by the blood of 
 Christ, and <I>confirms</I> the promises of the covenant, which are all 
 <I>Yea</I> and <I>Amen</I> in him. This will be reviving and refreshing 
 to our souls, as wine that <I>makes glad the heart.</I> In all our 
 commemorations of the shedding of Christ's blood, we must have an eye 
 to it as shed for us; we needed it, we take hold of it, we hope to have 
 benefit by it; <I>who loved me, and gave himself for me.</I> And in all 
 our regards to the New Testament we must have an eye to the <I>blood of 
 Christ,</I> which gave life and being to it, and seals to us all the 
 promises of it. Had it not been for the blood of Christ, we had never 
 had the New Testament; and, had it not been for the New Testament, we 
 had never know the meaning of Christ's blood shed.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me <I>is</I> with me
 on the table.
 &nbsp; 22 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but
 woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!
 &nbsp; 23 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it
 was that should do this thing.
 &nbsp; 24 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should
 be accounted the greatest.
 &nbsp; 25 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
 lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them
 are called benefactors.
 &nbsp; 26 But ye <I>shall</I> not <I>be</I> so: but he that is greatest among
 you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that
 doth serve.
 &nbsp; 27 For whether <I>is</I> greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he
 that serveth? <I>is</I> not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among
 you as he that serveth.
 &nbsp; 28 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
 &nbsp; 29 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath
 appointed unto me;
 &nbsp; 30 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit
 on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
 &nbsp; 31 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired
 <I>to have</I> you, that he may sift <I>you</I> as wheat:
 &nbsp; 32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and
 when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
 &nbsp; 33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both
 into prison, and to death.
 &nbsp; 34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow
 this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest
 me.
 &nbsp; 35 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and
 scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.
 &nbsp; 36 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let
 him take <I>it,</I> and likewise <I>his</I> scrip: and he that hath no
 sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.
 &nbsp; 37 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
 accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors:
 for the things concerning me have an end.
 &nbsp; 38 And they said, Lord, behold, here <I>are</I> two swords. And he
 said unto them, It is enough.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's discourse with his disciples after supper, much 
 of which is new here; and in St. John's gospel we shall find other 
 additions. We should take example from him to entertain and edify our 
 family and friends with such discourse at table as is good and to the 
 use of edifying, which may minister grace to the hearers; but 
 especially after we have been at the Lord's table, by Christian 
 conference to keep one another in a suitable frame. The matters Christ 
 here discoursed of were of weight, and to the present purpose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He discoursed with them concerning him that should betray him, who 
 was now present. 

 1. He signifies to them that the traitor was now among them, and one of
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 By placing this after the institution of the Lord's supper, though in
 Matthew and Mark it is placed before it, it seems plain that Judas did 
 receive the Lord's supper, did <I>eat of that bread</I> and <I>drink of 
 that cup;</I> for, after the solemnity was over, Christ said, 
 <I>Behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the 
 table.</I> There have been those that have eaten bread with Christ and 
 yet have betrayed him. 

 2. He foretels that the treason would take effect

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Truly the Son of man goes as it was determined,</I> goes to the 
 place where he will be betrayed; for he is delivered up by the counsel 
 and foreknowledge of God, else Judas could not have delivered him up. 
 Christ was not driven to his sufferings, but cheerfully <I>went to 
 them.</I> He said, <I>Lo, I come.</I> 

 3. He threatens the traitor: <I>Woe to that man by whom he is
 betrayed.</I> Note, Neither the patience of the saints under their 
 sufferings, nor the counsel of God concerning their sufferings, will be 
 any excuse for those that have any hand in their sufferings, or that 
 persecute them. Though God has <I>determined</I> that Christ shall be
 betrayed and he himself has cheerfully submitted to it, yet Judas's sin 
 or punishment is not at all the less. 

 4. He frightens the rest of the disciples into a suspicion of
 themselves, by saying that it was one of them, and not naming which

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>They began to enquire among themselves,</I> to interrogate 
 themselves, to put the question to themselves, <I>who it was that 
 should do this thing,</I> that could be so base to so good a Master.
 The enquiry was not, <I>Is it you?</I> or, <I>Is it such a one?</I> 
 but, <I>Is it I?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning the strife that was among them for precedency or 
 supremacy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See what the dispute was: <I>Which of them should be accounted the 
 greatest.</I> Such and so many contests among the disciples for dignity 
 and dominion, <I>before</I> the Spirit was poured upon them, were a sad 
 presage of the like strifes for, and affections of, supremacy in the 
 churches, after the Spirit should be provoked to depart from them. How 
 inconsistent is this with that in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:23">verse before</A>!

 There they were enquiring which would be the traitor, and here which
 should be the prince. Could such an instance of humility, and such an 
 instance of pride and vanity, be found in the same men, so near 
 together? This is like <I>sweet</I> waters and <I>bitter</I> proceeding 
 at the same time out of the same fountain. What a self-contradiction is 
 the deceitful heart of man!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See what Christ said to this dispute. He was not sharp upon them, as 
 might have been expected (he having so often reproved them for this 
 very thing), but mildly showed them the sin and folly of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This was to make themselves like the <I>kings of the Gentiles,</I> 
 who affect worldly pomp, and worldly power, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 They <I>exercise lordship</I> over their subjects, and are ever and
 anon striving to exercise lordship too over the <I>princes</I> that are 
 about them, though as <I>good</I> as themselves, if they think them not 
 <I>so strong</I> as themselves. Note, The <I>exercising of lordship</I> 
 better becomes the <I>kings of the Gentiles</I> than the ministers of 
 Christ. But observe, <I>They that exercise authority,</I> and take upon 
 themselves to bear sway, and give law, they are called 
 <I>Benefactors</I>--<B><I>Euergetas</I></B>, they call themselves so, 
 and so their flatterers call them, and those that set themselves to 
 serve their interests. It is pretended that they have <I>been</I> 
 benefactors, and upon <I>that</I> account they should be admitted to 
 <I>have rule;</I> nay, that in exercising authority they are 
 benefactors. However they may really serve themselves, they would be 
 thought to <I>serve their country.</I> One of the Ptolemies was 
 surnamed <I>Euergetes--The Benefactor.</I> Now our Saviour, by taking 
 notice of this, intimates,

 [1.] That to <I>do good</I> is much more honourable than to <I>look 
 great;</I> for these princes that were the <I>terror of the mighty</I> 
 would not be called so, but rather the <I>benefactors of the needy;</I> 
 so that, by their own confession, a benefactor to his country is much 
 more valued than a ruler of his country.

 [2.] That to <I>do good</I> is the surest way to be great, else they 
 that aimed to be <I>rulers</I> would not have been so solicitous to be 
 called <I>Benefactors.</I> This therefore he would have his disciples 
 believe, that their greatest honour would be to do all the good they 
 could in the world. They would indeed be <I>benefactors</I> to the 
 world, by bringing the gospel to it. Let them value themselves upon 
 that title, which they would indeed be <I>entitled</I> to, and then 
 they need not strive which should be the greatest, for they would all 
 be <I>greater-</I> treater blessings to mankind than the kings of the 
 earth, that exercise lordship over them. If they have that which is
 confessedly the <I>greater</I> honour, of being benefactors, let them 
 despise the less, of being rulers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was to make themselves unlike the disciples of Christ, and 
 unlike Christ himself: "<I>You shall not be so,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 "It was never intended that you should <I>rule</I> any otherwise than
 by the power of truth and grace, but that you should <I>serve.</I>" 
 When church-rulers affect external pomp and power, and bear up 
 themselves by secular interests and influences, they debase their 
 office, and it is an instance of degeneracy like that of Israel when 
 they would have a king like the nations that were round about them, 
 whereas the Lord was their King. See here,

 [1.] What is the rule Christ gave to his disciples: He that is 
 <I>greater among you,</I> that is <I>senior,</I> to whom precedency is 
 due upon the account of his age, let him be as the <I>younger,</I> both 
 in point of <I>lowness of place</I> (let him condescend to sit with the 
 younger, and be free and familiar with them) and in point of 
 <I>labour</I> and <I>work.</I> We say, <I>Juniores ad labores, seniores 
 ad honores--Let the young work, and the aged receive their honours.</I> 
 But let the elder take pains as well as the younger; their age and 
 honour, instead of warranting them to take their ease, bind them to 
 double work. And he <I>that is chief,</I> <B><I>ho 
 hegoumenos</I></B>--<I>the president</I> of the college or assembly, 
 let him be <I>as he that</I> serves, <B><I>hos ho 
 diakonon</I></B>--<I>as the deacon;</I> let him stoop to the meanest 
 and most toilsome services for the public good, if there be occasion.

 [2.] What was the example which he himself gave to this rule: 
 <I>Whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth?</I> 
 he that attendeth or he that is attended on? Now Christ was among his 
 disciples just like one that waited at table. He was so far from 
 <I>taking state,</I> or <I>taking his ease,</I> by commanding their 
 attendance upon him, that he was ready to do any office of kindness and 
 service for them; witness his <I>washing</I> their feet. Shall those 
 take upon them the form of princes who call themselves followers of him 
 that <I>took upon him the form of a servant?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They ought not to strive for worldly honour and grandeur, because 
 he had better honours in reserve for them, of another nature, a 
 <I>kingdom,</I> a <I>feast,</I> a <I>throne,</I> for each of them, 
 wherein they should all share alike, and should have no occasion to 
 strive for precedency, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:28-30"><I>v.</I> 28-30</A>.
 
 Where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Christ's commendation of his disciples for their faithfulness to 
 him; and this was honour enough for them, they needed not to strive for 
 any greater. It is spoken with an air of encomium and applause: "<I>You 
 are they who have continued with me in my temptations,</I> you are they 
 who have stood by me and stuck to me when others have deserted me and 
 turned their backs upon me." Christ had his temptations; he was 
 despised and rejected of men, reproached and reviled, and <I>endured 
 the contradiction of sinners.</I> But his disciples continued with him, 
 and were afflicted in all his afflictions. It was but little help that 
 they could give him, or service that they could do him; nevertheless, 
 he took it kindly that they <I>continued with him,</I> and he here owns 
 their kindness, though it was by the assistance of his own grace that 
 they did continue. Christ's disciples had been very defective in their 
 duty. We find them guilty of many mistakes and weaknesses: they were 
 very dull and very forgetful, and often blundered, yet their Master 
 passes all by and forgets it; he does not upbraid them with their 
 infirmities, but gives them this memorable testimonial, <I>You are they 
 who have continued with me.</I> Thus does he praise at parting, to show 
 how willing he is to make the best of those whose hearts he knows to be 
 upright with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The recompence he designed them for their fidelity: <I>I 
 appoint,</I> <B><I>diatithemai</I></B>, <I>I bequeath, unto you a 
 kingdom.</I> Or thus, <I>I appoint to you, as my Father has appointed a 
 kingdom to me, that you may eat and drink at my table.</I> Understand 
 it, <I>First,</I> Of what should be done for them in this world. God 
 gave his Son a <I>kingdom among men,</I> the gospel church, of which he 
 is the living, quickening, ruling, Head. This <I>kingdom</I> he 
 <I>appointed</I> to his apostles and their successors in the ministry 
 of the gospel, that they should enjoy the comforts and privileges of 
 the gospel, help to communicate them to others by gospel ordinances, 
 sit on thrones as officers of the church, not only declaratively, but 
 exhortatively <I>judging the tribes of Israel</I> that persist in their 
 infidelity, and denouncing the wrath of God against them, and ruling 
 the gospel Israel, the spiritual Israel, by the instituted discipline
 of the church, administered with gentleness and love. This is the 
 honour reserved for you. Or, <I>Secondly,</I> Of what should be done 
 for them in the other world, which I take to be chiefly meant. Let them 
 go on in their services in this world; their preferments shall be in 
 the other world. God will give them <I>the kingdom,</I> in which they 
 shall be sure to have, 

 1. The <I>richest dainties;</I> for they shall <I>eat and drink at
 Christ's table in his kingdom,</I> of which he had spoken,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:16,18"><I>v.</I> 16, 18</A>.

 They shall partake of those joys and pleasures which were the
 recompence of his services and sufferings. They shall have a full 
 satisfaction of soul in the vision and fruition of God; and herein they 
 shall have the best society, as at a feast, in the perfection of love.

 2. The <I>highest dignities:</I> "You shall not only be provided for at
 the royal table, as Mephibosheth at David's, but you shall be preferred
 to the royal throne; shall <I>sit down with me on my throne,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:21">Rev. iii. 21</A>.

 In the great day you shall <I>sit on thrones,</I> as assessors with 
 Christ, to approve of and applaud his judgment of the <I>twelve tribes 
 of Israel.</I>" If the <I>saints shall judge the world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:2">1 Cor. vi. 2</A>),

 much more the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Concerning Peter's denying him. And in this part of the discourse 
 we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The general notice Christ gives to Peter of the devil's design upon 
 him and the rest of the apostles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>The Lord said, Simon, Simon,</I> observe what I say; <I>Satan hath 
 desired to have you,</I> to have you all in his hands, <I>that he may 
 sift you as wheat.</I> Peter, who used to be the <I>mouth</I> of the 
 rest in speaking to Christ, is here made the <I>ear</I> of the rest; 
 and what is designed for warning to them all (<I>all you shall be 
 offended, because of me</I>) is directed to Peter, because he was 
 principally concerned, being in particular manner struck at by the 
 tempter: <I>Satan has desired to have you.</I> Probably Satan had 
 <I>accused</I> the disciples to God as mercenary in following Christ, 
 and aiming at nothing else therein but enriching and advancing 
 themselves in this world, as he accused Job. "No," saith God, "they are 
 honest men, and men of integrity." "Give me leave to try them," saith 
 Satan, "and Peter particularly." He desired to have them, <I>that he 
 might sift them,</I> that he might show them to be chaff, and not 
 wheat. The troubles that were now coming upon them were <I>sifting,</I> 
 would try what there was in them: but this was not all; Satan desired 
 to sift them by his temptations, and endeavoured by those troubles to 
 draw them into sin, to put them into a loss and hurry, as corn when it 
 is sifted to bring the chaff uppermost, or rather to shake out the 
 wheat and leave nothing but the chaff. Observe, Satan could not sift 
 them unless God gave him leave: He <I>desired to have them,</I> as he 
 begged of God a permission to try and tempt Job.
 <B><I>Exetesato</I></B>--"<I>He has challenged you,</I> has undertaken 
 to prove you a company of hypocrites, and Peter especially, the 
 forwardest of you." Some suggest that Satan demanded leave to sift them 
 as their punishment for striving who should be greatest, in which 
 contest Peter perhaps was very warm: "Leave them to me, to sift them 
 for it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The particular encouragement he gave to Peter, in reference to this 
 trial: "<I>I have prayed for thee,</I> because, though he desires to 
 have them all, he is permitted to make his strongest onset upon thee 
 only: thou wilt be most violently assaulted, <I>but I have prayed for 
 thee, that thy faith fail not,</I> that it may not totally and finally 
 fail." Note, 

 (1.) If faith be kept up in an hour of temptation, though we may fall, 
 yet we shall not be utterly cast down. Faith will quench Satan's fiery 
 darts. 

 (2.) Though there may be many failings in the faith of true believers, 
 yet there shall not be a total and final failure of their faith. It is 
 their seed, their root, remaining in them. 

 (3.) It is owing to the mediation and intercession of Jesus Christ that 
 the faith of his disciples, though sometimes sadly shaken, yet is not 
 sunk. If they were left to themselves, they would fail; but they are 
 <I>kept by the power of God</I> and the prayer of Christ. The 
 intercession of Christ is not only general, for all that believe, but 
 for <I>particular</I> believers (I have prayed for <I>thee</I>), which 
 is an encouragement for us to pray for ourselves, and an engagement 
 upon us to pray for others too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The charge he gives to Peter to help others as he should himself be 
 helped of God: "<I>When thou art converted, strengthen thy 
 brethren;</I> when thou art recovered by the grace of God, and brought 
 to repentance, do what thou canst to recover others; when thou hast 
 found they faith kept from failing, labour to confirm the faith of 
 others, and to establish them; when thou hast found mercy with God 
 thyself, encourage others to hope that they also shall find mercy." 
 Note, 

 (1.) Those that have fallen into sin must be <I>converted from it;</I> 
 those that have turned aside must <I>return;</I> those that have left 
 their first love must do their first works. 

 (2.) Those that through grace are converted from sin must do what they 
 can to strengthen their brethren that stand, and to prevent <I>their 
 falling;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:11-13,1Ti+1:13">Ps. li. 11-13; 1 Tim. i. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Peter's declared resolution to cleave to Christ, whatever it cost 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison and to death.</I> 
 This was a great word, and yet I believe no more than he meant at this 
 time, and thought he should <I>make good</I> too. Judas never protested 
 thus against denying Christ, though often warned of it; for his heart 
 was as fully set in him to the evil as Peter's was against it. Note, 
 All the true disciples of Christ sincerely desire and design to 
 <I>follow him, whithersoever he goes,</I> and whithersoever he leads 
 them, though into a prison, though out of the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Christ's express prediction of his denying him thrice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 "<I>I tell thee, Peter</I> (thou dost not know thine own heart, but
 must be left to thyself a little, that thou mayest know it, and mayest 
 never trust to it again), <I>the cock shall not crow this day before 
 thou even deny that thou knowest me.</I>" Note, Christ knows us better 
 than we know ourselves, and knows the evil that is in us, and will be 
 done by us, which we ourselves do not suspect. It is well for us that 
 Christ knows where we are weak better than we do, and therefore where 
 to come in with grace sufficient; that he knows how far a temptation 
 will prevail, and therefore when to say, <I>Hitherto shall it come, and 
 no further.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Concerning the condition of all the disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He appeals to them concerning what had been, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 He had owned that they had been faithful servants to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Now he expects, at parting, that they should acknowledge that he had
 been a kind and careful Master to them ever since they left all to 
 follow him: <I>When I sent you without purse, lacked you any thing?</I>

 (1.) He owns that he had sent them out in a very poor and bare 
 condition, barefoot, and with no money in their purses, because they 
 were not to go far, nor be out long; and he would thus teach them to 
 depend upon the providence of God, and, under that, upon the kindness 
 of their friends. If God thus send us out into the world, let us 
 remember that better than we have thus begun low. 

 (2.) Yet ye will have them own that, notwithstanding this, they had 
 <I>lacked nothing;</I> they then lived as plentifully and comfortably 
 as ever; and they readily acknowledged it: "<I>Nothing, Lord;</I> I 
 have all, and abound." Note, 

 [1.] It is good for us often to review the providences of God that have 
 been concerning us all our days, and to observe how we have got through 
 the straits and difficulties we have met with.

 [2.] Christ is a good Master, and his service a good service; for 
 though his servants may sometimes be brought low, yet he will help 
 them; and though he <I>try</I> them, yet will he not leave them.
 <I>Jehovah-jireh.</I>

 [3.] We must reckon ourselves well done by, and must not complain, but 
 be thankful, if we have had the necessary supports of life, though we 
 have had neither dainties nor superfluities, though we have lived from 
 hand to mouth, and lived upon the kindness of our friends. The 
 disciples lived upon contribution, and yet did not complain that their 
 maintenance was precarious, but owned, to their Master's honour, that 
 it was sufficient; they had wanted nothing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives them notice of a very great change of their circumstances 
 now approaching. For, 

 (1.) He that was their Master was now entering upon his sufferings, 
 which he had often foretold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 "Now <I>that which is written must be fulfilled in me,</I> and this 
 among the rest, <I>He was numbered among the transgressors--</I> he 
 must suffer and die as a malefactor, and in company with some of the 
 vilest of malefactors. This is that which is <I>yet to be
 accomplished,</I> after all the rest, and then <I>the things concerning 
 me,</I> the things written concerning me, will have an end; then I 
 shall say, <I>It is finished.</I>" Note, It may be the comfort of 
 suffering Christians, as it was of a suffering Christ, that their 
 sufferings were foretold, and <I>determined</I> in the counsels of 
 heaven, and will shortly <I>determine</I> in the joys of heaven. They 
 were <I>written</I> concerning them, and they <I>will have an end,</I> 
 and will end well, everlastingly well. 

 (2.) They must therefore expect troubles, and must not think now to 
 have such an easy and comfortable life as they had had; no, the scene 
 will alter. They must now in some degree suffer <I>with</I> their 
 Master; and, when he is gone, they must expect to suffer <I>like</I> 
 him. The servant is not better than his Lord. 

 [1.] They must not now expect that their friends would be so kind and 
 generous to them as they had been; and therefore, <I>He that has a 
 purse, let him take it,</I> for he may have occasion for it, and for 
 all the good husbandry he can use.

 [2.] They must now expect that their enemies would be more fierce upon 
 them than they had been, and they would need magazines as well as 
 stores: <I>He that has no sword</I> wherewith to defend himself against 
 robbers and assassins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:26">2 Cor. xi. 26</A>)

 will find a great want of it, and will be ready to wish, some time or 
 other, that he had sold his garment and bought one. This is intended 
 only to show that the times would be very perilous, so that no man 
 would think himself safe if he had not a sword by his side. But the 
 <I>sword of the Spirit</I> is the sword which the disciples of Christ 
 must furnish themselves with. <I>Christ having suffered for us,</I> we 
 must <I>arm ourselves</I> with the same mind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:1">1 Peter iv. 1</A>),

 arm ourselves with an expectation of trouble, that it may not be a 
 surprise to us, and with a holy resignation to the will of God in it, 
 that there may be no opposition in us to it: and then we are better 
 prepared than if we had sold a coat to buy a sword. The disciples 
 hereupon enquire what strength they had, and find they had among them 
 <I>two swords</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 of which one was Peter's. The Galileans generally travelled with 
 swords. Christ wore none himself, but he was not against his disciples' 
 wearing them. But he intimates how little he would have them depend 
 upon this when he saith, <I>It is enough,</I> which some think is 
 spoken ironically: "Two swords among twelve men! you are bravely armed
 indeed when our enemies are now coming out against us in great 
 multitudes, and every one with a sword!" Yet two swords are sufficient

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the awful story of Christ's <I>agony in the garden,</I> 
 just before he was betrayed, which was largely related by the other 
 evangelists. In it Christ <I>accommodated himself</I> to that part of 
 his undertaking which he was now entering upon--the making of <I>his
 soul an offering for sin.</I> He afflicted his own soul with grief for 
 the sin he was to satisfy for, and an apprehension of the wrath of God 
 to which man had by sin made himself obnoxious, which he was pleased as 
 a sacrifice to admit the impressions of, the consuming of a sacrifice 
 with fire from heaven being the surest token of its acceptance. In it 
 Christ entered the lists with the powers of darkness, gave them all the 
 advantages they could desire, and yet conquered them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What we have in this passage which we had before is, 

 1. That when Christ went out, though it was in the night, and a long
 walk, <I>his disciples</I> (eleven of them, for Judas had given them 
 the slip) <I>followed him.</I> Having continued with him hitherto in 
 his temptations, they would not leave him now. 

 2. That he went to the place <I>where he was wont</I> to be private, 
 which intimates that Christ accustomed himself to retirement, was often 
 alone, to teach us to be so, for freedom of converse with God and our 
 own hearts. Though Christ had no conveniency for retirement but a 
 garden, yet he retired. This should particularly be our practice after
 we have been at the Lord's table; we have then work to do which 
 requires us to be private.

 3. That he exhorted his disciples to <I>pray</I> that, though the
 approaching trial could not be avoided, yet they might not in it 
 <I>enter into temptation</I> to sin; that, when they were in the 
 greatest fright and danger, yet they might not have any inclination to 
 desert Christ, nor take a step towards it: "Pray that you may be 
 <I>kept from sin.</I>" 

 4. That he withdrew from them, and prayed himself; they had their
 errands at the throne of grace, and he had his, and therefore it was 
 fit that they should pray separately, as sometimes, when they had joint 
 errands, they prayed together. He withdrew about a <I>stone's cast</I> 
 further into the garden, which some reckon about fifty of sixty paces, 
 and there he <I>kneeled down</I> (so it is here) upon the bare ground; 
 but the other evangelists say that afterwards he <I>fell on his 
 face,</I> and there <I>prayed</I> that, if it were the will of God, 
 this cup of suffering, this bitter cup, might be <I>removed from 
 him.</I> This was the language of that innocent dread of suffering 
 which, being really and truly man, he could not but have in his nature. 
 
 5. That he, knowing it to be his Father's will that he should suffer
 and die, and that, as the matter was now settled, it was necessary for 
 our redemption and salvation, presently withdrew that petition, did not 
 insist upon it, but resigned himself to his heavenly Father's will: 
 "<I>Nevertheless not my will be done,</I> not the will of my human 
 nature, but the will of God as it is written concerning me in the 
 volume of the book, <I>which I delight to do,</I> let that be done," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:7,8">Ps. xl. 7, 8</A>.

 6. That his disciples were <I>asleep</I> when he was at prayer, and
 when they should have been themselves praying,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 When he <I>rose from prayer,</I> he <I>found them sleeping,</I>
 unconcerned in his sorrows; but see what a favourable construction is 
 here put upon it, which we had not in the other evangelists--they were 
 <I>sleeping for sorrow.</I> The great sorrow they were in upon the 
 mournful farewells their Master had been this evening giving them had 
 exhausted their spirits, and made them very dull and heavy, which (it 
 being now late) disposed them to sleep. This teaches us to make the 
 best of our brethren's infirmities, and, if there be one cause better 
 than another, charitably impute them to that.

 7. That when he awoke them, then he exhorted them to pray

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>):

 "<I>Why sleep ye?</I> Why do you allow yourselves to sleep? <I>Rise
 and pray. Shake off</I> your drowsiness, that you may be <I>fit to 
 pray,</I> and <I>pray for grace,</I> that you may be able to <I>shake 
 off</I> your drowsiness." This was like the ship-master's call to Jonah 
 in a storm 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:6">Jon. i. 6</A>):

 <I>Arise, call upon thy God.</I> When we find ourselves either by our 
 outward circumstances or our inward dispositions entering into 
 temptation, it concerns us to <I>rise and pray,</I> Lord, help me in 
 this <I>time of need.</I> But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. There are three things in this passage which we had not in the 
 other evangelists:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That, when Christ was in his agony, <I>there appeared</I> to him 
 <I>an angel from heaven, strengthening him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 (1.) It was an instance of the deep humiliation of our Lord Jesus that 
 he <I>needed</I> the assistance of an angel, and would <I>admit</I> it.
 The influence of the divine nature withdrew for the present, and then, 
 as to his human nature, he was for a little while <I>lower than the 
 angels,</I> and was capable of receiving help from them. 

 (2.) When he was not delivered from his sufferings, yet he was 
 <I>strengthened</I> and supported under them, and that was 
 <I>equivalent.</I> If God proportion the shoulders to the burden, we 
 shall have no reason to complain, whatever he is pleased to lay upon 
 us. David owns this a sufficient <I>answer to his prayer,</I> in the 
 day of trouble, that God <I>strengthened him with strength in his 
 soul,</I> and so does the son of David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:3">Ps. cxxxviii. 3</A>.

 (3.) The angels ministered to the Lord Jesus in his sufferings. He
 could have had legions of them to rescue him; nay, this one could have 
 done it, could have chased and conquered the whole band of men that 
 came to take him; but he made use of his ministration only to 
 <I>strengthen him;</I> and the very visit which this angel made him now 
 in his grief, when his enemies were awake and his friends asleep, was 
 such a seasonable token of the divine favour as would be a very great 
 strengthening to him. Yet this was not all: he probably <I>said 
 something</I> to him to strengthen him; put him in mind that his 
 sufferings were in order to his Father's glory, to his own glory, and 
 to the salvation of those that were given him, represented to him the 
 joy set before him, the seed he should see; with these and the like 
 suggestions he encouraged him to go on cheerfully; and what is 
 comforting is strengthening. Perhaps he <I>did something</I> to
 strengthen him, wiped away his sweat and tears, perhaps ministered some 
 cordial to him, as after his temptation, or, it may be, took him by the 
 arm, and helped him off the ground, or bore him up when he was ready to 
 faint away; and in these services of the angel the Holy Spirit was 
 <B><I>enischyon auton</I></B>--<I>putting strength into him;</I> for so 
 the word signifies. <I>It pleased the Lord to bruise him</I> indeed; 
 yet <I>did he plead against him with his great power?</I> No, but he 
 <I>put strength in him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:6">Job xxiii. 6</A>),

 as he had promised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:21,Isa+49:8,50:7">Ps. lxxxix. 21; 
 Isa. xlix. 8; l. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That, <I>being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 As his sorrow and trouble grew upon him, he grew more importunate in
 prayer; not that there was before any coldness or indifferency in his 
 prayers, but there was now a greater vehemency in them, which was 
 expressed in his voice and gesture. Note, Prayer, though never out of 
 season, is in a special manner seasonable when we are in an agony; and 
 the stronger our agonies are the more lively and frequent our prayers 
 should be. Now it was that Christ <I>offered up prayers and 
 supplications with strong crying and tears, and was heard in that he 
 feared</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>),

 and in his fear <I>wrestled,</I> as Jacob with the angel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That, in this agony, <I>his sweat was as it were great drops of 
 blood falling down to the ground.</I> Sweat came in with sin, and was a 
 branch of the curse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:19">Gen. iii. 19</A>.

 And therefore, when Christ was made sin and a curse for us, he
 underwent a grievous sweat, that <I>in the sweat of his face</I> we 
 might eat bread, and that he might sanctify and sweeten all our trials 
 to us. There is some dispute among the critics whether this 
 <I>sweat</I> is only <I>compared to</I> drops of <I>blood,</I> being 
 much <I>thicker</I> than drops of sweat commonly are, the pores of the 
 body being more than ordinarily opened, or whether <I>real</I> blood 
 out of the capillary veins mingled with it, so that it was in colour 
 like blood, and might truly be called a <I>bloody sweat;</I> the matter 
 is not great. Some reckon this one of the times when Christ shed his 
 blood for us, <I>for without the shedding of blood there is no 
 remission.</I> Every pore was as it were a bleeding wound, and his 
 blood stained all his raiment. This showed the <I>travail of his
 soul.</I> He was now abroad in the open air, in a cool season, upon the 
 cold ground, far in the night, which, one would think, had been enough 
 to strike in a sweat; yet now he breaks out into a sweat, which 
 bespeaks the extremity of the agony he was in.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>47  And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was
 called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near
 unto Jesus to kiss him.
 &nbsp; 48 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of
 man with a kiss?
 &nbsp; 49 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they
 said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
 &nbsp; 50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and
 cut off his right ear.
 &nbsp; 51 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he
 touched his ear, and healed him.
 &nbsp; 52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the
 temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out,
 as against a thief, with swords and staves?
 &nbsp; 53 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth
 no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of
 darkness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Satan, finding himself baffled in his attempts to terrify our Lord 
 Jesus, and so to put him out of the possession of his own soul, betakes 
 himself (according to his usual method) to force and arms, and brings a 
 party into the field to seize him, and Satan was <I>in them.</I> Here 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The marking of him by Judas. Here a numerous party appears, and 
 Judas at the head of them, for he was <I>guide to them that took 
 Jesus;</I> they knew not where to <I>find him,</I> but he brought them 
 to the place: when they were there, they knew not which was he, but 
 Judas told them that whomsoever he should kiss, that same was he; so he 
 <I>drew near to him to kiss him,</I> according to the wonted freedom 
 and familiarity to which our Lord Jesus admitted his disciples. Luke 
 takes notice of the question Christ asked him, which we have not in the 
 other evangelists: <I>Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a 
 kiss?</I> What! Is this the signal? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.

 Must the Son of man be <I>betrayed,</I> as if any thing could be
 concealed from him, and a plot carried on against him unknown to him? 
 Must one of his own disciples betray him, as if he had been a hard 
 Master to them, or deserved ill at their hands? Must he be betrayed 
 with a kiss? Must the badge of friendship be the instrument of 
 treachery? Was ever a love-token so desecrated and abused? Note, 
 Nothing can be a greater affront or grief to the Lord Jesus than to be 
 betrayed, and betrayed with a kiss, by those that profess relation to 
 him and an affection for him. Those do so who, under pretence of zeal 
 for his honour, persecute his servants, who, under the cloak of a 
 seeming affection for the honour of free grace, give a blow to the root 
 of holiness and strictness of conversation. Many instances there are of 
 Christ's being betrayed with a kiss, by those who, under the form of 
 godliness, fight against the power of it. It were well if their own 
 consciences would put this question to them, which Christ here puts to 
 Judas, <I>Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</I> And will he 
 not resent it? Will he not revenge it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The effort which his disciples made for his protection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):
 
 <I>When they saw what would follow,</I> that those armed men were come 
 to seize him, they said, "<I>Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</I> 
 Thou didst allow us to <I>have</I> two swords, shall we now make use of 
 them? Never was there more occasion; and to what purpose should we have 
 them if we do not use them?" They asked the question as if they would 
 not have drawn the sword without commission from their Master, but they 
 were in too much <I>haste</I> and too much <I>heat</I> to stay for an 
 answer. But Peter, aiming at the head of one of the servants of the 
 <I>high priest,</I> missed his blow, and <I>cut off his right ear.</I> 
 As Christ, by throwing them to the ground that came to take him, showed 
 what he could have done, so Peter, by this exploit, showed what he 
 could have done too in so good a cause if he had had leave. The other 
 evangelists tell us what was the check Christ gave to Peter for it. 
 Luke here tells us, 

 1. How Christ excused the blow: <I>Suffer ye thus far,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>.

 Dr. Whitby thinks he said this to his enemies who came to take him, to
 pacify them, that they might not be provoked by it to fall upon the 
 disciples, whom he had undertaken the preservation of: "<I>Pass by</I> 
 this injury and affront; it was without warrant from me, and there 
 shall not be another blow struck." Though Christ had power to have 
 struck them down, and struck them dead, yet he <I>speaks them fair,</I> 
 and, as it were, <I>begs their pardon</I> for an assault made upon them 
 by one of his followers, to teach us to give good words even to our 
 enemies. 

 2. How he cured the wound, which was more than amends sufficient for 
 the injury: <I>He touched his ear, and healed him;</I> fastened his ear 
 on again, that he might not so much as go away <I>stigmatized,</I> 
 though he well deserved it. Christ hereby gave them a proof,

 (1.) Of his power. He that could <I>heal</I> could <I>destroy</I> if he 
 pleased, which should have obliged them in interest to submit to him. 
 Had they returned the blow upon Peter, he would immediately have healed 
 him; and what could not a small regiment do that had such a surgeon to 
 it, immediately to help the <I>sick</I> and <I>wounded?</I> 

 (2.) Of his mercy and goodness. Christ here gave an illustrious example 
 to his own rule of <I>doing good to them that hate us,</I> as 
 afterwards he did of <I>praying for them that despitefully use us.</I> 
 Those who render good for evil do as Christ did. One would have thought 
 that this generous piece of kindness should have overcome them, that 
 such coals, heaped on their heads, should have <I>melted them,</I> that 
 they could not have bound him as a malefactor who had approved himself 
 such a benefactor; but their hearts were hardened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's expostulation with the officers of the detachment that 
 came to apprehend him, to show what an absurd thing it was for them to 
 make all this rout and noise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:52,53"><I>v.</I> 52, 53</A>.

 Matthew relates it as said to <I>the multitude.</I> Luke tells us that
 it was said to the <I>chief priests and captains of the temple</I> the 
 latter commanded the several orders of the priests, and therefore are 
 here put between the <I>chief priests</I> and <I>the elders,</I> so 
 that they were all ecclesiastics, retainers to the temple, who were 
 employed in this odious piece of service; and some of the first rank 
 too disparaged themselves so far as to be seen in it. Now see here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How Christ <I>reasons</I> with them concerning their proceedings. 
 What occasion was there for them to come out in the dead of the night, 
 and <I>with swords and staves?</I> 

 (1.) They knew that he was one that would not <I>resist,</I> nor raise 
 the mob against them; he never had done any thing like this. Why then 
 <I>are ye come out as against a thief?</I> 

 (2.) They knew he was one that would not <I>abscond,</I> for he was 
 daily with them in the temple, in the midst of them, and never sought 
 to conceal himself, nor did they offer to lay hands on him. Before his
 hour was come, it was folly for them to think to take him; and when his 
 hour was come it was folly for them to make all this ado to take 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he reconciles himself to their proceedings; and this we had not 
 before: "<I>But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</I> How 
 hard soever it may seem that I should be thus exposed, I submit, for so 
 it is determined. This is the hour <I>allowed you</I> to have your will 
 against me. There is an hour <I>appointed me</I> to reckon for it. Now 
 the <I>power of darkness,</I> Satan, <I>the ruler of the darkness of 
 this world,</I> is permitted to do his worst, to bruise the heel of the 
 seed of the woman, and I resolve to acquiesce; let him do his worst. 
 <I>The Lord shall laugh at him, for he sees that his day,</I> his hour, 
 <I>is coming.</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13">Ps. xxxvii. 13</A>.

 Let this quiet us under the prevalency of the church's enemies; let it 
 quiet us in a dying hour, that,

 (1.) It is but an <I>hour</I> that is permitted for the triumph of our
 adversary, a short time, a limited time. 

 (2.) It is <I>their hour,</I> which is appointed them, and in which 
 they are permitted to try their strength, that omnipotence may be the 
 more glorified in their fall.

 (3.) It is <I>the power of darkness</I> that <I>rides master,</I> and 
 darkness must give way to light, and the power of darkness be made to 
 truckle to the prince of light. Christ was willing to wait for his 
 triumphs till his warfare was accomplished, and we must be so too.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>54  Then took they him, and led <I>him,</I> and brought him into the
 high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.
 &nbsp; 55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall,
 and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
 &nbsp; 56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and
 earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
 &nbsp; 57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
 &nbsp; 58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art
 also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
 &nbsp; 59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently
 affirmed, saying, Of a truth this <I>fellow</I> also was with him: for
 he is a Galil&aelig;an.
 &nbsp; 60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And
 immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
 &nbsp; 61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter
 remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before
 the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
 &nbsp; 62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the melancholy story of Peter's denying his Master, at the 
 time when he was arraigned before the high priest, and those that were 
 of the <I>cabal,</I> that were ready to receive the prey, and to 
 prepare the evidence for his arraignment, <I>as soon as it was day,</I> 
 before the <I>great</I> sanhedrim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:66"><I>v.</I> 66</A>.

 But notice is not taken here, as was in the other evangelists, of
 Christ's being now upon his examination before the high priest, only of 
 his being brought into <I>the high priest's house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.

 But the manner of expression is observable. They <I>took him, and led
 him, and brought him,</I> which methinks is like that concerning Saul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:12">1 Sam. xv. 12</A>):

 <I>He is gone about, and passed on, and gone down;</I> and intimates 
 that, even when they had seized their prey, they were in confusion, 
 and, for fear of the people, or rather struck with inward terror upon 
 what they had seen and heard, they took him the furthest way about, or, 
 rather, knew not which way they hurried him, such a hurry were they in 
 in their own bosoms. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Peter's falling. 

 1. It began in <I>sneaking.</I> He <I>followed Christ</I> when he was 
 had away prisoner; this was well, and showed a concern for his Master. 
 But he followed <I>afar off,</I> that he might be out of danger. He 
 thought to trim the matter, to <I>follow Christ,</I> and so to satisfy 
 his conscience, but to follow <I>afar off,</I> and so to save his 
 reputation, and sleep in a whole skin. 

 2. It proceeded in keeping his distance still, and associating himself 
 with the high priest's servants, when he should have been at his 
 master's elbow. The <I>servants kindled a fire in the midst of the 
 hall</I> and <I>sat down together,</I> to talk over their 
 night-expedition. Probably Malchus was among them, and <I>Peter sat 
 down among them,</I> as if he had been one of them, at least would be 
 thought to be so. His fall itself was disclaiming all acquaintance with 
 Christ, and relation to him, disowning him because he was now in 
 distress and danger. He was charged by a sorry simple maid, that 
 belonged to the house, with being a retainer to this <I>Jesus,</I> 
 about whom there was now so much noise. She <I>looked wistfully</I>
 upon him as he <I>at by the fire,</I> only because he was a stranger, 
 and one whom she had not seen before; and concluding that at this time 
 of night there were no neuters there, and knowing him not to be any of 
 the retinue of the high priest, she concludes him to be one of the 
 retinue of this Jesus, or perhaps she had been some time or other 
 looking about her in the temple, and had seen Jesus there and Peter 
 with him, officious about him, and remembered him; <I>and this man was 
 with him,</I> saith she. And Peter, as he had not the courage to 
 <I>own</I> the charge, so he had not the wit and presence of mind to 
 <I>turn it off,</I> as he might have done many ways, and therefore 
 flatly and plainly denies it: <I>Woman, I know him not.</I> 

 4. His fall was repeated a second time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>):

 <I>After a little while,</I> before he had time to recollect himself, 
 <I>another saw him,</I> and said, "<I>Even thou art one of them,</I> as 
 slyly as thou sittest here among the high priest's servants." <I>Not 
 I,</I> saith Peter; <I>Man, I am not.</I> And a <I>third</I> time, 
 <I>about the space of an hour after</I> (for, saith the tempter, "When 
 he is down, down with him; let us follow the blow, till we get him past 
 recovery"), <I>another</I> confidently affirms, <I>strenuously</I>
 asserts it, "<I>Of a truth this fellow also was with him,</I> let him 
 deny it if he can, for you may all perceive <I>he is a Galilean.</I>" 
 But he that has once told a lie is strongly tempted to persist in it; 
 the <I>beginning of</I> that <I>sin is as the letting forth of 
 water.</I> Peter now not only denies that he is a disciple of Christ, 
 but that he knows any thing of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>):

 "<I>Man, I know not what thou sayest;</I> I never heard of this 
 Jesus."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>Peter's getting up again.</I> See how happily he recovered 
 himself, or, rather, the grace of God recovered him. See how it was 
 brought about:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The <I>cock crew</I> just as he was the third time denying that he 
 knew Christ, and this startled him and put him upon thinking. Note, 
 Small accidents may involve great consequences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>The Lord turned and looked upon him.</I> This circumstance we had 
 not in the other evangelists, but it is a very remarkable one. Christ 
 is here called <I>the Lord,</I> for there was much of divine knowledge, 
 power, and grace, appearing in this. Observe, Though Christ had now
 his back upon Peter, and was upon his trial (when, one would think, he 
 had something else to mind), yet he knew all that Peter said. Note, 
 Christ takes more notice of what we say and do than we think he does. 
 When Peter disowned Christ, yet Christ did not disown him, though he 
 might justly have cast him off, and never looked upon him more, but 
 have denied him before his Father. It is well for us that Christ does 
 not deal with us as we deal with him. Christ <I>looked upon Peter,</I> 
 not doubting but that Peter would soon be aware of it; for he knew 
 that, though he had denied him with his lips, yet his eye would still 
 be towards him. Observe, Though Peter had now been guilty of a very 
 great offence, and which was very provoking, yet Christ would not 
 <I>call to him,</I> lest he should <I>shame</I> him or <I>expose</I> 
 him; he only gave him <I>a look</I> which none but Peter would 
 understand the meaning of, and it had a great deal in it. 

 (1.) It was a <I>convincing</I> look. Peter said that he did not
 <I>know Christ.</I> Christ <I>turned, and looked upon him,</I> as if he 
 should say, "Dost thou not know me, Peter? Look me in the face, and 
 tell me so." 

 (2.) It was a <I>chiding</I> look. We may suppose that he looked upon 
 him and <I>frowned,</I> or some way signified his displeasure. Let us 
 think with what an angry countenance Christ justly looks upon us when 
 we have sinned. 

 (3.) It was an <I>expostulating</I> upbraiding look: "What, Peter, art 
 thou he that disownest me now, when thou shouldest come and witness for 
 me? What thou a disciple? Thou that wast the most forward to confess me 
 to be the Son of God, and didst solemnly promise thou wouldest never 
 disown me?" 

 (4.) It was a <I>compassionate</I> look; he looked upon him with 
 tenderness. "Poor Peter, how weak is thine heart! How art thou fallen
 and undone if I do not help thee!" 

 (5.) It was a <I>directing</I> look. Christ <I>guided him with his
 eye,</I> gave him a wink to go out from that sorry company, to 
 <I>retire,</I> and bethink himself a little, and then he would soon see 
 what he had to do. 

 (6.) It was a <I>significant</I> look: it signified the conveying of 
 grace to Peter's heart, to enable him to repent; the crowing of the 
 cock would not have brought him to repentance without this look, nor 
 will the external means without special efficacious grace. Power went 
 along with this look, to change the heart of Peter, and to bring him to 
 himself, to his <I>right mind.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>Peter remembered the words of the Lord.</I> Note, The <I>grace of 
 God</I> works in and by the <I>word of God,</I> brings that to mind, 
 and sets that home upon the conscience, and so gives the soul a happy 
 turn. <I>Tolle et lege--Take it up, and read.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Then <I>Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</I> One look from Christ 
 melted him into tears of godly sorrow for sin. The candle was newly put 
 out, and then a little thing lighted it again. Christ looked upon the 
 chief priests, and made no impression upon them as he did on Peter, who 
 had the divine seed remaining in him to work upon. It was not the look 
 from Christ, but the grace of God with it, that recovered Peter, and 
 brought him to-rights.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>63  And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the
 face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
 &nbsp; 65 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
 &nbsp; 66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the
 chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into
 their council, saying,
 &nbsp; 67 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I
 tell you, ye will not believe:

 &nbsp; 70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he

 ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told, as before in the other gospels,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How our Lord Jesus was <I>abused</I> by the servants of the high 
 priest. <I>The abjects,</I> the rude and barbarous servants, 
 <I>gathered themselves together against him.</I> They that <I>held 
 Jesus,</I> that had him in custody till the court sat, they <I>mocked 
 him,</I> and <I>smote him</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:63"><I>v.</I> 63</A>),

 they would not allow him to <I>repose</I> himself one minute, though he 
 had had no sleep all night, nor to <I>compose</I> himself, though he 
 was hurried to his trial, and no time given him to prepare for it. They 
 made sport with him: this sorrowful night to him shall be a merry night 
 to them; and the blessed Jesus, like Samson, is made the fool in the 
 play. They <I>hood-winked</I> him, and then, according to the common 
 play that young people have among them, they <I>struck him on the 
 face,</I> and continued to do so till he named the person that smote 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:64"><I>v.</I> 64</A>),

 intending hereby an affront to his prophetical office, and that 
 knowledge of secret things which he was said to have. We are not told
 that he said <I>any thing,</I> but <I>bore every thing;</I> hell was 
 let loose, and he suffered it to do its worst. A greater indignity 
 could not be done to the blessed Jesus, yet this was but one instance 
 of many; for <I>many other things blasphemously spoke they against 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:65"><I>v.</I> 65</A>.

 They that condemned him for a blasphemer were themselves the vilest
 blasphemers that ever were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he was accused and condemned by the great sanhedrim, consisting 
 of the <I>elders of the people, the chief priests, and the scribes,</I> 
 who were all up betimes, and got together <I>as soon as it was day,</I> 
 about five of the clock in the morning, to prosecute this matter. They 
 were <I>working this evil upon their beds,</I> and, as soon as ever the 
 <I>morning</I> was <I>light, practised</I> it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:1">Mic. ii. 1</A>.

 They would not have been up so early for any good work. It is but a
 short account that we have here of his trial in the ecclesiastical 
 court.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They ask him, <I>Art thou the Christ?</I> He was generally believed 
 by his followers to be the Christ, but they could not prove it upon him 
 that he had ever said so <I>totidem verbis--in so many words,</I> and
 therefore urge him to own it to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:67"><I>v.</I> 67</A>.

 If they had asked him this question with a willingness to admit that he
 was the Christ, and to receive him accordingly if he could give 
 sufficient proof of his being so, it had been <I>well,</I> and might 
 have been for ever <I>well with them;</I> but they asked it with a 
 resolution not to believe him, but a design to ensnare him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He justly complained of their unfair and unjust usage of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:67,68"><I>v.</I> 67, 68</A>.

 They all, as Jews, professed to expect the Messiah, and to expect him
 at <I>this time.</I> No other appeared, or had appeared, that pretended 
 to be the Messiah. He had no competitor, nor was he likely to have any. 
 He had given amazing proofs of a divine power going along with him, 
 which made his claims very well worthy of a free and impartial enquiry. 
 It had been but just for these leaders of the people to have taken him 
 into their council, and examined him there as a <I>candidate</I> for 
 the messiahship, not at the bar as a <I>criminal.</I> "But," saith he,

 (1.) "<I>If I tell you that I am the Christ,</I> and give you ever such 
 convincing proofs of it, you are resolved that <I>you will not 
 believe.</I> Why should the cause be brought on before you who have 
 already prejudged it, and are resolved, right or wrong, to run it down, 
 and to condemn it?" 

 (2.) "<I>If I ask you</I> what you have to object against the proofs I 
 produce, <I>you will not answer me.</I>" Here he refers to their 
 silence when he put a question to them, which would have led them to 
 own his authority,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:5-7"><I>ch.</I> xx. 5-7</A>.

 They were neither fair judges, nor fair disputants; but, when they were
 pinched with an argument, would rather be silent than own their 
 conviction: "<I>You will neither answer me nor let me go;</I> if I be 
 <I>not</I> the Christ, you ought to <I>answer</I> the arguments with 
 which I prove that I am; if I be, you ought to <I>let me go;</I> but 
 you will do neither."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He referred them to his second coming, for the full proof of his 
 being the Christ, to their confusion, since they would not now admit 
 the proof of it, to their conviction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:69"><I>v.</I> 69</A>):

 "<I>Hereafter shall the Son of man sit,</I> and be seen to sit, <I>on 
 the right hand of the power of God,</I> and then you will not need to 
 ask whether he be the Christ or no."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Hence they inferred that he set up himself as the Son of God, and 
 asked him <I>whether he were so</I> or <I>no</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:70"><I>v.</I> 70</A>):

 <I>Art thou then the Son of God?</I> He called himself the <I>Son of 
 man,</I> referring to Daniel's vision of the <I>Son of man</I> that 
 <I>came near before the Ancient of days,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13,14">Dan. vii. 13, 14</A>.

 But they understood so much as to know that if he was <I>that Son</I>
 of man, he was also <I>the Son of God.</I> And art thou so? By this it 
 appears to have been the faith of the Jewish church that the Messiah 
 should be both <I>Son of man</I> and <I>Son of God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He owns himself to be the Son of God: <I>Ye say that I am;</I> that 
 is, "I am, as ye say." Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:62">Mark xiv. 62</A>.

 <I>Jesus said, I am.</I> This confirms Christ's testimony concerning 
 himself, that he was the Son of God, that he stood to it, when he knew 
 he should suffer for standing to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Upon this they ground his condemnation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:71"><I>v.</I> 71</A>):

 <I>What need we any further witness?</I> It was true, they needed not 
 any further witness to prove that he said he was <I>the Son of God,</I> 
 they had it from <I>his own mouth;</I> but did they not need proof that 
 he was not so, before they condemned him as a blasphemer for saying 
 that he was so? Had they no apprehension that it was possible he might
 be so, and then what horrid guilt they should bring upon themselves in 
 putting him to death? No, <I>they know not, neither will they 
 understand.</I> They cannot think it possible that he should be the 
 Messiah, though ever so evidently clothed with divine power and grace, 
 if he appear not, as they expect, in worldly pomp and grandeur. Their 
 eyes being blinded with the admiration of that, they rush on in this 
 dangerous prosecution, as the horse into the battle.</P>
