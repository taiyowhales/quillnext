 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus went gloriously down to death, in spite of the malice of 
 his enemies, who did all they could to make his death ignominious; but 
 he rose again more gloriously, of which we have an account in this 
 chapter; and the proofs and evidences of Christ's resurrection are more 
 fully related by this evangelist than they were by Matthew and Mark. 
 Here is, 

 I. Assurance given by two angels, to the woman who visited the
 sepulchre, that the Lord Jesus was risen from the dead, according to 
 his own word, to which the angels refer them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>),

 and the report of this to the apostles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 II. The visit which Peter made to the sepulchre, and his discoveries
 there, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:12">ver. 12</A>.

 III. Christ's conference with the two disciples that were going to
 Emmaus, and his making himself known to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:13-35">ver. 13-35</A>.

 IV. His appearing to the eleven disciples themselves, the same day at
 evening, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:39-46">ver. 36-49</A>.

 V. The farewell he gave them, his ascension into heaven, and the joy
 and praise of his disciples whom he left behind,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now upon the first <I>day</I> of the week, very early in the
 morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which
 they had prepared, and certain <I>others</I> with them.
 &nbsp; 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
 &nbsp; 3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord
 Jesus.
 &nbsp; 4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,
 behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
 &nbsp; 5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down <I>their</I> faces to the
 earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the
 dead?
 &nbsp; 6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you
 when he was yet in Galilee,
 &nbsp; 7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of
 sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
 &nbsp; 8 And they remembered his words,
 &nbsp; 9 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things
 unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
 &nbsp; 10 It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary <I>the mother</I> of
 James, and other <I>women that were</I> with them, which told these
 things unto the apostles.
 &nbsp; 11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they
 believed them not.
 &nbsp; 12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping
 down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and
 departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The manner of the re-uniting of Christ's soul and body in his 
 resurrection is a mystery, one of the <I>secret things</I> that 
 <I>belong not to us;</I> but the <I>infallible proofs</I> of his 
 resurrection, that he did indeed rise from the dead, and was thereby 
 proved to be the Son of God, are <I>things revealed, which belong to us 
 and to our children.</I> Some of them we have here in these verses, 
 which relate the same story for substance that we had in Matthew and 
 Mark.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here the affection and respect which the good women that had 
 followed Christ showed to him, after he was dead and buried, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 As soon as ever they could, after the sabbath was over, they <I>came to 
 the sepulchre,</I> to embalm his body, not to take it out of the linen 
 in which Joseph had wrapped it, but to anoint the head and face, and 
 perhaps the wounded hands and feet, and to scatter sweet spices upon 
 and about the body; as it is usual with us to strew flowers about the 
 dead bodies and graves of our friends, only to show our good-will 
 towards the taking off the deformity of death if we could, and to make 
 them somewhat the less loathsome to those that are about them. The zeal 
 of these good women for Christ did continue. The spices which they had 
 prepared the evening before the sabbath, at a great expense, they did 
 not, upon second thoughts, when they had slept upon it, dispose of 
 otherwise, suggesting, <I>To what purpose is this waste?</I> but they 
 brought them to the sepulchre on the morning after the sabbath, early, 
 very early. It is a rule of charity, <I>Every man, according as he 
 purposes in his heart, so let him give,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:7">2 Cor. ix. 7</A>.

 What is prepared for Christ, let it be used for him. Notice is taken of
 the names of these women, <I>Mary Magdalene,</I> and <I>Joanna,</I> and 
 <I>Mary</I> the mother of James; grave matronly women, it should seem, 
 they were. Notice is also taken of certain others with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>,
 
 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 These, who had not joined in preparing the spices, would yet go along
 with them to the sepulchre; as if the number of Christ's friends 
 increased when he was dead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:24,32">John xii. 24, 32</A>.

 The daughters of Jerusalem, when they saw how inquisitive the souse was 
 after her Beloved, were desirous to seek him with her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:1">Cant. vi. 1</A>),

 so were these <I>other women.</I> The zeal of some provokes others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The surprise they were in, when they found the stone rolled away 
 and the grave empty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>);
 
 they were <I>much perplexed</I> at that
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 which they had much reason to rejoice in, that <I>the stone was rolled 
 away from the sepulchre</I> (by which it appeared that he had a legal 
 discharge, and leave to come out), and that they <I>found not the body 
 of the Lord Jesus,</I> by which it appeared that he had made us of his 
 discharge and was come out. Note, Good Christians often perplex 
 themselves about that with which they should comfort and encourage 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The plain account which they had of Christ's resurrection from two 
 angels, who appeared to them <I>in shining garments,</I> not only 
 white, but bright, and casting a lustre about them. They first saw 
 <I>one</I> angel without the sepulchre, who presently <I>went in,</I> 
 and sat with another angel in the sepulchre, <I>one at the head and the 
 other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain;</I> so the 
 evangelists may be reconciled. The women, when they saw the angels, 
 <I>were afraid</I> lest they had some ill news for them; but, instead 
 of enquiring of them, they <I>bowed down their faces to the earth,</I> 
 to look for their dear Master in the grave. They would rather find him 
 in his <I>grave-clothes</I> than angels themselves in their <I>shining 
 garments.</I> A dying Jesus has more beauty in the eyes of a believer 
 than angels themselves. These women, like the spouse, when found by the 
 watchman (and angels are called <I>watchers</I>), enter not into any 
 other conversation with them than this, <I>Saw ye him whom my soul 
 loveth?</I> Now here, 

 1. They upbraid the women with the absurdity of the search they were
 making: <I>Why seek ye the living among the dead?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Witness is hereby given to Christ that he is <I>living,</I> of him 
 <I>it is witnessed that he liveth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:8">Heb. vii. 8</A>),
 
 and it is the comfort of all the saints, <I>I know that my Redeemer 
 liveth;</I> for because he lives we shall live also. But a reproof is 
 given to those that look for him <I>among the dead,</I>--that look for
 him among the dead heroes that the Gentiles worshipped, as if he were 
 but like one of them,--that look for him in an image, or a crucifix, the
 work of men's hands, or among unwritten tradition and the inventions of 
 men; and indeed all they that expect happiness and satisfaction in the 
 creature, or perfection in this imperfect state, may be said to <I>seek 
 the living among the dead.</I> 

 2. They assure them that he is risen from the dead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>He is not here, but is risen,</I> is risen by his own power; he has 
 quitted his grace, to return no more to it." These angels were 
 competent witnesses, for they had been sent express from heaven with 
 orders for his discharge. And we are sure that their record is true; 
 they durst not tell a lie. 

 3. They refer them to his own words: <I>Remember what he spoke to you,
 when he was yet in Galilee.</I> If they had duly believed and observed 
 the prediction of it, they would easily have believed the thing itself 
 when it came to pass; and therefore, that the tidings might not be such 
 a surprise to them and they seemed to be, the angels repeat to them 
 what Christ had often said in their hearing, <I>The Son of man must be 
 delivered into the hands of sinful men,</I> and though it was done by 
 the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, yet they that did it 
 were not the less <I>sinful</I> for doing it. He told them that he 
 <I>must be crucified.</I> Surely they could not forget that which they 
 had with so much concern seen fulfilled; and would not this bring to 
 their mind that which always followed, <I>The third day he shall rise 
 again?</I> Observe, These angels from heaven bring not any <I>new 
 gospel,</I> but put them in mind, as the angels of the churches do, of 
 the sayings of Christ, and teach them how to improve and apply 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Their satisfaction in this account, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The women seemed to acquiesce; they <I>remembered his words,</I> when 
 they were thus put in mind of them, and thence concluded that if he was 
 risen it was not more than they had reason to expect; and now they were 
 ashamed of the preparations they had made to embalm on the third day 
 <I>him</I> who had often said that he would on the third day rise 
 again. Note, A seasonable remembrance of the words of Christ will help 
 us to a right understanding of his providence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The report they brought of this to the apostles: <I>They returned 
 from the sepulchre, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all 
 the rest</I> of Christ's disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It does not appear that they were together in a body; they were 
 <I>scattered every one to his own,</I> perhaps scarcely two or three of 
 them together in the same lodgings, but one went to some of them and 
 another to others of them, so that in a little time, that morning, they 
 all had notice of it. But we are told

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 how the report was received: <I>Their words seemed to them as idle 
 tales, and they believed them not.</I> They thought it was only the 
 fancy of the women, and imputed it to the power of imagination; for 
 they also had forgotten Christ's words, and wanted to be put in mind of 
 them, not only what he had said to them in Galilee some time ago, but 
 what he had said very lately, in the night wherein he was betrayed: 
 <I>Again a little while, and ye shall see me. I will see you again.</I> 
 One cannot but be amazed at the stupidity of these disciples,--who had 
 themselves so often professed that they believed Christ to be the Son 
 of God and the true Messiah, had been so often told that he must die 
 and rise again, and then enter into his glory, had seen him more than 
 once raise the dead,--that they should be so backward to believe in his 
 raising himself. Surely it would seem the less strange to them, when 
 hereafter this complaint would justly be taken up <I>by them,</I> to 
 remember that there was a time when it might justly have been taken up 
 against them, <I>Who hath believed our report?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The enquiry which Peter made hereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It was Mary Magdalene that brought the report to him, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:1,2">John xx. 1, 2</A>,

 where this story of his running to the sepulchre is more particularly 
 related. 

 1. Peter hastened to the sepulchre upon the report, perhaps ashamed of
 himself, to think that Mary Magdalene should have been there before 
 him; and yet, perhaps, he had not been so ready to go thither now if 
 the women had not told him, among other things, that <I>the watch was 
 fled.</I> Many that are <I>swift-footed</I> enough when there is no 
 danger are but <I>cow-hearted</I> when there is. Peter now <I>ran to 
 the sepulchre,</I> who but the other day <I>ran from his Master.</I> 

 2. He looked into the sepulchre, and took notice how orderly the linen
 clothes in which Christ was wrapped were taken off, and folded up, and 
 laid by themselves, but the body gone. He was very particular in making 
 his observations, as if he would rather credit his own eyes than the 
 testimony of the angels. 

 3. He went away, as he thought, not much the wiser, <I>wondering in
 himself at that which was come to pass.</I> Had he remembered the words 
 of Christ, even this was enough to satisfy him that he was risen from 
 the dead; but, having forgotten them, he is only amazed with the thing, 
 and knows not what to make of it. There is many a thing puzzling and 
 perplexing to us which would be both plain and profitable if we did but 
 rightly understand the words of Christ, and had them ready to us.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village
 called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem <I>about</I> threescore
 furlongs.
 &nbsp; 14 And they talked together of all these things which had
 happened.
 &nbsp; 15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed <I>together</I>
 and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
 &nbsp; 16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
 &nbsp; 17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications <I>are</I>
 these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
 &nbsp; 18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said
 unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not
 known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
 &nbsp; 19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him,
 Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed
 and word before God and all the people:
 &nbsp; 20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
 condemned to death, and have crucified him.
 &nbsp; 21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have
 redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day
 since these things were done.
 &nbsp; 22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us
 astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
 &nbsp; 23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that
 they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was
 alive.
 &nbsp; 24 And certain of them which were with us went to the
 sepulchre, and found <I>it</I> even so as the women had said: but him
 they saw not.
 &nbsp; 25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to
 believe all that the prophets have spoken:
 &nbsp; 26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter
 into his glory?
 &nbsp; 27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded
 unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
 &nbsp; 28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and
 he made as though he would have gone further.
 &nbsp; 29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
 toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry
 with them.
 &nbsp; 30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took
 bread, and blessed <I>it,</I> and brake, and gave to them.
 &nbsp; 31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he
 vanished out of their sight.
 &nbsp; 32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within
 us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us
 the scriptures?
 &nbsp; 33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem,
 and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with
 them,
 &nbsp; 34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to
 Simon.
 &nbsp; 35 And they told what things <I>were done</I> in the way, and how he
 was known of them in breaking of bread.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This appearance of Christ to the <I>two disciples</I> going to Emmaus 
 was mentioned, and but just mentioned, before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:12">Mark xvi. 12</A>);

 here it is largely related. It happened the same day that Christ rose, 
 the first day of the new world that rose with him. One of these two
 disciples was <I>Cleopas</I> or <I>Alpheus,</I> said by the ancients to
 be the brother of Joseph, Christ's supposed father; who the other was 
 is not certain. Some think it was Peter; it should seem indeed that 
 Christ did appear particularly to Peter that day, which the eleven 
 spoke of among themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),
 
 and Paul mentions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:5">1 Cor. xv. 5</A>.

 But it could not be Peter that was one of the <I>two,</I> for he was 
 one of the <I>eleven</I> to whom the <I>two</I> returned; and, besides, 
 we know Peter so well as to think that if he had been one of the two he 
 would have been the <I>chief speaker,</I> and not Cleopas. It was one 
 of those that were associated with the eleven, mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Now in this passage of story we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>walk</I> and <I>talk</I> of these two disciples: <I>They went 
 to a village called Emmaus,</I> which is reckoned to be about two 
 hours' walk from Jerusalem; it is here said to be about sixty furlongs, 
 seven measured miles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Whether they went thither upon business, or to see some friend, does 
 not appear. I suspect that they were going homewards to Galilee, with 
 an intention not to enquire more after this Jesus; that they were 
 meditating a retreat, and stole away from their company without asking 
 leave or taking leave; for the accounts brought them that morning of 
 their Master's resurrection seemed to them <I>as idle tales;</I> and, 
 if so, no wonder that they began to think of making the best of their 
 way home. But as they travelled they <I>talked together of all those 
 things which had happened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They had not courage to <I>confer</I> of these things, and 
 <I>consult</I> what was to be done in the present juncture at 
 Jerusalem, for fear of the Jews; but, when they were got out of the 
 hearing of the Jews, they could talk it over with more freedom. They 
 <I>talked over these things,</I> reasoning with themselves concerning 
 the probabilities of Christ's resurrection; for, according as these 
 appeared, they would either go forward or return back to Jerusalem. 
 Note, It well becomes the disciples of Christ, when they are together, 
 to talk of his death and resurrection; thus they may improve one 
 another's knowledge, refresh one another's memory, and stir up one 
 another's devout affections.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The good company they met with upon the road, when Jesus himself 
 came, and joined himself to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>They communed together, and reasoned,</I> and perhaps were warm at 
 the argument, one hoping that their Master was risen, and would set up 
 his kingdom, the other despairing. <I>Jesus himself drew near,</I> as a 
 stranger who, seeing them travel the same way that he <I>went,</I> told 
 them that he should be <I>glad of their company.</I> We may observe it, 
 for our encouragement to keep up Christian conference and edifying 
 discourse among us, that where but two together are well employed in 
 work of that kind Christ will come to them, and make a third. When they 
 that fear the Lord <I>speak one to another</I> the Lord <I>hearkens and 
 hears,</I> and is with them of a truth; so that two thus twisted in 
 faith and love become a <I>threefold cord, not easily broken,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:12">Eccl. iv. 12</A>.

 They in their communings and reasonings together were searching for
 Christ, comparing notes concerning him, that they might come to more 
 knowledge of him; and now Christ comes to them. Note, They who seek 
 Christ shall find him: he will manifest himself to those that enquire 
 after him, and give knowledge to those who use the helps for knowledge 
 which they have. When the spouse enquired of the watchman concerning 
 her beloved, <I>it was but a little that she passed from them, but she 
 found him.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:4">Cant. iii. 4</A>.

 But, though they had Christ with them, they were not at first aware of
 it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Their eyes were held, that they should not know him.</I> It should
 seem, there were both an alteration of the <I>object</I> (for it is 
 said in Mark that now <I>he appeared in another form</I>) and a 
 restraint upon the organ (for here it is said that <I>their eyes were 
 held</I> by a divine power); or, as some think, there was a confusion 
 in the <I>medium;</I> the air was so disposed that they could not 
 discern who it was. No matter <I>how</I> it was, but <I>so</I> it was 
 they did not <I>know him,</I> Christ so ordering it that they might the 
 more freely discourse with him and he with them, and that it might 
 appear that his word, and the influence of it, did not depend upon his 
 bodily presence, which the disciples had too much doted upon, and must 
 be weaned from; but he could teach them, and warm their hearts, by 
 others, who should have his spiritual presence with them, and should 
 have his grace going along with them unseen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The conference that was between Christ and them, when he knew 
 them, and they knew not him. Now Christ and his disciples, as is usual 
 when friends meet incognito, or in a disguise, are here crossing 
 questions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ's first question to them is concerning <I>their</I> present 
 <I>sadness,</I> which plainly appeared in their countenances: <I>What 
 manner of communications are those that you have one with another as 
 you walk, and are sad?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It is a very kind and friendly enquiry. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They were <I>sad;</I> it appeared to a stranger that they were so. 
 
 [1.] They had lost their dear Master, and were, in their own
 apprehensions, quite disappointed in their expectations from him. They 
 had given up the cause, and knew not what course to take to retrieve 
 it. Note, Christ's disciples have reason to be sad when he withdraws 
 from them, to <I>fast</I> when the <I>Bridegroom</I> is taken from 
 them. 

 [2.] Though he was risen from the dead, yet either they did not know it 
 or did not believe it, and so they were still in sorrow. Note, Christ's 
 disciples are often sad and sorrowful even when they have reason to 
 rejoice, but through the weakness of their faith they cannot take the 
 comfort that is offered to them.

 [3.] Being sad, they had <I>communications one with another</I>
 concerning Christ. Note, <I>First,</I> It becomes Christians to talk of 
 Christ. Were our hearts as full of him, and of what he has done and 
 suffered for us, as they should be, <I>out of the abundance of the 
 heart the mouth would speak,</I> not only of God and his providence, 
 but of Christ and his grace and love. <I>Secondly,</I> Good company and 
 good converse are an excellent antidote against prevailing melancholy. 
 When Christ's disciples were sad they did not each one get by himself, 
 but continued as he sent them out, two and two, for two are better than 
 one, especially in times of sorrow. Giving <I>vent</I> to the grief may 
 perhaps give <I>ease</I> to the grieved; and by talking it over we may 
 talk ourselves or our friends may talk us into a better frame. Joint 
 mourners should be mutual comforters; comforts sometimes come best from 
 such.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ came up to them, and enquired into the matter of their 
 talk, and the cause of their grief: <I>What manner of communications 
 are these?</I> Though Christ had now entered into his state of 
 exaltation, yet he continued tender of his disciples, and concerned for 
 their comfort. He speaks as one troubled to see their melancholy: 
 <I>Wherefore look ye so sadly to-day?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+40:7">Gen. xl. 7</A>.

 Note, Our Lord Jesus takes notice of the sorrow and sadness of his
 disciples, and is afflicted in their afflictions. Christ has hereby
 taught us,

 [1.] To be <I>conversable.</I> Christ here fell into discourse with two 
 grave serious persons, though he was a stranger to them and they knew 
 him not, and they readily embraced him. It does not become Christians 
 to be morose and shy, but to take pleasure in good society. 

 [2.] We are hereby taught to be <I>compassionate.</I> When we see our 
 friends in sorrow and sadness, we should, like Christ here, take 
 cognizance of their grief, and give them the best counsel and comfort 
 we can: <I>Weep with them that weep.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In answer to this, they put a question to him concerning <I>his 
 strangeness. Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known 
 the things that are come to pass there in these days?</I> Observe, 

 (1.) Cleopas gave him a civil answer. He does not rudely ask him. "As 
 for what we are talking of, what is that to you?" and bid him go about 
 his business. Note, We ought to be civil to those who are civil to us, 
 and to conduct ourselves obligingly to all, both in word and deed. It 
 was a dangerous time now with Christ's disciples; yet he was not 
 jealous of this stranger, that he had any design upon them, to inform 
 against them, or bring them into trouble. Charity is not forward to 
 <I>think evil,</I> no, not of strangers. 

 (2.) He is full of Christ himself and of his death and sufferings, and 
 wonders that every body else is not so too: "What! art thou such a 
 stranger in Jerusalem as not to know what has been done to our Master 
 there?" Note, Those are strangers indeed in Jerusalem that know not of 
 the death and sufferings of Christ. What! are they <I>daughters of
 Jerusalem,</I> and yet so little acquainted with Christ as to ask, 
 <I>What is thy beloved more than another beloved?</I> 

 (3.) He is very willing to inform this stranger concerning Christ, and 
 to draw on further discourse with him upon this subject. He would not 
 have any one that had the face of a man to be ignorant of Christ. Note, 
 Those who have themselves the knowledge of Christ crucified should do 
 what they can to spread that knowledge, and lead others into an 
 acquaintance with him. And it is observable that these disciples, who 
 were so forward to instruct the stranger, were instructed by him; for 
 to him that has, and uses what he has, shall be given. 

 (4.) It appears, by what Cleopas says, that the death of Christ made a 
 great noise in Jerusalem, so that it could not be imagined that any man 
 should be such a stranger in the city as not to know of it; it was all 
 the talk of the town, and discoursed of in all companies. Thus the 
 matter of fact came to be universally <I>known,</I> which, after the 
 pouring out of the Spirit, was to be <I>explained.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ, by way of reply, asked concerning <I>their knowledge</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>He said unto them, What things?</I> thus making himself yet more a 
 stranger. Observe, 

 (1.) Jesus Christ made light of his own sufferings, in comparison with 
 the joy set before him, which was the recompence of it. Now that he was 
 entering upon his glory, see with what unconcernedness he looks back 
 upon his sufferings: <I>What things?</I> He had reason to know what 
 things; for to him they were bitter things, and heavy things, and yet 
 he asks, <I>What things?</I> The sorrow was forgotten, for joy that the 
 man-child of our salvation was born. He took pleasure in infirmities 
 for our sakes, to teach us to do so for his sake. 

 (2.) Those whom Christ will teach he will first examine how far they 
 have learned; they must tell him <I>what things</I> they know, and then 
 he will tell them what was the meaning of these things. and lead them 
 into the mystery of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They, hereupon, gave him a particular account concerning Christ, and 
 the present posture of his affairs. Observe the story they tell, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is a summary of Christ's <I>life</I> and <I>character.</I> 
 The <I>things</I> they are full of are concerning <I>Jesus of 
 Nazareth</I> (so he was commonly called), who <I>was a prophet,</I> a 
 teacher come from God. He preached a true and excellent doctrine, which 
 had manifestly its rise from heaven, and its tendency towards heaven. 
 He confirmed it by many glorious miracles, miracles of mercy, so that 
 he was <I>mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</I> 
 that is, he was both a great favourite of heaven and a great blessing 
 to this earth. He was, and appeared to be, greatly beloved of God, and 
 much the darling of his people. He had great acceptance with God, and a 
 great reputation in the country. Many are <I>great before all the 
 people,</I> and are caressed by them, who are not so <I>before God,</I> 
 as the scribes and Pharisees; but Christ was mighty both in his 
 <I>doctrine</I> and in his <I>doings, before God and all the 
 people.</I> Those were strangers in Jerusalem that did not know 
 this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is a modest narrative of his sufferings and death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 "Though he was so dear both to God and man, yet the <I>chief priests 
 and our rulers,</I> in contempt of both, <I>delivered him</I> to the 
 Roman power, <I>to be condemned to death,</I> and <I>they have 
 crucified him.</I>" It is strange that they did not aggravate the 
 matter more, and lay a greater load upon those that had been guilty of 
 crucifying Christ; but perhaps because they spoke to one that was a 
 stranger they thought it prudent to avoid all reflections upon the 
 chief priests and their rulers, how just soever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Here is an intimation of their disappointment in him, as the 
 reason of their sadness: "<I>We trusted that it had been he who should 
 have redeemed Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 We are of those who not only looked upon him to be a prophet, like 
 Moses, but, like him, a redeemer too." He was depended upon, and great 
 things expected from him, by them that <I>looked for redemption,</I> 
 and in it for the consolation of Israel. Now, if <I>hope deferred
 makes the heart sick,</I> hope disappointed, especially such a hope, 
 kills the heart. But see how they made that the ground of their despair 
 which if they had understood it aright was the surest ground of their 
 hope, and that was the dying of the Lord Jesus: <I>We trusted</I> (say 
 they) <I>that it had been he that should have redeemed Israel.</I> And 
 is it not he that doth redeem Israel? Nay, is he not by his death 
 paying the price of their redemption? Was it not necessary, in order to 
 his saving Israel from their sins, that he should suffer? Sop that now, 
 since that most difficult part of his undertaking was got over, they 
 had more reason than ever to <I>trust</I> that <I>this was he that 
 should deliver Israel;</I> yet now they are ready to give up the 
 cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Here is an account of their present amazement with reference to 
 his resurrection. 

 [1.] "<I>This is the third day</I> since he was crucified and died, and 
 that was the day when it was expected, if ever, that he should rise 
 again, and rise in glory and outward pomp, and show himself as publicly 
 in honour as he had been shown three days before in disgrace; but we 
 see no sign of it; nothing appears, as we expected, to the conviction 
 and confusion of his prosecutors, and the consolation of his disciples, 
 but all is silent." 

 [2.] They own that there was a report among them that he was risen, but 
 they seem to speak of it very slightly, and as what they gave no credit 
 at all to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>):

 "<I>Certain women also of our company made us astonished</I> (and that
 was all), who were <I>early at the sepulchre,</I> and found the body 
 gone, and they said that they had <I>seen a vision of angels, who said 
 that he was alive;</I> but we are ready to think it was only their 
 fancy, and no real thing, for angels would have been sent to the 
 apostles, not to the women, and women are easily imposed upon."

 [3.] They acknowledge that some of the apostles had visited the 
 sepulchre, and found it empty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 "But <I>him they saw not,</I> and therefore we have reason to fear that 
 he <I>is not risen,</I> for, if he be, surely he would have <I>shown 
 himself</I> to them; so that, upon the whole matter, we have no great 
 reason to think that he is risen, and therefore have no expectations 
 from him now; our hopes were all nailed to his cross, and buried in his 
 grave."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Our Lord Jesus, though not known by face to them, makes himself 
 known to them by his word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He reproves them for their incogitancy, and the weakness of their 
 faith in the scriptures of the Old Testament: <I>O fools, and slow of 
 heart to believe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 When Christ forbade us to say to our brother, <I>Thou fool,</I> it was 
 intended to restrain us from giving unreasonable reproaches, not from 
 giving just reproofs. Christ called them <I>fools,</I> not as it 
 signifies <I>wicked men,</I> in which sense he forbade it to us, but as 
 it signifies <I>weak men.</I> He might call them <I>fools,</I> for he 
 <I>knows our foolishness,</I> the foolishness that is bound in our 
 hearts. Those are fools that act against their own interest; so they 
 did who would not admit the evidence given them that their Master was 
 risen, but put away the comfort of it. That which is condemned in them
 as their <I>foolishness</I> is, <I>First,</I> Their <I>slowness to 
 believe.</I> Believers are branded as fools by atheists, and infidels, 
 and free-thinkers, and their most holy faith is censured as a fond 
 credulity; but Christ tells us that those are <I>fools</I> who are 
 <I>slow of heart to believe,</I> and are kept from it by prejudices 
 never impartially examined. <I>Secondly,</I> Their slowness to believe 
 <I>the writings of the prophets.</I> He does not so much blame them for 
 their slowness to believe the testimony of the women and of the angels, 
 but for that which was the cause thereof, their <I>slowness to 
 believe</I> the prophets; for, if they had given the prophets of the 
 Old Testament their due weight and consideration, they would have been 
 as sure of Christ's <I>rising from the dead</I> that morning (being the 
 third day after his death) as they were of the <I>rising of the 
 sun;</I> for the <I>series</I> and <I>succession</I> of events as 
 settled by <I>prophecy</I> are no less certain and inviolable than as 
 settled by <I>providence.</I> Were we but more <I>conversant</I> with 
 the scripture, and the divine counsels as far as they are made known in 
 the scripture, we should not be subject to such perplexities as we 
 often <I>entangle</I> ourselves in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He shows them that the sufferings of Christ, which were such a 
 stumbling-block to them, and made them unapt to believe his glory, were 
 really the appointed way to his glory, and he could not go to it any 
 other way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>Ought not the Christ</I> (the Messiah) to <I>have suffered these
 things, and to enter into his glory?</I> Was it not decreed, and was 
 not that decree <I>declared,</I> that the promised Messiah must first 
 suffer and then reign, that he must go by his cross to his crown?" Had 
 they never read the fifty-third of Isaiah and the ninth of Daniel, 
 where the prophets speak so very plainly of the <I>sufferings of 
 Christ</I> and the <I>glory that should follow?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11">1 Pet. i. 11</A>.

 The cross of Christ was that to which they could not reconcile
 themselves; now here he shows them two things which take off the 
 offence of the cross:--<I>First,</I> That the Messiah <I>ought to 
 suffer</I> these things; and therefore his sufferings were not only no 
 objection against his being the Messiah, but really a proof of it, as 
 the afflictions of the saints are an evidence of their sonship; and 
 they were so far from ruining their expectations that really they were 
 the foundation of their hopes. He could not have been a <I>Saviour,</I> 
 if he had not been a <I>sufferer.</I> Christ's undertaking our 
 salvation was voluntary; but, having undertaken it, it was necessary 
 that he should suffer and die. <I>Secondly,</I> That, when he had 
 suffered these things, he should <I>enter into his glory,</I> which he 
 did at his resurrection; that was his first step upward. Observe, It is 
 called <I>his</I> glory, because he was <I>duly entitled</I> to it, and 
 it was the glory he had before the world was; he <I>ought</I> to enter 
 into it, for in that, as well as in his sufferings, the scripture must 
 be fulfilled. He <I>ought</I> to suffer first, and then to enter into 
 his glory; and thus the <I>reproach</I> of the cross is for ever 
 <I>rolled away,</I> and we are directed to expect the crown of 
 <I>thorns</I> and then that of <I>glory.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] He expounded to them the scriptures of the Old Testament, which 
 spoke of the Messiah, and showed them how they were fulfilled in Jesus 
 of Nazareth, and now can tell them more concerning him than they could 
 before tell him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>Beginning at Moses,</I> the first inspired writer of the Old 
 Testament, he went in order through <I>all the prophets,</I> and 
 <I>expounded to them the things concerning himself,</I> showing that 
 the sufferings he had now gone through were so far from defeating the 
 prophecies of the scripture concerning him that they were the 
 accomplishment of them. He began at Moses, who recorded the first 
 promise, in which it was plainly foretold that the Messiah should have 
 his <I>heel bruised,</I> but that by it the serpent's head should be 
 incurably broken. Note, <I>First,</I> There are things dispersed 
 throughout <I>all the scriptures</I> concerning Christ, which it is of 
 great advantage to have <I>collected</I> and <I>put together.</I> You 
 cannot go far in any part of scripture but you meet with something that 
 has reference to Christ, some prophecy, some promise, some prayer, some 
 type or other; for he is the true <I>treasure his in the field</I> of 
 the Old Testament. A golden thread of gospel grace runs through the 
 whole web of the Old Testament. There is an <I>eye</I> of that 
 <I>white</I> to be discerned in every place. <I>Secondly,</I> The
 things concerning Christ need to be <I>expounded.</I> The eunuch, 
 though a scholar, would not pretend to understand them, <I>except some 
 man should guide him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:31">Acts viii. 31</A>);

 for they were delivered darkly, according to that dispensation: but now 
 that the veil is taken away the New Testament expounds the Old.
 <I>Thirdly,</I> Jesus Christ is himself the best expositor of 
 scripture, particularly the scriptures concerning himself; and even 
 after his resurrection it was in this way that he led people into the 
 knowledge of the mystery concerning himself; not by advancing new 
 notions independent upon the scripture, but by showing how the 
 scripture was fulfilled, and turning them over to the study of it. Even 
 the Apocalypse itself is but a second part of the Old-Testament 
 prophecies, and has continually an eye to them. <I>If men believe not 
 Moses and the prophets,</I> they are incurable. <I>Fourthly,</I> In
 <I>studying</I> the scriptures, it is good to be <I>methodical,</I> and 
 to take them in order; for the Old-Testament light shone 
 <I>gradually</I> to the <I>perfect day,</I> and it is good to observe 
 how <I>at sundry times,</I> and in <I>divers manners</I> (subsequent 
 predictions improving and giving light to the preceding ones), God 
 spoke to the fathers <I>concerning</I> his Son, by whom he has now 
 <I>spoken</I> to us. Some begin their bible at the wrong end, who study 
 the Revelation first; but Christ has here taught us to <I>begin at 
 Moses.</I> Thus far the conference between them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is the discovery which Christ at length made of himself to 
 them. One would have given a great deal for a copy of the sermon Christ 
 preached to them by the way, of that exposition of the bible which he 
 gave them; but it is not thought fit that we should have it, we have 
 the substance of it in other scriptures. The disciples are so charmed 
 with it, that they think they are come too soon to their journey's end; 
 but so it is: <I>They drew nigh to the village whither they went</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 where, it should seem, they determined to <I>take up</I> for that 
 night. And now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They courted his stay with them: <I>He made as though he would have 
 gone further;</I> he did not <I>say</I> that he would, but he seemed to 
 them to be going further, and did not readily turn into their friend's 
 house, which it would not be decent for a stranger to do unless he were 
 invited. He would have gone further if they had not courted his stay; 
 so that here was nothing like dissimulation in the case. If a stranger 
 be <I>shy,</I> every one knows the meaning of it; he will not thrust 
 himself <I>rudely</I> upon your house or company; but, if you make it 
 appear that you are freely desirous of him for your guest or companion, 
 he knows not but he may accept your invitation, and this was all that 
 Christ did when he <I>made as though he would have gone further.</I> 
 Note, Those that would have Christ dwell with them must invite him, and 
 be importunate with him; though he is often <I>found of those that seek 
 him not,</I> yet those only that <I>seek</I> can be sure to 
 <I>find;</I> and, if he seem to <I>draw off</I> from us, it is but to 
 draw out our importunity; as here, <I>they constrained him;</I> both of 
 them laid hold on him, with a kind and friendly violence, saying, 
 <I>Abide with us.</I> Note, Those that have experienced the pleasure 
 and profit of communion with Christ cannot but covet more of his 
 company, and beg of him, not only to <I>walk with them</I> all day, but 
 to <I>abide with them</I> at night. When <I>the day is far spent,</I> 
 and it is <I>towards evening,</I> we begin to think of retiring for our 
 repose, and then it is proper to have our eye to Christ, and to beg of 
 him to <I>abide with us,</I> to manifest himself to us and to fill our 
 minds with good thoughts of him and good affections to him. Christ 
 yielded to their importunity: He <I>went in, to tarry with them.</I> 
 Thus ready is Christ to give further instructions and comforts to those 
 who improve what they have received. He has promised that <I>if any man 
 open the door,</I> to bid him welcome, he will <I>come in to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He manifested himself to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>.

 We may suppose that he continued his discourse with them, which he 
 began upon the road; for thou must talk of the things of God <I>when 
 thou sittest in the house as well as when thou walkest by the way.</I> 
 While supper was getting ready (which perhaps was soon done, the 
 provision was so small and mean), it is probable that he entertained 
 them with such communications as were <I>good</I> and <I>to the use of 
 edifying;</I> and so likewise as they <I>sat at meat</I> his <I>lips 
 fed</I> them. But still they little thought that it was Jesus himself 
 that was all this while talking with them, till at length he was 
 pleased to throw off his disguise, and then to withdraw.

 (1.) They began to suspect it was he, when, as they <I>sat down to 
 meat,</I> he undertook the office of the Master of the feast, which he 
 performed so like himself, and like what he used to do among his 
 disciples, that by it they discerned him: <I>He took bread, and blessed 
 it,</I> and <I>brake, and gave to them.</I> This he did with his usual 
 air both of authority and affection, with the same gestures and mien, 
 with the same expressions perhaps in craving a blessing and in giving 
 the bread to them. This was not a <I>miraculous</I> meal like that of 
 the five loaves, nor a <I>sacramental</I> meal like that of the 
 eucharist, but a <I>common</I> meal; yet Christ here did the same as he 
 did in those, to teach us to keep up our communion with God through 
 Christ in common providences as well as in special ordinances, and to 
 crave a blessing and give thanks at every meal, and to see our daily 
 bread provided for us and broken to us by the hand of Jesus Christ, the 
 Master, not only of the great family, but of all our families. Wherever 
 we <I>sit down to eat,</I> let us set Christ at the upper end of the 
 table, take our meat as <I>blessed to us</I> by him, and <I>eat and 
 drink</I> to his glory, and receive contentedly and thankfully what he 
 is pleased to <I>carve</I> out to us, be the fare ever so coarse and 
 mean. We may well receive it cheerfully, if we can by faith see it 
 coming to us <I>from</I> Christ's hand, and with his blessing. 

 (2.) Presently <I>their eyes were opened,</I> and then they saw who it 
 was, and <I>knew him</I> well enough. Whatever it was which had 
 hitherto concealed him from them, it was now taken out of the way; the 
 mists were scattered, the veil was taken off, and then they made no 
 question but it was their Master. He might, for wise and holy ends, put 
 on the shape of another, but no other could put on his; and therefore 
 it must be he. See how Christ by his Spirit and grace makes himself 
 known to the souls of his people.

 [1.] He opens the scriptures to them, for they are they which testify 
 of him to those who <I>search them,</I> and search for him in them. 
 
 [2.] He meets them at his table, in the ordinance of the Lord's supper, 
 and commonly there makes further discoveries of himself to them, is 
 <I>known to them in the breaking of bread.</I> But, 

 [3.] The work is completed by the opening of the eyes of their mind, 
 and causing the scales to fall off from them, as from Paul's in his 
 conversion. If he that gives the revelation do not give the 
 understanding, we are in the dark still.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He immediately disappeared: <I>He vanished out of their sight.</I> 
 <B><I>Aphantos egeneto</I></B>--He <I>withdrew himself</I> from them,
 slipped away of a sudden, and went <I>out of sight.</I> Or, he 
 <I>became not visible by them,</I> was made inconspicuous by them. It 
 should seem that though Christ's body, after his resurrection, was the 
 very <I>same body</I> in which he suffered and died, as appeared by the 
 marks in it, yet it was so far changed as to become either 
 <I>visible</I> or <I>not visible</I> as he thought fit to make it, 
 which was a step towards its being made a <I>glorious body.</I> As soon 
 as he had given his disciples one glimpse of him he was gone presently. 
 Such short and transient views have we of Christ in this world; we see 
 him, but in a little while lose the sight of him again. When we come to 
 heaven the vision of him will have no interruptions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is the reflection which these disciples made upon this 
 conference, and the report which they made of it to their brethren at 
 Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The reflection they each of them made upon the influence which 
 Christ's discourse had upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>They said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us?</I> "I 
 am sure mine did," saith one; "And so did mine," saith the other, "I 
 never was so affected with any discourse in all my life." Thus do they 
 not so much compare <I>notes</I> as compare <I>hearts,</I> in the 
 review of the sermon Christ had preached to them. They found the 
 preaching powerful, even when they knew not the preacher. It made 
 things very plain and clear to them; and, which was more, brought a 
 <I>divine heat</I> with a <I>divine light</I> into their souls, such as 
 put their hearts into a glow, and kindled a holy fire of pious and 
 devout affections in them. Now this they take notice of, for the
 confirming of their belief, that it was indeed, as at last they saw, 
 <I>Jesus himself</I> that had been talking with them all along. "What 
 fools were we, that we were not sooner aware who it was! For none but 
 he, no word but his, could <I>make our hearts burn within us</I> as 
 they did; it must be he that has the key of the heart; it could be no 
 other." See here, 

 (1.) What <I>preaching</I> is likely to <I>do good</I>--such as 
 Christ's was, <I>plain preaching,</I> and that which is familiar and 
 level to our capacity--<I>he talked with us by the way;</I> and
 <I>scriptural</I> preaching--<I>he opened to us the scriptures,</I> the 
 scriptures relating to himself. Ministers should show people their 
 religion in their bibles, and that they preach no other doctrine to 
 them than what is there; they must show that they make that the 
 fountain of their knowledge and the foundation of their faith. Note, 
 The expounding of those scriptures which speak of Christ has a direct 
 tendency to warm the hearts of his disciples, both to quicken and to 
 comfort them. 

 (2.) What <I>hearing</I> is likely to <I>do good</I>--that which makes 
 the <I>heart burn;</I> when we are much affected with the things of 
 God, especially with the love of Christ in dying for us, and have our 
 hearts thereby drawn out in love to him, and drawn up in holy desires 
 and devotions, then our hearts <I>burn within us;</I> when our hearts 
 are raised and elevated, and are as the sparks which <I>fly upwards</I> 
 towards God, and when they are kindled and carried out with a holy zeal 
 and indignation against sin, both in others and in ourselves, and we 
 are in some measure refined and purified from it by the <I>spirit of 
 judgment</I> and the <I>spirit of burning,</I> then we may say, 
 "Through grace our hearts are thus inflamed."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The report they brought of this to their brethren at Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>They rose up the same hour,</I> so transported with joy at the 
 discovery Christ had made of himself to them that they could not stay 
 to make an end of their supper, but returned with all speed to 
 Jerusalem, though it was towards evening. If they had had any thoughts 
 of quitting their relation to Christ, this soon banished all such 
 thoughts out of their mind, and there needed no more to send them back 
 to his flock. It should seem that they intended at least to take up 
 their quarters to-night at Emmaus; but now that they had seen Christ 
 they could not rest till they had brought the good news to the 
 disciples, both for the confirmation of their trembling faith and for 
 the comfort of their sorrowful spirits, with the <I>same comforts 
 wherewith they were comforted of God.</I> Note, It is the duty of those 
 to whom Christ has manifested himself to let others know what he has 
 done for their souls. When thou art converted, instructed, comforted, 
 strengthen thy brethren. These disciples were <I>full</I> of this 
 matter themselves, and must go to their brethren, to give vent to their 
 joys, as well as to give them satisfaction that their Master was risen.
 Observe, 

 (1.) How they found them, just when they came in among them, 
 discoursing on the same subject, and relating another proof of the 
 resurrection of Christ. They found the eleven, and those that were 
 their usual companions, <I>gathered together</I> late in the night, to 
 pray together, it may be, and to consider what was to be done in this 
 juncture; and they found them <I>saying</I> among themselves 
 (<B><I>legontas</I></B> it is the saying of the <I>eleven,</I> not of 
 the <I>two,</I> as is plain by the original), and when these two came 
 in, they repeated to them with joy and triumph, <I>The Lord is risen
 indeed, and hath appeared to Simon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 That Peter had a sight of him before the rest of the disciples had 
 appears

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:5">1 Cor. xv. 5</A>,

 where it is said, <I>He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve.</I> The 
 angel having ordered the women to tell Peter of it particularly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:7">Mark xvi. 7</A>),
 
 for his comfort, it is highly probable that our Lord Jesus did himself 
 presently the same day appear to Peter, though we have no particular 
 narrative of it, to <I>confirm the word of his messengers.</I> This he 
 had related to his brethren; but, observe, Peter does not here proclaim 
 it, and boast of it, himself (he thought this did not become a 
 penitent), but the other disciples speak of it with exultation, <I>The 
 Lord is risen indeed,</I> <B><I>ontos</I></B>--<I>really;</I> it is now 
 past dispute, no room is left to doubt it, for he has appeared not only 
 to the women, but to Simon. 

 (2.) How they seconded their evidence with an account of what they had 
 seen 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>They told what things were done in the way.</I> The words that were 
 spoken by Christ to them in the way, having a wonderful effect and 
 influence upon them, are here called the <I>things</I> that were 
 <I>done in the way;</I> for the words that Christ speaks are not an 
 empty sound, but <I>they are spirit and they are life,</I> and wondrous 
 things are <I>done</I> by them, done <I>by the way,</I> by the by as it 
 were, where it is not expected. They told also how he was at length
 <I>known to them in the breaking of bread;</I> then, when he was 
 carving out blessings to them, God opened their eyes to discern who it 
 was. Note, It would be of great use for the discovery and confirmation 
 of truth if the disciples of Christ would compare their observations 
 and experiences, and communicate to each other what they know and have 
 felt in themselves.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>36  And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of
 them, and saith unto them, Peace <I>be</I> unto you.
 &nbsp; 37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that
 they had seen a spirit.
 &nbsp; 38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do
 thoughts arise in your hearts?
 &nbsp; 39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me,
 and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me
 have.
 &nbsp; 40 And when he had thus spoken, he showed them <I>his</I> hands and
 <I>his</I> feet.
 &nbsp; 41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he
 said unto them, Have ye here any meat?
 &nbsp; 42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an
 honeycomb.
 &nbsp; 43 And he took <I>it,</I> and did eat before them.
 &nbsp; 44 And he said unto them, These <I>are</I> the words which I spake
 unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be
 fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and <I>in</I> the
 prophets, and <I>in</I> the psalms, concerning me.
 &nbsp; 45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might
 understand the scriptures,
 &nbsp; 46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved
 Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
 &nbsp; 47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached
 in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 48 And ye are witnesses of these things.
 &nbsp; 49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but
 tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power
 from on high.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Five times Christ was seen the same day that he rose: by Mary Magdalene 
 alone in the garden 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:14">John xx. 14</A>),

 by the women as they were going to tell the disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:9">Matt. xxviii. 9</A>),

 by Peter alone, by the two disciples going to Emmaus, and now at night 
 by the eleven, of which we have an account in these verses, as also 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:19">John xx. 19</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great <I>surprise</I> which his appearing gave them. He came in 
 among them very <I>seasonably,</I> as they were comparing notes 
 concerning the proofs of his resurrection: <I>As they thus spoke,</I> 
 and were ready perhaps to <I>put it to the question</I> whether the 
 proofs produced amounted to evidence sufficient of their Master's 
 resurrection or no, and how they should proceed, <I>Jesus himself stood 
 in the midst of them,</I> and <I>put it out of question.</I> Note, 
 Those who make the best use they can of their evidences for their 
 comfort may expect further assurances, and that the <I>Spirit of 
 Christ</I> will <I>witness with their spirits</I> (as Christ here 
 witnessed with the disciples, and confirmed their testimony) that they 
 are the <I>children of God,</I> and risen with Christ. Observe, 

 1. The <I>comfort</I> Christ spoke to them: <I>Peace be unto you.</I>
 This intimates in general that it was a kind visit which Christ now 
 paid them, a visit of love and friendship. Though they had very 
 unkindly deserted him in his sufferings, yet he takes the first 
 opportunity of seeing them together; for he deals not with us as we 
 deserve. They did not <I>credit</I> those who had seen him; therefore 
 he <I>comes himself,</I> that they might not continue in their 
 disconsolate incredulity. He had promised that after his resurrection 
 he <I>would see them in Galilee;</I> but so desirous was he to see 
 them, and satisfy them, that he anticipated the appointment and <I>sees 
 them at Jerusalem.</I> Note, Christ is often <I>better</I> than his 
 word, but never <I>worse.</I> Now his first word to them was, <I>Peace 
 be to you;</I> not in a way of compliment, but of consolation. This was 
 a common form of salutation among the Jews, and Christ would thus 
 express his usual familiarity with them, though he had now entered into 
 his state of exaltation. Many, when they are advanced, forget their old 
 friends and take state upon them; but we see Christ as free with them 
 as ever. Thus Christ would at the first word intimate to them that he 
 did not come to quarrel with Peter for <I>denying</I> him and the rest 
 for <I>running away</I> from him; no, he <I>came peaceably,</I> to 
 signify to them that he had forgiven them, and was reconciled to them.

 2. The <I>fright</I> which they put themselves into upon it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 They were <I>terrified,</I> supposing that <I>they had seen a
 spirit,</I> because he came in among them without any noise, and was in 
 the midst of them ere they were aware. The word used 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:26">Matt. xiv. 26</A>),

 when they said <I>It is a spirit,</I> is <B><I>phantasma</I></B>, it is 
 a <I>spectre,</I> an <I>apparition;</I> but the word here used is 
 <B><I>pneuma</I></B>, the word that properly signifies <I>a spirit;</I> 
 they supposed it to be a spirit not clothed with a real body. Though we 
 have an alliance and correspondence with the world of spirits, and are 
 hastening to it, yet while we are here in this world of sense and 
 matter it is a terror to us to have a spirit so far change its own 
 nature as to become visible to us, and conversable with us, for it is 
 something, and bodes something, very extraordinary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great <I>satisfaction</I> which his discourse gave them, 
 wherein we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The reproof he gave them for their causeless fears: <I>Why are you 
 troubled, and why do</I> frightful <I>thoughts arise in your 
 hearts?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 (1.) That when at any time we are <I>troubled, thoughts</I> are apt to 
 <I>rise in our hearts</I> that do us hurt. Sometimes the <I>trouble</I> 
 is the effect of the <I>thoughts</I> that <I>arise in our hearts;</I> 
 our griefs and fears take rise from those things that are the creatures 
 of our own fancy. Sometimes the thoughts arising in the heart are the
 effect of the trouble, without are fightings and then within are fears. 
 Those that are melancholy and troubled in mind have <I>thoughts arising 
 in their hearts</I> which reflect dishonour upon God, and create 
 disquiet to themselves. <I>I am cut off from thy sight. The Lord has 
 forsaken and forgotten me.</I> 

 (2.) That many of the troublesome thoughts with which our minds are 
 disquieted arise from our mistakes concerning Christ. They here
 thought that they had <I>seen a spirit,</I> when they saw Christ, and 
 that put them into this fright. We forget that Christ is our <I>elder
 brother,</I> and look upon him to be at as great a distance from us as 
 the world of spirits is from this world, and therewith terrify 
 ourselves. When Christ is by his Spirit convincing and humbling us, 
 when he is by his providence trying and converting us, we <I>mistake 
 him,</I> as if he designed our hurt, and this troubles us. 

 (3.) That all the troublesome thoughts which rise in our hearts at any 
 time are known to the Lord Jesus, even at the first rise of them, and 
 they are displeasing to him. He chid his disciples for such 
 <I>thoughts,</I> to teach us to chide ourselves for them. <I>Why art
 thou cast down, O my soul? Why art thou troubled?</I> Why do 
 <I>thoughts arise</I> that are neither <I>true</I> nor <I>good,</I> 
 that have neither <I>foundation</I> nor <I>fruit,</I> but hinder our 
 joy in God, unfit us for our duty, give advantage to Satan, and deprive 
 us of the comforts laid up for us?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The proof he gave them of his resurrection, both for the 
 <I>silencing</I> of their <I>fears</I> by convincing them that he was 
 <I>not a spirit,</I> and for the <I>strengthening</I> of their 
 <I>faith</I> in that doctrine which they were to preach to the world by 
 giving them full satisfaction concerning his resurrection. Two proofs 
 he gives them:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He shows them his body, particularly <I>his hands and his 
 feet.</I> They saw that he had the shape, and features, and exact 
 resemblance, of their Master; but is it not his ghost? "No," saith 
 Christ, "<I>behold my hands and my feet;</I> you see I have 
 <I>hands</I> and <I>feet,</I> and therefore have a <I>true</I> body; 
 you see I can <I>move</I> these hands and feet, and therefore have a 
 <I>living</I> body; and you see the marks of the nails in my hands and 
 feet, and therefore it is <I>my own</I> body, the <I>same</I> that you 
 saw crucified, and not a <I>borrowed</I> one." He lays down this 
 principle--that a <I>spirit has not flesh and bones;</I> it is not
 compounded of gross matter, shaped into various members, and consisting 
 of divers heterogeneous parts, as our bodies are. He does not tell us 
 what a <I>spirit</I> is (it is time enough to know that when we go to 
 the world of spirits), but what it is not: <I>It has not flesh and 
 bones.</I> Now hence he infers, "<I>It is I myself,</I> whom you have 
 been so intimately acquainted with, and have had such familiar 
 conversation with; it is <I>I myself,</I> whom you have reason to 
 rejoice in, and not to be afraid of." Those who <I>know Christ</I> 
 aright, and know him as <I>theirs,</I> will have no reason to be 
 terrified at his appearances, at his approaches. 

 [1.] He appeals to their <I>sight, shows</I> them <I>his hands</I> and 
 <I>his feet,</I> which were pierced with the nails. Christ retained the 
 marks of them in his glorified body, that they might be proofs that it 
 was he himself; and he was willing that they should be <I>seen.</I> He 
 afterwards showed them to Thomas, for he is not ashamed of his 
 sufferings for us; little reason then have we to be ashamed of them, or 
 of ours for him. As he showed his wounds here to his disciples, for
 the enforcing of his instructions to them, so he showed them to his 
 Father, for the enforcing of his intercessions with him. He appears in 
 heaven <I>as a Lamb that had been slain</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:6">Rev. v. 6</A>);

 his <I>blood speaks,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:24">Heb. xii. 24</A>.

 He makes intercession in the virtue of his satisfaction; he says to the 
 Father, as here to the disciples, <I>Behold my hands and my feet,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:6,7">Zech. xiii. 6, 7</A>.

 [2.] He appeals to their <I>touch: Handle me, and see.</I> He would not
 let Mary Magdalene touch him at that time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17">John xx. 17</A>.

 But the disciples here are entrusted to do it, that they who were to
 preach his resurrection, and to suffer for doing so, might be 
 themselves abundantly satisfied concerning it. He bade them <I>handle
 him,</I> that they might be convinced that he was not a <I>spirit.</I> 
 If there were really no spirits, or apparitions of spirits (as by this 
 and other instances it is plain that the disciples did believe there 
 were), this had been a proper time for Christ to have undeceived them, 
 by telling them there were no such things; but he seems to take it for 
 granted that there have been and may be apparitions of spirits, else 
 what need was there of so much pains to prove that he was not one?
 There were many heretics in the primitive times, atheists I rather 
 think they were, who said that Christ had never any substantial body, 
 but that it was a mere phantasm, which was neither really born nor 
 truly suffered. Such wild notions as these, we are told, the
 Valentinians and Manichees had, and the followers of Simon Magus; they 
 were called <B><I>Doketai</I></B> and <B><I>Phantysiastai</I></B>.
 Blessed be God, these heresies have long since been <I>buried;</I> and 
 we know and are sure that Jesus Christ was no <I>spirit</I> or 
 <I>apparition,</I> but had a true and real body, even after his 
 resurrection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He <I>eats</I> with them, to show that he had a real and true 
 body, and that he was willing to converse freely and familiarly with 
 his disciples, as one friend with another. Peter lays a great stress 
 upon this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:41">Acts x. 41</A>):

 We <I>did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] When they <I>saw his hands and his feet,</I> yet they knew not 
 what to say, <I>They believed not for joy, and wondered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 It was their infirmity that they <I>believed not,</I> that <I>yet</I> 
 they believed not, <B><I>eti apistounton auton</I></B>--<I>they as yet 
 being unbelievers.</I> This very much corroborates the truth of 
 Christ's resurrection that the disciples were so slow to believe it. 
 Instead of stealing away his body, and saying, <I>He is risen,</I> when 
 he is not, as the chief priests suggested they would do, they are ready 
 to say again and again, <I>He is not risen,</I> when he is. Their being 
 incredulous of it at first, and insisting upon the utmost proofs of it, 
 show that when afterwards they did believe it, and venture their all 
 upon it, it was not but upon the fullest demonstration of the thing 
 that could be. But, though it was their infirmity, yet it was an 
 excusable one; for it was not from any contempt of the evidence offered 
 them that they believed not: but, <I>First,</I> They <I>believed not 
 for joy,</I> as Jacob, when he was told that Joseph was alive; they 
 thought it too good news to be true. When the faith and hope are 
 therefore <I>weak</I> because the love and desires are <I>strong,</I> 
 that weak faith shall be helped, and not rejected. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 They <I>wondered;</I> they thought it not only <I>too good,</I> but 
 <I>too great,</I> to be true, forgetting both the scriptures and the 
 power of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] For their further conviction and encouragement, he <I>called for 
 some meat.</I> He sat down to meat with the two disciples at Emmaus, 
 but it is not said that he did eat with <I>them;</I> now, lest that 
 should be made an objection, he here did actually <I>eat</I> with 
 <I>them</I> and <I>the rest,</I> to show that his body was really and 
 truly <I>returned to life,</I> though he did not eat and drink, and 
 converse constantly, with them, as he had done (and as Lazarus did 
 after <I>his</I> resurrection, who not only returned to life, but to 
 his former state of life, and to die again), because it was not 
 agreeable to the economy of the state he was risen to. They gave him a 
 <I>piece of a broiled fish, and of a honey-comb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 The honey-comb, perhaps, was used as sauce to the broiled fish, for 
 Canaan was a land <I>flowing with honey.</I> This was mean fare; yet, 
 if it be the fare of the disciples, their Master will fare as they do, 
 because in the kingdom of our Father they shall fare as he does, shall 
 eat and drink with him in his kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The <I>insight</I> he gave them into the word of God, which they had 
 <I>heard</I> and read, by which faith in the resurrection of Christ is 
 wrought in them, and all the difficulties are cleared. 

 (1.) He refers them to the <I>word</I> which they had <I>heard</I> from 
 him when he was with them, and puts them in mind of that as the angel 
 had done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):

 <I>These are the words which I said unto you</I> in private, many a 
 time, <I>while I was yet with you.</I> We should better 
 <I>understand</I> what Christ <I>does,</I> if we did but better 
 <I>remember</I> what he hath <I>said,</I> and had but the art of 
 comparing them together. 

 (2.) He refers them to the <I>word</I> they had read in the Old 
 Testament, to which the word they had heard from him directed them: 
 <I>All things must be fulfilled which were written.</I> Christ had 
 given them this general hint for the regulating of their 
 expectations--that whatever they found written concerning the Messiah, 
 in the Old Testament, must be fulfilled in him, what was written 
 concerning his sufferings as well as what was written concerning his 
 kingdom; these God had <I>joined together</I> in the prediction, and it 
 could not be thought that they should be <I>put asunder</I> in the 
 event. <I>All things</I> must be fulfilled, even the <I>hardest,</I> 
 even the <I>heaviest,</I> even the <I>vinegar;</I> he could not die 
 till he had that, because he could not till then say, <I>It is 
 finished.</I> The several parts of the Old Testament are here 
 mentioned, as containing each of them things concerning Christ: <I>The 
 law of Moses,</I> that is, the Pentateuch, or the <I>five</I> books 
 written by Moses,--the <I>prophets,</I> containing not only the books 
 that are purely prophetical, but those historical books that were 
 written by prophetical men,--the <I>Psalms,</I> containing the other 
 writings, which they called the <I>Hagiographa.</I> See in what various 
 ways of writing God did of old reveal his will; but all proceeded from 
 one and the self-same Spirit, who by them gave notice of the coming and 
 kingdom of the Messiah; for <I>to him bore all the prophets 
 witness.</I> 

 (3.) By an immediate present work upon their minds, of which they 
 themselves could not but be sensible, he gave them to apprehend the 
 true intent and meaning of the Old-Testament prophecies of Christ, and 
 to see them all fulfilled in him: <I>Then opened he their 
 understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.
 
 In his discourse with the two disciples he took the veil from off the 
 text, by <I>opening</I> the scriptures; here he took the veil from off 
 the heart, <I>by opening the mind.</I> Observe here,

 [1.] That Jesus Christ by his Spirit operates on the minds of men, on 
 the minds of all that are his. He has access to our spirits, and can 
 immediately influence them. It is observable how he did now after his 
 resurrection give a <I>specimen</I> of those two great operations of 
 <I>his Spirit</I> upon the <I>spirits of</I> men, his enlightening the 
 intellectual faculties with a divine light, when he opened the 
 understandings of his disciples, and his invigorating the active powers 
 with a divine heat, when he made their hearts burn within them. 

 [2.] Even good men need to have their <I>understandings opened;</I> for 
 though they are not <I>darkness,</I> as they were by nature, yet in 
 many things they are <I>in the dark.</I> David prays, <I>Open mine 
 eyes. Give me understanding.</I> And Paul, who knows so much of Christ, 
 sees his need to learn more. 

 [3.] Christ's way of working faith in the soul, and gaining the throne 
 there, is by <I>opening the understanding</I> to discern the evidence 
 of those things that are to be believed. Thus he comes into the soul by 
 <I>the door,</I> while Satan, as a thief and a robber, climbs up some 
 other way. 

 [4.] The design of opening the understanding is <I>that we may 
 understand the scriptures;</I> not that we may be <I>wise above what is 
 written,</I> but that we may be <I>wiser in what is written,</I> and 
 may be made <I>wise to salvation</I> by it. The Spirit in the word and 
 the Spirit in the heart say the same thing. Christ's scholars never 
 learn <I>above their bibles</I> in this world; but they need to be 
 learning still more and more <I>out of their bibles,</I> and to grow 
 more <I>ready</I> and <I>mighty</I> in the scriptures. That we may have 
 right thoughts of Christ, and have our mistakes concerning him 
 rectified, there needs no more than to be made to understand the 
 scriptures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The instructions he gave them as <I>apostles,</I> who were to be 
 employed in setting up his kingdom in the world. They expected, while 
 their Master was with them, that they should be preferred to posts of 
 honour, of which they thought themselves quite disappointed when he was 
 dead. "No," saith, he, "you are now to enter upon them; <I>you are</I> 
 to be <I>witnesses of these things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>),

 to carry the notice of them to all the world; not only to <I>report</I> 
 them as matter of news, but to <I>assert</I> them as evidence given 
 upon the trial of the great cause that has been so long depending 
 between God and Satan, the issue of which must be the casting down and 
 casting out of the <I>prince of this world.</I> You are fully assured 
 of these things yourselves, you are eye and ear-witnesses of them; go, 
 and assure the world of them; and the same Spirit that has enlightened 
 you shall go along with you for the enlightening of others." Now here 
 they are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>What they must preach.</I> They must preach the gospel, must
 preach the <I>New Testament</I> as the full accomplishment of the 
 <I>Old,</I> as the continuation and conclusion of divine revelation. 
 They must take their bibles along with them (especially when they 
 preached to the Jews; nay, and Peter, in his first sermon to the 
 Gentiles, directed them to consult the prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:43">Acts x. 43</A>),

 and must show people how it was written of old concerning the Messiah,
 and the glories and graces of his kingdom, and then must tell them how, 
 upon their certain knowledge, all this was fulfilled in the Lord 
 Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The great <I>gospel truth</I> concerning the <I>death</I> and 
 <I>resurrection</I> of Jesus Christ must be <I>published</I> to the 
 children of men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>):

 <I>Thus it was written</I> in the sealed book of the divine counsels 
 from eternity, the volume of that book of the covenant of redemption; 
 and thus it was written in the open book of the Old Testament, among 
 the things revealed; and therefore <I>thus it behoved Christ to 
 suffer,</I> for the divine counsels must be performed, and care taken 
 that no word of God fall to the ground. "Go, and tell the world," 
 <I>First,</I> "That Christ <I>suffered,</I> as it was written of him. 
 Go, preach <I>Christ crucified;</I> be not ashamed of his cross, not 
 ashamed of a suffering Jesus. Tell them what he suffered, and why he 
 suffered, and how all the scriptures of the Old Testament were 
 fulfilled in his sufferings. Tell them that it <I>behoved him to 
 suffer,</I> that it was necessary to the taking away of the sin of the 
 world, and the deliverance of mankind from death and ruin: nay, it 
 <I>became him</I> to be perfected <I>through sufferings,</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10">Heb. ii. 10</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> "That he rose from the dead on <I>the third day,</I>
 by which not only all the offence of the cross was rolled away, but he 
 was declared to be the Son of God with power, and in this also the 
 <I>scriptures</I> were <I>fulfilled</I> (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:3,4">1 Cor. xv. 3, 4</A>);

 go, tell the world how often you saw him after he rose from the dead,
 and how intimately you conversed with him. <I>Your eyes see</I>" (as 
 Joseph said to his brethren, when his discovering himself to them was 
 as life from the dead) "<I>that it is my mouth that speaketh unto 
 you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+45:12">Gen. xlv. 12</A>.

 Go, and tell them, then, that he that <I>was dead is alive,</I> and
 <I>lives for evermore,</I> and <I>has the keys of death and the 
 grave,</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The great <I>gospel duty</I> of <I>repentance</I> must be 
 <I>pressed</I> upon the children of men. <I>Repentance for sin</I> must 
 be preached in <I>Christ's name,</I> and by his authority, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.
 
 <I>All men every where</I> must be called and <I>commanded to 
 repent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:30">Acts xvii. 30</A>.

 "Go, and tell all people that the God that made them, and the Lord that 
 bought them, expects and requires that, immediately upon this notice 
 given, they turn from the worship of the gods that they have made to 
 the worship of the God that made them; and not only so, but from 
 serving the interests of the world and the flesh; they must turn to the 
 service of God in Christ, must mortify all sinful habits, and forsake 
 all sinful practices. Their hearts and lives must be changed, and they 
 must be universally renewed and reformed."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The great <I>gospel privilege</I> of the <I>remission of sins</I> 
 must be <I>proposed</I> to all, and assured to all that <I>repent,</I> 
 and <I>believe the gospel.</I> "Go, tell a guilty world, that stands 
 convicted and condemned at God's bar, that an act of indemnity has 
 passed the royal assent, which all that repent and believe shall have 
 the benefit of, and not only be <I>pardoned,</I> but <I>preferred</I> 
 by. Tell them that <I>there is hope</I> concerning them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>To whom they must preach.</I> Whither must they carry these 
 proposals, and how far does their commission extend? They are here 
 told, 

 [1.] That they must preach this <I>among all nations.</I> They must 
 disperse themselves, like the sons of Noah after the flood, some one 
 way and some another, and carry this light along with them wherever 
 they go. The prophets had preached <I>repentance</I> and 
 <I>remission</I> to the <I>Jews,</I> but the apostles must preach them 
 to <I>all the world.</I> None are <I>exempted</I> from the obligations 
 the gospel lays upon men to <I>repent,</I> nor are any <I>excluded</I> 
 from those inestimable benefits which are included in the remission of 
 sins, but those that by their unbelief and impenitency put a bar in 
 their own door. 

 [2.] That they must <I>begin at Jerusalem</I> There they must preach 
 their first <I>gospel sermon;</I> there the <I>gospel church</I> must 
 be first formed; there the gospel day must dawn, and thence that light 
 shall go forth which must take hold on the ends of the earth. And why 
 must they begin there? <I>First,</I> Because <I>thus it was 
 written,</I> and therefore it <I>behoved them</I> to take this method. 
 <I>The word of the</I> Lord must <I>go forth from Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3">Isa. ii. 3</A>.

 And see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:32,3:16,Ob+1:21,Zec+14:8">Joel ii. 32; iii. 16;
 Obad. 21; Zech. xiv. 8</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Because there the matters of fact on which the gospel
 was founded were transacted; and therefore there they were first 
 attested, where, if there had been any just cause for it, they might be 
 best contested and disproved. So strong, so bright, is the first 
 shining forth of the glory of the risen Redeemer that it dares face 
 those daring enemies of his that had put him to an ignominious death, 
 and sets them at defiance. "<I>Begin at Jerusalem,</I> that the chief 
 priests may try their strength to crush the gospel, and may rage to see 
 themselves disappointed." <I>Thirdly,</I> Because he would give us a 
 further example of forgiving enemies. Jerusalem had put the greatest 
 affronts imaginable upon him (both the rulers and the multitude), for 
 which that city might justly have been excepted by name out of the act 
 of indemnity; but no, so far from that, the first offer of gospel grace 
 is made to Jerusalem, and thousands there are in a little time brought 
 to partake of that grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What <I>assistance they should have in preaching.</I> It is a vast 
 undertaking that they are here called to, a very large and difficult 
 province, especially considering the opposition this service would meet 
 with, and the sufferings it would be attended with. If therefore they 
 ask, <I>Who is sufficient for these things?</I> here is an answer 
 ready: <I>Behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you,</I> and 
 <I>you shall be endued with power from on high,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>.

 He here assures them that in a little time the Spirit should be poured 
 out upon them in greater measures than ever, and they should thereby be 
 furnished with all those gifts and graces which were necessary to their 
 discharge of this great trust; and therefore they must <I>tarry at 
 Jerusalem,</I> and not enter upon it till this be done. Note,

 [1.] Those who <I>receive the Holy Ghost</I> are thereby <I>endued with 
 a power from on high,</I> a supernatural power, a power above any of 
 their own; it is <I>from on high,</I> and therefore draws the soul 
 upward, and makes it to <I>aim high.</I> 

 [2.] Christ's apostles could never have planted his gospel, and set up 
 his kingdom in the world, as they did, if they had not been endued with 
 such a power; and their admirable achievements prove that there was an 
 excellency of power going along with them. 

 [3.] <I>This power from on high</I> was the <I>promise of the 
 Father,</I> the great promise of the New Testament, as the promise of 
 the coming of Christ was of the Old Testament. And, if it be the 
 <I>promise of the Father,</I> we may be sure that the promise is 
 <I>inviolable</I> and the thing promised <I>invaluable.</I> 

 [4.] Christ would not leave his disciples till the time was just at 
 hand for the performing of this promise. It was but ten days after the 
 <I>ascension</I> of Christ that there came the <I>descent</I> of the 
 Spirit. 

 [5.] Christ's ambassadors must stay till they have their powers, and 
 not venture upon their embassy till they have received full 
 instructions and credentials. Though, one would think, never was such 
 haste as now for the preaching of the gospel, yet the preachers must 
 tarry till they be endued with power from on high, and <I>tarry at 
 Jerusalem,</I> though a place of danger, because there this promise of 
 the Father was to find them,

 This evangelist omits the solemn meeting between Christ and his 
 disciples <I>in Galilee;</I> but what he said to them there, and at 
 other interviews, he subjoins to what he said to them at the first 
 visit he made them on the evening of the day he rose; and has now 
 nothing more to account for but his ascension into heaven, of which we 
 have a very brief narrative in these verses, in which we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How solemnly Christ took leave of his disciples. Christ's design 
 being to reconcile heaven and earth, and to continue a days-man between 
 them, it was necessary that he should lay his hands on them both, and, 
 in order thereunto, that he should <I>pass</I> and <I>repass.</I> He 
 had business to do in both worlds, and accordingly came from heaven to 
 earth in his incarnation, to despatch his business here, and, having 
 finished this, he returned to heaven, to reside there, and negotiate 
 our affairs with the Father. Observe, 

 1. Whence he ascended: from <I>Bethany,</I> near Jerusalem, adjoining
 to the <I>mount of Olives.</I> There he had done eminent services for 
 his Father's glory, and there he entered upon his glory. There was the 
 <I>garden</I> in which his sufferings began, there he was in his agony; 
 and Bethany signifies <I>the house of sorrow.</I> Those that would go 
 to heaven must ascend thither from the house of sufferings and sorrow, 
 must go by agonies to their joys. The mount of Olives was pitched upon 
 long since to be the place of Christ's ascension: <I>His feet shall 
 stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:4">Zech. xiv. 4</A>.

 And here it was that awhile ago he began his triumphant entry into
 Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:22"><I>ch.</I> xix. 29</A>.

 2. Who were the witnesses of his ascension: <I>He led out his
 disciples</I> to see him. Probably, it was very early in the morning 
 that he ascended, before people were stirring; for he never showed 
 himself openly to all the people after his resurrection, but only to 
 <I>chosen witnesses.</I> The disciples did not see him rise out of the 
 grace, because his resurrection was capable of being proved by their 
 seeing him alive afterwards; but they saw him <I>ascend</I> into 
 heaven, because they could not otherwise have an <I>ocular</I> 
 demonstration of his ascension. They were <I>led out</I> on purpose to 
 see him ascend, had their eye upon him when he ascended, and were not 
 looking another way. 

 3. What was the farewell he gave them: <I>He lifted up his hands, and 
 blessed them.</I> He did not go away in displeasure, but in love; he 
 left a blessing behind him; <I>he lifted up his hands,</I> as the high 
 priest did when he blessed the people; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+9:22">Lev. ix. 22</A>.

 He blessed as one having authority, commanded the blessing which he had 
 purchased; he <I>blessed them</I> as Jacob blessed his sons. The 
 apostles were now as the representatives of the twelve tribes, so that 
 in blessing them he blessed all his spiritual Israel, and put his 
 Father's name upon them. He blessed them as Jacob blessed his sons, and 
 Moses the tribes, at parting, to show that, having loved his own which 
 were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 

 4. How he left them: <I>While he was blessing them, he was parted from
 them;</I> not as if he were taken away before he had said all he had to 
 say, but to intimate that his being parted from them did not put an end 
 to his blessing them, for the intercession which he went to heaven to 
 make for all his is a continuation of the blessing. He <I>began</I> to 
 bless them on earth, but he went to heaven to <I>go on</I> with it. 
 Christ was now sending his apostles to preach his gospel to the world, 
 and he gives them his blessing, not for <I>themselves</I> only, but to 
 be conferred in his name upon <I>all</I> that should believe on him 
 through their word; for in him <I>all the families of the earth were to 
 be blessed.</I> 
 
 5. How his ascension is described.

 (1.) He was <I>parted from them,</I> was taken from their head, as 
 Elijah from Elisha's. Note, The dearest friends must part. Those that
 love us, and pray for us, and instruct us, must be <I>parted form 
 us.</I> The bodily presence of Christ himself was not to be expected 
 always in this world; those that knew him after the flesh must now 
 henceforth know him so no more. 

 (2.) He was <I>carried up into heaven;</I> not by force, but by his own 
 act and deed. As he arose, so he ascended, by his own power, yet 
 attended by angels. There needed no chariot of fire, nor horses of 
 fire; he knew the way, and, being the <I>Lord from heaven,</I> could go 
 back himself. He ascended in a cloud, as the angel in the smoke of 
 Manoah's sacrifice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:20">Judg. xiii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How cheerfully his disciples continued their attendance on him, and 
 on God through him, even now that he was parted from them. 

 1. They paid their homage to him at his going away, to signify that
 though he was going into a far country, yet they would continue his 
 loyal subjects, that they were willing to have him reign over them: 
 <I>They worshipped him.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.

 Note, Christ expects <I>adoration</I> from those that receive blessings
 from him. He <I>blessed them,</I> in token of gratitude for which they 
 <I>worshipped him.</I> This fresh display of Christ's glory drew from 
 them fresh acknowledgments and adorations of it. They knew that though 
 he was <I>parted form them,</I> yet he could, and did, take notice of 
 their adorations of him; the cloud that received him out of their sight 
 did not put them or their services out of his sight. 

 2. They <I>returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</I> There they were 
 ordered to continue till the Spirit should be poured out upon them, and 
 thither they went accordingly, though it was into the mouth of danger. 
 Thither they went, and there they staid <I>with great joy.</I> This was 
 a wonderful change, and an effect of the opening of their 
 understandings. When Christ told them that he must leave them sorrow
 filled their hearts; yet now that they see him go they are <I>filled 
 with joy,</I> being convinced at length that it was expedient for them 
 and for the church that he should go away, to send the Comforter. Note, 
 The glory of Christ is the joy, the exceeding joy, of all true 
 believers, even while they are here in this world; much more will it be 
 so when they go to the new Jerusalem, and find him there in his glory.

 3. They abounded in acts of devotion while they were in expectation of 
 the promise of the Father,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>.

 (1.) They attended the temple-service at the hours of prayer. God had
 not as yet quite forsaken it, and therefore they did not. <I>They were 
 continually in the temple,</I> as their Master was when he was at 
 Jerusalem. <I>The Lord loves the gates of Zion,</I> and so should we. 
 Some think that they had their place of meeting, as disciples, in some 
 of the chambers of the temple which belonged to some Levite that was 
 <I>well affected</I> to them; but others think it is not likely that 
 this either could be <I>concealed from,</I> or would be <I>connived 
 at</I> by, the chief priests and <I>rulers of the temple.</I> 

 (2.) Temple-sacrifices, they knew, were superseded by Christ's 
 sacrifice, but the temple-songs they joined in. Note, While we are 
 waiting for God's promises we must go forth to meet them with our 
 praises. Praising and blessing God is work that is never out of season: 
 and nothing better prepares the mind for the receiving of the Holy 
 Ghost than holy joy and praise. Fears are silenced, sorrows sweetened 
 and allayed, and hopes kept up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <I>amen</I> that concludes seems to be added by the church and 
 every believer to the reading of the gospel, signifying an assent to 
 the truths of the gospel, and a hearty concurrence with all the
 disciples of Christ in praising and blessing God. <I>Amen.</I> Let him
 be continually praised and blessed.</P>
