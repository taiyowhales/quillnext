 are now entering into the labours of another evangelist; his name
 <I>Luke,</I> which some take to be a contraction of <I>Lucilius;</I> 
 born at Antioch, so St. Jerome. Some think that he was the only one of 
 all the penmen of the scripture that was not of the seed of Israel. He 
 was a Jewish proselyte, and, as some conjecture, converted to 
 Christianity by the ministry of St. Paul at Antioch; and after his 
 coming into Macedonia 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:10">Acts xvi. 10</A>)

 he was his constant companion. He had employed himself in the study and 
 practice of physic; hence, Paul calls him <I>Luke the beloved 
 Physician,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:14">Col. iv. 14</A>.

 Some of the pretended ancients tell you that he was a painter, and drew
 a picture of the virgin Mary. But Dr. Whitby thinks that there is 
 nothing certain to the contrary, and that therefore it is probable that 
 he was one of the seventy disciples, and a follower of Christ when he 
 was here upon earth; and, if so, he was a native Israelite. I see not 
 what can be objected against this, except some uncertain traditions of 
 the ancients, which we can build nothing upon, and against which may be 
 opposed the testimonies of Origen and Epiphanius, who both say that he 
 was one of the seventy disciples. He is supposed to have written this 
 gospel when he was associated with St. Paul in his travels, and by
 direction from him: and some think that this is <I>the brother</I> whom 
 Paul speaks of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:18">2 Cor. viii. 18</A>),

 <I>whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches of
 Christ;</I> as if the meaning of it were, that he was celebrated <I>in 
 all the churches</I> for writing <I>this gospel;</I> and that St. Paul 
 means this when he speaks sometimes of <I>his</I> gospel, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:16">Rom. ii. 16</A>.
 
 But there is no ground at all for this. Dr. Cave observes that his way
 and manner of writing are accurate and exact, his style polite and 
 elegant, sublime and lofty, yet perspicuous; and that he expresses 
 himself in a vein of purer Greek than is to be found in the other 
 writers of the holy story. Thus he relates divers things more copiously 
 than the other evangelists; and thus he especially treats of those 
 things which relate to the priestly office of Christ. It is uncertain 
 when, or about what time, this gospel was written. Some think that it 
 was written in Achaia, during his travels with Paul, seventeen years 
 (twenty-two years, say others) after Christ's ascension; others, that 
 it was written at Rome, a little before he wrote his history of the 
 <I>Acts of the Apostles</I> (which is a continuation of this), when he 
 was there with Paul, while he was a prisoner, and preaching in his own 
 hired house, with which the history of the Acts concludes; and then 
 Paul saith that <I>only Luke was with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:11">2 Tim. iv. 11</A>.

 When he was under that voluntary confinement with Paul, he had leisure
 to compile these two histories (and many excellent writings the church 
 has been indebted to a prison for): if so, it was written about 
 twenty-seven years after Christ's ascension, and about the fourth year 
 of Nero. Jerome says, He died when he was eighty-four years of age,
 and was never married. Some write that he suffered martyrdom; but, if 
 he did, where and when is uncertain. Nor indeed is there much more 
 credit to be given to the Christian traditions concerning the writers 
 of the New Testament than to the Jewish traditions concerning those of 
 the Old Testament.</P>
