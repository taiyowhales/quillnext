 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <I>that is</I> an
 householder, which went out early in the morning to hire
 labourers into his vineyard.
 &nbsp; 2  And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day,
 he sent them into his vineyard.
 &nbsp; 3  And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing
 idle in the marketplace,
 &nbsp; 4  And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and
 whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
 &nbsp; 5  Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did
 likewise.
 &nbsp; 6  And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others
 standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day
 idle?
 &nbsp; 7  They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith
 unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right,
 <I>that</I> shall ye receive.
 &nbsp; 8  So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto
 his steward, Call the labourers, and give them <I>their</I> hire,
 beginning from the last unto the first.
 &nbsp; 9  And when they came that <I>were hired</I> about the eleventh hour,
 they received every man a penny.
 &nbsp; 10  But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
 received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
 &nbsp; 11  And when they had received <I>it,</I> they murmured against the
 goodman of the house,
 &nbsp; 12  Saying, These last have wrought <I>but</I> one hour, and thou
 hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and
 heat of the day.
 &nbsp; 13  But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
 wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
 &nbsp; 14  Take <I>that</I> thine <I>is,</I> and go thy way: I will give unto
 this last, even as unto thee.
 &nbsp; 15  Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
 thine eye evil, because I am good?
 &nbsp; 16  So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be
 called, but few chosen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This parable of the labourers in the vineyard is intended,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To represent to us <I>the kingdom of heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 that is, the way and method of the gospel dispensation. The laws of 
 that kingdom are not wrapt up in parables, but plainly set down, as in 
 the sermon upon the mount; but the mysteries of that kingdom are 
 delivered in parables, in sacraments, as here and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:1-58"><I>ch.</I> xiii.</A>

 The duties of Christianity are more necessary to be known than the
 notions of it; and yet the notions of it are more necessary to be 
 illustrated than the duties of it; which is that which parables are 
 designed for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In particular, to represent to us that concerning the kingdom of 
 heaven, which he had said in the close of the foregoing chapter, that 
 <I>many that are first shall be last, and the last, first;</I> with 
 which this parable is connected; that truth, having in it a seeming 
 contradiction, needed further explication.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Nothing was more a mystery in the gospel dispensation than the 
 rejection of the Jews and the calling in of the Gentiles; so the 
 apostle speaks of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:3-6">Eph. iii. 3-6</A>);

 that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs: nor was any thing more
 provoking to the Jews than the intimation of it. Now this seems to be 
 the principal scope of this parable, to show that the Jews should be 
 first called into the vineyard, and many of them should come at the 
 call; but, at length, the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles, 
 and they should receive it, and be admitted to equal privileges and 
 advantages with the Jews; should be <I>fellow-citizens with the 
 saints,</I> which the Jews, even those of them that believed, would be 
 very much disgusted at, but without reason.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But the parable may be applied more generally, and shows us, 

 1. That God is debtor to no man; a great truth, which the contents in
 our Bible give as the scope of this parable. 

 2. That many who begin last, and promise little in religion, sometimes,
 by the blessing of God, arrive at greater attainments in knowledge, 
 grace, and usefulness, than others whose entrance was more early, and 
 who promised fairer. Though Cushi gets the start of Ahimaaz, yet
 Ahimaaz, choosing <I>the way of the plain,</I> outruns Cushi. John is 
 swifter of foot, and comes <I>first to the sepulchre:</I> but Peter has 
 more courage, and goes <I>first into it.</I> Thus <I>many that are last 
 shall be first.</I> Some make it a caution to the disciples, who had 
 boasted of their timely and zealous embracing of Christ; they had left 
 all, to follow him; but let them look to it, that they keep up their 
 zeal; let them press forward and persevere; else their good beginnings 
 will avail them little; they that seemed to be <I>first,</I> would be 
 <I>last.</I> Sometimes those that are converted later in their lives, 
 outstrip those that are converted earlier. Paul was <I>as one born out 
 of due time, yet came not behind the chiefest of the apostles,</I> and 
 outdid those that were in Christ before him. Something of affinity
 there is between this parable and that of the prodigal son, where he 
 that returned from his wandering, was as dear to his father as he was, 
 that never went astray; <I>first and last alike.</I> 

 3. That <I>the recompence of reward</I> will be given to the saints,
 not according to the time of their conversion, but according to the 
 preparations for it by grace in this world; not according to the 
 seniority

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+43:33">Gen. xliii. 33</A>),

 but <I>according to the measure of the stature of the fulness of
 Christ.</I> Christ had promised the apostles, who followed him <I>in
 the regeneration,</I> at the beginning of the gospel dispensation, 
 great glory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:28"><I>ch.</I> xix. 28</A>);

 but he now tells them that those who are in like manner faithful to
 him, even in the latter end of the world, shall have the same reward, 
 shall <I>sit with Christ on his throne,</I> as well as the apostles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:26-3:21">Rev. ii. 26-iii. 21</A>.

 Sufferers for Christ in the latter days, shall have the same reward 
 with the martyrs and confessors of the primitive times, though they are 
 more celebrated; and faithful ministers now, the same with the first 
 fathers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have two things in the parable; the <I>agreement</I> with the 
 labourers, and the <I>account</I> with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is the agreement made with the labourers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:1-7"><I>v.</I> 1-7</A>);

 and here it will be asked, as usual,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Who hires them? <I>A man that is a householder.</I> God is the 
 great Householder, <I>whose we are, and whom we serve;</I> as a 
 householder, he has work that he will have to be done, and servants 
 that he will have to be doing; he has a great family in heaven and 
 earth, which is named from Jesus Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:15">Eph. iii. 15</A>),

 which he is Owner and Ruler of. God hires labourers, not because he
 needs them or their services (for, <I>if we be righteous, what do we 
 unto him?</I>), but as some charitable generous householders keep poor 
 men to work, in kindness to them, to save them from idleness and 
 poverty, and pay them for working for themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Whence they are hired? Out of <I>the market-place,</I> where, till 
 they are hired into God's service, they <I>stand idle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 <I>all the day idle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>).

 Note, <I>First,</I> The soul of man stands ready to be hired into some 
 service or other; it was (as all the creatures were) created to work, 
 and is either a <I>servant to iniquity,</I> or a <I>servant to 
 righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:19">Rom. vi. 19</A>.

 The devil, by his temptations, is <I>hiring labourers</I> into his
 field, to <I>feed swine.</I> God, by his gospel, is <I>hiring labourers 
 into his vineyard, to dress it, and keep it,</I> paradise-work. We are 
 put to our choice; for hired we must be

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:15">Josh. xxiv. 15</A>);

 <I>Choose ye this day whom ye will serve. Secondly,</I> Till we are
 hired into the service of God, we are standing all the day idle; a 
 sinful state, though a state of drudgery to Satan, may really be called 
 <I>a state of idleness;</I> sinners are doing nothing, nothing to the 
 purpose, nothing of the great work they were sent into the world about, 
 nothing that will pass well in the account. <I>Thirdly,</I> The gospel 
 call is given to those that <I>stand idle in the market-place.</I> The 
 market-place is <I>a place of concourse,</I> and there <I>Wisdom 
 cries</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:20,21">Prov. i. 20, 21</A>);

 it is a place of sport, there the <I>children are playing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:16"><I>ch.</I> xi. 16</A>);

 and the gospel calls us from vanity to seriousness; it is a place of
 business, of noise and hurry; and from that we are called to retire.
 "Come, come from this market-place."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] What are they hired to do? To labour in his vineyard. Note,
 <I>First,</I> The church is God's vineyard; it is of his planting, 
 watering, and fencing; and the fruits of it must be to his honour and 
 praise. <I>Secondly,</I> We are all called upon to be labourers in this 
 vineyard. The work of religion is vineyard-work, pruning, dressing, 
 digging, watering, fencing, weeding. We have each of us our own 
 vineyard to keep, our own soul; and it is God's and to be kept and 
 dressed for him. In this work we must not be slothful, not loiterers, 
 but <I>labourers,</I> working, and <I>working out our own 
 salvation.</I> Work for God will not admit of trifling. A man may go 
 idle to hell; but he that will go to heaven, must be busy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] What shall be their wages? He promises, <I>First, A penny,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The Roman penny was, in our money, of the value of a sevenpence 
 half-penny, a day's wages for a day's work, and the wages sufficient 
 for a day's maintenance. This doth not prove that the reward of our 
 obedience to God is <I>of works,</I> or <I>of debt</I> (no, it is <I>of 
 grace, free grace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:4">Rom. iv. 4</A>),

 or that there is any proportion between our services and heaven's
 glories; no, when we have done all, <I>we are unprofitable 
 servants;</I> but it is to signify that there is a reward set before 
 us, and a sufficient one. <I>Secondly, Whatsoever is right,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:4-7"><I>v.</I> 4-7</A>.

 Note, God will be sure not to be behind-hand with any for the service 
 they do him: never any lost by working for God. The crown set before us 
 is <I>a crown of righteousness, which the righteous Judge shall 
 give.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [5.] For what term are they hired? For <I>a day.</I> It is but a day's 
 work that is here done. The time of life is the day, in which <I>we 
 must work the works of him that sent us</I> into the world. It is a 
 short time; the reward is for eternity, the work is but for <I>a 
 day;</I> man is said <I>to accomplish, as a hireling, his day,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:6">Job xiv. 6</A>.

 This should quicken us to expedition and diligence in our work, that we
 have but a little time to work in, and <I>the night</I> is hastening 
 on, <I>when no man can work;</I> and if our great work be undone when 
 our day is done, we are undone for ever. It should also encourage us in 
 reference to the hardships and difficulties of our work, that it is but 
 <I>for a day;</I> the approaching <I>shadow, which the servant 
 earnestly desireth,</I> will bring with it both rest, and <I>the reward 
 of our work,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:2">Job vii. 2</A>.

 Hold out, faith, and patience, yet a little while.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [6.] Notice is taken of the several hours of the day, at which the 
 labourers were hired. The apostles were sent forth at <I>the first and 
 third hour</I> of the gospel day; they had a first and a second 
 mission, while Christ was on earth, and their business was to call in 
 the Jews; after Christ's ascension, about <I>the sixth and ninth 
 hour,</I> they went out again on the same errand, <I>preaching the 
 gospel to the Jews only, to them in Judea first,</I> and afterward to 
 them of the dispersion; but, at length, as it were <I>about the 
 eleventh hour,</I> they called the Gentiles to the same work and 
 privilege with the Jews, and told them that in Christ Jesus there 
 should be <I>no difference</I> made <I>between Jew and Greek.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But this may be, and commonly is, applied to the several ages of life, 
 in which souls are converted to Christ. The common call is promiscuous, 
 to come and work in the vineyard; but the effectual call is particular, 
 and it is <I>then</I> effectual when we come at the call.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Some are effectually called, and begin to work in the 
 vineyard when they are very young; are sent in early in the morning, 
 whose tender years are seasoned with grace, and the remembrance of 
 their Creator. John the Baptist was <I>sanctified from the womb,</I> 
 and therefore <I>great</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:15">Luke i. 15</A>);
 
 Timothy <I>from a child</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:15">2 Tim. iii. 15</A>);

 Obadiah <I>feared the Lord from his youth.</I> Those that have such a
 journey to go, had need set out betimes, the sooner the better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Others are savingly wrought upon in middle age; <I>Go 
 work in the vineyard, at the third, sixth, or ninth hour.</I> The power 
 of divine grace is magnified in the conversion of some, when they are 
 in the midst of their pleasures and worldly pursuits, as Paul. God has 
 work for all ages; no time amiss to turn to God; none can say, "It is 
 all in good time;" for, whatever hour of the day it is with us, the 
 time past of our life may suffice that we have served sin; <I>Go ye 
 also into the vineyard.</I> God turns away none that are willing to be 
 hired, for <I>yet there is room.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> Others are hired into the vineyard in old age, at
 <I>the eleventh hour,</I> when <I>the day of life is far spent,</I> and 
 there is but <I>one hour</I> of the twelve remaining. None are hired at 
 the twelfth hour; when life is done, opportunity is done; but "while 
 there is life, there is hope."

 1. There is hope <I>for</I> old sinners; for if, in sincerity, they
 turn to God, they shall doubtless be accepted; true repentance is never 
 too late. And, 

 2. There is hope <I>of</I> old sinners, that they may be brought to
 true repentance; nothing is too hard for Almighty grace to do, it 
 <I>can change the Ethiopian's skin, and the leopard's spots;</I> can 
 set those to work, who have contracted a habit of idleness. Nicodemus
 may <I>be born again when he is old,</I> and <I>the old man may be put 
 off, which is corrupt.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Yet let none, upon this presumption, put off their repentance till they 
 are old. These were <I>sent into the vineyard,</I> it is true, <I>at 
 the eleventh hour;</I> but nobody had hired them, or offered to hire 
 them, before. The Gentiles came in <I>at the eleventh hour,</I> but it 
 was because the gospel had not been before preached to them. Those that
 have had gospel offers made them <I>at the third, or sixth hour,</I> 
 and have resisted and refused them, will not have that to say for 
 themselves at the eleventh hour, that these had; <I>No man has hired 
 us;</I> nor can they be sure that any man will hire them at the ninth 
 or eleventh hour; and therefore not to discourage any, but to awaken 
 all, be it remembered, that <I>now is the accepted time; if we will 
 hear his voice,</I> it must be <I>to-day.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is the account with the labourers. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] When the account was taken; <I>when the evening was come,</I> 
 then, as usual, the day-labourers were called and paid. Note, Evening 
 time is the reckoning time; the particular account must be given up in 
 the evening of our life; for after death cometh the judgment. Faithful 
 labourers shall receive their reward when they die; it is deferred till 
 then, that they may wait with patience for it, but no longer; for God 
 will observe his own rule, <I>The hire of the labourers shall not abide 
 with thee all night, until the morning.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:15">Deut. xxiv. 15</A>.

 When Paul, that faithful labourer, departs, he is with Christ
 presently. The payment shall not be wholly deferred till <I>the morning 
 of the resurrection;</I> but then, in the evening of the world, will be 
 the general account, when <I>every one shall receive according to the 
 things done in the body.</I> When time ends, and with it the world of 
 work and opportunity, then the state of retribution commences; then 
 call the labourers, and give them their hire. Ministers call them into
 the vineyard, to do their work; death calls them out of the vineyard, 
 to receive their penny: and those to whom the call into the vineyard is 
 effectual, the call out of it will be joyful. Observe, They did not 
 come for their pay till they were called; we must with patience wait 
 God's time for our rest and recompence; go by our master's clock.
 <I>The last trumpet, at the great day, shall call the labourers,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:16">1 Thess. iv. 16</A>.

 <I>Then shalt thou call,</I> saith the good and faithful servant,
 <I>and I will answer.</I> In calling the labourers, they must begin 
 from the last, and so to the first. Let not those that come in at the 
 eleventh hour, be put behind the rest, but, lest they should be 
 discouraged, call them first. <I>At the great day,</I> though <I>the 
 dead in Christ shall rise first,</I> yet <I>they which are alive and 
 remain, on whom the ends of the world</I> (the eleventh hour of its 
 day) <I>comes, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds;</I> 
 no preference shall be given to seniority, but every man <I>shall stand 
 in his own lot at the end of the days.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What the account was; and in that observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The general pay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>);

 <I>They received every man a penny.</I> Note, <I>All that by patient 
 continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, honour, and immortality,</I> 
 shall undoubtedly <I>obtain eternal life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:7">Rom. ii. 7</A>),

 not as <I>wages</I> for the value of their work, but as the <I>gift</I>
 of God. Though there be degrees of glory in heaven, yet it will be to 
 all a complete happiness. They that come from the east and west, and so 
 come in late, that are picked up out of <I>the highways and the hedges, 
 shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</I> at the same feast,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:11"><I>ch.</I> vii. 11</A>.

 In heaven, every vessel will be full, brimful, though every vessel is
 not alike large and capacious. In the distribution of future joys, as 
 it was in the gathering of the manna, he that shall gather much, will 
 have nothing over, and he that shall gather little, will have no lack, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:18">Exod. xvi. 18</A>.

 Those whom Christ fed miraculously, though of different sizes, <I>men,
 women, and children, did all eat, and were filled.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The giving of a whole day's wages to those that had not done the tenth 
 part of a day's work, is designed to show that God distributes his 
 rewards by <I>grace</I> and <I>sovereignty,</I> and not of <I>debt.</I> 
 The best of the labourers, and those that begin soonest, having so many 
 empty spaces in their time, and their works not being filled up before 
 God, may truly be said to labour in the vineyard scarcely one hour of 
 their twelve; but because <I>we are under grace,</I> and <I>not under 
 the law,</I> even such defective services, done in sincerity, shall not 
 only be accepted, but by free grace richly rewarded. Compare 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:7,8,12:37">Luke xvii. 7, 8, with Luke xii. 37</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The particular pleading with those that were offended 
 with this distribution in gavel-kind. The circumstances of this serve 
 to adorn the parable; but the general scope is plain, that <I>the last 
 shall be first.</I> We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The offence taken 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>);

 <I>They murmured at the good man of the house;</I> not that there is, 
 or can be, any discontent or murmuring in heaven, for that is both 
 guilt and grief, and in heaven there is neither; but there may be, and 
 often are, discontent and murmuring concerning heaven and heavenly 
 things, while they are in prospect and promise in this world. This 
 signifies the jealousy which the Jews were provoked to by the admission 
 of the Gentiles into the kingdom of heaven. As the elder brother, in 
 the parable of the prodigal, repined at the reception of his younger 
 brother, and complained of his father's generosity to him; so these 
 labourers quarrelled with their master, and found fault, not because 
 they had not enough, so much as because others were made <I>equal</I> 
 with them. They boast, as the prodigal's elder brother did, of their
 good services; <I>We have borne the burthen and heat of the day;</I> 
 that was the most they could make of it. Sinners are said to <I>labour 
 in the very fire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:13">Hab. ii. 13</A>),

 whereas God's servants, at the worst, do but labour in the sun; not in
 the heat of the iron furnace, but only in the heat of the day. Now 
 <I>these last have worked but one hour,</I> and that too in the cool of 
 the day; and yet <I>thou hast made them equal with us.</I> The 
 Gentiles, who are newly called in, have as much of the privileges of 
 the kingdom of the Messiah as the Jews have, who have so long been 
 labouring in the vineyard of the Old-Testament church, under the yoke 
 of the ceremonial law, in expectation of that kingdom. Note, There is a 
 great proneness in us to think that we have too little, and other too 
 much, of the tokens of God's favour; and that we do too much, and 
 others too little, in the work of God. Very apt we all are to 
 undervalue the deserts of others, and to overvalue our own. Perhaps,
 Christ here gives an intimation to Peter, not to boast too much, as he 
 seemed to do, of his having <I>left all to follow Christ;</I> as if, 
 because he and the rest of them had borne the burthen and heat of the 
 day thus, they must have a heaven by themselves. It is hard for those 
 that do or suffer more than ordinary for God, not to be elevated too 
 much with the thought of it, and to expect to merit by it. Blessed Paul 
 guarded against this, when, though <I>the chief of the apostles,</I> he 
 owned himself to be <I>nothing,</I> to be <I>less than the least of all 
 saints.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The offence removed. Three things the master of the house urges, in 
 answer to this ill-natured surmise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That the complainant had no reason at all to say he had any wrong 
 done to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Here he asserts his own justice; <I>Friend, I do thee no wrong.</I> He 
 calls him <I>friend,</I> for in reasoning with others we should use 
 soft words and hard arguments; if our inferiors are peevish and 
 provoking, yet we should not thereby be put into a passion, but speak 
 calmly to them.

 [1.] It is incontestably true, that God can do no wrong. This is the 
 prerogative of the King of kings. <I>Is there unrighteousness with
 God?</I> The apostle startles at the thought of it; <I>God forbid!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:5,6">Rom. iii. 5, 6</A>.

 His word should silence all our murmurings, that, whatever God does to 
 us, or withholds from us, he does us no wrong.

 [2.] If God gives that grace to others, which he denies to us, it is
 kindness to them, but no injustice to us; and bounty to another, while 
 it is no injustice to us, we ought not to find fault with. Because it 
 is free grace, that is given to those that have it, boasting is for 
 ever excluded; and because it is free grace, that is withheld from 
 those that have it not, murmuring is for ever excluded. Thus <I>shall 
 every mouth be stopped, and all flesh be silent before God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To convince the murmurer that he did no wrong, he refers him to the 
 bargain: "<I>Didst not thou agree with me for a penny?</I> And if thou 
 hast what thou didst agree for, thou hast no reason to cry out of 
 wrong; thou shalt have what we agreed for." Though God is a debtor to 
 none, yet he is graciously pleased to make himself a debtor by his own 
 promise, for the benefit of which, through Christ, believers agree with 
 him, and he will stand to his part of the agreement. Note, It is good 
 for us often to consider what it was that we agreed with God for. 
 <I>First,</I> Carnal worldlings agree with God for their penny in this 
 world; they choose <I>their portion in this life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>);

 in these things they are willing to <I>have their reward</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:2,5"><I>ch.</I> vi. 2, 5</A>),
 
 <I>their consolation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:24">Luke vi. 24</A>),
 
 <I>their good things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25">Luke xvi. 25</A>);

 and with these they shall be put off, shall be cut off from spiritual
 and eternal blessings; and herein God does them no wrong; they have 
 what they chose, the penny they agreed for; <I>so shall their doom be, 
 themselves have decided it;</I> it is conclusive against them.
 <I>Secondly,</I> Obedient believers agree with God for their penny in 
 the other world, and they must remember that they have so agreed. Didst 
 not thou agree to take God's word for it? Thou didst; and wilt thou go 
 and agree with the world? Didst not thou agree to take up with heaven 
 as thy portion, thy all, and to take up with nothing short of it? And 
 wilt thou seek for a happiness in the creature, or think from thence to 
 make up the deficiencies of thy happiness in God?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He therefore, 
 
 1. Ties him to his bargain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 <I>Take that thine is, and go thy way.</I> If we understand it of that
 which is ours by debt or absolute propriety, it would be a dreadful 
 word; we are all undone, if we be put off with that only which we can 
 call our <I>own.</I> The highest creature must go away into nothing, if 
 he must go away with that only which is his own: but if we understand 
 it of that which is ours by <I>gift,</I> the free gift of God, it 
 teaches us <I>to be content with such things as we have.</I> Instead of 
 repining that we have no more, let us take what we have, and be 
 thankful. If God be better in any respect to others than to us, yet we 
 have no reason to complain while he is so much better to us than we 
 deserve, in giving us our penny, though we are unprofitable servants. 
 
 2. He tells him that those he envied should fare as well as he did;
 "<I>I will give unto this last, even as unto thee;</I> I am resolved I 
 will." Note, The unchangeableness of God's purposes in dispensing his 
 gifts should silence our murmurings. If he will do it, it is not for us 
 to gainsay; for <I>he is in one mind, and who can turn him? Neither 
 giveth he an account of any of his matters;</I> nor is it fit he 
 should.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He had no reason to quarrel with the master; for what he gave was 
 absolutely his own, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 As before he asserted his justice, so here his sovereignty; <I>Is it 
 not lawful for me to do what I will with my own?</I> Note,

 [1.] God is the Owner of all good; his propriety in it is absolute, 
 sovereign, and unlimited. 

 [2.] He may therefore give or withhold his blessings, as he pleases. 
 What we have, is not our <I>own,</I> and therefore <I>it is not lawful 
 for us to do what we will with</I> it; but what God has, is his own; 
 and this will justify him, <I>First,</I> In all the disposals of his 
 providence; when God takes from us that which was dear to us, and which 
 we could ill spare, we must silence our discontents with this; <I>May 
 he not do what he will with his own? Abstulit, sed et dedit--He hath
 taken away; but he originally gave.</I> It is not for such depending 
 creatures as we are to quarrel with our Sovereign. <I>Secondly,</I> In 
 all the dispensations of his grace, God gives or withholds the means of 
 grace, and the Spirit of grace, as he pleases. Not but that there is a 
 counsel in every will of God, and what seems to us to be done 
 arbitrarily, will appear at length to have been done wisely, and for 
 holy ends. But this is enough to silence all murmurs and objectors, 
 that God is sovereign Lord of all, and <I>may do what he will with his 
 own.</I> We are in his hand, as clay in the hands of a potter; and it 
 is not for us to prescribe to him, or strive with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He had no reason to envy his fellow servant, or to grudge at him; 
 or to be angry that he came into the vineyard no sooner; for he was not 
 sooner called; he had no reason to be angry that the master had given 
 him wages for the whole day, when he had idled away the greatest part 
 of it; for <I>Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</I> See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The nature of envy; It is an evil eye. The eye is often both the 
 inlet and the outlet of this sin. <I>Saul saw that David prospered, and 
 he eyed him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:9,15">1 Sam. xviii. 9, 15</A>.

 It is an evil eye, which is displeased at the good of others, and
 desires their hurt. What can have more evil in it? It is grief to 
 ourselves, anger to God, and ill-will to our neighbour; and it is a sin 
 that has neither pleasure, profit, nor honour, in it; <I>it is an evil, 
 an only evil.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The aggravation of it; "It is because I am good." Envy is 
 unlikeness to God, who is good, and doeth good, and delighteth in doing 
 good; nay, it is an opposition and contradiction to God; it is a 
 dislike of his proceedings, and a displeasure at what he does, and is 
 pleased with. It is a direct violation of both the two great 
 commandments at once; both that of love to God, in whose will we should 
 acquiesce, and love to our neighbour, in whose welfare we should 
 rejoice. Thus man's badness takes occasion from God's goodness to be 
 more exceedingly sinful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is the application of the parable
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 in that observation which occasioned it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:30"><I>ch.</I> xix. 30</A>);

 <I>So the first shall be last, and the last first.</I> There were many
 that followed Christ now in the regeneration, when the gospel kingdom 
 was first set up, and these Jewish converts seemed to have got the 
 start of others; but Christ, to obviate and silence their boasting, 
 here tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they might possibly be outstripped by their successors in 
 profession, and, though they were before others in profession, might be 
 found inferior to them in knowledge, grace, and holiness. The Gentile 
 church, which was as yet unborn, the Gentile world, which as yet stood 
 <I>idle in the market-place,</I> would produce greater numbers of 
 eminent, useful Christians, than were found among the Jews. More and 
 more excellent shall be <I>the children of the desolate than those of 
 the married wife,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1">Isa. liv. 1</A>.

 Who knows but that the church, in its old age, may be more fat and
 flourishing than ever, to show that the Lord is upright? Though 
 primitive Christianity had more of the purity and power of that holy 
 religion than is to be found in the degenerate age wherein we live, yet 
 what <I>labourers</I> may be <I>sent into the vineyard in the eleventh 
 hour of the church's day,</I> in the Philadelphian period, and what 
 plentiful effusions of the Spirit may then be, above what has been yet, 
 who can tell?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they had reason to fear, lest they themselves should be found 
 hypocrites at last; for <I>many are called but few chosen.</I> This is 
 applied to the Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:14"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 14</A>);

 it was so then, it is too true still; many are called with a common
 call, that are not chosen with a saving choice. All that are chosen
 from eternity, are effectually called, <I>in the fulness of time</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:30">Rom. viii. 30</A>),

 so that in making our effectual calling sure we <I>make sure our
 election</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:10">2 Pet. i. 10</A>);

 but it is not so as to the outward call; <I>many are called,</I> and
 yet refuse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:24">Prov. i. 24</A>),

 nay, as they are called <I>to</I> God, so they go <I>from</I> him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:2,7">Hos. xi. 2, 7</A>),

 by which it appears that they were not chosen, for <I>the election will
 obtain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:7">Rom. xi. 7</A>.

 Note, There are but few <I>chosen</I> Christians, in comparison with
 the many that are only <I>called</I> Christians; it therefore highly 
 concerns us to build our hope for heaven upon the rock of an eternal 
 choice, and not upon the sand of an external call; and we should fear 
 lest we be found but seeming Christians, and so should really come 
 short; nay, lest we be found blemished Christians, and so should 
 <I>seem to come short,</I>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples
 apart in the way, and said unto them,
 &nbsp; 18  Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be
 betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they
 shall condemn him to death,
 &nbsp; 19  And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to
 scourge, and to crucify <I>him:</I> and the third day he shall rise
 again.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the third time that Christ gave his disciples notice of his 
 approaching sufferings; he was not going up to Jerusalem to celebrate 
 the passover, and to offer up himself the great Passover; both must be 
 done at Jerusalem: there <I>the passover must be kept</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:5">Deut. xii. 5</A>),
 
 and there a prophet must perish, because there the great Sanhedrim sat,
 who were judges in that case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:33">Luke xiii. 33</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The privacy of this prediction; <I>He took the twelve disciples 
 apart in the way.</I> This was one of those things which were told to 
 them in <I>darkness,</I> but which they were afterward to <I>speak in 
 the light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:27"><I>ch.</I> x. 27</A>.

 His secret was with them, as his friends, and this particularly. It was
 a hard saying, and, if any could bear it, they could. They would be 
 more immediately exposed to peril with him, and therefore it was 
 requisite that they should know of it, that, being fore-warned, they 
 might be fore-armed. It was not fit to be spoken publicly as yet, 1. 
 Because many that were cool toward him, would hereby have been driven 
 to turn their backs upon him; the scandal of the cross would have 
 frightened them from following him any longer. 

 2. Because many that were hot for him, would hereby be driven to take
 up arms in his defense, and it might have occasioned <I>an uproar among 
 the people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:5"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 5</A>),

 which would have been laid to his charge, if he had told them of it
 publicly before: and, besides that such methods are utterly 
 disagreeable to the genius of his kingdom, which is not of this world, 
 he never countenanced any thing which had a tendency to prevent his 
 sufferings. This discourse was not in the synagogue, or in the house, 
 but <I>in the way,</I> as they travelled along; which teaches us, in 
 our walks or travels with our friends, to keep up such discourse as 
 <I>is good, and to the use of edifying.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+16:7">Deut. xvi. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prediction itself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is but a repetition of what he had once and again said before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:21,17:22,23"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 21; xvii. 22, 23</A>.

 This intimates that he not only saw clearly what troubles lay before
 him, but that his heart was upon his suffering-work; it filled him, not 
 with fear, then he would have studied to avoid it, and could have done 
 it, but with desire and expectation; he spoke thus frequently of his 
 sufferings, because through them he was to enter into his glory. Note, 
 It is good for us to be often thinking and speaking of our death, and 
 of the sufferings which, it is likely, we may meet with betwixt this 
 and the grave; and thus, by making them more familiar, they would 
 become less formidable. This is one way of dying daily, and of taking
 up our cross daily, to be daily speaking of the cross, and of dying; 
 which would come neither the sooner nor the surer, but much the better, 
 for our thoughts and discourses of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is more particular here in foretelling his sufferings than any 
 time before. He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:21"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 21</A>),

 that he <I>should suffer many things, and be killed;</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:22"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 22</A>),

 that he should <I>be betrayed into the hands of men, and they should
 kill him;</I> but here he adds; that he shall be <I>condemned, and 
 delivered to the Gentiles,</I> that <I>they shall mock him, and scourge 
 him, and crucify him.</I> These are frightful things, and the certain 
 foresight of them was enough to damp an ordinary resolution, yet (as 
 was foretold concerning him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:4">Isa. xlii. 4</A>)

 <I>he did not fail, nor was discouraged;</I> but the more clearly he
 foresaw his sufferings, the more cheerfully he went forth to meet them. 
 He foretels by whom he should suffer, by <I>the chief priests and the 
 scribes;</I> so he had said before, but here he adds, <I>They shall 
 deliver him to the Gentiles,</I> that he might be the better 
 understood; for the chief priests and scribes had no power to put him 
 to death, nor was crucifying a manner of death in use among the Jews. 
 Christ suffered from the malice both of Jews and Gentiles, because he 
 was to suffer for the salvation both of Jews and Gentiles; both had a 
 hand in his death, because he was to reconcile both by his cross, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:16">Eph. ii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here, as before, he annexes the mention of his resurrection and his 
 glory to that of his death and sufferings; <I>The third day he shall 
 rise again.</I> He still brings this in, 

 (1.) To encourage himself in his sufferings, and to carry him
 cheerfully through them. <I>He endured the cross for the joy set before 
 him;</I> he foresaw he should rise again, and rise quickly, the third 
 day. He shall be straightway glorified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:32">John xiii. 32</A>.
 
 The reward is not only sure, but very near.

 (2.) To encourage his disciples, and comfort them, who would be
 overwhelmed and greatly terrified by his sufferings.

 (3.) To direct us, under all <I>the sufferings of this present
 time,</I> to keep up a believing prospect of <I>the glory to be 
 revealed,</I> to look at <I>the things that are not seen, that are 
 eternal,</I> which will enable us to call the present afflictions 
 light, and but for a moment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her
 sons, worshipping <I>him,</I> and desiring a certain thing of him.
 &nbsp; 21  And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him,
 Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand,
 and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
 &nbsp; 22  But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye
 able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be
 baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto
 him, We are able.
 &nbsp; 23  And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and
 be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit
 on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but <I>it
 shall be given to them</I> for whom it is prepared of my Father.
 &nbsp; 24  And when the ten heard <I>it,</I> they were moved with
 indignation against the two brethren.
 &nbsp; 25  But Jesus called them <I>unto him,</I> and said, Ye know that the
 princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they
 that are great exercise authority upon them.
 &nbsp; 26  But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be
 great among you, let him be your minister;
 &nbsp; 27  And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your
 servant:
 &nbsp; 28  Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but
 to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, is first, the request of the two disciples to Christ, and the 
 rectifying of the mistake upon which that was grounded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:20-23"><I>v.</I> 20-23</A>.

 The sons of Zebedee were James and John, two of the first three of 
 Christ's disciples; Peter and they were his favourites; John was the 
 disciple whom Jesus loved; yet none were so often reproved as they; 
 whom Christ loves best he reproves most,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:19">Rev. iii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the ambitious address they made to Christ--that they might
 sit, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left, in his 
 kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 It was a great degree of faith, that they were confident of his 
 kingdom, though now he appeared in meanness; but a great degree of 
 ignorance, that they still expected a temporal kingdom, with worldly 
 pomp and power, when Christ had so often told them of sufferings and 
 self-denial. In this they expected to be grandees. They ask not for 
 employment in this kingdom, but for honour only; and no place would 
 serve them in this imaginary kingdom, but the highest, next to Christ, 
 and above every body else. It is probable that the last word in 
 Christ's foregoing discourse gave occasion to this request, that <I>the 
 third day he should rise again.</I> They concluded that his 
 resurrection would be his entrance upon his kingdom, and therefore were 
 resolved to put in betimes for the best place; nor would they lose it 
 for want of speaking early. What Christ said to comfort them, they thus 
 abused, and were puffed up with. Some cannot bear comforts, but they 
 turn them to a wrong purpose; as sweetmeats in a foul stomach produce 
 bile. Now observe,</P>

 1. There was policy in the management of this address, that they put 
 their mother on to present it, that it might be looked upon as her 
 request, and not theirs. Though proud people think well of themselves, 
 they would not be thought to do so, and therefore affect nothing more 
 than <I>a show of humility</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:18">Col. ii. 18</A>),

 and others must be put on to court that honour for them, which they are
 ashamed to court for themselves. The mother of James and John was 
 Salome, as appears by comparing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:61,Mk+15:40"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 61, with Mark xv. 40</A>.

 Some think she was daughter of Cleophas or Alpheus, and sister or
 cousin german to Mary the mother of our Lord. She was one of those 
 women that attended Christ, and ministered to him; and they thought she 
 had such an interest in him, that he could deny her nothing, and 
 therefore they made her their advocate. Thus when Adonijah had 
 reasonable request to make to Solomon, he put Bathsheba on to speak for 
 him. It was their mother's weakness thus to become that tool of their 
 ambition, which she should have given a check to. Those that are wise 
 and good, would not be seen in an ill-favoured thing. In gracious 
 requests, we should learn this wisdom, to desire the prayers of those 
 that have an interest at the throne of grace; we should beg of our 
 praying friends to pray for us, and reckon it a real kindness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was likewise policy to ask first for a general grant, that he would 
 do a <I>certain</I> thing for them, not in faith, but in presumption, 
 upon that general promise; <I>Ask, and it shall be given you;</I> in 
 which is implied this qualification of our request, that it be 
 according to the revealed will of God, otherwise we <I>ask and have 
 not,</I> if we ask to <I>consume it upon our lusts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:3">Jam. iv. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There was pride at the bottom of it, a proud conceit of their own 
 merit, a proud contempt of their brethren, and a proud desire of honour 
 and preferment; pride is a sin that most easily besets us, and which it 
 is hard to get clear of. It is a holy ambition to strive to excel 
 others in grace and holiness; but it is a sinful ambition to covet to 
 exceed others in pomp and grandeur. <I>Seekest thou great things for 
 thyself,</I> when thou hast just now heard of thy Master's being 
 mocked, and scourged, and crucified? For shame! <I>Seek them not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+45:5">Jer. xlv. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's answer to this address 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>),

 directed not to the mother, but to the sons that set her on. Though 
 others be our mouth in prayer, the answer will be given to us according 
 as we stand effected. Christ's answer is very mild; they were
 overtaken in the fault of ambition, but Christ <I>restored them with 
 the spirit of meekness.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he reproved the ignorance and error of their petition; <I>Ye 
 know not what ye ask.</I> 

 (1.) They were much in the dark concerning the kingdom they had their
 eye upon; they dreamed of a temporal kingdom, whereas Christ's kingdom 
 is not of this world. They knew not what it was to sit on his right 
 hand, and on his left; they talked of it as blind men do of colours. 
 Our apprehensions of that glory which is yet to be revealed, are like 
 the apprehensions which a child has of the preferments of grown men. If 
 at length, through grace, we arrive at perfection, we shall then put 
 away such childish fancies: when we come to see face to face, we shall 
 know what we enjoy; but now, alas, we know not what we ask; we can but 
 ask for the good as it lies in the promise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:2">Tit. i. 2</A>.

 What it will be in the performance, eye has not seen, nor ear heard.

 (2.) They were much in the dark concerning the way to that kingdom.
 <I>They</I> know not what they ask, who ask for the end, but overlook 
 the means, and so put asunder what God has joined together. The 
 disciples thought, when they had left what little <I>all</I> they had 
 for Christ, and had gone about the country awhile preaching the gospel 
 of the kingdom, all their service and sufferings were over, and it was 
 now time to ask, <I>What shall we have?</I> As if nothing were now to 
 be looked for but crowns and garlands; whereas there were far greater 
 hardships and difficulties before them than they had yet met with. They 
 imagined their warfare was accomplished when it was scarcely begun, and 
 they had yet but run with the footmen. They dream of being in Canaan 
 presently, and consider not what they shall do in the swellings of 
 Jordan. Note,

 [1.] We are all apt, when we are but <I>girding on the harness, to 
 boast</I> as though we <I>had put it off.</I> 

 [2.] We know not what we ask, when we ask for the glory of wearing the 
 crown, and ask not for grace to bear the cross in our way to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he repressed the vanity and ambition of their request. They were 
 pleasing themselves with the fancy of sitting on his right hand, and on 
 his left, in great state; now, to check this, he leads them to the 
 thoughts of their sufferings, and leaves them in the dark about their 
 glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He leads them to the thoughts of their sufferings, which they were 
 not so mindful of as they ought to have been. They looked so earnestly 
 upon the crown, the prize, that they were ready to plunge headlong and 
 unprepared into the foul way that led to it; and therefore he thinks it 
 necessary to put them in mind of the hardships that were before them, 
 that they might be no surprise or terror to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 [1.] How fairly he puts the matter to them, concerning these 
 difficulties 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);

 "You would stand candidates for the first post of honour in the 
 kingdom; but <I>are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink 
 of?</I> You talk of what great things you must have when you have done 
 your work; but are you able to hold out to the end of it?" Put the 
 matter seriously to yourselves. These same two disciples once knew not 
 what manner of spirit they were of, when they were disturbed with 
 anger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:55">Luke ix. 55</A>;

 and now they were not aware what was amiss in their spirits when they
 were lifted up with ambition. Christ sees that pride in us which we 
 discern not in ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, <I>First,</I> That to suffer for Christ is <I>to drink of a 
 cup,</I> and <I>to be baptized with a baptism.</I> In this description 
 of sufferings, 

 1. It is true, that affliction doth abound. It is supposed to be a 
 bitter cup, that is drunk of, wormwood and gall, those waters of a full 
 cup, that are wrung out to God's people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+43:10">Ps. xliii. 10</A>);

 a cup of trembling indeed, but not of fire and brimstone, the portion
 of the cup of wicked men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:6">Ps. xi. 6</A>.

 It is supposed to be a baptism, a washing with the waters of
 affliction; some are dipped in them; the waters compass them about even 
 to the soul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:5">Jonah ii. 5</A>);

 others have but a sprinkling of them; both are baptism, some are
 overwhelmed in them, as in a deluge, others ill wet, as in a sharp 
 shower. But, 

 2. Even in this, <I>consolation doth more abound.</I> It is but a cup,
 not an ocean; it is but a draught, bitter perhaps, but we shall see the 
 bottom of it; it is a cup in the hand of a Father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:11">John xviii. 11</A>);
 
 and it is full of mixture, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:8">Ps. lxxv. 8</A>.

 It is but a baptism; if dipped, that is the worst of it, not drowned; 
 perplexed, but not in despair. Baptism is an ordinance by which we join 
 ourselves to the Lord in covenant and communion; and so is suffering 
 for Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:37,Isa+48:10">Ezek. xx. 37; Isa. xlviii. 10</A>.

 Baptism is "an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual
 grace;" and so is suffering for Christ, for <I>unto us it is given,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:29">Phil. i. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> It is to drink of the same cup that Christ drank of, 
 and to be baptized with the same baptism that he was baptized with. 
 Christ is beforehand with us in suffering, and in that as in other 
 things left us an example. 

 1. It bespeaks the condescension of a suffering Christ, that he would
 drink of such a cup

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:11">John xviii. 11</A>),

 nay, and such a brook

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:7">Ps. cx. 7</A>),

 and drink so deep, and yet so cheerfully; that he would be baptized
 with such a baptism, and was so forward to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:50">Luke xii. 50</A>.

 It was much that he would be baptized with water as a common sinner,
 much more with blood as an uncommon malefactor. But in all this he was 
 made <I>in the likeness of sinful flesh,</I> and <I>was made sin for 
 us.</I> 

 2. It bespeaks the consolation of suffering Christians, that they do
 but pledge Christ in the bitter cup, are <I>partakers of his 
 sufferings,</I> and <I>fill up that which is behind</I> of them; we 
 must therefore arm ourselves with the same mind, and <I>go to him 
 without the camp.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> It is good for us to be often putting it to ourselves,
 whether we are able to drink of this cup, and to be baptized with this 
 baptism.  We must expect suffering, and not look upon it as a hard 
 thing to suffer well and as becomes us. Are we able to suffer 
 cheerfully, and in the worst of times still to hold fast our integrity? 
 What can we afford to part with for Christ? How far will we give him 
 credit? Could I find in my heart to drink of a bitter cup, and to be 
 baptized with a bloody baptism, rather than let go my hold of Christ? 
 The truth is, Religion, if it be worth any thing, is worth every thing; 
 but it is worth little, if it be not worth suffering for. Now let us 
 sit down, and count the cost of dying for Christ rather than denying 
 him, and ask, Can we take him upon these terms?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] See how boldly they engage for themselves; they said, <I>We are 
 able,</I> in hopes of sitting on his right hand, and on his left; but 
 at the same time they fondly hoped that they should never be tried. As 
 before they knew not what they asked, so now they knew not what they 
 answered. <I>We are able;</I> they would have done well to put in, 
 "<I>Lord, by thy strength,</I> and <I>in thy grace, we are able,</I> 
 otherwise we are not." But the same that was Peter's temptation, to be 
 confident of his own sufficiency, and presume upon his own strength, 
 was here the temptation of James and John; and it is a sin we are all 
 prone to. They knew not what Christ's cup was, nor what his baptism, 
 and therefore they were thus bold in promising for themselves. But 
 those are commonly most confident, that are least acquainted with the 
 cross.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] See how plainly and positively their sufferings are here foretold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 <I>Ye shall drink of my cup.</I> Sufferings foreseen will be the more 
 easily borne, especially if looked upon under a right notion, as 
 drinking of his cup, and being baptized with his baptism. Christ began 
 in suffering for us, and expects we should pledge him in suffering for 
 him. Christ will have us know the worst, that we may make the best of 
 our way to heaven; <I>Ye shall drink;</I> that is, ye shall suffer. 
 James drank the bloody cup first of all the apostles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:2">Acts xii. 2</A>.

 John, though at last he died in his bed, if we may credit the
 ecclesiastical historians, yet often drank of this bitter cup, as when 
 he was banished into the isle of Patmos

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:9">Rev. i. 9</A>),

 and when (as they say) at Ephesus he was put into a caldron of boiling 
 oil, but was miraculously preserved. He was, as the rest of the 
 apostles, in deaths often. He took the cup, offered himself to the 
 baptism, and it was accepted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He leaves them in the dark about the degrees of their glory. To 
 carry them cheerfully through their sufferings, it was enough to be 
 assured that they should have <I>a place in his kingdom.</I> The lowest 
 seat in heaven is an abundant recompence for the greatest sufferings on 
 earth. But as to the preferments there, it was not fit there should be 
 any intimation given for whom they were intended; for the infirmity of 
 their present state could not bear such a discovery with any evenness; 
 "<I>To sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give,</I> and 
 therefore it is not for you to ask it or to know it; <I>but it shall be 
 given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</I>" Note, 

 [1.] It is very probable that there are degrees of glory in heaven; for 
 our Saviour seems to allow that there are some that shall sit on his 
 right hand and on his left, in the highest places. 

 [2.] As the future glory itself, so the degrees of it, are purposed and 
 prepared in the eternal counsel of God; as the common salvation, so the 
 more peculiar honours, are appointed, the whole affair is long since 
 settled, and there is a certain measure of the stature, both in grace 
 and glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:13">Eph. iv. 13</A>.

 [3.] Christ, in dispensing the fruits of his own purchase, goes exactly
 by the measures of his Father's purpose; <I>It is not mine to give, 
 save to them</I> (so it may be read) <I>for whom it is prepared.</I> 
 Christ has the sole power of giving eternal life, but then it is <I>to 
 as many as were given him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:2">John xvii. 2</A>.

 <I>It is not mine to give,</I> that is, to <I>promise</I> now; that
 matter is already settled and concerted, and the Father and Son 
 understand one another perfectly well in this matter. "It is not mine 
 to give to those that seek and are ambitious of it, but to those that 
 by great humility and self-denial are prepared for it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here are the reproof and instruction which Christ gave to the 
 other ten disciples for their displeasure at the request of James and 
 John. He had much to bear with in them all, they were so weak in 
 knowledge and grace, yet he bore their manners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The fret that the ten disciples were in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>).

 <I>They were moved with indignation against the two brethren;</I> not 
 because they were desirous to be preferred, which was their sin, and 
 for which Christ was displeased with them, but because they were 
 desirous to be preferred <I>before them,</I> which was a reflection 
 upon them. Many seem to have indignation at sin; but it is not because 
 it is sin, but because it touches them. They will inform against a man 
 that swears; but it is only if he swear at them, and affront them, not 
 because he dishonours God. These disciples were angry at their 
 brethren's ambition, though they themselves, bay <I>because</I> they 
 themselves, were as ambitious. Note, It is common for people to be
 angry at those sins in others which they allow of and indulge in 
 themselves. Those that are proud and covetous themselves do not care to 
 see others so. Nothing makes more mischief among brethren, or is the 
 cause of more indignation and contention, than ambition, and desire of 
 greatness. We never find Christ's disciples quarreling, but something 
 of this was at the bottom of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The check that Christ gave them, which was very gentle, rather by 
 way of instruction what they should be, than by way of reprehension for 
 what they were. He had reproved this very sin before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:3"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 3</A>),

 and told them they must be humble as little children; yet they relapsed
 into it, and yet he reproved them for it thus mildly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>He called them unto him,</I> which intimates great tenderness and 
 familiarity. He did not, in anger, bid them get out of his presence, 
 but called them, in love, to come into his presence: for 
 <I>therefore</I> he is fit to teach, and we are invited to learn of 
 him, because <I>he is meek and lowly in heart.</I> What he had to say 
 concerned both the two disciples and the ten, and therefore he will 
 have them all together. And he tells them, that, whereas they were 
 asking which of them should have dominion a temporal kingdom, there was 
 really no such dominion reserved for any of them. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They must not be <I>like the princes of the Gentiles.</I> Christ's 
 disciples must not be like Gentiles, no not like princes of the 
 Gentiles. Principality doth no more become ministers than Gentilism 
 doth Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 [1.] What is the way of the princes of the Gentiles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 to <I>exercise dominion and authority</I> over their subjects, and (if 
 they can but win the upper hand with a strong hand) over one another 
 too. That which bears them up in it is, that they are great, and great 
 men think they may do any thing. Dominion and authority are the great 
 things which the princes of the Gentiles pursue, and pride themselves 
 in; they would bear sway, would carry all before them, have every body 
 truckle to them, and every sheaf bow to theirs. They would have it 
 cried before them, <I>Bow the knee;</I> like Nebuchadnezzar, who slew, 
 and kept alive, at pleasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What is the will of Christ concerning his apostles and ministers, 
 in this matter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First, "It shall not be so among you.</I> The constitution of the 
 spiritual kingdom is quite different from this. You are to teach the 
 subjects of this kingdom, to instruct and beseech them, to counsel and 
 comfort them, to take pains with them, and suffer with them, not to 
 exercise dominion or authority over them; you are not to <I>lord it 
 over God's heritage</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:3">1 Pet. v. 3</A>),

 but to labour in it." This forbids not only tyranny, and abuse of
 power, but the claim or use of any such secular authority as the 
 princes of the Gentiles lawfully exercise. So hard is it for vain men, 
 even good men, to have such authority, and not to be puffed up with it, 
 and do more hurt than good with it, that our Lord Jesus saw fit wholly 
 to banish it out of his church. Paul himself disowns dominion over the
 faith of any, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:24">2 Cor. i. 24</A>.

 The pomp and grandeur of the princes of the Gentiles ill become
 Christ's disciples. Now, if there were no such power and honour
 intended to be in the church, it was nonsense for them to be striving 
 who should have it. <I>They knew not what they asked.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> How then shall it be among the disciples of Christ?
 Something of greatness among them Christ himself had intimated, and 
 here he explains it; "<I>He that will be great among you,</I> that 
 <I>will be chief,</I> that would really be so, and would be found to be 
 so at last, <I>let him be your minister, your servant,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 Here observe, 

 1. That it is the duty of Christ's disciples to serve one another, for 
 mutual edification. This includes both humility and usefulness. The 
 followers of Christ must be ready to stoop to the meanest offices of 
 love for the good one of another, must <I>submit one to another</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:5,Eph+5:21">1 Pet. v. 5; Eph. v. 21</A>),

 and <I>edify one another</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:19">Rom. xiv. 19</A>),
 
 <I>please one another</I> for good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:2">Rom. xv. 2</A>.

 The great apostle made himself every one's servant; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:19">1 Cor. ix. 19</A>.

 2. It is the dignity of Christ's disciples faithfully to discharge
 this duty. The way to be great and chief is to be humble and 
 serviceable. Those are to be best accounted of, and most respected, in
 the church, and will be so by all that understand things aright; not 
 those that are dignified with high and mighty names, like the names of 
 the great ones of the earth, that appear in pomp, and assume to 
 themselves a power proportionable, but those that are most humble and 
 self-denying, and lay out themselves most to do good, though to the 
 diminishing of themselves. These honour God most, and those he will 
 honour. As he must become a fool that would be wise, so he must become 
 a servant that would be chief. St. Paul was a great example of this;
 he <I>laboured more abundantly than they all,</I> made himself (as some 
 would call it) a drudge to his work; and is not he chief? Do we not by 
 consent call him the <I>great</I> apostle, though he called himself 
 <I>less than the least?</I> And perhaps our Lord Jesus had an eye to 
 him, when he said, There were <I>last</I> that should be <I>first;</I> 
 for Paul was <I>one born out of due time</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:8">1 Cor. xv. 8</A>);

 not only the youngest child of the family of the apostles, but a
 posthumous one, yet he became greatest. And perhaps he it was for whom 
 the first post of honour in Christ's kingdom was reserved and prepared 
 of his Father, not for James who sought it; and therefore just before 
 Paul began to be famous as an apostle, Providence ordered it so that 
 James was cut off

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:2">Acts xii. 2</A>),

 that in the college of the twelve Paul might be substituted in his
 room.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They must be like the Master himself; and it is very fit that they 
 should, that, while they were in the world, they should be as he was 
 when he was in the world; for to both the present state is a state of 
 humiliation, the crown and glory were reserved for both in the future 
 state. Let them consider that the <I>Son of Man came not to be 
 ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for 
 many,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Our Lord Jesus here sets himself before his disciples as a pattern of 
 those two things before recommended, humility, and usefulness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Never was there such an example of humility and condescension as 
 there was in the life of Christ, who came not to be <I>ministered unto, 
 but to minister.</I> When the Son of God came into the world, his 
 Ambassador to the children of men, one would think he should have been 
 ministered to, should have appeared in an equipage agreeable to his 
 person and character; but he did not so; he made no figure, had no 
 pompous train of state-servants to attend him, nor was he clad in robes 
 of honour, for he took upon him the <I>form of a servant.</I> He was 
 indeed ministered to as a poor man, which was a part of his 
 humiliation; there were those that <I>ministered to him of their 
 substance</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:2,3">Luke viii. 2, 3</A>);

 but he was never ministered to as a great man; he never took state upon
 him, was not waited on at table; he once washed his disciples' feet, 
 but we never read that they washed his feet. He came to minister help 
 to all that were in distress; he made himself a servant to the sick and 
 diseased; was as ready to their requests as ever any servant was at the 
 beck of his master, and took as much pains to serve them; he attended 
 continually to this very thing, and denied himself both food and rest 
 to attend to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Never was there such an example of beneficence and usefulness as 
 there was in the death of Christ, who <I>gave his life a ransom for 
 many.</I> He lived as a servant, and went about doing good; but he died 
 as a sacrifice, and in that he did the greatest good of all. He came 
 into the world on purpose to give his life a ransom; it was first in 
 his intention. The aspiring princes of the Gentiles make the lives of 
 many a ransom for their own honour, and perhaps a sacrifice to their 
 own humour. Christ doth not do so; his subjects' blood is precious to 
 him, and he is not prodigal of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:14">Ps. lxxii. 14</A>);

 but on the contrary, he gives his honour and life too ransom for his
 subjects. Note, <I>First,</I> Jesus Christ laid down his life for a 
 ransom. Our lives were forfeited into the hands of divine justice by 
 sin. Christ, by parting with his life, made atonement for sin, and so 
 rescued ours; <I>he was made sin, and a curse for us,</I> and died, not 
 only <I>for our good, but in our stead,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28,1Pe+1:18,19">Acts xx. 28; 1 Pet. i. 18, 19</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> It was a ransom for many, sufficient for all,
 effectual for many; and, if for many, then, saith the poor doubting 
 soul, "Why not for me?" It was for many, that by him many may be made 
 righteous. These many were his seed, for which his soul travailed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10,11">Isa. liii. 10, 11</A>);

 for many, so they will be when they come all together, though now they
 appear but a little flock.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this is a good reason why we should not strive for precedency, 
 because the cross is our banner, and our Master's death is our life. It 
 is a good reason why we should study to do good, and, in consideration 
 of the love of Christ in dying for us, not hesitate <I>to lay down our 
 lives for the brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:16">1 John iii. 16</A>.

 Ministers should be more forward than others to serve and suffer for
 the good of souls, as blessed Paul was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:24,Php+2:17">Acts xx. 24; Phil. ii. 17</A>.

 The nearer we are all concerned in, and the more we are advantaged by,
 the humility and humiliation of Christ, the more ready and careful we 
 should be to imitate it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude
 followed him.
 &nbsp; 30  And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when
 they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on
 us, O Lord, <I>thou</I> Son of David.
 &nbsp; 31  And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold
 their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O
 Lord, <I>thou</I> Son of David.
 &nbsp; 32  And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will
 ye that I shall do unto you?
 &nbsp; 33  They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
 &nbsp; 34  So Jesus had compassion <I>on them,</I> and touched their eyes:
 and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the cure of two poor blind beggars; in which 
 we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their address to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>.
 
 And in this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The circumstances of it are observable. It was as Christ and his 
 disciples departed from Jericho; of that devoted place, which was 
 rebuilt under a curse, Christ took his leave with this blessing, for he 
 received gifts even for the rebellious. It was in the presence of <I>a 
 great multitude that followed him;</I> Christ had a numerous, though 
 not a pompous, attendance, and did good to them, though he did not take 
 state to himself. This multitude that followed him for loaves, and some 
 for love, some for curiosity, and some in expectation of his temporal 
 reign, which the disciples themselves dreamed of, very few with desire 
 to be taught their duty; yet, for the sake of those few, he confirmed 
 his doctrine by miracles wrought in the presence of great multitudes; 
 who, if they were not convinced by them, would be the more inexcusable. 
 Two blind men concurred in their request; for joint-prayer is pleasing 
 to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:19"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 19</A>.

 These joint-sufferers were joint-suitors; being companions in the same
 tribulation, they were partners in the same supplication. Note, It is 
 good for those that are labouring under the same calamity, or infirmity 
 of body or mind, to join together in the same prayer to God for relief, 
 that they may quicken one another's fervency, and encourage one 
 another's faith. There is mercy enough in Christ for all the 
 petitioners. These blind men were <I>sitting by the way-side,</I> as 
 blind beggars used to do. Note, Those that would receive mercy from 
 Christ, must place themselves there where his out-goings are; where he 
 manifests himself to those that seek him. It is good thus to way-lay 
 Christ, to be in his road.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>They heard that Jesus passed by.</I> Though they were blind, they 
 were not deaf. Seeing and hearing are the learning senses. It is a 
 great calamity to want either; but the defect of one may be, and often 
 is, made up in the acuteness of the other; and therefore it has been 
 observed by some as an instance of the goodness of Providence, that 
 none were ever known to be born both blind and deaf; but that, one way 
 or other, all are in a capacity of receiving knowledge. These blind men 
 had heard of Christ by the hearing of the ear, but they desired that 
 their eyes might see him. <I>When they heard that Jesus passed by,</I> 
 they asked no further questions, who were with him, or whether he was 
 in haste, but immediately <I>cried out.</I> Note, It is good to improve 
 the present opportunity, to make the best of the price now in the hand, 
 because, if once let slip, it may never return; these blind men did so, 
 and did wisely; for we do not find that Christ ever came to Jericho 
 again. <I>Now is the accepted time.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The address itself is more observable; <I>Have mercy on us, O Lord, 
 thou Son of David,</I> repeated again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Four things are recommended to us for an example in this address; for, 
 though the eye of the body was dark, the eye of the mind was 
 enlightened concerning truth, duty, and interest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is an example of importunity in prayer. They cried out as men 
 in earnest; men in want are earnest, of course. Cold desires do but beg 
 denials. Those that would prevail in prayer, must stir up themselves to 
 take hold on God in duty. When they were discountenanced in it, they 
 cried the more. The stream of fervency, if it be stopped, will rise and 
 swell the higher. This wrestling with God in prayer, and makes us the 
 fitter to receive mercy; for the more it is striven for, the more it 
 will be prized and thankfully acknowledged.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Of humility in prayer; in that word, <I>Have mercy on us,</I> not 
 specifying the favour, or prescribing what, much less pleading merit, 
 but casting themselves upon, and referring themselves cheerfully to, 
 the Mediator's mercy, in what way he pleases; "Only have mercy." They 
 ask not for silver and gold, though they were poor, but mercy, mercy. 
 This is that which our hearts must be upon, when we come to <I>the 
 throne of grace, that we may find mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:16,Ps+130:7">Heb. iv. 16; Ps. cxxx. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Of faith in prayer; in the title they gave to Christ, which was in 
 the nature of a plea; <I>O Lord, thou Son o David;</I> they confess 
 that <I>Jesus Christ is Lord,</I> and therefore had authority to 
 command deliverance for them. Surely it was by the Holy Ghost that they 
 called Christ <I>Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:3">1 Cor. xii. 3</A>.

 Thus they take their encouragement in prayer from his power, as in
 calling him the Son of David they take encouragement from his goodness, 
 as Messiah, of whom so many kind and tender things had been foretold, 
 particularly his compassion to the poor and needy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:12,13">Ps. lxxii. 12, 13</A>.

 It is of excellent use, in prayer, to eye Christ in the grace and glory
 of his Messiahship; to remember that he is the Son of David, whose 
 office it is to help, and save, and to plead it with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Of perseverance in prayer, notwithstanding discouragement. <I>The 
 multitude rebuked them,</I> as noisy, clamorous, and impertinent, and 
 bid them <I>hold their peace,</I> and not disturb the Master, who 
 perhaps at first himself seemed not to regard them. In following Christ 
 with our prayers, we must expect to meet with hindrances and manifold 
 discouragements from within and from without, something or other that 
 bids us hold our peace. Such rebuke are permitted, that faith and 
 fervency, patience and perseverance, may be tried. These poor blind men 
 were rebuked by the multitude that followed Christ. Note, the sincere 
 and serious beggars at Christ's door commonly meet with the worst 
 rebukes from those that follow him but in pretence and hypocrisy. But
 they would not be beaten off so; when they were in pursuit of such a 
 mercy, it was no time to compliment, or to practise a timid delicacy; 
 no, <I>they cried the more.</I> Note, <I>Men ought always to pray, and 
 not to faint;</I> to <I>pray with all perseverance</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:1">Luke xviii. 1</A>);

 to continue in prayer with resolution, and not to yield to
 opposition.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The answer of Christ to this address of theirs. The multitude 
 rebuked them; but Christ encouraged them. It were sad for us, if the 
 Master were not more kind and tender than the multitude; but he loves 
 to countenance those with special favour, that are under frowns, and 
 rebukes, and contempts from men. He will not suffer his humble 
 supplicants to be run down, and put out of countenance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>He stood still, and called them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 He was now going up to Jerusalem, and was straitened till his work 
 there was accomplished; and yet he stood still to cure these blind men. 
 Note, When we are ever so much in haste about any business, yet we 
 should be willing to stand still to do good. <I>He called them,</I> not 
 because he could not cure them at a distance, but because he would do 
 it in the most obliging and instructive way, and would countenance weak 
 but willing patients and petitioners. Christ not only enjoins us to
 pray, but invites us; holds out the golden sceptre to us, and bids us 
 come touch the top of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He enquired further into their case; <I>What will ye that I shall do 
 unto you?</I> This implies, 

 (1.) A very fair offer; "Here I am; let me know what you would have, 
 and you shall have it." What would we more? He is able to do for us,
 and as willing as he is able; <I>Ask, and it shall be given you.</I>

 (2.) A condition annexed to this offer, which is a very easy and
 reasonable one--that they should tell him what they would have him do 
 for them. One would think this a strange question, any one might tell 
 what they would have. Christ knew well enough; but he would know it 
 from them, whether they begged only for alms, as from a common person, 
 or for a cure, as from the Messiah. Note, It is the will of God that we 
 should in every thing make our requests known to him by prayer and 
 supplication; not to inform or move him, but to qualify ourselves for 
 the mercy. The waterman in the boat, who with his hook takes hold of 
 the shore, does not thereby pull the shore to the boat, but the boat to 
 the shore. So in prayer we do not draw the mercy to ourselves, but 
 ourselves to the mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 They soon made known their request to him, such a one as they never 
 made to any one else; <I>Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</I> The 
 wants and burthens of the body we are soon sensible of, and can readily 
 relate; <I>Ubi dolor, ubi digitus--The finger promptly points to the
 seat of pain.</I> O that we were but as apprehensive of our spiritual 
 maladies, and could as feelingly complain of them, especially our 
 spiritual blindness! Lord, that the eyes of our mind may be opened! 
 Many are spiritually blind, and yet say they see, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:41">John ix. 41</A>.

 Were we but sensible of our darkness, we should soon apply ourselves to
 him, who alone has the eye-salve, with this request, <I>Lord, that our 
 eyes may be opened.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He cured them; when he encouraged them to seek him, he did not say, 
 <I>Seek in vain.</I> What he did was an instance,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Of his pity; <I>He had compassion on them.</I> Misery is the 
 object of mercy. They that are poor and blind are <I>wretched and 
 miserable</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17">Rev. iii. 17</A>),

 and the objects of compassion. It was the tender mercy of our God, that 
 gave light and sight to them that sat in darkness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:78,79">Luke i. 78, 79</A>.

 We cannot help those that are under such calamities, as Christ did; but
 we may and must pity them, as Christ did, and draw out our soul to 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Of his power; <I>He that formed the eye, can he not heal it?</I> 
 Yes, he can, he did, he did it easily, he touched their eyes; he did it 
 effectually, <I>Immediately their eyes received sight.</I> Thus he not
 only proved that he was sent of God, but showed on what errand he was 
 sent--to give sight to those that are spiritually blind, <I>to turn them
 from darkness to light.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> These blind men, when they had received sight,
 <I>followed him.</I> Note, None follow Christ blindfold. He first by 
 his grace opens men's eyes, and so draws their hearts after him. They 
 followed Christ, as his disciples, to learn of him, and as his 
 witnesses, eye-witnesses, to bear their testimony to him and to his 
 power and goodness. The best evidence of spiritual illumination is a 
 constant inseparable adherence to Jesus Christ as our Lord and 
 Leader.</P>
