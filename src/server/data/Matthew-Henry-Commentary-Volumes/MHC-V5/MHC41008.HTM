 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In those days the multitude being very great, and having
 nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples <I>unto him,</I> and saith
 unto them,
 &nbsp; 2  I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now
 been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:
 &nbsp; 3  And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they
 will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.
 &nbsp; 4  And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy
 these <I>men</I> with bread here in the wilderness?
 &nbsp; 5  And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said,
 Seven.
 &nbsp; 6  And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he
 took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to
 his disciples to set before <I>them;</I> and they did set <I>them</I>
 before the people.
 &nbsp; 7  And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and
 commanded to set them also before <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 8  So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
 broken <I>meat</I> that was left seven baskets.
 &nbsp; 9  And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent
 them away.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We had the story of a miracle very like this before, in this gospel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:35"><I>ch.</I> vi. 35</A>),
 
 and of this same miracle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:32">Matt. xv. 32</A>),

 and here is little or no addition or alternation as to the
 circumstances. Yet observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That our Lord Jesus was greatly followed; <I>The multitude was very 
 great</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 notwithstanding the wicked arts of the scribes and Pharisees to blemish 
 him, and to blast his interest, the common people, who had more 
 honesty, and therefore more true wisdom, than their leaders, kept up 
 their high thoughts of him. We may suppose that this multitude were 
 generally of the meaner sort of people, with such Christ conversed, and 
 was familiar; for thus he humbled himself, and made himself of no 
 reputation, and thus encouraged the meanest to come to him for life and 
 grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Those that followed him, underwent a great deal of difficulty in 
 following him; <I>They were with him three days, and had nothing to 
 eat,</I> that was hard service. Never let the Pharisee say, that 
 <I>Christ's disciples fast not.</I> There were those, probably, that 
 brought some food with them from home; but by this time it was all 
 spent, and they had a great way home; and yet they <I>continued</I> 
 with Christ, and did not speak of leaving him till he spoke of 
 dismissing them. Note, True zeal makes nothing of hardships in the way 
 of duty. They that have a full feast for their souls may be content 
 with slender provision for their bodies. It was an old saying among the 
 Puritans, <I>Grown bread and the gospel are good fare.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. As Christ has a <I>compassion</I> for all that are in wants and 
 straits, so he has a special <I>concern</I> for those that are reduced 
 to straits by their zeal and diligence in attending on him. Christ 
 said, <I>I have compassion on the multitude.</I> Whom the proud 
 Pharisees looked upon with disdain, the humble Jesus looked upon with 
 pity and tenderness; and thus must we <I>honour all men.</I> But that 
 which he chiefly considers, is, <I>They have been with me three days, 
 and have nothing to eat.</I> Whatever losses we sustain, or hardships 
 we go through, for Christ's sake, and in love to him, he will take care 
 that they shall be made up to us one way or other. <I>They that seek 
 the Lord, shall not</I> long <I>want any good thing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:10">Ps. xxxiv. 10</A>.
 
 Observe with what sympathy Christ saith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>If I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by
 the way,</I> for hunger. Christ knows and considers our frame; and he 
 is <I>for the body,</I> if we glorify him, <I>verily we shall be 
 fed.</I> He considered that <I>many of them came from afar,</I> and had 
 a great way home. When we see <I>multitudes</I> attending upon the word 
 preached, it is comfortable to think that Christ knows whence they all 
 come, though we do not. <I>I know thy works, and where thou 
 dwellest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:13">Rev. ii. 13</A>.

 Christ would by no means have them go home fasting, for it is not his 
 manner to send those <I>empty</I> way from him, that in a right manner 
 attend on him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The doubts of Christians are sometimes made to work for the 
 magnifying of the power of Christ. The disciples could not imagine
 whence so many men should be <I>satisfied with bread</I> here in the 
 wilderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 That therefore must needs be <I>wonderful,</I> and appear so much the 
 more so, which the disciples looked upon as <I>impossible.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Christ's time to act for the relief of his people, is, when things 
 are brought to the last extremity; when they were ready to 
 <I>faint,</I> Christ provided for them. That he might not invite them
 to follow him for the <I>loaves,</I> he did not supply them but when
 they were utterly reduced, and then he <I>sent them away.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The bounty of Christ is inexhaustible, and, to evidence that, Christ 
 <I>repeated</I> this miracle, to show that he is still the same for the 
 succour and supply of his people that attend upon him. His favours are 
 renewed, as our wants and necessities are. In the former miracle, 
 Christ used all the bread he had, which was <I>five loaves,</I> and fed 
 all the guests he had, which were <I>five thousand,</I> and so he did 
 now; though he might have said, "If five loaves would feed five 
 thousand, four may feed four thousand;" he took all the seven loaves, 
 and fed with them the four thousand; for he would teach us to take 
 things as they are, and accommodate ourselves to them; to use what we 
 have, and make the best of that which is. Here it was, as in the 
 dispensing of manna, <I>He that gathered much had nothing over, and he 
 that gathered little had no lack.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. In our Father's house, in our Master's house, <I>there is bread 
 enough, and to spare;</I> there is a fulness in Christ, which he 
 communicates to all that passes through his hands; so that from it we 
 receive, and <I>grace for grace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16">John i. 16</A>.

 Those need not fear wanting, that have Christ to live upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. It is good for those that follow Christ, <I>to keep together;</I> 
 these followers of Christ continued in a body, <I>four thousand</I> of 
 them together, and Christ fed them all. Christ's sheep must abide by 
 the flock, and go forth by their footsteps, and verily they shall be 
 fed.</P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples,
 and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
 &nbsp; 11  And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with
 him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
 &nbsp; 12  And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
 generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall
 no sign be given unto this generation.
 &nbsp; 13  And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed
 to the other side.
 &nbsp; 14  Now <I>the disciples</I> had forgotten to take bread, neither had
 they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
 &nbsp; 15  And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven
 of the Pharisees, and <I>of</I> the leaven of Herod.
 &nbsp; 16  And they reasoned among themselves, saying, <I>It is</I> because
 we have no bread.
 &nbsp; 17  And when Jesus knew <I>it,</I> he saith unto them, Why reason ye,
 because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither
 understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?
 &nbsp; 18  Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and
 do ye not remember?
 &nbsp; 19  When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many
 baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.
 &nbsp; 20  And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets
 full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.
 &nbsp; 21  And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Still Christ is upon motion; now he visits the parts of Dalmanutha, 
 that no corner of the land of Israel might say that they had not had
 his presence with them. He came thither <I>by ship</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 but, meeting with occasions of dispute there, and not with 
 opportunities of doing good, he <I>entered into the ship again</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 and came back. In these verses, we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he refused to gratify the Pharisees, who challenged him to give 
 them a <I>sign from heaven.</I> They <I>came forth</I> on purpose to 
 <I>question with him;</I> not to propose questions to him, that they 
 might learn of him, but to cross question with him, that they might 
 ensnare him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They demanded of him a <I>sign from heaven,</I> as if the signs he 
 gave them on earth, which were more familiar to them, and were more 
 capable of being examined and enquired into, were not sufficient. There 
 was a sign <I>from heaven</I> at his baptism, in the descent of the 
 dove, and the voice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:16,17">Matt. iii. 16, 17</A>);

 it was public enough; and if they had attended John's baptism as they 
 ought to have done, they might themselves have seen it. Afterward, when 
 he was nailed to the cross, they prescribed a new sign; <I>Let him come 
 down from the cross, and we will believe him;</I> thus obstinate 
 infidelity will still have something to say, though ever so 
 unreasonable. They demanded this sign, <I>tempting him;</I> not in 
 hopes that he would give it them, that they might be satisfied, but in 
 hopes that he would not, that they might imagine themselves to have a 
 pretence for their infidelity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He denied them their demand; He <I>sighed deeply in his spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He <I>groaned</I> (so some), being grieved for the <I>hardness of their
 hearts,</I> and the little influence that his preaching and miracles 
 had had upon them. The infidelity of those that have long enjoyed the 
 means of conviction, is a great grief to the Lord Jesus; it troubles 
 him, that sinners should thus stand in their own light, and put a bar 
 in their own door.

 (1.) He expostulates with them upon this demand; "<I>Why doth this
 generation seek after a sign;</I> this generation, that is so unworthy 
 to have the gospel brought to it, and to have any sign accompanying it; 
 <I>this generation,</I> that so greedily swallows the traditions of the 
 elders, without the confirmation of any sign at all; <I>this 
 generation,</I> into which, by the calculating of the times prefixed in 
 the Old Testament, they might easily perceive that the coming of the 
 Messiah must fall; <I>this generation,</I> that has had such plenty of 
 sensible and merciful signs given them in the cure of their sick? What 
 an absurdity is it for them to desire a sign!" 

 (2.) He refuses to answer their demand; <I>Verily, I say unto you, 
 there shall no sign,</I> no such sign, <I>be given to this 
 generation.</I> When God spoke to particular persons in a particular 
 case, out of the road of his common dispensation, they were encouraged 
 to ask a sign, as Gideon and Ahaz; but when he speaks in general to 
 all, as in the law and the gospel, sending each with their own 
 evidence, it is presumption to prescribe other signs than what he has 
 given. <I>Shall any teach God knowledge?</I> He denied them, and then 
 <I>left them,</I> as men not fit to be talked with; if they will not be 
 convinced, they shall not; leave them to their strong delusions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he warned his disciples against the leaven of the Pharisees and 
 of Herod. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the caution was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 "<I>Take heed, beware,</I> lest ye partake of the <I>leaven of the 
 Pharisees,</I> lest ye embrace the tradition of the elders, which they 
 are so wedded to, lest ye be proud, and hypocritical, and ceremonious, 
 like them." Matthew adds, <I>and of the Sadducees;</I> Mark adds, 
 <I>and of Herod:</I> whence some gather, that Herod, and his courtiers 
 were generally Sadducees, that is, deists, men of no religion. Others 
 give this sense, The Pharisees demanded a <I>sign from heaven;</I> and 
 Herod was long <I>desirous</I> to see some miracle wrought by Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:8">Luke xxiii. 8</A>);

 such as he should prescribe, so that the leaven of both was the same; 
 they were unsatisfied with the signs they had, and would have others of 
 their own devising; "Take heed of <I>this leaven</I>" (saith Christ), 
 "be convinced by the miracles ye have seen, and covet not to see 
 more."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How they misunderstood this caution. It seems, at their putting to 
 sea this time, they had <I>forgotten to take bread,</I> and <I>had not 
 in their ship more than one loaf,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 When therefore Christ bid them <I>beware of the leaven of the 
 Pharisees,</I> they understood it as an intimation to them, not to 
 apply themselves to any of the Pharisees for relief, when they came to 
 the other side, for they had lately been offended at them for eating 
 with <I>unwashen hands.</I> They <I>reasoned among themselves,</I> what 
 should be the meaning of this caution, and concluded, "<I>It is because 
 we have no bread;</I> he saith this, to reproach us for being so 
 careless as to go to sea, and go among strangers, with but one loaf of 
 bread; he doth, in effect, tell us, we must be brought to <I>short 
 allowance,</I> and must eat our bread by weight." They <I>reasoned 
 it</I>--<B><I>dielogizonto</I></B>, they <I>disputed</I> about it; one 
 said, "It was owing to you;" and the other said, "It was owing to you, 
 that we are so ill provided for this voyage." Thus distrust of God 
 makes Christ's disciples quarrel among themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The reproof Christ gave them for their uneasiness in this matter, as 
 it argued a disbelief of his power to supply them, notwithstanding the 
 abundant experience they had had of it. The reproof is given with some 
 warmth, for he knew their hearts, and knew they needed to be thus 
 soundly chidden; "<I>Perceive ye not yet, neither understand,</I> that 
 which you have had so many demonstrations of? <I>Have ye your hearts 
 yet hardened,</I> so as that nothing will make any impression upon 
 them, or bring them to compliance with your Master's designs? <I>Having 
 eyes, see ye not</I> that which is plain before your eyes? <I>Having 
 ears, hear ye not</I> that which you have been so often told? How 
 strangely stupid and senseless are ye! <I>Do ye not remember</I> that 
 which was done but the other day, <I>when I broke the five loaves among 
 the five thousand,</I> and soon after, the <I>seven loaves among the 
 four thousand?</I> Do ye not remember <I>how many baskets full ye took 
 up</I> of the fragments?" Yes, they did remember, and could tell that 
 they took up <I>twelve</I> baskets full one time, and <I>seven</I> 
 another; "Why then," said he, "<I>how is it that ye do not 
 understand?</I> As if he that multiplied <I>five</I> loaves, and 
 <I>seven,</I> could not multiply one." They seemed to suspect that the 
 one was not matter enough to work upon, if he should have a mind to 
 entertain his hearers a third time: and if that was their thought, it 
 was indeed a very senseless one, as if it were not all alike to the 
 Lord, to save by many or few, and as easy to make one loaf to feed five 
 thousand as five. It was therefore proper to remind them, not only of 
 the sufficiency, but of the overplus, of the former meals; and justly 
 were they chidden for not understanding what Christ therein designed, 
 and what they from thence might have learned. Note, 

 (1.) The experiences we have had of God's goodness to us in the way of 
 duty, greatly aggravate our distrust of him, which is <I>therefore</I> 
 very provoking to the Lord Jesus. 

 (2.) Our <I>not understanding</I> of the true intent and meaning of 
 God's favours to us, is equivalent to our not remembering of them. 

 (3.) We are <I>therefore</I> overwhelmed with present cares and 
 distrusts, because we do not <I>understand,</I> and remember, what we 
 have known and seen of the power and goodness of our Lord Jesus. It 
 would be a great support to us, to <I>consider the days of old,</I> and 
 we are wanting both to God and ourselves if we do not.

 (4.) When we thus <I>forgot the works of God,</I> and distrust him, we 
 should chide ourselves severely for it, as Christ doth his disciples 
 here; "Am I thus without understanding? How is it that my heart is thus 
 hardened?"</P>

 <TR><TD><FONT SIZE=+1><I>A Blind Man Restored to Sight.</I></FONT></TD>
 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto
 him, and besought him to touch him.
 &nbsp; 23  And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of
 the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands
 upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
 &nbsp; 24  And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
 &nbsp; 25  After that he put <I>his</I> hands again upon his eyes, and made
 him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
 &nbsp; 26  And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into
 the town, nor tell <I>it</I> to any in the town.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This cure is related only by this evangelist, and there is something 
 singular in the circumstances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a <I>blind man</I> brought to Christ by his friends, with a 
 desire that he would <I>touch him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Here appears the faith of those that brought him--they doubted not but 
 that one touch of Christ's hand would recover him his sight; but the 
 man himself showed not that earnestness for, or expectation of, a cure 
 that other blind men did. If those that are spiritually blind, do not 
 pray for themselves, yet let their friends and relations pray for them, 
 that Christ would be pleased to <I>touch them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is Christ <I>leading</I> this blind man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He did not bid his friends lead him, but (which bespeaks his wonderful 
 condescension) he himself <I>took him by the hand, and led him,</I> to 
 teach us to be as Job was, <I>eyes to the blind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:15">Job xxix. 15</A>.

 Never had poor blind man such a Leader. He led him <I>out of the
 town.</I> Had he herein only designed privacy, he might have led him 
 into a house, into an inner chamber, and have cured him there; but he 
 intended hereby to upbraid Bethsaida with the <I>mighty works</I> that 
 had <I>in vain</I> been done <I>in her</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:21">Matt. xi. 21</A>),

 and was telling her, in effect, she was unworthy to have any more done 
 within her walls. Perhaps Christ took the blind man <I>out of the 
 town,</I> that he might have a larger prospect in the <I>open 
 fields,</I> to try his sight with, than he could have in the <I>close 
 streets.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the cure of the blind man, by that blessed Oculist, who 
 came into the world to <I>preach the recovering of sight to the 
 blind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:18">Luke iv. 18</A>),

 and to <I>give</I> what he <I>preached.</I> In this cure we may 
 observe, 

 1. That Christ used a <I>sign;</I> he <I>spat on his eyes</I> (spat
 <I>into</I> them, so some), and <I>put his hand upon him.</I> He could 
 have cured him, as he did others, with a word speaking, but thus he was 
 pleased to assist his faith which was very weak, and to help him 
 against his <I>unbelief.</I> And this spittle signified the 
 <I>eye-salve</I> wherewith Christ anoints the eyes of those that are 
 spiritually blind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:18">Rev. iii. 18</A>.

 2. That the cure was wrought <I>gradually,</I> which was not usual in 
 Christ's miracles. He <I>asked him if he saw aught,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Let him tell what condition his sight was in, for the satisfaction of 
 those about him. And he <I>looked up;</I> so far he <I>recovered his 
 sight,</I> that he could open his eyes, and he said, <I>I see men as 
 trees walking;</I> he could not distinguish men from trees, otherwise 
 than he could discern them to move. He had some glimmerings of sight, 
 and betwixt him and the sky could perceive a man erect like a tree, but 
 <I>could not discern the form thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:16">Job iv. 16</A>.

 But,

 3. It was soon completed; Christ never doeth <I>his work</I> by the
 halves, nor leaves it till he can say, <I>It is finished.</I> He <I>put 
 his hands again upon his eyes,</I> to disperse the remaining darkness, 
 and then bade him look up again, and he <I>saw every man clearly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Now Christ took this way,

 (1.) Because he would not <I>tie himself to a method,</I> but would 
 show with what liberty he acted in all he did. He did not cure by 
 <I>rote,</I> as I may say, and in a <I>road,</I> but <I>varied</I> as 
 he thought fit. Providence gains the same end in different ways, that 
 men may attend its motions with an <I>implicit faith.</I> 

 (2.) Because it should be to the patient <I>according to his faith;</I> 
 and perhaps this man's faith was at first very weak, but afterward 
 gathered strength, and accordingly his cure was. Not that Christ always 
 went by this rule, but thus he would sometimes put a rebuke upon those 
 who came to him, doubting. 

 (3.) Thus Christ would show how, and in what method, those are healed 
 by his grace, who by nature are <I>spiritually blind;</I> at first, 
 their knowledge is confused, they see <I>men as trees walking;</I> but, 
 like the light of the morning, it <I>shines more and more to the 
 perfect day,</I> and then they <I>see all things clearly,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:18">Prov. iv. 18</A>.

 Let us enquire then, if we <I>see aught</I> of those things which 
 <I>faith</I> is the <I>substance</I> and <I>evidence</I> of; and if 
 through grace we see <I>any thing</I> of them, we may hope that we 
 shall see yet <I>more</I> and <I>more,</I> for Jesus Christ will 
 <I>perfect</I> for ever those that are <I>sanctified.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The directions Christ gave the man he had cured, not to <I>tell it 
 to any in the town of Bethsaida,</I> nor so much as to <I>go into the 
 town,</I> where probably there were some expecting him to come back, 
 who had seen Christ lead him out of the town, but, having been 
 eyewitnesses of so many miracles, had not so much as the curiosity to 
 follow him: let not those be gratified with the sight of him when he 
 was cured, who would not show so much respect to Christ as to go a step 
 out of the town, to see this cure wrought. Christ doth not forbid him 
 to tell it to others, but he must not tell it to <I>any in the 
 town.</I> Slighting Christ's favours is forfeiting them; and Christ 
 will make those know the worth of their privileges by the want of them, 
 that would not know them otherwise. Bethsaida, in the day of her 
 visitation, would not know the things that belonged to her peace, and 
 now they are <I>hid from her eyes.</I> They will not see, and therefore 
 shall not see.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of
 C&aelig;sarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying
 unto them, Whom do men say that I am?
 &nbsp; 28  And they answered, John the Baptist: but some <I>say,</I> Elias;
 and others, One of the prophets.
 &nbsp; 29  And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
 answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
 &nbsp; 30  And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
 &nbsp; 31  And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer
 many things, and be rejected of the elders, and <I>of</I> the chief
 priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise
 again.
 &nbsp; 32  And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and
 began to rebuke him.
 &nbsp; 33  But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he
 rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou
 savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be
 of men.
 &nbsp; 34  And when he had called the people <I>unto him</I> with his
 disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me,
 let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
 &nbsp; 35  For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but
 whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the
 same shall save it.
 &nbsp; 36  For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole
 world, and lose his own soul?
 &nbsp; 37  Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
 &nbsp; 38  Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words
 in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the
 Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father
 with the holy angels.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have read a great deal of the doctrine Christ preached, and the 
 miracles he wrought, which were many, and strange, and well-attested, 
 of various kinds, and wrought in several places, to the astonishment of 
 the multitudes that were eye-witnesses of them. It is now time for us 
 to pause a little, and to consider what these things mean; the wondrous 
 works which Christ then forbade the publishing of, being recorded in 
 these sacred writings, are thereby published to all the world, to us, 
 to all ages; now what shall we think of them? Is the record of those 
 things designed only for an amusement, or to furnish us with matter for 
 discourse? No, certainly <I>these things are written, that we may 
 believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:31">John xx. 31</A>);

 and this discourse which Christ had with his disciples, will assist us 
 in making the necessary reflections upon the miracles of Christ, and a 
 right use of them. Three things we are here taught to infer from the 
 miracles Christ wrought.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They <I>prove</I> that he is <I>the true Messiah,</I> the Son of 
 God, and Saviour of the world: this the works he did witnessed 
 concerning him; and this his disciples, who were the eye-witnesses of 
 those works, here profess their belief of; which cannot but be a 
 satisfaction to us in making the same inference from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ enquired of them what the sentiments of the people were 
 concerning him; <I>Who did men say that I am?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Note, Though it is a small thing for us to be judged of men, yet it may 
 sometimes do us good to know what people say of us, not that we may 
 seek our own glory, but that we may hear our faults. Christ asked them, 
 not that he might be informed, but that they might observe it 
 themselves, and inform one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The account they gave him, was such as plainly intimated the <I>high 
 opinion</I> the people had of him. Though they came short of the truth, 
 yet they were convinced by his miracles that he was an extraordinary 
 person, sent from the invisible world with a divine commission. It is 
 probable that they would have acknowledged him to be the Messiah, if 
 they had not been possessed by their teachers with a notion that the 
 Messiah must be a temporal Prince, appearing in external pomp and 
 power, which the figure Christ made, would not comport with; yet 
 (whatever the Pharisees said, whose copyhold was touched by the 
 strictness and spirituality of his doctrine) none of the people said 
 that he was a Deceiver, but some said that <I>he was John Baptist,</I> 
 others <I>Elias,</I> others <I>one of the prophets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 All agreed that he was one <I>risen from the dead.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The account they gave him of their own sentiments concerning him, 
 intimated their abundant satisfaction in him, and in their having left 
 all to follow him, which now, after some time of trial, they see no 
 reason to repent; <I>But whom say ye that I am?</I> To this they have 
 an answer ready, <I>Thou art the Christ,</I> the Messiah often 
 promised, and long expected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 To be a Christian indeed, is, sincerely to believe that Jesus is the 
 Christ, and to act accordingly; and that he is so, plainly appears by 
 his wondrous works. This they knew, and must shortly publish and 
 maintain; but for the present they must keep it secret

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 till the proof of it was completed, and they were completely qualified 
 to maintain it, by the pouring out of the Holy Ghost; and then <I>let 
 all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this same 
 Jesus, whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:36">Acts ii. 36</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. These miracles of Christ <I>take off the offence of the cross,</I> 
 and assure us that Christ was, in it, not conquered, but a Conqueror. 
 Now that the disciples are convinced that Jesus is the Christ, they may 
 bear to hear of his sufferings, which Christ now <I>begins</I> to give 
 them notice of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ <I>taught</I> his disciples that he must <I>suffer many 
 things,</I> Though they had got over the vulgar error of the Messiah's 
 being a temporal Prince, so far as to believe their Master to be the 
 Messiah, notwithstanding his present meanness, yet still they retained 
 it, so far as to expect that he would <I>shortly</I> appear in outward 
 pomp and grandeur, and <I>restore the kingdom to Israel;</I> and
 therefore, to rectify that mistake, Christ here gives them a prospect 
 of the contrary, that he must be <I>rejected of the elders, and the 
 chief priests,</I> and <I>the scribes,</I> who, they expected, should 
 be brought to own and prefer him; that, instead of being crowned, <I>he 
 must be killed,</I> he must be crucified, and <I>after three days he 
 must rise again</I> to a heavenly life, and to be <I>no more in this 
 world.</I> This he spoke <I>openly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 <B><I>parresia</I></B>. He said it freely and plainly, and did not
 wrap it up in ambiguous expressions. The disciples might easily 
 understand it, if they had not been very much under the power of 
 prejudice: or, it intimates that he spoke it cheerfully and without any 
 terror, and would have them to hear it so: he spoke that saying 
 <I>boldly,</I> as one that not only knew he <I>must</I> suffer and die, 
 but was resolved he <I>would,</I> and made it his own act and deed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Peter opposed it; <I>He took him, and began to rebuke him.</I> Here 
 Peter showed more love than discretion, a zeal for Christ and his 
 safety, but not according to knowledge. He <I>took 
 him</I>--<B><I>proslabomenos auton</I></B>. He took hold of him, as it
 were to stop and hinder him, took him in his arms, and embraced him (so 
 some understand it); he fell on his neck, as impatient to hear that his 
 dear Master should suffer such hard things; or he took him aside 
 privately, and <I>began to rebuke</I> him. This was not the language of 
 the least authority, but of the greatest affection, of that 
 <I>jealousy</I> for the welfare of those we love, which is <I>strong as 
 death.</I> Our Lord Jesus allowed his disciples to be free with him, 
 but Peter here took too great a liberty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ checked him for his opposition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 He <I>turned about,</I> as one offended, and <I>looked on his 
 disciples,</I> to see if the rest of them were of the same mind, and 
 concurred with Peter in this, that, if they did, they might take the 
 reproof to themselves, which he was now about to give to Peter; and he 
 said, <I>Get thee behind me, Satan.</I> Peter little thought to have 
 had such a sharp rebuke for such a kind dissuasive, but perhaps 
 expected as much commendation now for his love as he had lately for his 
 faith. Note, Christ sees that amiss in what we say and do, which we 
 ourselves are not aware of, and knows what manner of spirit we are of, 
 when we ourselves do not. 

 (1.) Peter spoke as one that did not rightly understand, nor had duly 
 considered, the purposes and counsels of God. When he saw such proofs
 as he every day saw of the <I>power</I> of Christ, he might conclude 
 that he could not be <I>compelled to suffer;</I> the most potent 
 enemies could not overpower him whom diseases and deaths, whom winds 
 and waves and devils themselves, were forced to obey and yield to: and 
 when he saw so much of the <I>wisdom</I> of Christ every day, he might 
 conclude that he would not <I>choose to suffer</I> but for some very 
 great and glorious purposes; and therefore he ought not thus to have 
 contradicted him, but to have acquiesced. He looked upon his death only 
 as a <I>martyrdom,</I> like that of the prophets, which he thought 
 might be prevented, if either he would take a little care not to 
 provoke the chief priests, or to keep out of the way; but he knew not 
 that the thing was necessary for the glory of God, the destruction of 
 Satan, and the salvation of man, that the Captain of our salvation must 
 be <I>made perfect through sufferings,</I> and so must <I>bring many 
 sons to glory.</I> Note, The wisdom of man is perfect folly, when it 
 pretends to give measures to the divine counsels. The cross of Christ, 
 the great instance of God's power and wisdom, was to some a 
 stumbling-block, and to others foolishness. 

 (2.) Peter spoke as one that did not rightly understand, nor had duly 
 considered, the nature of Christ's kingdom; he took it to be 
 <I>temporal</I> and <I>human,</I> whereas it is <I>spiritual</I> and 
 <I>divine.</I> <I>Thou savourest not the things that are of God, but 
 those that are of men;</I> <B><I>ou phroneis</I></B>--<I>thou mindest 
 not;</I> so the word is rendered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:5">Rom. viii. 5</A>.

 Peter seemed to mind more the things that relate to the lower world,
 and the life that now is, than those which relate to the upper world, 
 and the life to come. Minding the <I>things of men</I> more than the
 <I>things of God,</I> our own credit, ease, and safety, more than the 
 <I>things of God,</I> and his glory and kingdom, is a very great sin, 
 and the root of much sin, and very common among Christ's disciples; and 
 it will appear in suffering times, those times of temptation, when 
 those in whom the <I>things of</I> men have the ascendant, are in 
 danger of falling off. <I>Non sapis--Thou art not wise</I> (so it may
 be read) <I>in the things of God,</I> but in the <I>things of men.</I> 
 It is important to consider what <I>generation</I> we appear <I>wise 
 in,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:8">Luke xvi. 8</A>.

 It seems policy to shun trouble, but if with that we shun duty, it is
 fleshly wisdom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12">2 Cor. i. 12</A>),
 
 and it will be folly in the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. These miracles of Christ should engage us all to <I>follow 
 him,</I> whatever it cost us, not only as they were 
 <I>confirmations</I> of his <I>mission,</I> but as they were 
 <I>explications</I> of his <I>design,</I> and the tendency of that 
 grace which he came to bring; plainly intimating that by his Spirit he 
 would do that for our blind, deaf, lame, leprous, diseased, possessed 
 <I>souls,</I> which he did for the <I>bodies</I> of those many who in 
 those distresses applied themselves to him. Frequent notice had been
 taken of the great flocking that there was to him for help in various 
 cases: now this is written, that we may believe that he is the great 
 Physician of souls, and may become his patients, and submit to his 
 <I>regimen;</I> and here he tells us upon what terms we may be 
 admitted; and he <I>called all the people to him,</I> to hear this, who 
 modestly stood at some distance when he was in private conversation 
 with his disciples. This is that which all are concerned to know, and 
 consider, if they expect Christ should heal <I>their souls.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must not be <I>indulgent</I> of the <I>ease of the body;</I> 
 for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 "<I>Whosoever will come after me</I> for spiritual cures, as these 
 people do for bodily cures, <I>let him deny himself,</I> and live a 
 life of self-denial, mortification, and contempt of the world; let him 
 not pretend to be his own physician, but renounce all confidence in 
 himself and his own righteousness and strength, and let him <I>take up 
 his cross,</I> conforming himself to the pattern of a crucified Jesus, 
 and accommodating himself to the will of God in all the afflictions he 
 lies under; and thus let him continue to <I>follow me;</I>" as many of 
 those did, whom Christ healed. Those that will be Christ's patients 
 must attend on him, converse with him, receive instruction and reproof 
 from him, as those did that <I>followed</I> him, and must resolve they 
 will never forsake him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must not be <I>solicitous,</I> no, not for <I>the life of the 
 body,</I> when they cannot keep it without quitting Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Are we invited by the words and works of Christ to follow him? Let us 
 sit down, and count the cost, whether we can prefer our advantages by 
 Christ before life itself, whether we can bear to think of losing our 
 life <I>for Christ's sake and the gospel's.</I> When the devil is 
 drawing away disciples and servants after him, he conceals the worst of 
 it, tells them only of the pleasure, but nothing of the peril, of his 
 service; <I>Ye shall not surely die;</I> but what there is of trouble 
 and danger in the service of Christ, he tells us of it before, tells us 
 we shall <I>suffer,</I> perhaps we shall <I>die,</I> in the cause; and 
 represents the discouragements not <I>less,</I> but <I>greater,</I> 
 than commonly they prove, that it may appear he <I>deals fairly</I> 
 with us, and is not afraid that we should know the worst; because the 
 <I>advantages</I> of his service abundantly suffice to <I>balance</I> 
 the <I>discouragements,</I> if we will but impartially set the one over 
 against the other. In short,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We must <I>not dread the loss of our lives,</I> provided it be 
 <I>in the cause of Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 <I>Whosoever will save his life,</I> by declining Christ, and refusing 
 to come to him, or by disowning and denying him after he has in 
 profession come to Christ, he shall <I>lose it,</I> shall lose the 
 comfort of his natural life, the root and fountain of his spiritual 
 life, and all his hopes of eternal life; such a bad bargain will he 
 make for himself. But <I>whosoever shall lose his life,</I> shall be 
 truly willing to lose it, shall venture it, shall lay it down when he 
 cannot keep it without denying Christ, he shall <I>save it,</I> he 
 shall be an unspeakable gainer; for the loss of his life shall be made 
 up to him in a better life. It is looked upon to be some kind of 
 recompence to those who lose their lives in the service of their prince 
 and country, to have their memories honoured and their families 
 provided for; but what is that to the recompence which Christ makes in 
 eternal life to all that die for him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We must <I>dread the loss of our souls,</I> yea, though we should 
 <I>gain the whole world</I> by it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>);

 <I>For what shall it profit a man, if he should gain the whole 
 world,</I> and all the wealth, honour, and pleasure, in it, by denying 
 Christ, and <I>lose his own soul?</I> "True it is," said Bishop Hooper, 
 the night before he suffered martyrdom, "that <I>life is sweet,</I> and 
 <I>death is bitter,</I> but <I>eternal death is more bitter,</I> and 
 <I>eternal life is more sweet.</I>" As the happiness of heaven with 
 Christ, is enough to countervail the loss of life itself for Christ, so 
 the gain of all the world <I>in sin,</I> is not sufficient to 
 countervail the ruin of the soul <I>by sin.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What that is that men do, to <I>save their lives,</I> and <I>gain the 
 world,</I> he tells us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+8:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 and of what fatal consequence it will be to them; <I>Whosoever 
 therefore shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous 
 and sinful generation, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed.</I> 
 Something like this we had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:33">Matt. x. 33</A>.

 But it is here expressed more fully. Note,

 [1.] The disadvantage that the cause of Christ labours under this 
 world, is, that it is to be owned and professed in an <I>adulterous and 
 sinful generation;</I> such the generation of mankind is, gone a 
 whoring from God, in the impure embraces of the world and the flesh, 
 lying in wickedness; some ages, some places, are more especially 
 adulterous and sinful, as that was in which Christ lived; in such a 
 <I>generation</I> the cause of Christ is opposed and run down, and 
 those that own it, are exposed to reproach and contempt, and every 
 where ridiculed and <I>spoken against.</I>

 [2.] There are many, who, though they cannot but own that the cause of 
 Christ is a righteous cause, are <I>ashamed</I> of it, because of the 
 reproach that attends the professing of it; they are <I>ashamed</I> of 
 their relation to Christ, and <I>ashamed</I> of the credit they cannot 
 but give to <I>his words;</I> they cannot bear to be frowned upon and 
 despised, and therefore throw off their profession, and go down the 
 stream of a prevailing apostasy.

 [3.] There is a day coming, when the cause of Christ will appear as 
 bright and illustrious as now it appears mean and contemptible; when 
 the Son of man comes <I>in the glory of his Father with his holy 
 angels,</I> as the true Shechinah, the brightness of his Father's 
 glory, and the Lord of angels.

 [4.] Those that are ashamed of Christ in this world where he is 
 despised, he will be ashamed of in that world where he is eternally 
 adored. <I>They</I> shall not share with him in his glory then, that 
 were not willing to share with him in his disgrace now.</P>
