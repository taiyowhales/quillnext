 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the foregoing chapter, we had our Saviour's discourses with the 
 scribes and Pharisees; here we have his discourse concerning them, or 
 rather against them. 

 I. He allows their office, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 II. He warns his disciples not to imitate their hypocrisy and pride, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:4-12">ver. 4-12</A>.

 III. He exhibits a charge against them for divers high crimes and
 misdemeanors, corrupting the law, opposing the gospel, and treacherous
 dealing both with God and man; and to each article he prefixes a woe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:13-33">ver. 13-33</A>.

 IV. He passes sentence upon Jerusalem, and foretels the ruin of the 
 city and temple, especially for the sin of persecution,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
 &nbsp; 2  Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:
 &nbsp; 3  All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, <I>that</I> observe
 and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do
 not.
 &nbsp; 4  For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
 <I>them</I> on men's shoulders; but they <I>themselves</I> will not move
 them with one of their fingers.
 &nbsp; 5  But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make
 broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their
 garments,
 &nbsp; 6  And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats
 in the synagogues,
 &nbsp; 7  And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi,
 Rabbi.
 &nbsp; 8  But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, <I>even</I>
 Christ; and all ye are brethren.
 &nbsp; 9  And call no <I>man</I> your father upon the earth: for one is your
 Father, which is in heaven.
 &nbsp; 10  Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, <I>even</I>
 Christ.
 &nbsp; 11  But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
 &nbsp; 12  And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he
 that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We find not Christ, in all his preaching, so severe upon any sort of 
 people as upon these <I>scribes and Pharisees;</I> for the truth is, 
 nothing is more directly opposite to the spirit of the gospel than the 
 temper and practice of that generation of men, who were made up of 
 pride, worldliness, and tyranny, under a cloak and pretence of 
 religion; yet these were the idols and darlings of the people, who 
 thought, if but two men went to heaven, one would be a Pharisee. Now 
 Christ directs his discourse here <I>to the multitude, and to his 
 disciples</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 to rectify their mistakes concerning these scribes and Pharisees, by 
 painting them out in their true colours, and so to take off the 
 prejudice which some of the multitude had conceived against Christ and 
 his doctrine, because it was opposed by those men of their church, that 
 called themselves the people's guides. Note, It is good to know the 
 true characters of men, that we may not be imposed upon by great and 
 mighty names, titles, and pretensions to power. People must be told of
 <I>the wolves</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:29,30">Acts xx. 29, 30</A>),
 
 <I>the dogs</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:2">Phil. iii. 2</A>),

 <I>the deceitful workers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:13">2 Cor. xi. 13</A>),

 that they may know here to stand upon their guard. And not only the 
 mixed multitude, but even the disciples, need these cautions; for good 
 men are apt to have their eyes dazzled with worldly pomp.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, in this discourse,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ allows their office as expositors of the law; <I>The scribes 
 and Pharisees</I> (that is, the whole Sanhedrim, who sat at the helm of 
 church government, who were all called <I>scribes,</I> and were some of 
 them Pharisees), they <I>sit in Moses' seat</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 as public teachers and interpreters of the law; and, the law of Moses 
 being the municipal law of their state, they were as judges, or a bench 
 of justices; teaching and judging seem to be equivalent, comparing 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:7,9,19:5,6,8">2 Chron. xvii. 7, 9, with 2 Chron. xix. 5, 6, 8</A>.

 They were not the itinerant judges that rode the circuit, but the
 standing bench, that determined on appeals, special verdicts, or writs 
 of error by the law; they sat in Moses's seat, not as he was Mediator 
 between God and Israel, but only as he was chief justice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:26">Exod. xviii. 26</A>.

 Or, we may apply it, not to the Sanhedrim, but to the other Pharisees
 and scribes, that expounded the law, and taught the people how to apply 
 it to particular cases. <I>The pulpit of wood,</I> such as was made for 
 Ezra, <I>that ready scribe in the law of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:4">Neh. viii. 4</A>),

 is here called <I>Moses's seat,</I> because Moses had those in every 
 city (so the expression is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:21">Acts xv. 21</A>),

 who in those pulpits preached him; this was their office, and it was 
 just and honourable; it was requisite that there should be some at 
 whose mouth the people might <I>enquire the law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>.

 Note,

 1. Many a good place is filled with bad men; it is no new thing for
 the vilest men to be exalted even to <I>Moses's seat</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:8">Ps. xii. 8</A>);

 and, when it is so, the men are not so much honoured by the seat as the 
 seat is dishonoured by the men. Now they that sat in Moses's seat were 
 so wretchedly degenerated, that it was time for the great Prophet to 
 arise, like unto Moses, to erect another seat. 

 2. Good and useful offices and powers are not <I>therefore</I> to be
 condemned and abolished, because they fall sometimes into the hands of 
 bad men, who abuse them. We must not <I>therefore</I> pull down Moses's 
 seat, because scribes and Pharisees have got possession of it; rather 
 than so, <I>let both grow together until the harvest,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:30"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hence he infers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 "<I>Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do</I> As far as 
 they <I>sit in Moses's seat,</I> that is, read and preach the law that 
 was given by Moses" (which, as yet, continued in full force, power, and 
 virtue), "and judge according to that law, so far you must hearken to 
 them, as remembrances to you of the written word." The scribes and 
 Pharisees made it their business to study the scripture, and were well 
 acquainted with the language, history, and customs of it, and its style 
 and phraseology. Now Christ would have the people to make use of the 
 helps they gave them for the understanding of the scripture, and do 
 accordingly. As long as their comments did illustrate the text and not 
 pervert it; did make plain, and not <I>make void, the commandment of 
 God;</I> so far they must be observed and obeyed, but with caution and 
 a judgment of discretion. Note, We must not think the worse of good
 truths for their being preached by bad ministers; nor of good laws for 
 their being executed by bad magistrates. Though it is most desirable to 
 have our food brought by angels, yet, if God send it to us by ravens, 
 if it be good and wholesome, we must take it, and thank God for it. Our 
 Lord Jesus promiseth this, to prevent the cavil which some would be apt 
 to make at this following discourse; as if, by condemning the scribes 
 and Pharisees, he designed to bring the law of Moses into contempt, and 
 to draw people off from it; whereas he <I>came not to destroy, but to 
 fulfil.</I> Note, It is wisdom to obviate the exceptions which may be 
 taken at just reproofs, especially when there is occasion to 
 distinguish between officers and their offices, <I>that the ministry be 
 not blamed</I> when the ministers are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He condemns the men. He had ordered the multitude to do as they 
 taught; but here he annexeth a caution not to do as they did, to beware 
 of their leaven; <I>Do not ye after their works.</I> Their traditions 
 were their works, were their idols, the works of their fancy. Or, "Do 
 not according to their example." Doctrines and practices are spirits 
 that must be tried, and where there is occasion, must be carefully 
 separated and distinguished; and as we must not swallow corrupt 
 doctrines for the sake of any laudable practices of those that teach 
 them, so we must not imitate any bad examples for the sake of the 
 plausible doctrines of those that set them. The scribes and Pharisees 
 boasted as much of the goodness of their works as of the orthodoxy of 
 their teaching, and hoped to be justified by them; it was the plea they 
 put in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:11,12">Luke xviii. 11, 12</A>);

 and yet these things, which they valued themselves so much upon, were 
 an abomination in the sight of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Saviour 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:3-32">here, and in the following verses</A>,

 specifies divers particulars of their works, wherein we must not
 imitate them. In general, they are charged with hypocrisy,
 dissimulation, or double-dealing in religion; a crime which cannot be
 enquired of at men's bar, because we can only judge according to
 outward appearance; but God, who searcheth the heart, can convict of
 hypocrisy; and nothing is more displeasing to him, for he desireth 
 truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Four things are in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:4-7">these verses</A>

 charged upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their saying and doing were two things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Their practice was no way agreeable either to their preaching or to
 their profession; for <I>they say, and do not;</I> they teach out of
 the law that which is good, but their conversation gives them the lie;
 and they seem to have found another way to heaven for themselves than
 what they show to others. See this illustrated and charged home upon
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:17-24">Rom. ii. 17-24</A>.

 Those are of all sinners most inexcusable that allow themselves in the
 sins they condemn in others, or in worse. This doth especially touch 
 wicked ministers, who will be sure to have their portion appointed them 
 with hypocrites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:51"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 51</A>);

 for what greater hypocrisy can there be, than to press that upon
 others, to be believed and done, which they themselves disbelieve and 
 disobey; pulling down in their practice what they build up in their 
 preaching; when in the pulpit, preaching so well that it is a pity they 
 should ever come out; but, when out of the pulpit, living so ill that 
 it is a pity they should ever come in; like bells, that call others to 
 church, but hang out of it themselves; or Mercurial posts, that point 
 the way to others, but stand still themselves? Such will <I>be judged 
 out of their own mouths.</I> It is applicable to all others that say, 
 and do not; that make a plausible profession of religion, but do not 
 live up to that profession; that make fair promises, but do not perform 
 their promises; are full of good discourse, and can lay down the law to 
 all about them, but are empty of good works; great talkers, but little 
 doers; <I>the voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of 
 Esau. Vox et pr&aelig;terea nihil--mere sound.</I> They speak fair, 
 <I>I go, sir;</I> but there is no trusting them, for <I>there are seven 
 abominations in their heart.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They were very severe in imposing upon others those things which 
 they were not themselves willing to submit to the burthen of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);
 
 <I>They bind heavy burthens, and grievous to be borne;</I> not only 
 insisting upon the minute circumstances of the law, which is called 
 <I>a yoke</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:10">Acts xv. 10</A>),

 and pressing the observation of them with more strictness and severity 
 than God himself did (whereas the maxim of the lawyers, is <I>Apices 
 juris son sunt jura--Mere points of law are not law</I>), but by adding 
 to his words, and imposing their own inventions and traditions, under 
 the highest penalties. They loved to show their authority and to 
 exercise their domineering faculty, lording it over God's heritage, and 
 saying to men's souls, <I>Bow down, that we may go over;</I> witness 
 their many additions to the law of the fourth commandment, by which 
 they made the sabbath a burthen on men's shoulders, which was designed 
 to be the joy of their hearts. Thus with force and cruelty did those 
 shepherds <I>rule the flock,</I> as of old, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:4">Ezek. xxxiv. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But see their hypocrisy; <I>They themselves will not move them with one 
 of their fingers.</I> 

 (1.) They would not exercise themselves in those things which they 
 imposed upon others; they pressed upon the people a strictness in 
 religion which they themselves would not be bound by; but secretly 
 transgressed their own traditions, which they publicly enforced. They 
 indulged their pride in giving law to others; but consulted their ease 
 in their own practice. Thus it has been said, to the reproach of the 
 popish priests, that they fast with wine and sweetmeats, while they 
 force the people to fast with bread and water; and decline the penances 
 they enjoin the laity. 

 (2.) They would not ease the people in these things, nor put a finger 
 to lighten their burthen, when they saw it pinched them. They could 
 find out loose constructions to put upon God's law, and could dispense 
 with that, but would not bate an ace of their own impositions, nor 
 dispense with a failure in the least punctilio of them. They allowed no 
 chancery to relieve the extremity of their common law. How contrary to 
 this was the practice of Christ's apostles, who would allow to others 
 that use of Christian liberty which, for the peace and edification of 
 the church, they would deny themselves in! They would lay no other
 burthen than necessary things, and those easy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:28">Acts xv. 28</A>.

 How carefully doth Paul spare those to whom he writes!

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:28,9:12">1 Cor. vii. 28; ix. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They were all for show, and nothing for substance, in religion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 <I>All their works they do, to be seen of men.</I> We must do such good 
 works, that they who see them may glorify God; but we must not proclaim 
 our good works, with design that others may see them, and glorify us; 
 which our Saviour here chargeth upon the Pharisees in general, as he 
 had done before in the particular instances of prayer and giving of 
 alms. All their end was to be praised of men, and therefore all their 
 endeavour was to be seen of men, to <I>make a fair show in the 
 flesh.</I> In those duties of religion which fall under the eye of men, 
 none ere so constant and abundant as they; but in what lies between God 
 and their souls, in the retirement of their closets, and the recesses 
 of their hearts, they desire to be excused. The <I>form</I> of 
 godliness will get them a name to live, which is all they aim at, and 
 therefore they trouble not themselves with the <I>power</I> of it, 
 which is essential to a life indeed. He that does all to be seen does 
 nothing to the purpose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He specifies two things which they did to be seen of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>They made broad their phylacteries.</I> Those were little 
 scrolls of paper or parchment, wherein were written, with great 
 niceness, these four paragraphs of the law, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:2-11,13:11-16,De+6:4-9,11:13-21">Exod. xiii. 2-11; xiii. 11-16;
 Deut. vi. 4-9; xi. 13-21</A>.

 These were sewn up in leather, and worn upon their foreheads and left
 arms. It was a tradition of the elders, which had reference to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:9">Exod. xiii. 9</A>,

 and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:3">Prov. vii. 3</A>,

 where the expressions seem to be figurative, intimating no more than 
 that we should bear the things of God in our minds as carefully as if 
 we had them bound between our eyes. Now the Pharisees made broad these
 phylacteries, that they might be thought more holy, and strict, and 
 zealous for the law, than others. It is a gracious ambition to covet to 
 be really more holy than others, but it is a proud ambition to covet to 
 appear so. It is good to excel in real piety, but not to exceed in 
 outward shows; for overdoing is justly suspected of design, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:14">Prov. xxvii. 14</A>.

 It is the guise of hypocrisy to make more ado than needs in external 
 service, more than is needful either to prove, or to <I>im</I>prove, 
 the good affections and dispositions of the soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>They enlarged the borders of their garments.</I> God appointed 
 the Jews to make borders or fringes upon their garments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+15:38">Num. xv. 38</A>),

 to distinguish them from other nations, and to be a memorandum to them 
 of their being a peculiar people; but the Pharisees were not content to 
 have these borders like other people's, which might serve God's design 
 in appointing them; but they must be larger than ordinary, to answer 
 their design of making themselves to be taken notice of; as if they 
 were more religious than others. But those who thus enlarge their 
 phylacteries, and the borders of their garments, while their hearts are 
 straitened, and destitute of the love of God and their neighbour, 
 though they may now deceive others, will in the end deceive 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They much affected pre-eminence and superiority, and prided 
 themselves extremely in it. Pride was the darling reigning sin of the 
 Pharisees, <I>the sin that did most easily beset them</I> and which our 
 Lord Jesus takes all occasions to witness against.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He describes their pride,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.
 
 They courted, and coveted,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Places of honour and respect. In all public appearances, as <I>at 
 feasts, and in the synagogues,</I> they expected, and had, to their 
 hearts' delight, <I>the uppermost rooms, and the chief seats.</I> They 
 took place of all others, and precedency was adjudged to them, as 
 persons of the greatest note and merit; and it is easy to imagine what 
 a complacency they took in it; <I>they loved to have the 
 preeminence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3John+1:9">3 John 9</A>.

 It is not possessing the uppermost rooms, nor sitting in the chief
 seats, that is condemned (somebody must sit uppermost), but 
 <I>loving</I> them; for men to value such a little piece of ceremony as 
 sitting highest, going first, taking the wall, or the better hand, and 
 to value themselves upon it, to seek it, and to feel resentment if they 
 have it not; what is that but making an idol of ourselves, and then 
 falling down and worshipping it--the worst kind of idolatry! It is bad 
 any where, but especially in the synagogues. <I>There</I> to seek
 honour to ourselves, where we appear in order to give glory to God, and 
 to humble ourselves before him, is indeed to mock God instead of 
 serving him. David would willingly lie at the threshold in God's house; 
 so far was he from coveting <I>the chief seat</I> there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:10">Ps. lxxxiv. 10</A>.

 It savours much of pride and hypocrisy, when people do not care for
 going to church, unless they can look fine and make a figure there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Titles of honour and respect. They <I>loved greetings in the 
 markets,</I> loved to have people put off their hats to them, and show 
 them respect when they met them in the streets. O how it pleased them, 
 and fed their vain humour, <I>digito monstrari et dicier, Hic est--to be
 pointed out, and to have it said, This be he,</I> to have way made for 
 them in the crowd of market people; "Stand off, here is a Pharisee 
 coming!" and to be complimented with the high and pompous title of 
 <I>Rabbi, Rabbi!</I> This was meat and drink and dainties to them; and 
 they took as great a satisfaction in it as Nebuchadnezzar did in his 
 palace, when he said, <I>Is not this great Babylon that I have 
 built?</I> The <I>greetings</I> would not have done them half so much 
 good, if they had not been in the markets, where every body might see 
 how much they were respected, and how high they stood in the opinion of 
 the people. It was but a little before Christ's time, that the Jewish 
 teachers, the masters of Israel, had assumed the title of <I>Rabbi, 
 Rab,</I> or <I>Rabban,</I> which signifies <I>great or much;</I> and 
 was construed as <I>Doctor,</I> or <I>My lord.</I> And they laid such a 
 stress upon it, that they gave it for a maxim that "he who salutes his 
 teacher, and does not call him Rabbi, provokes the divine Majesty to 
 depart from Israel;" so much religion did they place in that which was 
 but a piece of good manners! For him that is taught in the word to give 
 respect to him that teaches is commendable enough in him that gives it; 
 but for him that teaches to love it, and demand it, and affect it, to 
 be puffed up with it, and to be displeased if it be omitted, is sinful 
 and abominable; and, instead of teaching, he has need to learn the 
 first lesson in the school of Christ, which is humility.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He cautions his disciples against being herein like them; herein 
 they must not do after their works; "But be not ye called so, for ye 
 shall not be of such a spirit," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 [1.] A prohibition of pride. They are here forbidden,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> To challenge titles of honour and dominion to themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 It is repeated twice; <I>Be not called Rabbi, neither be ye called 
 Master or Guide:</I> not that it is unlawful to give civil respect to 
 <I>those that are over us in the Lord,</I> nay, it is an instance of 
 the honour and esteem which it is our duty to show them; but, 

 1. Christ's ministers must not affect the name of <I>Rabbi</I> or
 <I>Master,</I> by way of distinction from other people; it is not 
 agreeable to the simplicity of the gospel, for them to covet or accept 
 the honour which they have that are in kings' palaces. 

 2. They must not assume the authority and dominion implied in those
 names; they must not be magisterial, nor domineer over their brethren, 
 or over God's heritage, as if they had dominion over the faith of 
 Christians: what they received of the Lord, all must receive from them; 
 but in other things they must not make their opinions and wills a rule 
 and standard to all other people, to be admitted with an implicit 
 obedience. The reasons for this prohibition are,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>One is your Master, even Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:8,10"><I>v.</I> 8, and again, <I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Note, 

 [1.] Christ is our Master, our Teacher, our Guide. Mr. George Herbert, 
 when he named the name of <I>Christ,</I> usually added, <I>My 
 Master.</I> 

 [2.] Christ only is our Master, ministers are but ushers in the school. 
 Christ only is the Master, the great Prophet, whom we must hear, and be 
 ruled and overruled by; whose word must be an oracle and a law to us; 
 <I>Verily I say unto you,</I> must be enough to us. And if he only be 
 our Master, then for his ministers to set up for dictators, and to 
 pretend to a supremacy and an infallibility, is a daring usurpation of 
 that honour of Christ which he will not give to another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>All ye are brethren.</I> Ministers are brethren not only to one 
 another, but to the people; and therefore it ill becomes them to be 
 masters, when there are none for them to master it over but their 
 brethren; yea, and we are all younger brethren, otherwise the eldest 
 might claim an <I>excellency of dignity and power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:3">Gen. xlix. 3</A>.

 But, to preclude that, Christ himself is <I>the first-born among many
 brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:29">Rom. viii. 29</A>.

 Ye are brethren, as ye are all disciples of the same Master.
 School-fellows are brethren, and, as such, should help one another in 
 getting their lesson; but it will by no means be allowed that one of 
 the scholars step into the master's seat, and give law to the school. 
 If we are all brethren, we must not be <I>many masters.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:1">Jam. iii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> They are forbidden to ascribe such titles to others 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 "<I>Call no man your father upon the earth;</I> constitute no man the 
 father of your religion, that is, the founder, author, director, and 
 governor, of it." The fathers of our flesh must be called 
 <I>fathers,</I> and as such we must <I>give them reverence;</I> but God 
 only must be allowed as <I>the Father of our spirits,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:9">Heb. xii. 9</A>.
 
 Our religion must not be derived from, or made to depend upon, any man.
 We are born again to the spiritual and divine life, <I>not of 
 corruptible seed, but by the word of God; not of the will of the flesh, 
 or the will of man, but of God.</I> Now the will of man, not being the 
 rise of our religion, must not be the rule of it. We must not <I>jurare 
 in verba magistri--swear to the dictates of any creature,</I> not the 
 wisest or best, nor pin our faith on any man's sleeve, because we know 
 not whither he will carry it. St. Paul calls himself <I>a Father</I> to 
 those whose conversion he had been an instrument of 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:15,Philem+1:10">1 Cor. iv. 15; Phil. 10</A>);

 but he pretends to no dominion over them, and uses that title to 
 denote, not authority, but affection: therefore he calls them not his 
 <I>obliged,</I> but his <I>beloved,</I> sons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:14">1 Cor. iv. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The reason given is, <I>One is your Father, who is in heaven.</I> God 
 is our Father, and is All in all in our religion. He is the Fountain of 
 it, and its Founder; the Life of it, and its Lord; from whom alone, as 
 the Original, our spiritual life is derived, and on whom it depends. He 
 is <I>the Father of</I> all <I>lights</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:17">Jam. i. 17</A>),

 that <I>one Father, from whom are all things, and we in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:6">Eph. iv. 6</A>.

 Christ having taught us to say, <I>Our Father, who art in heaven;</I> 
 let us <I>call no man Father upon earth;</I> no man, because <I>man is 
 a worm, and the son of man is a worm,</I> hewn out of the same rock 
 with us; especially not upon earth, for man upon earth is a sinful 
 worm; <I>there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and 
 sinneth not,</I> and therefore no one is fit to be called 
 <I>Father.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Here is a precept of humility and mutual subjection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 <I>He that is greatest among you shall be your servant;</I> not only 
 call himself so (we know of one who styles himself <I>Servus servorum 
 Dei--Servant of the servants of God,</I> but acts as Rabbi, and father, 
 and master, and <I>Dominus Deus noster--The Lord our God,</I> and what 
 not), but he shall be so. Take it as a promise; "<I>He</I> shall be 
 accounted greatest, and stand highest in the favour of God, that is 
 most submissive and serviceable;" or as a precept; "He that is advanced 
 to any place of dignity, trust, and honour, in the church, <I>let him 
 be your servant</I>" (some copies read <B><I>esto</I></B> for 
 <B><I>estai</I></B>), "let him not think that his patent of honour is a 
 writ of ease; no; <I>he that is greatest</I> is not a lord, but a 
 minister." St. Paul, who knew his privilege as well as duty, though 
 <I>free from all, yet made himself servant unto all</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:19">1 Cor. ix. 19</A>);
 
 and our Master frequently pressed it upon his disciples to be humble 
 and self-denying, mild and condescending, and to abound in all offices 
 of Christian love, though mean, and to the meanest; and of this he hath 
 set us an example.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Here is a good reason for all this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The punishment intended for the proud; <I>Whosoever shall 
 exalt himself shall be abased.</I> If God give them repentance, they 
 will be abased in their own eyes, and will abhor themselves for it; if 
 they repent not, sooner or later they will be abased before the world. 
 Nebuchadnezzar, in the height of his pride, was turned to be a 
 fellow-commoner with the beasts; Herod, to be a feast for the worms; 
 and Babylon, that sat as a queen, to be the scorn of nations. God made 
 the proud and aspiring priests contemptible and base 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:9">Mal. ii. 9</A>),

 and the lying prophet to be <I>the tail,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:15">Isa. ix. 15</A>.

 But if proud men have not marks of humiliation set upon them in this
 world, there is a day coming, when they shall <I>rise to everlasting 
 shame and contempt</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:2">Dan. xii. 2</A>);

 <I>so plentifully will he reward the proud doer!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:23">Ps. xxxi. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The preferment intended for the humble; <I>He that 
 shall humble himself shall be exalted.</I> Humility is that <I>ornament 
 which is in the sight of God of great price.</I> In this world the 
 humble have the honour of being accepted with the holy God, and 
 respected by all wise and good men; of being qualified for, and often 
 called out to, the most honourable services; for honour is like the 
 shadow, which flees from those that pursue it, and grasp at it, but 
 follows those that flee from it. However, in the other world, they that 
 have humbled themselves in contrition for their sin, in compliance with 
 their God, and in condescension to their brethren, shall be exalted to 
 inherit the throne of glory; shall be not only owned, but crowned, 
 before angels and men.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
 shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in
 <I>yourselves,</I> neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
 &nbsp; 14  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
 devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer:
 therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
 &nbsp; 15  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
 compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made,
 ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
 &nbsp; 16  Woe unto you, <I>ye</I> blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall
 swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by
 the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
 &nbsp; 17  <I>Ye</I> fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or
 the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
 &nbsp; 18  And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but
 whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.
 &nbsp; 19  <I>Ye</I> fools and blind: for whether <I>is</I> greater, the gift, or

 &nbsp; 23  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
 tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the
 weightier <I>matters</I> of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these
 ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
 &nbsp; 24  <I>Ye</I> blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a

 &nbsp; 25  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make

 &nbsp; 27  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are

 &nbsp; 28  Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but

 &nbsp; 29  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have eight woes levelled directly against the 
 scribes and Pharisees by our Lord Jesus Christ, like so many claps of 
 thunder, or flashes of lightning, from mount Sinai. <I>Three</I> woes 
 are made to look very dreadful 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:13,9:12">Rev. viii. 13; ix. 12</A>);

 but here are <I>eight</I> woes, in opposition to the eight beatitudes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:3">Matt. v. 3</A>.

 The gospel has its woes as well as the law, and gospel curses are of 
 all curses the heaviest. These woes are the more remarkable, not only 
 because of the authority, but because of the meekness and gentleness, 
 of him that denounced them. He came to bless, and loved to bless; but, 
 if his wrath be kindled, there is surely cause for it: and who shall 
 entreat for him that the great Intercessor pleads against? A woe from 
 Christ is a remediless woe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is here the burthen of the song, and it is a heavy burthen; <I>Woe 
 unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites.</I> Note, 

 1. The scribes and Pharisees were hypocrites; that is it in which all
 the rest of their bad characters are summed up; it was the leaven which 
 gave the relish to all they said and did. A hypocrite is a stage-player 
 in religion (that is the primary signification of the word); he 
 personates or acts the part of one that he neither is nor may be, or 
 perhaps the he neither is nor would be. 

 2. That hypocrites are in a woeful state and condition. <I>Woe to
 hypocrites;</I> so <I>he</I> said whose saying that their case is 
 miserable makes it so: while they live, their religion is vain; when 
 they die, their ruin is great.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now each of these woes against the scribes and Pharisees has a reason 
 annexed to it containing a separate crime charged upon them, proving 
 their hypocrisy, and justifying the judgment of Christ upon them; for 
 his woes, his curses, are never causeless.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They were sworn enemies to the gospel of Christ, and consequently to 
 the salvation of the souls of men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 <I>They shut up the kingdom of heaven against men,</I> that is, they 
 did all they could to keep people from believing in Christ, and so 
 entering into his kingdom. Christ came to <I>open the kingdom of
 heaven,</I> that is, to lay open for us <I>a new and living way</I> 
 into it, to bring men to be subjects of that kingdom. Now the scribes 
 and Pharisees, who sat in Moses's seat, and pretended to the key of 
 knowledge, ought to have contributed their assistance herein, by 
 opening those scriptures of the Old Testament which pointed at the 
 Messiah and his kingdom, in their true and proper sense; they that 
 undertook to expound Moses and the prophets should have showed the 
 people how they testified of Christ; that Daniel's weeks were expiring, 
 <I>the sceptre was departed from Judah,</I> and therefore now was the 
 time for the Messiah's appearing. Thus they might have facilitated
 that great work, and have helped thousands to heaven; but, instead of 
 this, they shut up the kingdom of heaven; they made it their business 
 to press the ceremonial law, which was now in the vanishing, to 
 suppress the prophecies, which were now in the accomplishing, and to 
 beget and nourish up in the minds of the people prejudices against 
 Christ and his doctrine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They would not go in themselves; <I>Have any of the rulers,</I> or 
 <I>of the Pharisees, believed on him?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:48">John vii. 48</A>.

 No; they were to proud to stoop to his meanness, too formal to be
 reconciled to his plainness; they did not like a religion which 
 insisted so much on humility, self-denial, contempt of the world, and 
 spiritual worship. Repentance was the door of admission into this
 kingdom, and nothing could be more disagreeable to the Pharisees, who 
 justified and admired themselves, than to repent, that is, to accuse 
 and abase and abhor themselves; therefore they <I>went not in 
 themselves;</I> but that was not all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They would not <I>suffer them that were entering to go in.</I> It is 
 bad to keep away from Christ ourselves, but it is worse to keep others 
 from him; yet that is commonly the way of hypocrites; they do not love 
 that any should go beyond them in religion, or be better than they. 
 Their not going in themselves was a hindrance to many; for, they having 
 so great an interest in the people, multitudes rejected the gospel only 
 because their leaders did; but, besides that, they opposed both 
 Christ's entertaining of sinners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:39">Luke vii. 39</A>),

 and sinners' entertaining of Christ; they perverted his doctrine, 
 confronted his miracles, quarrelled with his disciples, and represented 
 him, and his institutes and economy, to the people in the most 
 disingenuous, disadvantageous manner imaginable; they thundered out 
 their excommunications against those that confessed him, and used all 
 their wit and power to serve their malice against him; and thus they 
 <I>shut up the kingdom of heaven,</I> so that <I>they who would 
 enter</I> into it must <I>suffer violence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:12"><I>ch.</I> xi. 12</A>),
 
 and <I>press into it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:16">Luke xvi. 16</A>),

 through a crowd of scribes and Pharisees, and all the obstructions and
 difficulties they could contrive to lay in their way. How well is it 
 for us that our salvation is not entrusted in the hands of any man or 
 company of men in the world! If it were, we should be undone. They that 
 shut out of the church would shut out of heaven if they could; but the 
 malice of men cannot <I>make the promise of God</I> to his chosen <I>of 
 no effect;</I> blessed be God, it cannot.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They made religion and the form of godliness a cloak and 
 stalking-horse to their covetous practices and desires, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What their wicked practices were; they <I>devoured widows' 
 houses,</I> either by quartering themselves and their attendants upon 
 them for entertainment, which must be of the best for men of their 
 figure; or by insinuating themselves into their affections, and so 
 getting to be the trustees of their estates, which they could make an 
 easy prey of; for who could presume to call such as they were to an 
 account? The thing they aimed at was to enrich themselves; and, this 
 being their chief and highest end, all considerations of justice and 
 equity were laid aside, and even widows' houses were sacrificed to 
 this. Widows are of the weaker sex in its weakest state, easily imposed 
 upon; and therefore they fastened on them, to make a prey of. They 
 devoured those whom, by the law of God, they were particularly obliged 
 to protect, patronise, and relieve. There is a woe in the Old Testament 
 to those that <I>made widows their prey</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:1,2">Isa. x. 1, 2</A>);

 and Christ here seconded it with his woe. God is the judge of the 
 widows; they are his peculiar care, he <I>establisheth their border</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:25">Prov. xv. 25</A>),
 
 and <I>espouseth their cause</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:22,23">Exod. xxii. 22, 23</A>);

 yet these were they whose houses the Pharisees devoured by wholesale; 
 so greedy were they to get <I>their bellies filled with the treasures 
 of wickedness!</I> Their devouring denotes not only covetousness, but 
 cruelty in their oppression, described 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:3">Mic. iii. 3</A>,

 <I>They eat the flesh, and flay off the skin.</I> And doubtless they
 did all this under colour of law; for they did it so artfully that it 
 passed uncensured, and did not at all lessen the people's veneration 
 for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What was the cloak with which they covered this wicked practice; 
 <I>For a pretence they made long prayers;</I> very long indeed, if it 
 be true which some of the Jewish writers tell us, that they spent three 
 hours at a time in the formalities of meditation and prayer, and did it 
 thrice every day, which is more than an upright soul, that makes a 
 conscience of being inward with God in the duty, dares pretend 
 ordinarily to do; but to the Pharisees it was easy enough, who never 
 made a business of the duty, and always made a trade of the outside of 
 it. By this craft they got their wealth, and maintained their grandeur. 
 It is not probable that these long prayers were extemporary, for then 
 (as Mr. Baxter observes) the Pharisees had much more the gift of prayer 
 than Christ's disciples had; but rather that they were stated forms of 
 words in use among them, which they said over by tale, as the papists 
 drop their beads. Christ doth not here condemn long prayers, as in 
 themselves hypocritical; nay if there were not a great appearance of 
 good in them, they would not have been used for a pretence; and the 
 cloak must be very thick which was used to cover such wicked practices. 
 Christ himself <I>continued all night in prayer to God,</I> and we are 
 commanded to <I>pray without ceasing</I> too soon; where there are many 
 sins to be confessed, and many wants to pray for the supply of, and 
 many mercies to give thanks for, there is occasion for long prayers. 
 But the Pharisees' long prayers were made up of vain repetitions, and 
 (which was the end of them) they were for a <I>pretence;</I> by them 
 they got the reputation of pious devout men, that loved prayer, and 
 were the favourites of Heaven; and by this means people were made to 
 believe it was not possible that such men as they should cheat them;, 
 and, therefore, happy the widow that could get a Pharisee for her 
 trustee, and guardian to her children! Thus, while they seemed to soar 
 heaven-ward, upon the wings of prayer, their eye, like the kite's, was 
 all the while upon their prey on the earth, some widow's house or other 
 that lay convenient for them. Thus circumcision was the cloak of the 
 Shechemites' covetousness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:22,23">Gen. xxxiv. 22, 23</A>),

 the payment of a vow in Hebron the cover of Absalom's rebellion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:7">2 Sam. xv. 7</A>),

 a fast in Jezreel must patronise Naboth's murder, and the extirpation 
 of Baal is the footstool of Jehu's ambition. Popish priests, under 
 pretence of long prayers for the dead, masses and dirges, and I know 
 not what, enrich themselves by devouring the house of the widows and 
 fatherless. Note, It is no new thing for the show and form of godliness 
 to be made a cloak to the greatest enormities. But dissembled piety, 
 however it passeth now, will be reckoned for as double iniquity, <I>in 
 the day when God shall judge the secrets of men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The doom passed upon them for this; <I>Therefore ye shall receive 
 the greater damnation.</I> Note, 

 (1.) There are degrees of damnation; there are some whose sin is more 
 inexcusable, <I>and whose ruin will therefore be more intolerable.</I> 
 
 (2.) The pretences of religion, with which hypocrites disguise or 
 excuse their sin now, will aggravate their condemnation shortly. Such 
 is the deceitfulness of sin, that the very thing by which sinners hope 
 to expiate and atone for their sins will come against them, and make 
 their sins more exceedingly sinful. But it is sad for the criminal, 
 when his <I>de</I>fence proves his <I>of</I>fence, and his pleas (<I>We 
 have prophesied in thy name, and in thy name</I> made long prayers) 
 heightens the charge against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. While they were such enemies to the conversion of souls to 
 Christianity, they were very industrious in the perversion of them to 
 their faction. They shut up the kingdom of heaven against those that 
 would turn to Christ, but at the same time <I>compassed sea and land to 
 make proselytes</I> to themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their commendable industry in making proselytes to the Jewish 
 religion, not only proselytes of <I>the gate,</I> who obliged 
 themselves to no more than the observance of the seven precepts of the 
 sons of Noah, but proselytes of <I>righteousness,</I> who addicted 
 themselves wholly to all the rites of the Jewish religion, for that was 
 the game they flew at; for this, for one such, though but one, they 
 compass sea and land, had many a cunning reach, and laid many a plot, 
 rode and run, and sent and wrote, and laboured unweariedly. And what 
 did they aim at? Not the glory of God, and the good of souls; but that 
 they might have the credit of making them proselytes, and the advantage 
 of making a prey of them when they were made. Note, 

 (1.) The making of proselytes, if it be to the truth and serious 
 godliness, and be done with a good design, is a good work, well worthy 
 of the utmost care and pains. Such is the value of souls, that nothing 
 must be thought too much to do, to save a soul from death. The industry 
 of the Pharisees herein may show the negligence of many who would be 
 thought to act from better principles, but will be at no pains or cost 
 to propagate the gospel. 

 (2.) To make a proselyte, sea and land must be compassed; all ways and 
 means must be tried; first one way, and then another, must be tried, 
 all little enough; but all well paid, if the point be gained.

 (3.) Carnal hearts seldom shrink from the pains necessary to carry on 
 their carnal purposes; when a proselyte is to be made to serve a turn 
 for themselves, they will compass sea and land to make him, rather than 
 be disappointed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their cursed impiety in abusing their proselytes when they were 
 made; "Ye make him the disciple of a Pharisee presently, and he sucks 
 in all a Pharisee's notions; and so <I>ye make him twofold more the 
 child of hell than yourselves.</I>" Note, 

 (1.) Hypocrites, while they fancy themselves heirs of heaven, are, in 
 the judgment of Christ, the children of hell. The rise of their 
 hypocrisy is from hell, for the devil is the father of lies; and the 
 tendency of their hypocrisy is toward hell, that is the country they 
 belong to, the inheritance they are heirs to; they are called 
 <I>children of hell,</I> because of their rooted enmity to the kingdom 
 of heaven, which was the principle and genius of Pharisaism. 

 (2.) Though all that maliciously oppose the gospel are children of 
 hell, yet some are twofold more so than others, more furious and 
 bigoted and malignant. 

 (3.) Perverted proselytes are commonly the greatest bigots; the 
 scholars outdid their masters, 

 [1.] In fondness of ceremony; the Pharisees themselves saw the folly of 
 their own impositions, and in their hearts smiled at the obsequiousness 
 of those that conformed to them; but their proselytes were eager for 
 them. Note, Weak heads commonly admire those shows and ceremonies which 
 wise men (however for public ends they countenance them) cannot but 
 think meanly of.

 [2.] In fury against Christianity; the proselytes readily imbibed the
 principles which their crafty leaders were not wanting to possess them
 with, and so became extremely hot against the truth. The most bitter
 enemies the apostles met with in all places were the Hellenist Jews,
 who were mostly proselytes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:45,14:2-19,17:5,18:6">Acts xiii. 45; 
 xiv. 2-19; xvii. 5; xviii. 6</A>.

 Paul, a disciple of the Pharisees, was <I>exceedingly mad against the
 Christians</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:11">Acts xxvi. 11</A>),

 when his master, Gamaliel, seems to have been more moderate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Their seeking their own worldly gain and honour more than God's 
 glory put them upon coining false and unwarrantable distinction, with 
 which they led the people into dangerous mistakes, particularly in the 
 matter of oaths; which, as an evidence of a universal sense of 
 religion, have been by all nations accounted sacred 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 <I>Ye blind guides.</I> Note, 

 1. It is sad to think how many are under the guidance of such as are 
 themselves blind, who undertake to show others that way which they are 
 themselves willingly ignorant of. <I>His watchmen are blind</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:10">Isa. lvi. 10</A>);

 and too often the people love to have it so, and say to the seers, 
 <I>See not.</I> But the case is bad, when the leaders of the people 
 <I>cause them to err,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:16">Isa. ix. 16</A>.

 2. Though the condition of those whose guides are blind is very sad,
 yet that of the blind guides themselves is yet more woeful. Christ 
 denounces a woe to the blind guides that have the blood of so many 
 souls to answer for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, to prove their blindness, he specifies the matter of swearing, and 
 shows what corrupt casuists they were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He lays down the doctrine they taught.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They allowed swearing by creatures, provided they were consecrated 
 to the service of God, and stood in any special relation to him. They 
 allowed swearing by the temple and the altar, though they were the work 
 of men's hands, intended to be the servants of God's honour, not 
 sharers in it. An oath is an appeal to God, to his omniscience and 
 justice; and to make this appeal to any creature is to put that 
 creature in the place of God. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:13">Deut. vi. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] They distinguished between an oath by <I>the temple</I> and an 
 oath by the <I>gold of the temple;</I> an oath by <I>the altar</I> and 
 an oath by <I>the gift upon the altar;</I> making the latter binding, 
 but not the former. Here was a double wickedness; <I>First,</I> That 
 there were some oaths which they dispensed with, and made light of, and 
 reckoned a man was not bound by to assert the truth, or perform a 
 promise. They ought not to have sworn by the temple or the altar; but, 
 when they had so sworn, they were taken in the words of their mouth. 
 That doctrine cannot be of the God of truth which gives countenance to 
 the breach of faith in any case whatsoever. Oaths are edge-tools and 
 are not to be jested with. <I>Secondly,</I> That they preferred the 
 gold before the temple, and the gift before the altar, to encourage 
 people to bring gifts to the altar, and gold to the treasures of the 
 temple, which they hoped to be gainers by. Those who had made gold 
 their hope, and whose eyes were blinded by gifts in secret, were great 
 friends to the Corban; and, gain being their godliness, by a thousand 
 artifices they made religion truckle to their worldly interests. 
 Corrupt church-guides make things to be sin or not sin as it serves 
 their purposes, and lay a much greater stress on that which concerns 
 their own gain than on that which is for God's glory and the good of 
 souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He shows the folly and absurdity of this distinction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:17-19"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>);
 
 <I>Ye fools, and blind.</I> It was in the way of a necessary reproof, 
 not an angry reproach, that Christ called them <I>fools.</I> Let it 
 suffice us from the word of wisdom to show the folly of sinful opinions 
 and practices: but, for the fastening of the character upon particular 
 persons, leave that to Christ, who knows what is in man, and has 
 forbidden us to say, <I>Thou fool.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To convict them of folly, he appeals to themselves, <I>Whether is 
 greater, the gold</I> (the golden vessels and ornaments, or the gold in 
 the treasury) <I>or the temple that sanctifies the gold; the gift, or 
 the altar that sanctifies the gift?</I> Any one will own, <I>Propter 
 quod aliquid est tale, id est magis tale--That, on account of which any
 thing is qualified in a particular way, must itself be much more 
 qualified in the same way.</I> They that sware by the gold of the 
 temple had an eye to it as holy; but what was it that made it holy but 
 the holiness of the temple, to the service of which it was 
 appropriated? And therefore the temple cannot be less holy than the 
 gold, but must be more so; for the less is blessed and sanctified of 
 the better, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:7">Heb. vii. 7</A>.

 The temple and altar were dedicated to God fixedly, the gold and gift
 but secondarily. Christ is our altar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:10">Heb. xiii. 10</A>),
 
 our temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:21">John ii. 21</A>);

 for it is he that sanctifies all our gifts, and puts an acceptableness 
 in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 Those that put their own works into the place of Christ's righteousness 
 in justification are guilty of the Pharisees' absurdity, who preferred 
 the gift before the altar. Every true Christian is a living temple; and 
 by virtue thereof common things are sanctified to him; <I>unto the pure 
 all things are pure</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:15">Tit. i. 15</A>),

 and <I>the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the</I> believing 
 <I>wife,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:14">1 Cor. vii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He rectifies the mistake 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:20-22"><I>v.</I> 20-22</A>),

 by reducing all the oaths they had invented to the true intent of an 
 oath, which is, By the name of the Lord: so that though an oath by the 
 temple, or the altar, or heaven, be formally bad, yet it is binding. 
 <I>Quod fieri non debuit, factum valet--Engagements which ought not to 
 have been made, are yet, when made, binding.</I> A man shall never take 
 advantage of his own fault.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He that swears by the altar, let him not think to shake off the 
 obligation of it by saying, "The altar is but wood, and stone, and 
 brass;" for his oath shall be construed most strongly against himself; 
 because he was culpable, and so as that the obligation of it may be 
 preserved, <I>ut res potius valeat quam pereat--the obligation being
 hereby strengthened rather than destroyed.</I> And therefore an oath by 
 the altar shall be interpreted by it and by all things thereon; for the 
 appurtenances pass with the principal. And, the things thereon being 
 offered up to God, to swear by it and them was, in effect, to call God 
 himself to witness: for it was the altar of God; and he that went to 
 that, went to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+43:4,Ps+26:6">Ps. xliii. 4; xxvi. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He that swears by the temple, if he understand what he does, 
 cannot but apprehend that the ground of such a respect to it, is, not 
 because it is a fine house, but because it is the house of God, 
 dedicated to his service, the place which he has chosen to put his name 
 there; and therefore he swears <I>by it, and by him that dwells 
 therein;</I> there he was pleased in a peculiar manner to manifest 
 himself, and give tokens of his presence; so that whoso swears by it, 
 swears by him who had said, <I>This is my rest, here will I dwell.</I> 
 Good Christians are God's temples, and the Spirit of God dwells in them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:16,6:19">1 Cor. iii. 16; vi. 19</A>),

 and God takes what is done to them as done to himself; he that grieves 
 a gracious soul, grieves it and the Spirit that dwells in it. 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:30">Eph. iv. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] If a man swears by heaven, he sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:34"><I>ch.</I> v. 34</A>);

 yet he shall not therefore be discharged from the obligation of his
 oath; no, God will make him know that the heaven he swears by, is his
 throne 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:1">Isa. lxvi. 1</A>);

 and he that swears by the throne, appeals to him that sits upon it;
 who, as he resents the affront done to him in the form of the oath, so 
 he will certainly revenge the greater affront done to him by the 
 violation of it. Christ will not countenance the evasion of a solemn 
 oath, though ever so plausible.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. They were very strict and precise in the smaller matters of the law, 
 but as careless and loose in the weightier matters, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 They were <I>partial in the law</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:9">Mal. ii. 9</A>),

 would pick and choose their duty, according as they were interested or 
 stood affected. Sincere obedience is universal, and he that from a 
 right principle obeys any of God's precepts, will have respect to them 
 all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:6">Ps. cxix. 6</A>.

 But hypocrites, who act in religion for themselves, and not for God,
 will do no more in religion than they can serve a turn by for 
 themselves. The partiality of the scribes and Pharisees appears here,
 in two instances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They observed smaller duties, but omitted greater; they were very 
 exact in paying tithes, till it came to <I>mint, anise,</I> and 
 <I>cummin,</I> their exactness in tithing of which would not cost them 
 much, but would be cried up, and they should buy reputation cheap. The 
 Pharisee boasted of this, <I>I give tithes of all that I possess,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:12">Luke xviii. 12</A>.

 But it is probable that they had ends of their own to serve, and would
 find their own account in it; for the priests and Levites, to whom the 
 tithes were paid, were in their interests, and knew how to return their 
 kindness. Paying tithes was their duty, and what the law required; 
 Christ tells them they ought not to leave it undone. Note, All ought in 
 their places to contribute to the support and maintenance of a standing 
 ministry: withholding tithes is called <I>robbing God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:8-10">Mal. ii. 8-10</A>.

 They that <I>are taught in the word,</I> and do not <I>communicate to
 them that teach them</I> that love a cheap gospel, come short of the 
 Pharisee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But that which Christ here condemns them for, is, that they <I>omitted 
 the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith;</I> and 
 their niceness in paying tithes, was, if not to atone before God, yet 
 at least to excuse end palliate to men the omission of those. All the 
 things of God's law are weighty, but those are most weighty, which are 
 most expressive of inward holiness in the heart; the instances of 
 self-denial, contempt of the world, and resignation to God, in which 
 lies the life of religion. Judgment and mercy toward men, and faith 
 toward God, are the weightier matters of the law, the <I>good 
 things</I> which the <I>Lord our God requires</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:8">Mic. vi. 8</A>);

 to do justly, and love mercy, and humble ourselves by faith to walk 
 with God. This is the obedience which is better than sacrifice or
 tithe; judgment is preferred before sacrifice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11">Isa. i. 11</A>.

 To be just to the priests in their tithe, and yet to cheat and defraud
 every body else, is but to mock God, and deceive ourselves. Mercy also 
 is preferred before sacrifice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:6">Hos. vi. 6</A>.

 To feed those who <I>made themselves fat with the offering of the
 Lord,</I> and at the same time to shut up the bowels of compassion from 
 a brother or a sister that is naked, and destitute of daily food, to 
 pay tithe-mint to the priest, and to deny a crumb to Lazarus, is to lie 
 open to that judgment without mercy, which is awarded to those who 
 pretended to judgment, and showed no mercy; nor will judgment and mercy 
 serve without faith in divine revelation; for God will be honoured in 
 his truths as well as in his laws.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They avoided lesser sins, but committed greater 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 <I>Ye blind guides;</I> so he had called them before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 for their corrupt teaching; here he calls them so for their corrupt 
 living, for their example was leading as well as their doctrine; and in 
 this also they were blind and partial; they <I>strained at a gnat, and 
 swallowed a camel.</I> In their doctrine they strained at gnats, warned 
 people against every the least violation of the tradition of the 
 elders. In their practice they strained at gnats, heaved at them, with 
 a seeming dread, as if they had a great abhorrence of sin, and were 
 afraid of it in the least instance; but they made no difficulty of 
 those sins which, in comparison with them, were as a camel to a gnat; 
 when they devoured widows' houses, they did indeed <I>swallow a 
 camel;</I> when they gave Judas the price of innocent blood, and yet 
 scrupled to put the returned money into the treasury

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:6"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 6</A>);

 when they would not go into the judgment-hall, for fear of being
 defiled, and yet would stand at the door, and cry out against the holy 
 Jesus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:28">John xviii. 28</A>);

 when they quarrelled with the disciples for eating with unwashen hands, 
 and yet, for the filling of the Corban, taught people to break the 
 fifth commandment, they strained at gnats, or lesser things, and yet 
 swallowed camels. It is not the scrupling of a little sin that Christ 
 here reproves; if it be a sin, though but a gnat, it must be strained 
 at, but the doing of that, and then swallowing a camel. In the smaller 
 matters of the law to be superstitious, and to be profane in the 
 greater, is the hypocrisy here condemned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. They were all for the outside, and not at all for the inside, of 
 religion. They were more desirous and solicitous to appear pious to men 
 than to approve themselves so toward God. This is illustrated by two 
 similitudes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are compared to a vessel that is clean washed on the outside, 
 but all dirt within, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 The Pharisees placed religion in that which at best was but a point of
 decency--the <I>washing of cups,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:4">Mark vii. 4</A>.

 They were in care to eat their meat in clean cups and platters, but 
 made no conscience of getting their meat by extortion, and using it to 
 excess. Now what a foolish thing would it be for a man to wash only the 
 outside of a cup, which is to be looked at, and to leave the inside 
 dirty, which is to be used; so they do who only avoid scandalous sins, 
 that would spoil their reputation with men, but allow themselves in 
 heart-wickedness, which renders them odious to the pure and holy God. 
 In reference to his, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The practice of the Pharisees; they made clean the outside. In 
 those things which fell under the observation of their neighbours, they 
 seemed very exact, and carried on their wicked intrigues with so much 
 artifice, that their wickedness was not suspected; people generally 
 took them for very good men. But within, in the recesses of their 
 hearts and the close retirements of their lives, they were <I>full of 
 extortion and excess;</I> of <I>violence and incontinence</I> (so Dr. 
 Hammond); that is, of injustice and intemperance. While they would seem 
 to be godly, they were neither sober nor righteous. Their <I>inward 
 part was very wickedness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:9">Ps. v. 9</A>);

 and that we are really, which we are inwardly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The rule Christ gives, in opposition to this practice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 It is addressed to the blind Pharisees. They thought themselves the 
 <I>seers of the land,</I> but 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:39">John ix. 39</A>)

 Christ calls them <I>blind.</I> Note, those are blind, in Christ's 
 account who (how quick-sighted soever they are in other things) are 
 strangers, and no enemies, to the wickedness of their own hearts; who 
 see not, and hate not, the secret sin that lodgeth there. 
 Self-ignorance is the most shameful and hurtful ignorance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17">Rev. iii. 17</A>.
 
 The rule is, <I>Cleanse first that which is within.</I> Note, the 
 principal care of every one of us should be to wash our hearts from 
 wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:14">Jer. iv. 14</A>.

 The main business of a Christian lies within, to get cleansed from the
 <I>filthiness of the spirit.</I> Corrupt affections and inclinations, 
 the secret lusts that lurk in the soul, unseen and unobserved, these 
 must first be mortified and subdued. Those sins must be conscientiously 
 abstained from, which the eye of God only is a witness to, who 
 searcheth the heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe the method prescribed; <I>Cleanse first that which is 
 within</I> not that <I>only,</I> but that <I>first;</I> because, if due 
 care be taken concerning that, the outside will be clean also. External 
 motives and inducements may keep the outside clean, while the inside is 
 filthy; but if renewing, sanctifying grace make clean the inside, that 
 will have an influence upon the outside, for the commanding principle 
 is within. If the heart be well kept, all is well, for <I>out of it are 
 the issues of life;</I> the eruptions will vanish of course. If the 
 heart and spirit be made new, there will be a newness of life; here 
 therefore we must begin with ourselves; first cleanse that which is 
 within; we then make sure work, when this is our first work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are compared to <I>whited sepulchres,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They were fair without, like sepulchres, <I>which appear beautiful 
 outward.</I> Some make it to refer to the custom of the Jews to whiten 
 graves, only for the notifying of them, especially if they were in 
 unusual places, that people might avoid them, because of the ceremonial 
 pollution contracted by the touch of a grave, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:16">Num. xix. 16</A>.

 And it was part of the charge of the overseers of the highways, to
 repair that whitening when it was decayed. Sepulchres were thus made 
 remarkable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:16,17">2 Kings xxiii. 16, 17</A>.

 The formality of hypocrites, by which they study to recommend
 themselves to the world, doth but make all wise and good men the more
 careful to avoid them, for fear of being defiled by them. <I>Beware of
 the scribes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:46">Luke xx. 46</A>.

 It rather alludes to the custom of whitening the sepulchres of eminent
 persons, for the beautifying of them. It is said here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 that they <I>garnished the sepulchres of the righteous;</I> as it is
 usual with us to erect monuments upon the graves of great persons, and 
 to strew flowers on the graves of dear friends. Now the righteousness 
 of the scribes and Pharisees was like the ornaments of a grave, or the 
 dressing up of a dead body, only for show. The top of their ambition 
 was to <I>appear righteous before men,</I> and to be applauded and had 
 in admiration by them. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They were <I>foul</I> within, like sepulchres, <I>full of dead 
 men's bones, and all uncleanness:</I> so vile are our bodies, when the 
 soul has deserted them! Thus were they full of hypocrisy and iniquity. 
 Hypocrisy is the worst iniquity of all other. Note, It is possible for 
 those that have their hearts full of sin, to have their lives free from 
 blame, and to appear very good. But what will it avail us, to have the 
 good word of our fellow-servants, if our Master doth not say, <I>Well 
 done</I>? When all other graves are opened, these whited sepulchres
 will be looked into, and the dead men's bones, and all the uncleanness, 
 shall be <I>brought out,</I> and be <I>spread before all the host of 
 heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:1,2">Jer. viii. 1, 2</A>.

 For it is the day when God shall judge, not the shows, but the secrets,
 of men. And it will then be small comfort to them who shall have their 
 portion with hypocrites, to remember how creditably and plausibly they 
 went to hell, applauded by all their neighbours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. They pretended a deal of kindness for the memory of the prophets 
 that were dead and gone, while they hated and persecuted those that 
 were present with them. This is put last, because it was the blackest 
 part of their character. God is jealous for his honour in his laws and 
 ordinances, and resents it if they be profaned and abused; but he has 
 often expressed an equal jealousy for his honour in his prophets and 
 ministers, and resents it worse if they be wronged and persecuted: and 
 therefore, when our Lord Jesus comes to this head, he speaks more fully 
 than upon any of the other 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:29-37"><I>v.</I> 29-37</A>);

 for that toucheth his ministers, <I>toucheth his Anointed,</I> and 
 toucheth the <I>apple of his eye.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The respect which the scribes and Pharisees pretend for the prophets 
 that were gone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>.

 This was the varnish, and that in which they outwardly appeared 
 righteous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They honoured the relics of the prophets, they built their tombs, 
 and garnished their sepulchres. It seems, the places of their burial
 were known, David's sepulchre was with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:29">Acts ii. 29</A>.

 There was a title upon the sepulchre of <I>the man of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:17">2 Kings xxiii. 17</A>),

 and Josiah thought it respect enough not to <I>move his bones,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 But they would do more, rebuild and beautify them. Now consider this,

 [1.] As an instance of honour done to deceased prophets, who, while
 they lived, were counted as the off-scouring of all things, and had all 
 manner of evil spoken against them falsely. Note, God can extort, even 
 from bad men, an acknowledgment of the honour of piety and holiness.
 Them that honour God he will honour, and sometimes with those from whom 
 contempt is expected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:22">2 Sam. vi. 22</A>.

 <I>The memory of the just is blessed,</I> when the names of those that
 hated and persecuted them shall be covered with shame. The honour of 
 constancy and resolution in the way of duty will be a lasting honour; 
 and those that are manifest to God, will be manifest in the consciences 
 of those about them.

 [2.] As an instance of the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees, who 
 paid their respect to them. Note, Carnal people can easily honour the 
 memories of faithful ministers that are dead and gone, because they do 
 not reprove them, nor disturb them, in their sins. Dead prophets are 
 <I>seers that see not,</I> and those they can bear well enough; they do 
 not torment them, as the living witnesses do, that bear their testimony 
 <I>viva voce--with a living voice,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>.

 They can pay respect to the writings of the dead prophets, which tell 
 them what they <I>should</I> be; but not the reproofs of the living 
 prophets, which tell them what they <I>are.</I> <I>Sit divus, modo non 
 sit vivus--Let there be saints; but let them not be living here.</I> 
 The extravagant respect which the church of Rome pays to the memory of 
 saints departed, especially the martyrs, dedicating days and places to 
 their names, enshrining their relics, praying to them, and offering to 
 their images, while they make themselves drunk with the blood of the 
 saints of their own day, is a manifest proof that they not only 
 <I>suc</I>ceed, but <I>ex</I>ceed, the scribes and Pharisees in a 
 counterfeit hypocritical religion, which builds the prophets' tombs, 
 but hates the prophets' doctrine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They protested against the murder of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>);

 <I>If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been 
 partakers with them.</I> They would never have consented to the 
 silencing of Amos, and the imprisonment of Micaiah, to the putting of 
 Hanani in the stocks, and Jeremiah in the dungeon, to the stoning of 
 Zechariah, the mocking of all the messengers of the Lord, and the 
 abuses put upon his prophets; no, not they, they would sooner have lost 
 their right hands than have done any such thing. <I>What, is thy 
 servant a dog?</I> And yet they were at this time plotting to murder 
 Christ, <I>to whom all the prophets bore witness.</I> They think, if 
 they had lived in the days of the prophets, they would have heard them 
 gladly and obeyed; and yet they rebelled against the light that Christ 
 brought into the world. But it is certain, a Herod and an Herodias to
 John the Baptist, would have been an Ahab and a Jezebel to Elijah. 
 Note, The deceitfulness of sinners' hearts appears very much in this, 
 that, while they go down the stream of the sins of their own day, they 
 fancy they should have swum against the stream of the sins of the 
 former days; that, if they had had other people's opportunities, they 
 should have improved them more faithfully; if they had been in other 
 people's temptations, they should have resisted them more vigorously; 
 when yet they improve not the opportunities they have, nor resist the 
 temptations they are in. We are sometimes thinking, if we had lived 
 when Christ was upon earth, how constantly we would have followed him; 
 we would not have despised and rejected him, as they then did; and yet 
 Christ in his Spirit, in his word, in his ministers, is still no better 
 treated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their enmity and opposition to Christ and his gospel, 
 notwithstanding, and the ruin they were bringing upon themselves and 
 upon that generation thereby, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:31-33"><I>v.</I> 31-33</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The indictment proved; <I>Ye are witnesses against yourselves.</I> 
 Note, Sinners cannot hope to escape the judgment of Christ for want of 
 proof against them, when it is easy to find them witnesses against 
 themselves; and their very pleas will not only be overruled, but turned 
 to their conviction, and <I>their own tongues</I> shall be made to 
 <I>fall upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:8">Ps. lxiv. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] By their own confession, it was the great wickedness of their 
 forefathers, to kill the prophets; so that they knew the fault of it, 
 and yet were themselves guilty of the same fact. Note, They who condemn 
 sin in others, and yet allow the same or worse in themselves, are of 
 all others most inexcusable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:32-2:1">Rom. i. 32-ii. 1</A>.

 They knew they ought not to have been partakers with persecutors, and
 yet were the followers of them. Such self-contradictions now will 
 amount to self-condemnations in the great day. Christ puts another 
 construction upon their building of the tombs of the prophets than what 
 they intended; as if by beautifying their graves they justified their 
 murderers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:48">Luke xi. 48</A>),

 for they persisted in the sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] By their own confession, these notorious persecutors were their 
 ancestors; <I>Ye are the children of them.</I> They meant no more than 
 that they were their children by blood and nature; but Christ turns it 
 upon them;, that they were so by spirit and disposition; <I>You are of 
 those fathers, and their lusts you will do.</I> They are, as you say, 
 <I>your</I> fathers, and you <I>patrizare--take after your fathers;</I>
 it is the sin that runs in the blood among you. <I>As your fathers did, 
 so do ye,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:51">Acts vii. 51</A>.

 They came of a persecuting race, were <I>a seed of evil doers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:4">Isa. i. 4</A>),

 <I>risen up in their fathers' stead,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:14">Num. xxxii. 14</A>.

 Malice, envy, and cruelty, were bred in the bone with them, and they
 had formerly espoused it for a principle, to <I>do as their fathers 
 did,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:17">Jer. xliv. 17</A>.
 
 And it is observable here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 how careful they are to mention the relation; "They were <I>our</I>
 fathers, that killed the prophets, and they were men in honour and 
 power, whose sons and successors we are." If they had detested the 
 wickedness of their ancestors, as they ought to have done, they would 
 not have been so fond to call them <I>their fathers;</I> for it is no 
 credit to be akin to persecutors, though they have ever so much dignity 
 and dominion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The sentence passed upon them. Christ here proceeds,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] To give them up to sin as irreclaimable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 <I>Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.</I> If Ephraim be 
 joined to idols, and hate to be reformed, <I>let him alone. He that is 
 filthy, let him be filthy still.</I> Christ knew they were now 
 contriving his death, and in a few days would accomplish it; "Well," 
 saith he, "go on with your plot, take your curse, walk in the way of 
 your heart and in the sight of your eyes, and see what will come of it. 
 <I>What thou doest, do quickly.</I> You will but fill up the measure of 
 guilt, which will then overflow in a deluge of wrath." Note, 
 <I>First,</I> There is a measure of sin to be filled up, before utter 
 ruin comes upon persons and families, churches and nations. God will 
 bear long, but the time will come when he can <I>no longer forbear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:22">Jer. xliv. 22</A>.

 We read of the measure of the Amorites that was to be filled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:16">Gen. xv. 16</A>),

 of the <I>harvest</I> of the earth <I>being ripe for the sickle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:15-19">Rev. xiv. 15-19</A>),

 and of sinners <I>making an end to deal treacherously,</I> arriving at 
 a full stature in treachery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1">Isa. xxxiii. 1</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Children fill up the measure of their fathers' sins 
 whey they are gone, if they persist in the same or the like. That 
 national guilt which brings national ruin is made up of the sin of many 
 in several ages, and in the successions of societies there is a score 
 going on; for God justly visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the 
 children that tread in the steps of it. <I>Thirdly,</I> Persecuting 
 Christ, and his people and ministers, is a sin that fills the measure 
 of a nation's guilt sooner than any other. This was it that brought 
 wrath without remedy upon the fathers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:16">2 Chron. xxxvi. 16</A>),

 and wrath to the utmost upon the children too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:16">1 Thess. ii. 16</A>.

 This was that fourth transgression, of which, when added to the other 
 three, the Lord <I>would not turn away the punishment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:3,6,9,11,13">Amos i. 3, 6, 9, 11, 13</A>.

 <I>Fourthly,</I> It is just with God to give those up to their own 
 heart's lusts, who obstinately persist in the gratification of them.
 Those who will run headlong to ruin, let the reins be laid on their 
 neck, and it is the saddest condition a man can be in on this side 
 hell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He proceeds to give them up to ruin as irrecoverable, to a 
 personal ruin in the other world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 <I>Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the 
 damnation of hell?</I> These are strange words to come from the mouth 
 of Christ, into whose lips grace was poured. But he can and will speak 
 terror, and in these words he explains and sums up the <I>eight</I> 
 woes he had denounced against the scribes and Pharisees.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, <I>First,</I> Their description; <I>Ye serpents.</I> Doth 
 Christ call names? Yes, but this doth not warrant us to do so. He 
 infallibly knew what was in man, and knew them to be subtle as 
 serpents, cleaving to the earth, feeding on dust; they had a specious 
 outside, but were within malignant, had poison under their tongues, the 
 seed of the old serpent. They were a <I>generation of vipers;</I> they 
 and those that went before them, they and those that joined with them, 
 were a generation of envenomed, enraged, spiteful adversaries to Christ 
 and his gospel. They loved to be called of men, <I>Rabbi, rabbi,</I> 
 but Christ calls them <I>serpents</I> and <I>vipers;</I> for he gives
 men their true characters, and delights to put contempt upon the
 proud.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Their doom. He represents their condition as very sad,
 and in a manner desperate; <I>How can ye escape the damnation of 
 hell?</I> Christ himself preached hell and damnation, for which his 
 ministers have often been reproached by those that care not to hear of 
 it. Note,

 1. The damnation of hell will be the fearful end of all impenitent
 sinners. This doom coming from Christ, was more terrible than coming 
 from all the prophets and ministers that ever were, for he is the 
 Judge, into whose hands the keys of hell and death are put, and his 
 saying they were damned, made them so.

 2. There is a way of escaping this damnation, this is implied here;
 some are <I>delivered from the wrath to come.</I>

 3. Of all sinners, those who are of the spirit of the scribes and
 Pharisees, are least likely to escape this damnation; for repentance 
 and faith are necessary to that escape; and how will <I>they</I> be 
 brought to these, who are so conceited of themselves, and so prejudiced 
 against Christ and his gospel, as they were? How could they be healed 
 and saved, who could not bear to have their wound searched, nor the 
 balm of Gilead applied to it? Publicans and harlots, who were sensible 
 of their disease and applied themselves to the Physician, were more 
 likely to escape the damnation of hell than those who, though they were 
 in the high road to it, were confident they were in the way to 
 heaven.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>34  Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men,

 <I>them</I> from city to city:

 Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and

 &nbsp; 36  Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this

 gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her

 &nbsp; 38  Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have left the blind leaders fallen into the ditch, under Christ's
 sentence, into the damnation of hell; let us see what will become of 
 the blind followers, of the body of the Jewish church, and particularly 
 Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jesus Christ designs yet to try them with the means of grace; <I>I 
 send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes.</I> The connection 
 is strange; "<I>You are a generation of vipers,</I> not likely to 
 <I>escape the damnation of hell;</I>" one would think it should follow, 
 "Therefore you shall never have a prophet sent to you any more;" but 
 no, "<I>Therefore I will send unto you prophets,</I> to see if you will 
 yet at length be wrought upon, or else to leave you inexcusable, and to 
 justify God in your ruin." It is therefore ushered in with a note of 
 admiration, behold! Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is Christ that sends them; <I>I send.</I> By this he avows 
 himself to be God, having power to gift and commission prophets. It is 
 an act of kingly office; he sends them as ambassadors to treat with us 
 about the concerns of our souls. After his resurrection, he made this 
 word good, when he said, <I>So send I you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:21">John xx. 21</A>.

 Though now he appeared mean, yet he was entrusted with this great
 authority.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He sends them to the Jews first; "I send them to <I>you.</I>" They 
 began at Jerusalem; and, wherever they went, they observed this rule, 
 to make the first tender of gospel grace <I>to the Jews,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:46">Acts xiii. 46</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Those he sends are called <I>prophets, wise men,</I> and 
 <I>scribes,</I> Old-Testament names for New-Testament officers; to show 
 that the ministers sent to them now should not be inferior to the 
 prophets of the Old Testament, to Solomon the wise, or Ezra the scribe. 
 The extraordinary ministers, who in the first ages were divinely 
 inspired, were as the prophets commissioned immediately from heaven; 
 the ordinary settled ministers, who were then, and continue in the 
 church still, and will do to the end of time, are as the wise men and 
 scribes, to guide and instruct the people in the things of God. Or, we 
 may take the apostles and evangelists for the prophets and wise men, 
 and the pastors and teachers for the scribes, <I>instructed to the 
 kingdom of heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:52"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 52</A>);

 for the office of a scribe was honourable till the men dishonoured
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He foresees and foretels the ill usage that his messengers would 
 meet with among them; "<I>Some of them ye shall kill and crucify,</I> 
 and yet I will send them." Christ knows beforehand how ill his servants 
 will be treated, and yet sends them, and appoints them their measure of 
 sufferings; yet he loves them never the less for his thus exposing 
 them, for he designs to glorify himself by their sufferings, and them 
 after them; he will counter-balance them, though not prevent them.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The cruelty of these persecutors; <I>Ye shall kill and crucify 
 them.</I> It is no less than the blood, the life-blood, that they 
 thirst after; their lust is not satisfied with any thing short of their 
 destruction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:9">Exod. xv. 9</A>.

 They killed the two James's, crucified Simon the son of Cleophas, and
 scourged Peter and John; thus did the members partake of the sufferings 
 of the Head, he was killed and crucified, and so were they. Christians 
 must expect to resist unto blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their unwearied industry; <I>Ye shall persecute them from city to 
 city.</I> As the apostles went from city to city, to preach the gospel, 
 the Jews dodged them, and haunted them, and stirred up persecution 
 against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:19,17:13">Acts xiv. 19; xvii. 13</A>.

 They that <I>did not believe in Judea</I> were more bitter enemies to
 the gospel than any other unbelievers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:31">Rom. xv. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The pretence of religion in this; they scourged them in their 
 synagogues, their place of worship, where they kept their 
 ecclesiastical courts; so that they did it as a piece of service to the 
 church; cast them out, and said, <I>Let the Lord be glorified,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5,Joh+16:2">Isa. lxvi. 5; John xvi. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He imputes the sin of their fathers to them, because they imitated 
 it; <I>That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the 
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35,36"><I>v.</I> 35, 36</A>.

 Though God bear long with a persecuting generation, he will not bear 
 always; and patience abused, turns into the greatest wrath. The longer 
 sinners have been heaping up treasures of wickedness, the deeper and 
 fuller will the treasures of wrath be; and the breaking of them up will 
 be like breaking up the fountains of the great deep.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. The extent of this imputation; it takes in <I>all the righteous
 blood shed upon the earth,</I> that is, the blood shed for 
 righteousness' sake, which has all been laid up in God's treasury, and 
 not a drop of it lost, for <I>it is precious.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:14">Ps. lxxii. 14</A>.

 He dates the account <I>from the blood of righteous Abel,</I> thence
 this <I>&aelig;ra martyrum--age of martyrs</I>--commences; he is
 called <I>righteous</I> Abel, for he obtained witness from heaven, that 
 he was <I>righteous, God testifying of his gifts.</I> How early did 
 martyrdom come into the world! The first that died, died for his 
 religion, and, <I>being dead, he yet speaketh.</I> His blood not only 
 cried against Cain, but continues to cry against all that walk in the 
 way of Cain, and hate and persecute their brother, <I>because their 
 works are righteous.</I> He extends it <I>to the blood of Zacharias, 
 the son of Barachias</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 not Zecharias the prophet (as some would have it), though he was <I>the
 son of Barachias</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:1">Zech. i. 1.</A>)

 nor Zecharias the father of John Baptist, as others say; but, as is 
 most probable, <I>Zechariah the son of Jehoiada,</I> who was <I>slain 
 in the court of the Lord's house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:20,21">2 Chron. xxiv. 20, 21</A>.

 His father is called <I>Barachias,</I> which signifies much the same
 with Jehoiada; and it was usual among the Jews for the same person to 
 have two names; <I>whom ye slew,</I> ye of this nation, though not of 
 this generation. This is specified, because the requiring of that is
 particularly spoken of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:22">2 Chron. xxiv. 22</A>),

 as that of Abel's is. The Jews imagined that the captivity had 
 sufficiently atoned for the guilt; but Christ lets them know that it 
 was not yet fully accounted for, but remained upon the score. And some 
 think that this is mentioned with a prophetical hint, for there was one 
 Zecharias, the son of Baruch, whom Josephus speaks of (<I>War</I> 
 4. 335), who was a just and good man, who was killed in the temple a
 little before it was destroyed by the Romans. Archbishop Tillotson 
 thinks that Christ both alludes to the history of the former Zecharias 
 in <I>Chronicles,</I> and foretels the death of this latter in 
 Josephus. Though the latter was not yet slain, yet, before this 
 destruction comes, it would be true that they had slain him; so that 
 all shall be put together from first to last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The effect of it; <I>All these things shall come;</I> all the guilt 
 of this blood, all the punishment of it, it shall <I>all come upon this 
 generation.</I> The misery and ruin that are coming upon them, shall be 
 so very great, that, though, considering the evil of their own sins, it 
 was less that even those deserved; yet, comparing it with other 
 judgments, it will seem to be a general reckoning for all the 
 wickedness of their ancestors, especially their persecutions, to all 
 which God declared this ruin to have special reference and relation. 
 The destruction shall be so dreadful, as if God had once for all 
 arraigned them for all the righteous blood shed in the world. It shall 
 <I>come upon this generation;</I> which intimates, that it shall come 
 quickly; some here shall live to see it. Note, The sorer and nearer the 
 punishment of sin is, the louder is the call to repentance and 
 reformation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He laments the wickedness of Jerusalem, and justly upbraids them 
 with the many kind offers he had made them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 See with what concern he speaks of that city; <I>O Jerusalem,
 Jerusalem!</I> The repetition is emphatical, and bespeaks abundance of
 commiseration. A day or two before Christ had wept over Jerusalem, now
 he sighed and groaned over it. Jerusalem, <I>the vision of peace</I>
 (so it signifies), must now be the seat of war and confusion.
 Jerusalem, that had been <I>the joy of the whole earth,</I> must now be
 <I>a hissing, and an astonishment, and a by-word;</I> Jerusalem, that
 has been <I>a city compact together,</I> shall now be shattered and
 ruined by its own intestine broils. Jerusalem, <I>the place that God
 has chosen to put his name there,</I> shall now be abandoned to the
 spoil and the robbers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:1,4:1">Lam. i. 1, iv. 1</A>.

 But wherefore will the Lord do all this to Jerusalem? Why? <I>Jerusalem 
 hath grievously sinned,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:8">Lam. i. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She persecuted God's messengers; <I>Thou that killest the prophets, 
 and stonest them that are sent unto thee.</I> This sin is especially 
 charged upon Jerusalem; because there the Sanhedrim, or great council, 
 sat, who took cognizance of church matters, and therefore a prophet 
 could not perish but in Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:33">Luke xiii. 33</A>.

 It is true, they had not now a power to put any man to death, but they
 killed the prophets in popular tumults, mobbed them, as Stephen, and 
 put the Roman powers on to kill them. At Jerusalem, where the gospel 
 was first preached, it was first persecuted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:1">Acts viii. 1</A>),

 and that place was the head-quarters of the persecutors; thence 
 warrants were issued out to other cities, and thither the saints were 
 brought bound, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:2">Acts ix. 2</A>.

 <I>Thou stonest them:</I> that was a capital punishment, in use only 
 among the Jews. By the law, false prophets and seducers were to <I>be 
 stoned</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:10">Deut. xiii. 10</A>),

 under colour of which law, they put the true prophets to death. Note,
 It has often been the artifice of Satan, to turn that artillery against 
 the church, which was originally planted in the defence of it. Brand
 the true prophets as seducers, and the true professors of religion as 
 heretics and schismatics, and then it will be easy to persecute them. 
 There was abundance of other wickedness in Jerusalem; but this was the 
 sin that made the loudest cry, and which God had an eye to more than 
 any other, in bringing that ruin upon them, as 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:4,2Ch+36:16">2 Kings xxiv. 4; 2 Chron. xxxvi. 16</A>.

 Observe, Christ speaks in the present tense; <I>Thou killest, and
 stonest;</I> for all they had done, and all they would do, was present 
 to Christ's notice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She refused and rejected Christ, and gospel offers. The former was a 
 sin <I>without</I> remedy, this <I>against</I> the remedy. Here is, 
 
 (1.) The wonderful grace and favour of Jesus Christ toward them; <I>How 
 often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathers her 
 chickens under her wings!</I> Thus kind and condescending are the 
 offers of gospel grace, even to Jerusalem's children, bad as she is, 
 the inhabitants, the little ones not excepted. 

 [1.] The favour proposed was the gathering of them. Christ's design is 
 to gather poor souls, gather them in from their wanderings, gather them 
 home to himself, as the Centre of unity; for <I>to him must the 
 gathering of the people be.</I> He would have taken the whole body of 
 the Jewish nation into the church, and so gathered them all (as the 
 Jews used to speak of proselytes) <I>under the wings of the Divine 
 Majesty.</I> It is here illustrated by a humble similitude; <I>as a 
 hen</I> clucks <I>her chickens together.</I> Christ would have gathered 
 them, <I>First,</I> With such a tenderness of affection as the hen 
 does, which has, by instinct, a peculiar concern for her young ones. 
 Christ's gathering of souls, comes from his love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:3">Jer. xxxi. 3</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> For the same end. <I>The hen gathered her chickens
 under her wings,</I> for protection and safety, and for warmth and 
 comfort; poor souls have in Christ both refuge and refreshment. The 
 chickens naturally run to the hen for shelter, when they are threatened 
 by the birds of prey; perhaps Christ refers to that promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:4">Ps. xci. 4</A>),

 <I>He shall cover thee with his feathers.</I> There is <I>healing under 
 Christ's wings</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:2">Mal. iv. 2</A>);

 that is more than the hen has for her chickens.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The forwardness of Christ to confer this favour. His offers are, 
 <I>First,</I> Very free; <I>I would have done it.</I> Jesus Christ is 
 truly willing to receive and save poor souls that come to him. He 
 desires not their ruin, he delights in their repentance. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Very frequent; <I>How often!</I> Christ often came up 
 to Jerusalem, preached, and wrought miracles there; and the meaning of 
 all this, was, he would have gathered them. He keeps account how often 
 his calls have been repeated. As often as we have heard the sound of
 the gospel, as often as we have felt the strivings of the Spirit, so 
 often Christ would have gathered us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Their wilful refusal of this grace and favour; <I>Ye would 
 not.</I> How emphatically is their obstinacy opposed to Christ's mercy! 
 I would, and <I>ye would not.</I> He was willing to save them, but they 
 were not willing to be saved by him. Note, It is wholly owing to the 
 wicked wills of sinners, that they are not gathered under the wings of 
 the Lord Jesus. They did not like the terms upon which Christ proposed 
 to gather them; they loved their sins, and yet trusted to their 
 righteousness; they would not submit either to the grace of Christ or 
 to his government, and so the bargain broke off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He reads Jerusalem's doom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:38,39"><I>v.</I> 38, 39</A>);

 <I>Therefore behold your house is left unto you desolate.</I> Both the 
 city and the temple, God's house and their own, all shall be laid 
 waste. But it is especially meant of the temple, which they boasted of, 
 and trusted to; that holy mountain because of which they were so 
 haughty. Note, they that will not be gathered by the love and grace of 
 Christ shall be consumed and scattered by his wrath; <I>I would, and 
 you would not. Israel would none of me, so I gave them up,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:11,12">Ps. lxxxi. 11, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their house shall be <I>deserted; It is left unto you.</I> Christ 
 was now departing from the temple, and never came into it again, but by 
 this word abandoned it to ruin. They doated on it, would have it to 
 themselves; Christ must have no room or interest there. "Well," saith 
 Christ, "it is left to you; take it, and make your best of it; I will 
 never have any thing more to do with it." They had made it <I>a house 
 of merchandise, and a den of thieves,</I> and so it is left to them. 
 Not long after this, the voice was heard in the temple, "Let us depart 
 hence." When Christ went, <I>Ichabod, the glory departed.</I> Their 
 city also was left to them, destitute of God's presence and grace; he 
 was no longer <I>a wall of fire about them,</I> nor <I>the glory in the 
 midst of them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It shall be <I>desolate; It is left unto you desolate;</I> it is 
 left <B><I>eremos</I></B>--<I>a wilderness.</I> 

 (1.) It was immediately, when Christ left it, in the eyes of all that 
 understood themselves, a very dismal melancholy place. Christ's 
 departure makes the best furnished, best replenished place a 
 wilderness, though it be the temple, the chief place of concourse; for 
 what comfort can there be where Christ is not? Though there may be a 
 crowd of other contentments, yet, if Christ's special spiritual 
 presence be withdrawn, that soul, that place, is <I>become a 
 wilderness, a land of darkness, as darkness itself.</I> This comes of 
 men's rejecting Christ, and driving him away from them. 

 (2.) It was, not long after, destroyed and ruined, and <I>not one stone 
 left upon another.</I> The lot of Jerusalem's enemies will now become 
 Jerusalem's lot, <I>to be made of a city a heap, of a defenced city a 
 ruin</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:2">Isa. xxv. 2</A>),
 
 <I>a lofty city laid low, even to the ground,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:5">Isa. xxvi. 5</A>.

 The temple, that holy and beautiful house, became desolate. When God
 goes out, all enemies break in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is the final farewell that Christ took of them and 
 their temple; <I>Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, 
 Blessed is he that cometh.</I> This bespeaks,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His departure from them. The time was at hand, when <I>he should 
 leave the world, to go to his Father,</I> and be seen no more. <I>After 
 his resurrection, he was seen only by a few chosen witnesses,</I> and 
 they saw him not long, but he soon removed to the invisible world, and 
 there will be <I>till the time of the restitution of all things,</I> 
 when his welcome at his first coming will be repeated with loud 
 acclamations; <I>Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</I> 
 Christ will not be seen again till he <I>come in the clouds, and every 
 eye shall see him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:7">Rev. i. 7</A>);

 and then, even they, who, when time was, rejected and pierced him, will 
 be glad to come in among his adorers; then every knee shall bow to him, 
 even those that had bowed to Baal; and even the workers of iniquity 
 will then cry, <I>Lord, Lord,</I> and will own, when his wrath is 
 kindled, that <I>blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</I> 
 Would we have our lot in that day with those that say, <I>Blessed is he 
 that cometh?</I> let us be with them now, with them that truly worship, 
 and truly welcome, Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their continued blindness and obstinacy; <I>Ye shall not see me,</I> 
 that is, not see me to be the Messiah (for otherwise they did see him 
 upon the cross), not see the light of the truth concerning me, nor 
 <I>the things that belong to your peace, till ye shall say, Blessed is 
 he that cometh.</I> They will never be convinced, till Christ's second 
 coming convince them, when it will be too late to make an interest in 
 him, and nothing will remain <I>but a fearful looking for of 
 judgment.</I> Note, 

 (1.) Wilful blindness is often punished with judicial blindness. If 
 they <I>will</I> not see, they <I>shall</I> not see. With this word he 
 concludes his public preaching. <I>After his resurrection,</I> which 
 was <I>the sign of the prophet Jonas,</I> they should have no other 
 sign given them, till they should <I>see the sign of the Son of 
 man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:30"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 30</A>.

 (2.) When <I>the Lord comes with ten thousand of his saints,</I> he
 will convince all, and will force acknowledgments from the proudest of 
 his enemies, of his being the Messiah, and even <I>they shall be found 
 liars to him.</I> They that would not now come at his call, shall then 
 be forced to depart with his curse. The chief priests and scribes were 
 displeased with the children for crying <I>hosanna</I> to Christ; but 
 the day is coming, when proud persecutors would gladly be found in the 
 condition of the meanest and poorest they now trample upon. They who 
 now reproach and ridicule the hosannas of the saints will be of another 
 mind shortly; it were therefore better to be of that mind now. Some 
 make this to refer to the conversion of the Jews to the faith of 
 Christ; then they shall see him, and own him, and <I>say, Blessed is he 
 that cometh;</I> but it seems rather to look further, for the complete 
 manifestation of Christ, and conviction of sinners, are reserved to be 
 the glory of the last day.</P>
