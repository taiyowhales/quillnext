 him concerning some Galileans, that were lately massacred by Pilate, as

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  There were present at that season some that told him of the
 Galil&aelig;ans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
 &nbsp; 2 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these
 Galil&aelig;ans were sinners above all the Galil&aelig;ans, because they
 suffered such things?
 &nbsp; 3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
 perish.
 &nbsp; 4 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and
 slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that
 dwelt in Jerusalem?
 &nbsp; 5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
 perish.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 

 I. Tidings brought to Christ of the death of some Galileans lately, 
 whose blood <I>Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Let us consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What this tragical story was. It is briefly related here, and is not 
 met with in any of the historians of those times. Josephus indeed 
 mentions Pilate's killing some Samaritans, who, under the conduct of a 
 factious leader, were going in a tumultuous manner to mount Gerizim, 
 where the Samaritans' temple was; but we can by no means allow that 
 story to be the same with this. Some think that these Galileans were of 
 the faction of Judas Gaulonita, called also <I>Judas of Galilee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:37">Acts v. 37</A>),

 who disowned C&aelig;sar's authority and refused to pay tribute to him: 
 or perhaps these, being Galileans, were only suspected by Pilate to be 
 of that faction, and barbarously murdered, because those who were in 
 league with that pretender were out of his reach. The Galileans being 
 Herod's subjects, it is probable that this outrage committed upon them 
 by Pilate occasioned the quarrel that was between Herod and Pilate, 
 which we read of in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:12"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 12</A>.

 We are not told what number they were, perhaps <I>but a few,</I> whom
 Pilate had some particular <I>pique</I> against (and therefore the 
 story is overlooked by Josephus); but the circumstance remarked is that 
 he <I>mingled their blood with their sacrifices</I> in the court of the 
 temple. Though perhaps they had reason to fear Pilate's malice, yet 
 they would not, under pretence of that fear, keep away from Jerusalem, 
 whither the law obliged them to go up with their sacrifices. Dr 
 Lightfoot thinks it probable that they were <I>themselves</I> killing 
 their sacrifices (which was allowed, for the priest's work, they said, 
 began with the <I>sprinkling of the blood</I>), and that Pilate's 
 officers came upon them by surprise, just at the time when they were 
 off their guard (for otherwise the Galileans were mettled men, and 
 generally went well-armed), and mingled the blood of the sacrificers 
 with the blood of the sacrifices, as if it had been equally acceptable 
 to God. Neither the holiness of the place nor of the work would be a 
 protection to them from the fury of an unjust judge, <I>who neither 
 feared God nor regarded man.</I> The altar, which used to be a 
 sanctuary and place of shelter, is now become a snare and a trap, a 
 place of danger and slaughter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Why it was related <I>at this season</I> to our Lord Jesus. 

 (1.) Perhaps merely as a matter of news, which they supposed he had not 
 heard before, and as a thing which they lamented, and believed he would 
 do so too; for the Galileans were their countrymen. Note, Sad 
 providences ought to be observed by us, and the knowledge of them 
 communicated to others, that they and we may be suitably affected with 
 them, and make a good use of them. 

 (2.) Perhaps it was intended as a confirmation of what Christ had said 
 in the close of the foregoing chapter, concerning the necessity of 
 making our peace with God in time, before we be <I>delivered to the 
 officer,</I> that is, to <I>death,</I> and so <I>cast into prison,</I> 
 and then it will be too late to make agreements: "Now," say they, 
 "Master, here is a fresh instance of some that were very suddenly 
 <I>delivered to the officer,</I> that were taken away by death when 
 they little expected it; and therefore we have all need to be ready." 
 Note, It will be of good use to us both to explain the word of God and 
 to enforce it upon ourselves by observing the providences of God. 

 (3.) Perhaps they would stir him up, being himself of Galilee, and a 
 prophet, and one that had a great interest in that country, to find out 
 a way to revenge the death of these Galileans upon Herod. If they had 
 any thoughts of this kind, they were quite mistaken; for Christ was now 
 going up to Jerusalem, to be <I>delivered into the hands of Pilate,</I> 
 and to have his blood, not mingled with his sacrifice, but itself made 
 a sacrifice. 

 (4.) Perhaps this was told Christ to <I>deter</I> him from going up to
 Jerusalem, to worship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 lest Pilate should serve him as he had served those Galileans, and 
 should suggest against him, as probably he had insinuated against those 
 Galileans, in vindication of his cruelty, that they came to sacrifice 
 as Absalom did, with a <I>seditious</I> design, under colour of 
 sacrificing, to raise rebellion. Now, lest Pilate, when his hand was 
 in, should proceed further, they think it advisable that Christ should 
 for the present keep out of the way. 

 (5.) Christ's answer intimates that they told him this with a spiteful 
 <I>innuendo,</I> that, though Pilate was unjust in killing them, yet 
 without doubt they were secretly bad men, else God would not have 
 permitted Pilate thus barbarously to cut them off. It was very 
 invidious; rather than they would allow them to be martyrs, though they 
 died sacrificing, and perhaps suffered for their devotion, they would, 
 without any colour of proof, suppose them to be malefactors; and it may 
 be for no other reason than because they were not of their party and 
 denomination, differed from them, or had difference with them. This 
 fate of theirs, which was capable not only of a favourable, but an 
 honourable construction, shall be called a <I>just judgment</I> of God 
 <I>upon them,</I> though they know not for what.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's reply to this report, in which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He seconded it with another story, which, like it, gave an instance 
 of people's being taken away by sudden death. It is not long since 
 <I>the tower of Siloam fell,</I> and there were eighteen persons killed 
 and buried in the ruins of it. Dr Lightfoot's conjecture is that this 
 tower adjoined to the <I>pool of Siloam,</I> which was the same with 
 the pool of Bethesda, and that it belonged to those <I>porches</I> 
 which were by the <I>pool,</I> in which the <I>impotent folks</I> lay, 
 that <I>waited for the stirring</I> of the water 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:3">John v. 3</A>),

 and that they who were killed were some of them, or some of those who 
 in this pool used to purify themselves for the temple-service, for it 
 was near the temple. Whoever they were, it was a sad story; yet such 
 melancholy accidents we often hear of: for <I>as the birds are caught 
 in a snare, so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it 
 falls suddenly upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:12">Eccl. ix. 12</A>.

 Towers, that were built for safety, often prove men's destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He cautioned his hearers not to make an ill use of these and similar 
 events, nor take occasion thence to censure <I>great sufferers,</I> as 
 if they were <I>therefore</I> to be accounted <I>great sinners: Suppose 
 ye that these Galileans,</I> who were slain as they were sacrificing, 
 <I>were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such 
 things? I tell you nay,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 Perhaps they that told him the story of the Galileans were Jews, and 
 were glad of any thing that furnished them with matter of reflection 
 upon the Galileans, and therefore Christ retorted upon them the story 
 of the <I>men of Jerusalem,</I> that came to an untimely end; for, 
 <I>with what measure</I> of that kind <I>we mete,</I> it <I>shall be 
 measured to us again.</I> "Now suppose ye that <I>those eighteen</I> 
 who met with their death from the tower of Siloam, while perhaps they 
 were expecting their cure from the pool of Siloam, were <I>debtors</I> 
 to divine justice <I>above all men that dwelt at Jerusalem? I tell you 
 nay.</I>" Whether it make for us or against us, we must abide by this 
 rule, that we cannot judge of men's <I>sins</I> by their 
 <I>sufferings</I> in this world; for many are thrown into the furnace 
 as gold to be purified, not as dross and chaff to be consumed. We must 
 therefore not be harsh in our censures of those that are afflicted more 
 than their neighbours, as Job's friends were in their censures of him, 
 lest we condemn <I>the generation of the righteous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:14">Ps. lxxii. 14</A>.

 If we will be judging, we have enough to do to judge ourselves; nor
 indeed can we <I>know love or hatred by all that is before us,</I> 
 because <I>all things come alike to all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:1,2">Eccl. ix. 1, 2</A>.

 And we might as justly conclude that the <I>oppressors,</I> and Pilate
 among the rest, <I>on whose side are power</I> and success, are the 
 greatest saints, as that the <I>oppressed,</I> and those Galileans 
 among the rest, who are all in tears and have no comforter, no, not the 
 priests and Levites that attended the altar, are the <I>greatest 
 sinners.</I> Let us, in our censures of others, do as we would be done 
 by; for as we do we shall be done by: <I>Judge not, that ye be not 
 judged,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:1">Matt. vii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. On these stories he founded a call to repentance, adding to each of 
 them this awakening word, <I>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise 
 perish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.

 (1.) This intimates that we all deserve to <I>perish</I> as much as
 <I>they did,</I> and had we been dealt with according to our sins, 
 according to the <I>iniquity of our holy things,</I> our blood had been 
 long ere this mingled with our sacrifices by the justice of God. It 
 must moderate our censure, not only that we are <I>sinners,</I> but 
 that we are as great sinners as they, have as much sin to repent of as 
 they had to suffer for. 

 (2.) That therefore we are all concerned to <I>repent,</I> to be sorry 
 for what we have done amiss, and to do so no more. The judgments of God 
 upon others are loud calls to us to <I>repent.</I> See how Christ 
 improved every thing for the pressing of that great duty which he came 
 not only to <I>gain room</I> for, and <I>give hopes</I> to, but to 
 enjoin upon us--and that is, to <I>repent.</I> 

 (3.) That repentance is the way to escape perishing, and it is a sure 
 way: <I>so iniquity shall not be your ruin,</I> but upon no other 
 terms. 

 (4.) That, if we repent not, we shall certainly perish, as others have 
 done before us. Some lay an emphasis upon the word <I>likewise,</I> and 
 apply it to the destruction that was coming upon the people of the 
 Jews, and particularly upon Jerusalem, who were destroyed by the Romans 
 at the time of their passover, and so, like the Galileans, they had 
 <I>their blood mingled with their sacrifices;</I> and many of them, 
 both in Jerusalem and in other places, were destroyed by the fall of 
 walls and buildings which were battered down about their ears, as those 
 that died by the fall of the tower of Siloam. But certainly it looks 
 further; except we repent, we shall perish eternally, as they perished 
 out of this world. The same Jesus that calls us to <I>repent because 
 the kingdom of heaven is at hand,</I> bids us <I>repent</I> because 
 otherwise we shall perish; so that he has set before us life and death, 
 good and evil, and put us to our choice.

 (5.) The perishing of <I>those</I> in their impenitency who have been 
 most harsh and severe in judging others will be in a particular manner 
 aggravated.</P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  He spake also this parable; A certain <I>man</I> had a fig tree
 planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon,
 and found none.
 &nbsp; 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these
 three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none:
 cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?
 &nbsp; 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year
 also, till I shall dig about it, and dung <I>it:</I>
 &nbsp; 9 And if it bear fruit, <I>well:</I> and if not, <I>then</I> after that
 thou shalt cut it down.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This parable is intended to enforce that word of warning immediately 
 going before, "<I>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish;</I> 
 except you be reformed, you will be ruined, as the barren tree, except 
 it bring forth fruit, will be cut down."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This parable primarily refers to the nation and people of the Jews. 
 God chose them for his own, made them a people near to him, gave them 
 advantages for knowing and serving him above any other people, and 
 expected answerable returns of duty and obedience from them, which, 
 turning to his praise and honour, he would have accounted <I>fruit;</I> 
 but they disappointed his expectations: they did not do their duty; 
 they were a reproach instead of being a credit to their profession. 
 Upon this, he justly determined to abandon them, and cut them off, to 
 deprive them of their privileges, to unchurch and unpeople them; but, 
 upon Christ's intercession, as of old upon that of Moses, he graciously 
 gave them further time and further mercy; tried them, as it were, 
 another year, by sending his apostles among them, to call them to 
 repentance, and in Christ's name to offer them pardon, upon repentance. 
 Some of them were wrought upon to <I>repent,</I> and bring forth fruit, 
 and with them all was well; but the body of the nation continued 
 impenitent and unfruitful, and ruin without remedy came upon them; 
 about forty years after they were cut down, and cast into the fire, as 
 John Baptist had told them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:10">Matt. iii. 10</A>),

 which saying of his this parable enlarges upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Yet it has, without doubt, a further reference, and is designed for 
 the awakening of all that enjoy the means of grace, and the privileges 
 of the visible church, to see to it that the temper of their minds and 
 the tenour of their lives be answerable to their professions and 
 opportunities, for that is the <I>fruit</I> required. Now observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The advantages which this fig-tree had. It was <I>planted in a 
 vineyard,</I> in better soil, and where it had more care taken of it 
 and more pains taken with it, than other fig-trees had, that commonly 
 grew, not in <I>vineyards</I> (Those are for vines), but by the
 <I>way-side,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:19">Matt. xxi. 19</A>.

 This fig-tree belonged to a <I>certain man,</I> that owned it, and was
 at expense upon it. Note, The church of God is <I>his vineyard,</I> 
 distinguished from the common, and fenced about,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:1,2">Isa. v. 1, 2</A>.

 We are <I>fig-trees planted</I> in this vineyard by our baptism; we
 have a place and a name in the visible church, and this is our 
 privilege and happiness. It is a distinguishing favour: he has not 
 <I>dealt so with other nations.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The owner's expectation from it: <I>He came, and sought fruit 
 thereon,</I> and he had reason to expect it. He did not <I>send,</I> 
 but came himself, intimating his desire to find fruit. Christ came into 
 this world, <I>came to his own,</I> to the Jews, seeking fruit. Note, 
 The God of heaven requires and expects <I>fruit</I> from those that 
 have a place in his vineyard. He has <I>his eye</I> upon those that 
 <I>enjoy</I> the gospel, to see whether they <I>live</I> up to it; he 
 seeks evidences of their getting good by the means of grace they enjoy. 
 <I>Leaves</I> will not serve, crying, <I>Lord, Lord; blossoms</I> will 
 not serve, beginning well and promising fair; there must be 
 <I>fruit.</I> Our thoughts, words, and actions must be according to the 
 gospel, light and love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The disappointment of his expectation: <I>He found none,</I> none at 
 all, not one fig. Note, It is sad to think how many enjoy the 
 privileges of the gospel, and yet do nothing at all to the honour of 
 God, nor to answer the end of his entrusting them with those 
 privileges; and it is a disappointment to him and a grief to the Spirit 
 of his grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He here complains of it to the dresser of the vineyard: I come, 
 <I>seeking fruit,</I> but am disappointed--<I>I find none,</I> looking
 for grapes, but behold <I>wild grapes.</I> He is grieved with such a 
 generation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He aggravates it, with two considerations:--

 [1.] That he had waited long, and yet was disappointed. As he was not 
 <I>high</I> in his expectations, he only expected fruit, not 
 <I>much</I> fruit, so he was not <I>hasty, he came three years,</I> 
 year after year: applying it to the Jews, he came one space of time 
 before the captivity, another after that, and another in the preaching 
 of John Baptist and of Christ himself; or it may allude to the three 
 years of Christ's public ministry, which were now expiring. In general, 
 it teaches us that the patience of God is stretched out to 
 long-suffering with many that enjoy the gospel, and do not bring forth 
 the fruits of it; and this patience is wretchedly abused, which 
 provokes God to so much the greater severity. How many times three 
 years has God come to many of us, <I>seeking fruit,</I> but has 
 <I>found none,</I> or next to none, or worse than none!

 [2.] That this fig-tree did not only not bring forth fruit, but did 
 hurt; it <I>cumbered the ground;</I> it took up the room of a fruitful 
 tree, and was injurious to all about it. Note, Those who do not 
 <I>do</I> good commonly <I>do hurt</I> by the influence of their bad 
 example; they grieve and discourage those that are good; they harden 
 and encourage those that are bad. And the mischief is the greater, and 
 the ground the more cumbered, if it be a high, large, spreading tree, 
 and if it be an old tree of long standing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The doom passed upon it; <I>Cut it down.</I> He saith this to the 
 <I>dresser of the vineyard,</I> to Christ, to whom all judgment is 
 committed, to the ministers who are in his name to declare this doom. 
 Note, No other can be expected concerning barren trees than that they 
 should be <I>cut down.</I> As the unfruitful vineyard is dismantled, 
 and thrown open to the common 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:5,6">Isa. v. 5, 6</A>),

 so the unfruitful trees in the vineyard are cast out of it, and wither, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:6">John xv. 6</A>.

 It is cut down by the judgments of God, especially spiritual judgments,
 such as those on the Jews that believed not,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:9,10">Isa. vi. 9, 10</A>.
 
 It is cut down by death, and cast into the fire of hell; and with good 
 reason, for <I>why cumbers it the ground?</I> What reason is there why 
 it should have a place in the vineyard to no purpose?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The dresser's intercession for it. Christ is the great Intercessor; 
 he ever lives, interceding. Ministers are intercessors; they that 
 <I>dress</I> the vineyard should <I>intercede</I> for it; those we 
 <I>preach to</I> we should <I>pray for,</I> for we must give ourselves 
 to the <I>word of God</I> and to <I>prayer.</I> Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What it is he prays for, and that is a reprieve: <I>Lord, let it 
 alone this year also.</I> He doth not pray, "Lord, let it never be cut 
 down," but, "Lord, not now. Lord, do not remove the dresser, do not 
 withhold the dews, do not pluck up the tree." Note, 

 [1.] It is desirable to have a barren tree reprieved. Some have not yet 
 <I>grace to repent,</I> yet it is a mercy to them to have <I>space to 
 repent,</I> as it was to the old world to have 120 years allowed them 
 to make their peace with God.

 [2.] We owe it to Christ, the great Intercessor, that <I>barren</I> 
 trees are not cut down immediately: had it not been for his 
 interposition, the whole world had been cut down, upon the sin of Adam; 
 but he said, <I>Lord, let it alone;</I> and it is he that upholds all 
 things.

 [3.] We are encouraged to pray to God for the merciful reprieve of 
 barren fig-trees: "Lord, <I>let them alone;</I> continue them yet 
 awhile in their probation; bear with them a little longer, and wait to 
 be gracious." Thus must we stand in the gap, to turn away wrath.

 [4.] Reprieves of mercy are but for a time; <I>Let it alone this year 
 also,</I> a short time, but a sufficient time to make trial. When God 
 has borne long, we may hope he will bear yet a little longer, but we 
 cannot expect he should bear always.

 [5.] <I>Reprieves</I> may be obtained by the prayers of others for us, 
 but not <I>pardons;</I> there must be our own faith, and repentance, 
 and prayers, else no pardon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How he promises to improve this reprieve, if it be obtained: 
 <I>Till I shall dig about it, and dung it,</I> Note, 

 [1.] In general, our prayers must always be seconded with our 
 endeavours. The dresser seems to say, "Lord, it may be I have been 
 wanting in that which is my part; but let it alone this year, and I 
 will do more than I have done towards its fruitfulness." Thus in all 
 our prayers we must request God's grace, with a humble resolution to do 
 our duty, else we mock God, and show that we do not rightly value the 
 mercies we pray for.

 [2.] In particular, when we pray to God for grace for ourselves or 
 others, we must follow our prayers with diligence in the use of the 
 means of grace. The dresser of the vineyard engages to do <I>his</I> 
 part, and therein teaches ministers to do <I>theirs.</I> He will <I>dig 
 about</I> the tree and will <I>dung</I> it. Unfruitful Christians must 
 be <I>awakened</I> by the terrors of the law, which <I>break up the 
 fallow ground,</I> and then encouraged by the promises of the gospel, 
 which are warming and fattening, as manure to the tree. Both methods 
 must be tried; the one prepares for the other, and all little 
 enough.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Upon what foot he leaves the matter: "Let us try it, and try what 
 we can do with it one year more, <I>and, if it bear fruit, well,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It is possible, nay, there is hope, that yet it may be fruitful." In 
 this hope the owner will have patience with it, and the dresser will 
 take pains with it, and, if it should have the desired success, both 
 will be pleased that it was not cut down. The word <I>well</I> is not 
 in the original, but the expression is abrupt: <I>If it bear 
 fruit!</I>--supply it how you please, so as to express how wonderfully 
 well-pleased both the owner and dresser will be. If it bear fruit, 
 there will be cause of rejoicing; we have what we would have. But it 
 cannot be better expressed than as we do: <I>well.</I> Note, Unfruitful 
 professors of religion, if after long unfruitfulness they will repent, 
 and amend, and bring forth fruit, shall find <I>all is well.</I> God 
 will be <I>pleased,</I> for he will be <I>praised;</I> ministers' hands 
 will be strengthened, and such penitents will be their joy now and 
 their crown shortly. Nay, there will be joy in heaven for it; the 
 ground will be no longer cumbered, but bettered, the vineyard 
 beautified, and the good trees in it made better. As for the tree 
 itself, it is <I>well</I> for it; it shall not only not be cut down, 
 but it shall <I>receive blessing from God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:7">Heb. vi. 7</A>);

 it shall be <I>purged,</I> and <I>shall bring forth more fruit,</I> for 
 the Father is its husbandman 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:2">John xv. 2</A>);

 and it shall at last be transplanted from the vineyard on earth to the 
 paradise above.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But he adds, <I>If not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.</I> 
 Observe here, 

 [1.] That, though God bear long, he will not bear always with 
 unfruitful professors; his patience will have an end, and, if it be 
 abused, will give way to that wrath which will have no end. Barren 
 trees will certainly be <I>cut down</I> at last, and <I>cast into the 
 fire.</I>

 [2.] The longer God has <I>waited,</I> and the more cost he has been at 
 upon them, the greater will their destruction be: to be cut down 
 <I>after that,</I> after all these expectations from it, these debates 
 concerning it, this concern for it, will be sad indeed, and will 
 aggravate the condemnation.

 [3.] Cutting down, though it is work that shall be done, is work that 
 God does not take pleasure in: for observe here, the owner said to the 
 dresser, "Do thou <I>cut it down,</I> for it cumbereth the ground." 
 "Nay," said the dresser, "if it must be done at last, <I>thou shalt cut 
 it down;</I> let not my hand be upon it."

 [4.] Those that now intercede for barren trees, and take pains with 
 them, if they persist in their unfruitfulness will be even content to 
 see them cut down, and will not have one word more to say for them. 
 Their best friends will acquiesce in, nay, they will approve and 
 applaud, the righteous judgment of God, in the day of the manifestation 
 of it,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
 &nbsp; 11 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of
 infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no
 wise lift up <I>herself.</I>
 &nbsp; 12 And when Jesus saw her, he called <I>her to him,</I> and said
 unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.
 &nbsp; 13 And he laid <I>his</I> hands on her: and immediately she was made
 straight, and glorified God.
 &nbsp; 14 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,
 because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto
 the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in
 them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.
 &nbsp; 15 The Lord then answered him, and said, <I>Thou</I> hypocrite, doth
 not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or <I>his</I> ass from
 the stall, and lead <I>him</I> away to watering?
 &nbsp; 16 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom
 Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this
 bond on the sabbath day?
 &nbsp; 17 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were
 ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things
 that were done by him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The miraculous cure of a woman that had been long under a spirit of 
 infirmity. Our Lord Jesus spent his <I>Sabbaths</I> in the 
 <I>synagogues,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 We should make conscience of doing so, as we have opportunity, and not 
 think we can spend the sabbath as well at home reading a good book; for 
 religious assemblies are a divine institution, which we must bear our 
 testimony to, though but of two or three. And, when he was in the 
 synagogues on the sabbath day, <I>he was teaching there</I>--<B><I>en 
 didaskon</I></B>. It denotes a continued act; he <I>still taught the 
 people knowledge.</I> He was in his element when he was teaching. Now 
 to confirm the doctrine he preached, and recommend it as faithful, and 
 well worthy of all acceptation, he wrought a miracle, a miracle of 
 mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The object of charity that presented itself was a woman in the 
 synagogue that had <I>a spirit of infirmity eighteen years,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 She had an infirmity, which an evil spirit, by divine permission, had 
 brought upon her, which was such that she was <I>bowed together</I> by 
 strong convulsions, and could <I>in no wise lift up herself;</I> and, 
 having been so long thus, the disease was incurable; she could not 
 stand erect, which is reckoned man's honour above the beasts. Observe, 
 Though she was under this infirmity, by which she was much 
 <I>deformed,</I> and made to look mean, and not only so, but, as is 
 supposed, motion was very painful to her, yet she went to the 
 <I>synagogue on the sabbath day.</I> Note, Even bodily infirmities, 
 unless they be very grievous indeed, should not keep us from public 
 worship on the sabbath days; for God can help us, beyond our 
 expectation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The offer of this cure to one that sought it not bespeaks the 
 preventing mercy and grace of Christ: <I>When Jesus saw her, he called 
 her to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It does not appear that she made any application to him, or had any 
 expectation from him; but <I>before she called he answered.</I> She 
 came to him to be <I>taught,</I> and to get good to her soul, and then 
 Christ gave this relief to her bodily infirmity. Note, Those whose
 first and chief care is for their souls do best befriend the true 
 interests of their bodies likewise, for <I>other things shall be added 
 to them.</I> Christ in his gospel calls and invites those to come to 
 him for healing that labour under <I>spiritual infirmities,</I> and, if 
 he <I>calls us,</I> he will undoubtedly help us when we come to 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The cure effectually and immediately wrought bespeaks his almighty 
 power. He <I>laid his hands on her,</I> and said, "<I>Woman, thou art 
 loosed from thine infirmity;</I> though thou hast been long labouring 
 under it, thou art at length released from it." Let not those despair 
 whose disease is <I>inveterate,</I> who have been long in affliction.
 God can at length relieve them, therefore though he tarry wait for him.
 Though it was a <I>spirit of infirmity,</I> an evil spirit, that she 
 was under the power of, Christ has a power superior to that of Satan, 
 is <I>stronger than he.</I> Though <I>she could in no wise lift up 
 herself,</I> Christ could lift her up, and enable her to lift up 
 herself. She that had been <I>crooked</I> was <I>immediately made 
 straight,</I> and the scripture was fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:8">Ps. cxlvi. 8</A>):

 <I>The Lord raiseth them that are bowed down.</I> This cure represents 
 the work of Christ's grace upon the souls of the people. 

 (1.) In the <I>conversion</I> of sinners. Unsanctified hearts are under 
 this <I>spirit of infirmity;</I> they are distorted, the faculties of 
 the soul are quite out of place and order; they are <I>bowed down</I> 
 towards things below. <I>O curv&aelig; in terram anim&aelig;!</I> They 
 can in no wise <I>lift up themselves</I> to God and heaven; the bent of 
 the soul, in its natural state, is the quite contrary way. Such crooked 
 souls seek not to Christ; but he calls them to him, lays the hand of 
 his power and grace upon them, speaks a healing word to them, by which 
 he <I>looses them from their infirmity,</I> makes the soul 
 <I>straight,</I> reduces it to order, raises it above worldly regards, 
 and directs its affections and aims heavenward. Though <I>man cannot 
 make that straight which God has made crooked</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:13">Eccl. vii. 13</A>),

 yet the grace of God can make that straight which the sin of man has 
 made crooked. 

 (2.) In the <I>consolation</I> of good people. Many of the children of 
 God are long under a <I>spirit of infirmity,</I> a spirit of bondage; 
 through prevailing grief and fear, their <I>souls</I> are <I>cast 
 down</I> and <I>disquieted</I> within them, <I>they are troubled, they 
 are bowed down greatly, they go mourning all the day long,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:6">Ps. xxxviii. 6</A>.

 But Christ, by his Spirit of adoption, looses them from this infirmity
 in due time, and raises them up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The present effect of this cure upon the <I>soul</I> of the patient 
 as well as upon her <I>body.</I> She <I>glorified God,</I> gave him the 
 praise of her cure to whom all praise is due. When crooked souls are 
 made straight, they will show it by their glorifying God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The offence that was taken at this by the <I>ruler of the 
 synagogue,</I> as if our Lord Jesus had committed some heinous crime, 
 in healing this poor woman. He <I>had indignation</I> at it, because it 
 was <I>on the sabbath day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 One would think that the miracle should have convinced him, and that 
 the circumstance of its being done on the sabbath day could not have 
 served to counteract the conviction; but what light can shine so clear, 
 so strong, that a spirit of bigotry and enmity to Christ and his gospel 
 will not serve to shut men's eyes against it? Never was such honour 
 done to the synagogue he was ruler of as Christ had now done it, and 
 yet he had indignation at it. He had not indeed the impudence to 
 quarrel with Christ; but he said <I>to the people,</I> reflecting upon 
 Christ in what he said, <I>There are six days in which men ought to 
 work, in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath 
 day.</I> See here how light he made of the miracles Christ wrought, as 
 if they were <I>things of course,</I> and no more than what quacks and 
 mountebanks did every day: "You may <I>come</I> and be healed any day 
 of the week." Christ's cures were become, in his eyes, cheap and common 
 things. See also how he stretches the law beyond its intention, or any 
 just construction that could be put upon it, in making either healing 
 or being healed with a touch of the hand, or a word's speaking, to be 
 that <I>work</I> which is <I>forbidden</I> on the sabbath day. This was 
 evidently <I>the work of God;</I> and, when God tied us out from 
 working that day, did he tie himself out? The same word in Hebrew 
 signifies both <I>godly</I> and <I>merciful</I> (<I>chesed</I>), to 
 intimate that works of <I>mercy</I> and <I>charity</I> are in a manner 
 works of <I>piety</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:4">1 Tim. v. 4</A>)

 and therefore very proper on sabbath days.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's justification of himself in what he had done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 <I>The Lord then answered him,</I> as he had answered others who in 
 like manner cavilled at him, <I>Thou hypocrite.</I> Christ, who knows 
 men's hearts, may call those <I>hypocrites</I> whom it would be 
 presumption for us to call so. We <I>must</I> judge charitably, and 
 <I>can</I> judge only according to the outward appearance. Christ knew 
 that he had a real enmity to him and to his gospel, that he did but 
 cloak this with a pretended zeal for the sabbath day, and that when he 
 bade the people come on the <I>six days,</I> and be healed, he really 
 would not have them be healed any day. Christ could have told him this, 
 but he vouchsafes to reason the case with him; and,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He <I>appeals</I> to the common practice among the Jews, which was 
 never disallowed, that of <I>watering</I> their cattle on the sabbath 
 day. Those cattle that are kept up in the stable are constantly 
 <I>loosed from the stall on the sabbath day, and led away to 
 watering.</I> It would be a barbarous thing not to do it; for <I>a 
 merciful man regards the life of his beast,</I> his own beast that 
 serves him. Letting the cattle <I>rest</I> on the sabbath day, as the 
 law directed, would be worse than working them, if they must be made to 
 fast on that day, as the Ninevites' cattle on their fast-day, that were 
 not permitted to <I>feed nor drink water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:7">Jon. iii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He applies this to the present case 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "Must the <I>ox</I> and the <I>ass</I> have compassion shown them on 
 the sabbath day, and have so much time and pains bestowed upon them 
 <I>every</I> sabbath, to be loosed from the stall, led away perhaps a 
 great way to the water, and then back again, and shall not this woman, 
 only with a touch of the hand and a word's speaking, be <I>loosed</I> 
 from a much <I>greater</I> grievance than that which the cattle undergo 
 when they are kept a day without water? For consider,"

 (1.) "She is <I>a daughter of Abraham,</I> in a relation to whom you 
 all pride yourselves; she is <I>your sister,</I> and shall she be 
 denied a favour that you grant to an ox or an ass, dispensing a little 
 with the supposed strictness of the sabbath day? She is <I>a daughter 
 of Abraham,</I> and therefore is entitled to the Messiah's blessings, 
 to the <I>bread</I> which belongs to the <I>children.</I>" 

 (2.) "She is one whom Satan <I>has bound.</I> He had a hand in the 
 affliction, and therefore it was not only an act of charity to the poor 
 woman, but of piety to God, to break the power of the devil, and baffle 
 him." 

 (3.) "She has been in this deplorable condition, <I>lo, these eighteen 
 years,</I> and therefore, now that there is an opportunity of 
 delivering her, it ought not to be deferred <I>a day</I> longer, as you 
 would have it, for any of you would have thought eighteen years' 
 affliction full long enough."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The different effect that this had upon those that heard him. He 
 had sufficiently made it out, not only that it was lawful, but that it 
 was highly fit and proper, to heal this poor woman <I>on the sabbath 
 day,</I> and thus publicly in the synagogue, that they might all be 
 witnesses of the miracle. And now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What a confusion this was to the malice of his persecutors: <I>When 
 he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);
 
 they were put to silence, and were vexed that they were so, that they 
 had not a word to say for themselves. It was not a shame that worked
 repentance, but rather indignation. Note, Sooner or later, all the 
 adversaries of Christ, and his doctrine and miracles, will be made 
 <I>ashamed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What a confirmation this was to the faith of his friends: <I>All the 
 people,</I> who had a better sense of things, and judged more 
 impartially than their rulers, rejoiced <I>for all the glorious things 
 that were done by him.</I> The shame of his foes was the joy of his 
 followers; the increase of his interest was what the one fretted at, 
 and the other triumphed in. The things Christ did were <I>glorious 
 things;</I> they were all so, and, though now clouded, perhaps will 
 appear to, and we ought to rejoice in them. Every thing that is the 
 honour of Christ is the comfort of Christians.</P>

 the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The gospel's progress foretold in two parables, which we had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:31-33">Matt. xiii. 31-33</A>.

 The <I>kingdom of the Messiah</I> is the <I>kingdom of God,</I> for it
 advances his glory; this kingdom was yet a mystery, and people were 
 generally in the dark, and under mistakes, about it. Now, when we would 
 describe a thing to those that are strangers to it, we choose to do it 
 by similitudes. "Such a person you know not, but I will tell you whom 
 he is like;" so Christ undertakes here to show <I>what the kingdom of 
 God is like</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 It will be quite another thing from what you expect, and will operate, 
 and gain its point, in quite another manner." 

 1. "You expect it will appear <I>great,</I> and will arrive at its
 perfection all of a sudden; but you are mistaken, <I>it is like a grain 
 of mustard-seed,</I> a little thing, takes up but little room, makes 
 but a little figure, and promises but little; yet, when sown in soil 
 proper to receive it, it <I>waxes a great tree,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Many perhaps were prejudiced against the gospel, and loth to come in 
 <I>to the obedience</I> of it, because its beginning was so small; they 
 were ready to say of Christ, <I>Can this man save us?</I> And of his 
 gospel, <I>Is this likely ever to come to any thing?</I> Now Christ 
 would remove this prejudice, by assuring them that though <I>its 
 beginning was small its latter end should greatly increase;</I> so that 
 many should come, should come upon the wing, should <I>fly like a 
 cloud,</I> to lodge in the branches of it with more safety and 
 satisfaction than in the branches of Nebuchadnezzar's tree, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:21">Dan. iv. 21</A>.

 2. "You expect it will make its way by <I>external</I> means, by
 subduing nations and vanquishing armies, though it shall work <I>like
 leaven,</I> silently and insensibly, and without any force or violence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump; so the doctrine of Christ
 will strangely <I>diffuse</I> its relish into the world of mankind: in 
 this it triumphs, that <I>the savour of the knowledge of it</I> is 
 unaccountably made manifest <I>in every place,</I> beyond what one 
 could have expected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:14">2 Cor. ii. 14</A>.

 But you must <I>give it time,</I> wait for the issue of the preaching
 of the gospel to the world, and you will find it does wonders, and 
 alters the property of the souls of men. By degrees <I>the whole will 
 be leavened,</I> even as many as are, like <I>the meal</I> to the 
 <I>leaven,</I> prepared to receive the savour of it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's progress towards Jerusalem recorded: <I>He went through 
 the cities and villages, teaching and journeying,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Here we find Christ an itinerant, but an itinerant preacher, journeying 
 towards Jerusalem, to the feast of dedication, which was <I>in the 
 winter,</I> when travelling was uncomfortable, yet he would be about 
 his Father's business; and therefore, whatever cities or villages he 
 could make in his way, he gave them a sermon or two, not only in the 
 cities, but in the country villages. Wherever Providence brings us, we 
 should endeavour to be doing all the good we can.</P>

 And he said unto them,

 you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
 &nbsp; 25 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut

 from the north, and <I>from</I> the south, and shall sit down in the
 kingdom of God.
 &nbsp; 30 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there
 are first which shall be last.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A question put to our Lord Jesus. Who it was that put it we are not 
 told, whether a friend or a foe; for he both gave a great liberty of 
 questioning him and returned answers to the thoughts and intents of the 
 heart. The question was, <I>Are there few that are saved?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>:

 <B><I>ei oligoi hoi sozomenoi</I></B>--"<I>If the saved be few?</I> 
 Master, I have heard thou shouldest say so; is it true?" 

 1. Perhaps it was a <I>captious</I> question. He put it to him,
 tempting him, with a design to ensnare him and lessen his reputation. 
 If he should say that many would be saved, they would reproach him as 
 too loose, and making salvation cheap; if few, they would reproach him 
 as precise and strait-laced. The Jewish doctors said that <I>all Israel 
 should have a place in the world to come;</I> and would he dare to 
 contradict that? Those that have sucked in a corrupt nation are ready
 to make it the standard by which to measure all men's judgments; and in 
 nothing do men more betray their ignorance, presumption, and 
 partiality, than in judging of the salvation of others. 

 2. Perhaps it was a <I>curious</I> question, a nice speculation, which
 he had lately been disputing upon with his companions, and they all 
 agreed to refer it to Christ. Note, Many are more inquisitive 
 respecting who shall be saved, and who not, than respecting what they 
 shall do to be saved. It is commonly asked, "May such and such be 
 saved?" But it is well that we may be saved without knowing this. 

 3. Perhaps it was an <I>admiring</I> question. He had taken notice how
 strict the law of Christ was, and how bad the world was, and, comparing 
 these together, cries out, "How few are there that will be saved!" 
 Note, We have reason to wonder that of the many to whom the word of 
 salvation is sent there are so few to whom it is indeed a saving word.
 
 4. Perhaps it was an <I>enquiring</I> question: "<I>If there be few
 that be saved,</I> what then? What influence should this have upon me?" 
 Note, It concerns us all seriously to improve the great truth of the 
 fewness of those that are saved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's answer to this question, which directs us what use to make 
 of this truth. Our Saviour did not give a direct answer to this 
 enquiry, for he came to <I>guide</I> men's <I>consciences,</I> not to 
 <I>gratify</I> their <I>curiosity.</I> Ask not, "How many shall be 
 saved?" But, be they more or fewer, "Shall I be one of them?" Not, 
 "What shall become of such and such, and <I>what shall this man 
 do?</I>" But, "What shall I do, and what will become of me?" Now in 
 Christ's answer observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A quickening exhortation and direction: <I>Strive to enter in at the 
 strait gate.</I> This is directed not to him only that asked the 
 question, but to all, to us, it is in the plural number: <I>Strive 
 ye.</I> Note, 

 (1.) All that will be saved must <I>enter in at the strait gate,</I> 
 must undergo a change of the whole man, such as amounts to no less than 
 being born again, and must submit to a strict discipline. 

 (2.) Those that would enter in at the strait gate must <I>strive to 
 enter.</I> It is a hard matter to get to heaven, and a point that will 
 not be gained without a great deal of care and pains, of difficulty and 
 diligence. We must strive with God in prayer, wrestle as Jacob, strive 
 against sin and Satan. We must strive in every duty of religion; strive 
 with our own hearts, <B><I>agonizesthe</I></B>--"<I>Be in an agony;</I> 
 strive as those that run for a prize; excite and exert ourselves to the 
 \ utmost."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Divers awakening considerations, to enforce this exhortation. O that 
 we may be all awakened and quickened by them! They are such 
 considerations as will serve to answer the question, <I>Are there few 
 that shall be saved?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Think how many take <I>some pains</I> for salvation and yet perish 
 because they do not take <I>enough,</I> and you will say that there are 
 <I>few that will be saved</I> and that it highly concerns us to 
 <I>strive: Many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able;</I> they 
 <I>seek,</I> but they do not <I>strive.</I> Note, The reason why many 
 come short of grace and glory is because they rest in a <I>lazy 
 seeking</I> of that which will not be attained without a <I>laborious 
 striving.</I> They have a <I>good mind to happiness,</I> and a <I>good 
 opinion of holiness,</I> and take some <I>good steps</I> towards both. 
 But their convictions are weak; they do not consider what they know and 
 believe, and, consequently, their desires are cold, and their 
 endeavours feeble, and there is no strength or steadiness in their 
 resolutions; and thus they <I>come short,</I> and lose the prize, 
 because they do not press forward. Christ avers this upon his own word: 
 <I>I say unto you;</I> and we may take it upon his word, for he knows 
 both the counsels of God and the hearts of the children of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Think of the <I>distinguishing</I> day that is coming and the 
 <I>decisions</I> of that day, and you will say there are a <I>few that 
 shall be saved</I> and that we are concerned to strive: The <I>Master 
 of the house</I> will <I>rise up, and shut to the door,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 Christ is the <I>Master of the house,</I> that will take cognizance of 
 all that frequent his house and are retainers to it, will examine 
 comers and goers and those that pass and repass. Now he seems as if he 
 left things at large; but the day is coming when he will <I>rise up, 
 and shut to the door.</I> What door? 

 [1.] A door of <I>distinction.</I> Now, within the temple of the church 
 there are <I>carnal</I> professors who worship in the 
 <I>outer-court,</I> and <I>spiritual</I> professors who worship 
 <I>within the veil;</I> between these the door is now open, and they 
 meet <I>promiscuously</I> in the same external performances. But, when
 the <I>Master of the house is risen up,</I> the door will be shut 
 between them, that those who are in the <I>outer-court</I> may be kept 
 out, and left to be <I>trodden underfoot by the Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:2">Rev. xi. 2</A>.

 As to those <I>that are filthy,</I> shut the door upon them, and let 
 them be <I>filthy still;</I> that those who are within may be kept 
 within, that those who are <I>holy may be holy still.</I> The door is 
 shut to <I>separate</I> between the <I>precious</I> and the 
 <I>vile,</I> that <I>sinners</I> may no longer <I>stand in the 
 congregation of the righteous.</I> Then you shall return, and discern 
 betwixt them.

 [2.] A door of <I>denial</I> and exclusion. The door of <I>mercy</I> 
 and <I>grace</I> has long <I>stood open</I> to them, but they would 
 <I>not come in by it,</I> would not be beholden to the <I>favour</I> of 
 that door; they hoped to <I>climb up some other way,</I> and to get to 
 heaven by their own merits, and therefore when the Master of the house 
 is risen up he will justly <I>shut that door;</I> let them not expect 
 to enter by it, but let them take their own measures. Thus, when Noah 
 was safe in the ark, God <I>shut</I> the door, to <I>exclude</I> all 
 those that depended upon shelters of their own in the approaching 
 flood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Think how many who were very <I>confident</I> that they should be 
 <I>saved</I> will be rejected in the day of trial, and their 
 confidences will deceive them, and you will say that there are 
 <I>few</I> that <I>shall be saved</I> and that we are all concerned to 
 <I>strive.</I> Consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What an <I>assurance</I> they had of <I>admission,</I> and how far 
 their hope carried them, even to <I>heaven's gate.</I> There they 
 <I>stand and knock,</I> knock as if they had authority, knock as those 
 that belong to the house, <I>saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us,</I> for 
 we think we have a right to enter; take us in among the <I>saved 
 ones,</I> for we joined ourselves to them." Note, Many are ruined by an 
 ill-grounded hope of heaven, which they never distrusted or called in 
 question, and <I>therefore</I> conclude their state is good because 
 they never doubted it. They call Christ, <I>Lord,</I> as if they were 
 his servants; nay, in token of their importunity, they double it, 
 <I>Lord, Lord;</I> they are desirous now to enter in by that door which 
 they had formerly made light of, and would now gladly come in among 
 those serious Christians whom they had secretly despised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What <I>grounds</I> they had for this <I>confidence.</I> Let us 
 see what their plea is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 <I>First,</I> They had been <I>Christ's guests,</I> had had an intimate 
 converse with him, and had shared in his favours: <I>We have eaten and 
 drunk in thy presence,</I> at thy table. Judas ate bread with Christ, 
 dipped with him in the dish. Hypocrites, under the disguise of their
 external profession, receive the Lord's supper, and in it partake of 
 the children's bread, as if they were children. <I>Secondly,</I> They
 had been <I>Christ's hearers,</I> had received instruction from him, 
 and were well acquainted with his doctrine and law: "<I>Thou hast 
 taught in our streets</I>--a distinguishing favour, which few had, and 
 surely it might be taken as a pledge of distinguishing favour now; for 
 wouldest thou teach us, and not save us?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] How their confidence will fail them, and all their pleas be 
 rejected as frivolous. Christ will say to them, <I>I know you not 
 whence you are,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 And again
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 <I>I tell you, I know you not, depart from me.</I> He does not deny 
 that what they pleaded was true; they had <I>eaten and drunk in his 
 presence,</I> by the same token that they had no sooner eaten of his 
 bread than they lifted up the heel against him. He had <I>taught in 
 their streets,</I> by the same token that they had despised his 
 instruction and would not submit to it. And therefore, <I>First,</I> He 
 <I>disowns</I> them: "<I>I know you not;</I> you do not belong to my 
 family." <I>The Lord knows them that are his,</I> but them that are not 
 he does not know, he has nothing to do with them: "<I>I know you not 
 whence you are.</I> You are not of me, you are not from above, you are 
 not branches of my house, of my vine." <I>Secondly,</I> He 
 <I>discards</I> them: <I>Depart from me.</I> It is the hell of hell to 
 depart from Christ, the principal part of the misery of the damned. 
 "Depart from my door, here is nothing for you, no, not a drop of 
 water." <I>Thirdly,</I> He gives them such a character as is the reason 
 of this doom: <I>You are workers of iniquity.</I> This is their ruin, 
 that, under a pretence of piety, they kept up secret haunts of sin, and 
 did the devil's drudgery in Christ's livery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] How terrible their punishment will be 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,</I> the utmost degree 
 of grief and indignation; and that which is the cause of it, and 
 contributes to it, is a sight of the happiness of those that are saved: 
 <I>You shall see the patriarchs and prophets in the kingdom of God, and 
 yourselves thrust out.</I> Observe here, <I>First,</I> That the 
 <I>Old-Testament saints</I> are in the kingdom of God; those had 
 benefit by the Messiah who died before his coming, for they <I>saw his 
 day</I> at a distance and it reflected comfort upon them. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> That <I>New-Testament sinners</I> will be <I>thrust 
 out</I> of the kingdom of God. It intimates that they will be 
 <I>thrusting in,</I> and will presume upon admission, but in vain; they 
 shall be <I>thrust out</I> with shame, as having no part or lot in the 
 matter. <I>Thirdly,</I> That the sight of the saint's glory will be a 
 great aggravation of sinner's misery; they shall thus far <I>see the 
 kingdom of God</I> that they shall see the <I>prophets</I> in it, whom 
 they hated and despised, and themselves, though they thought themselves 
 sure of it, <I>thrust out.</I> This is that at which they will <I>gnash 
 their teeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:10">Ps. cxii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Think who are they that shall be saved, notwithstanding: <I>They 
 shall come from the east and the west; and the last shall be first,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>.

 [1.] By what Christ said, it appears that but <I>few shall be saved</I>
 of those whom we think most likely, and who bid fairest for it. Yet do 
 not say then that the gospel is preached in vain; for, though Israel be 
 not <I>gathered,</I> Christ will be <I>glorious.</I> There shall come 
 many from all parts of the Gentile world that shall be admitted into 
 the kingdom of grace in this world, and of glory in the other. Plainly 
 thus, when we come to heaven, we shall meet a great many there whom we 
 little thought to have met there, and miss a great many thence whom we 
 verily expected to have found there.

 [2.] Those who <I>sit down in the kingdom of God</I> are such as had 
 taken pains to get thither, for they came from far--<I>from the east 
 and from the west, from the north and from the south;</I> they had 
 passed through different climates, had broken through many difficulties 
 and discouragements. This shows that they who would enter into that 
 kingdom must <I>strive,</I> as the queen of Sheba, who came from the 
 <I>utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon.</I> They 
 who <I>travel</I> now in the service of God and religion shall shortly 
 <I>sit down</I> to rest in the <I>kingdom of God.</I>

 [3.] Many who stood fair for heaven came short, and others who seemed 
 cast behind, and thrown quite out of the way, will win and wear this 
 prize, and therefore it concerns us to <I>strive to enter.</I> Let us 
 be <I>provoked,</I> as Paul desires the Jews might be, to a holy 
 emulation, by the zest an forwardness of the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:14">Rom. xi. 14</A>.
 
 Shall I be outstripped by my juniors? Shall I, who started first, and
 stood nearest, miss of heaven, when others, less likely, enter into it?
 If it be got by striving, why should not I strive?</P>

 Christ's Message to Herod.</I></FONT></TD>
 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying
 unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill
 thee.
 &nbsp; 32 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I
 cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the
 third <I>day</I> I shall be perfected.
 &nbsp; 33 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the
 <I>day</I> following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and
 stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have
 gathered thy children together, as a hen <I>doth gather</I> her brood
 under <I>her</I> wings, and ye would not!
 &nbsp; 35 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I
 say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until <I>the time</I> come when ye
 shall say, Blessed <I>is</I> he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A suggestion to Christ of his danger from Herod, now that he was in 
 Galilee, within Herod's jurisdiction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>Certain of the Pharisees</I> (for there were those of that sect
 dispersed all the nation over) <I>came</I> to Christ, pretending 
 friendship and a concern for his safety, and said, <I>Get thee</I> out 
 of this country, and <I>depart hence,</I> for otherwise <I>Herod will 
 kill thee,</I> as he did John. Some think that these Pharisees had no 
 ground at all for this, that Herod had not given out any words to this 
 purport, but that they framed this lie, to drive him out of Galilee, 
 where he had a great and growing interest, and to drive him into Judea, 
 where they knew there were those that really sought his life. But, 
 Christ's answer being directed to Herod himself, it should seem that 
 the Pharisees had ground for what they said, and that Herod was enraged 
 against Christ, and designed him a mischief, for the honourable 
 testimony he had borne to John Baptist, and to the doctrine of 
 repentance which John preached. Herod was willing to get rid of Christ
 out of his dominions; and, when he durst not put him to death, he hoped 
 to <I>frighten him away</I> by sending him this threatening 
 message.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His defiance of Herod's rage and the Pharisees' too; he fears 
 neither the one nor the other: <I>Go you, and tell that fox so,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 In calling him a <I>fox,</I> he gives him his true character; for he 
 was subtle as a fox, noted for his craft, and treachery, and baseness, 
 and preying (as they say of a fox) furthest from his own den. And,
 though it is a black and ugly character, yet it did not ill become 
 Christ to give it to him, nor was it in him a violation of that law, 
 <I>Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</I> For Christ 
 was a prophet, and prophets always had a liberty of speech in reproving 
 princes and great men. Nay, Christ was more than a prophet, he was a 
 king, he was King of kings, and the greatest of men were accountable to 
 him, and therefore it became him to call this proud king by his own 
 name; but it is not to be drawn into an example by us. "Go, and tell 
 <I>that</I> fox, yea, and <I>this</I> fox too" (for so it is in the 
 original, <B> <I>te alopeki taute</I></B>); "<I>that Pharisee,</I> 
 whoever he is, that whispers this in my ear, let him know that <I>I do 
 not fear him,</I> nor regard his menaces. For," 

 1. "I know that I must die, and must die shortly; I expect it, and
 count upon it, <I>the third day,</I>" that is, "very shortly; my hour 
 is at hand." Note, It will help us very much above the fear of death, 
 and of them that have the power of death, to make death familiar to us, 
 to expect it, think of it, and converse with it, and see it at the 
 door. "If Herod should kill me, he will not surprise me." 

 2. "I know that death will be not only no prejudice to me, but that it
 will be my preferment; and therefore tell him I do not fear him; when I 
 die, <I>I shall be perfected.</I> I shall then have <I>finished</I> the 
 hardest part of my undertaking; I shall have completed my business;" 
 <B><I>teleioumai</I></B>--<I>I shall be consecrated.</I> When Christ 
 dies, he is said to have <I>sanctified himself;</I> he consecrated 
 himself to his priestly office with his own blood. 

 3. "I know that neither he nor any one else can kill me <I>till I have
 done my work.</I> Go, and tell him that I value not his impotent rage. 
 <I>I will cast out devils, and do cures, to-day and to-morrow,</I>" 
 that is, "now and for some little space of time yet to come, in spite 
 of him and all his threats. I <I>must walk,</I> I must <I>go on</I> in 
 my intended journey, and it is not in his power to hinder me. I must 
 <I>go about,</I> as I do, preaching and healing, <I>to-day, and 
 to-morrow, and the day following.</I>" Note, It is good for us to look 
 upon the time we have before us as but a little, two or three days 
 perhaps may be the utmost, that we may thereby be quickened to <I>do 
 the work of the day in its day.</I> And it is a comfort to us, in 
 reference to the power and malice of our enemies, that they can have no 
 power to take us off as long as God has any work for us to do. The 
 witnesses were not <I>slain</I> till they had <I>finished their 
 testimony.</I> 

 4. "I know that Herod can do me no harm, not only because <I>my
 time</I> is not yet come, but because the place appointed for my death 
 is Jerusalem, which is not within his jurisdiction: <I>It cannot be 
 that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem,</I>" that is, "any where but at 
 Jerusalem." If a <I>true prophet</I> was put to death, he was 
 prosecuted as a <I>false prophet.</I> Now none undertook to try 
 prophets, and to judge concerning them, but the great sanhedrim, which 
 always sat at Jerusalem; it was a cause which the inferior courts did 
 not take cognizance of, and therefore, if a <I>prophet</I> be <I>put to 
 death,</I> it must be at Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His lamentation for Jerusalem, and his denunciation of wrath 
 against that city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>.
 
 This we had 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37-39">Matt. xxiii. 37-39</A>.

 Perhaps this was not said now in Galilee, but the evangelist, not 
 designing to bring it in in its proper place, inserts it here, upon 
 occasion of Christ's mentioning his being put to death at 
 Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The wickedness of persons and places that more eminently than others 
 profess religion and relation to God is in a particular manner 
 provoking and grieving to the Lord Jesus. How pathetically does he 
 speak of the sin and ruin of that holy city! <I>O Jerusalem!
 Jerusalem!</I> 

 2. Those that enjoy great plenty of the means of grace, if they are not
 profited by them, are often prejudiced against them. They that would
 not hearken to the prophets, nor welcome those whom God had sent to 
 them, <I>killed</I> them, and <I>stoned</I> them. If men's corruptions 
 are not conquered, they are provoked. 

 3. Jesus Christ has shown himself willing, freely willing, to receive
 and entertain poor souls that come to him, and put themselves under his 
 protection: <I>How often would I have gathered thy children 
 together,</I> as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings, with such 
 care and tenderness! 

 4. The reason why sinners are not protected and provided for by the
 Lord Jesus, as the chickens are by the hen, is because they will not: 
 <I>I would,</I> I often would, and <I>ye would not.</I> Christ's 
 willingness aggravates sinners' unwillingness, and leaves their blood 
 upon their own heads. 

 5. The house that Christ leaves is <I>left desolate.</I> The temple,
 though richly adorned, though greatly frequented, is yet desolate if 
 Christ has deserted it. He leaves it <I>to them;</I> they had made an
 idol of it, and let them take it to themselves, and make their best of 
 it, Christ will trouble it no more.

 6. Christ justly withdraws from those that drive him from them. They
 would not be <I>gathered</I> by him, and therefore, saith he, "<I>You 
 shall not see me,</I> you shall not hear me, any more," as Moses said 
 to Pharaoh, when he forbade him his presence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:28,29">Exod. x. 28, 29</A>.

 7. The judgment of the great day will effectually convince unbelievers
 that would not now be convinced: "Then you will say, <I>Blessed is he 
 that cometh,</I>" that is, "you will be glad to be among those that say 
 so, and <I>will not see me</I> to be the Messiah till then when it is 
 too late."</P>
