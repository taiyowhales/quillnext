 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the substance of that prophetical sermon which our Lord 
 Jesus preached, pointing at the destruction of Jerusalem, and the 
 consummation of all things; it was one of the last of his sermons, and 
 not <I>ad populum</I>--to the people, but <I>ad clerum</I>--to the
 clergy; it was private, preached only to four of his disciples, with 
 whom his secret was. Here is, 

 I. The occasion of his prediction--his disciples' admiring the building
 of the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 and their enquiry concerning the time of the desolation of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 II. The predictions themselves,

 1. Of the rise of deceivers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:5,6,21-23">ver. 5, 6, 21-23</A>.

 2. Of the wars of the nations, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 3. Of the persecution of Christians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.

 4. Of the destruction of Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:14-20">ver. 14-20</A>.

 5. Of the end of the world, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:24-27">ver. 24-27</A>.

 III. Some general intimations concerning the time of them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:28-32">ver. 28-32</A>.
 
 IV. Some practical inferences from all,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:33-37">ver. 33-37</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith
 unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings
 <I>are here!</I>
 &nbsp; 2  And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great
 buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that
 shall not be thrown down.
 &nbsp; 3  And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the
 temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
 &nbsp; 4  Tell us, when shall these things be? and what <I>shall be</I> the
 sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may here see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How apt many of Christ's own disciples are to idolize things that 
 look <I>great,</I> and have been long looked upon as <I>sacred.</I> 
 They had heard Christ complain of those who had made the temple a 
 <I>den of thieves;</I> and yet, when he quitted it, for the wickedness 
 that remained in it, they court him to be as much in love as they were 
 with the stately structure and adorning of it. One of them said to him, 
 "Look, Master, <I>what manner of stones, and what buildings are 
 here,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 We never saw the like in Galilee; O do not leave this fine place."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How little Christ values external pomp, where there is not real 
 purity; "<I>Seest thou these great buildings</I>" (saith Christ), "and 
 admirest thou them? I tell thee, the time is at hand when <I>there 
 shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown 
 down,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 And the sumptuousness of the fabric shall be no security to it, no nor
 move any compassion in the Lord Jesus towards it. He looks with 
 <I>pity</I> upon the ruin of precious souls, and weeps over them, for 
 on them he has put great value; but we do not find him look with any 
 pity upon the ruin of a magnificent house, when he is driven out of it 
 by sin, for that is of small value with him. With what little concern 
 doth he say, <I>Not one stone shall be left on another!</I> Much of the 
 strength of the temple lay in the largeness of the stones, and if these 
 be thrown down, no footstep, no remembrance, of it will remain. While 
 any part remained standing, there might be some hopes of the repair of 
 it; but what hope is there, when not one stone is <I>left upon 
 another?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How natural it is to us to desire to know things to come, and the 
 times of them; more inquisitive we are apt to be about that than about 
 our duty. His disciples knew not how to <I>digest</I> this doctrine of 
 the ruin of the temple, which they thought must be their Master's royal 
 palace, and in which they expected their preferment, and to have the 
 posts of honour; and therefore they were in pain till they got him 
 alone, and got more out of him concerning this matter. As he was 
 returning to Bethany therefore, he <I>sat upon the mount of Olives, 
 over against the temple,</I> where he had a full view of it; and there 
 four of them agreed to <I>ask him privately,</I> what he meant by the 
 destroying of the temple, which they understood no more than they did 
 the predictions of his own death, so inconsistent was it with their 
 scheme. Probably, though these four proposed the question, yet Christ's 
 discourse, in answer to it, was in the hearing of the rest of the 
 disciples, yet <I>privately,</I> that is, apart from the multitude. 
 Their enquiry is, <I>When shall these things be?</I> They will not 
 question, at least not seem to question, whether they shall be or no 
 (for their Master has said that they shall), but are willing to hope it 
 is a great way off. Yet they ask not precisely the day and year 
 (therein they were modest), but say, "Tell us <I>what shall be the 
 sign, when all these things shall be fulfilled?</I> What presages shall 
 there be of them, and how may we prognosticate their approach?"</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any
 <I>man</I> deceive you:
 &nbsp; 6  For many shall come in my name, saying, I am <I>Christ;</I> and
 shall deceive many.
 &nbsp; 7  And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
 troubled: for <I>such things</I> must needs be; but the end <I>shall</I>
 not <I>be</I> yet.
 &nbsp; 8  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
 kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and
 there shall be famines and troubles: these <I>are</I> the beginnings
 of sorrows.
 &nbsp; 9  But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to
 councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall
 be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony
 against them.
 &nbsp; 10  And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
 &nbsp; 11  But when they shall lead <I>you,</I> and deliver you up, take no
 thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye
 premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that
 speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.
 &nbsp; 12  Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the
 father the son; and children shall rise up against <I>their</I>
 parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.
 &nbsp; 13  And ye shall be hated of all <I>men</I> for my name's sake: but
 he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus, in reply to their question, sets himself, not so much 
 to satisfy their curiosity as to direct their consciences; leaves them 
 still in the dark concerning the <I>times</I> and <I>seasons,</I> which 
 the father has <I>kept in his own power,</I> and which <I>it was not 
 for them to know;</I> but gives them the cautions which were needful, 
 with reference to the events that should now shortly come to pass.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They must take heed that they be not <I>deceived</I> by the 
 <I>seducers</I> and <I>imposters</I> that should now shortly arise 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>);

 "<I>Take heed lest any man deceive you,</I> lest, having found the 
 <I>true Messiah,</I> you lose him again in the crowd of 
 <I>pretenders,</I> or be inveigled to embrace others in rivalship with 
 him. Many shall come <I>in my name</I> (not in the name of 
 <I>Jesus</I>), but saying, <I>I am the Christ,</I> and so claiming the 
 dignities which I only an entitled to." After the Jews had rejected the 
 true Christ, they were imposed upon, and so <I>ex</I>posed by many 
 false Christs, but never before; those false Christs <I>deceived 
 many;</I> Therefore <I>take heed lest they deceive you.</I> Note, When 
 many are deceived, we should thereby be awakened to look to 
 ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They must take heed that they be not <I>disturbed</I> at the noise 
 of wars, which they should be alarmed with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Sin introduced <I>wars,</I> and they come <I>from men's lusts.</I> But
 at some times the nations are more distracted and wasted with wars than 
 at other times; so it shall be now; Christ was born into the world when 
 there was a general peace, but soon after he went out of the world 
 there were general wars; <I>Nation shall rise against nation, and 
 kingdom against kingdom.</I> And what will become of them then who are 
 to preach the gospel to every nation? <I>Inter arma silent 
 leges--Amidst the clash of arms, the voice of law is not heard.</I> 
 "But <I>be not troubled at it.</I>" 

 1. "Let it be no <I>surprise</I> to you; you are bid to expect it, and
 <I>such things must needs be,</I> for God has appointed them, in order 
 to further accomplishment of his purposes, and by the <I>wars of the 
 Jews</I>" (which Josephus has given us a large account of) "God will 
 punish the <I>wickedness of the Jews.</I>" 

 2. "Let it be no <I>terror</I> to you, as if your interest were in
 danger of being overthrown, or your work obstructed by these wars; you 
 have no concern in them, and therefore need not be apprehensive of any 
 damage by them." Note, Those that despise the smiles of the world, and 
 do not court and covet them, may despise the frowns of the world, and 
 need not fear them. If we seek not to rise with them that <I>rise in 
 the world,</I> why should we dread falling with them that fall in the 
 world?

 3. "Let it not be looked upon as an omen of the approaching period of
 the world, for the <I>end is not yet,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Think not that these <I>wars</I> will bring the world to a period; no,
 there are other intermediate counsels to be fulfilled betwixt that end
 and the end of all things, which are designed to prepare you for the
 end, but not to hasten it out of due time." 

 4. "Let it not be looked upon as if in them God has done his worst; no,
 he has more arrows in his quiver, and they are <I>ordained against the 
 persecutors;</I> be not troubled at the wars you shall hear of, for 
 they are but <I>the beginnings of sorrows,</I> and therefore, instead 
 of being disturbed at <I>them,</I> you ought to <I>prepare for 
 worse;</I> for there shall also be <I>earthquakes in divers places,</I> 
 which shall bury multitudes in the ruins of their own houses, and there 
 <I>shall be famines,</I> by which many of the poor shall perish for 
 want of bread, and <I>troubles</I> and commotions; so that there shall 
 be no peace to him that <I>goes out</I> or <I>comes in.</I> The world 
 shall be full of <I>troubles,</I> but <I>be not ye troubled;</I> 
 without are <I>fightings,</I> within are <I>fears,</I> but <I>fear not 
 ye their fear.</I>" Note, The disciples of Christ, if it be not their 
 own fault, may enjoy a holy security and serenity of mind, when all 
 about them is in the greatest disorder.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They must take heed that they be not <I>drawn away</I> from 
 Christ, and from their duty to him, by the sufferings they should meet 
 with for Christ's sake. Again, he saith, "<I>Take heed to 
 yourselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Though you may escape the <I>sword of war,</I> better than some of your
 neighbours, because you interest not yourselves in the public quarrels, 
 yet be not secure; you will be exposed to the <I>sword of justice</I> 
 more than others, and the parties that contend with one another, will 
 unite against you. <I>Take heed</I> therefore lest you <I>deceive</I> 
 yourselves with the hopes of outward prosperity, and such a temporal 
 kingdom as you have been dreaming of, when it is <I>through many 
 tribulations</I> that <I>you must enter into the kingdom of God.</I> 
 Take heed lest you needlessly expose yourselves to trouble, and pull it 
 upon your own head. <I>Take heed</I> what you say and do, for you will 
 have many eyes upon you." Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the trouble is which they must expect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They shall be <I>hated of all men;</I> trouble enough! The 
 thoughts of <I>being hated</I> are grievous to a tender spirit, and the 
 fruits of that hatred must needs be a constant vexation; those that are 
 <I>malicious,</I> will be <I>mischievous.</I> It was not for any thing 
 amiss in them, or done amiss by them, that they were <I>hated,</I> but 
 for Christ's name sake, because they were called by his name, called 
 upon his name, preached his name, and wrought miracles in his name. The 
 world hated them because he loved them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their own <I>relations</I> shall <I>betray them,</I> those to whom 
 they were most nearly allied, and on whom therefore they depended for 
 protection; "They <I>shall betray you,</I> shall inform against you, 
 and be your prosecutors." If a father has a child that is a Christian, 
 he shall become void of natural affection, it shall be swallowed up in 
 bigotry, and he shall betray his own child to the persecutors, as if he 
 were a worshipper of other gods, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:6-10">Deut. xiii. 6-10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Their <I>church-rulers</I> shall inflict <I>their censures</I> 
 upon them; "You shall be <I>delivered up</I> to the great Sanhedrim at 
 Jerusalem, and to the inferior courts and consistories in other cities, 
 and shall be <I>beaten in the synagogues</I> with forty stripes at a 
 time, as offenders against the law which was read in the synagogue." It 
 is no new thing for the church's artillery, through the treachery of 
 its officers, to be turned against some of its best friends.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) <I>Governors</I> and <I>kings</I> shall use their power against 
 them. Because the Jews have not power to put them to death, they shall 
 incense the Roman powers against them, as they did Herod against James 
 and Peter; and they shall <I>cause you to be put to death,</I> as 
 enemies to the empire. They must resist unto blood, and still 
 resist.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What they shall have to comfort themselves with, in the midst of 
 these great and sore troubles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That the work they were called to should be carried on and 
 prosper, notwithstanding all this opposition which they should meet 
 with in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 "<I>The gospel</I> shall, for all this, be <I>published among all 
 nations,</I> and before the destruction of Jerusalem the <I>sound</I> 
 of it shall <I>go forth into all the earth;</I> not only through all 
 the nation of the Jews, but to all the nations of the earth." It is 
 comfort to those who suffer for the gospel, that, though they may be 
 crushed and borne down, the gospel cannot; it shall keep its ground, 
 and carry the day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That their sufferings, instead of obstructing their work, should 
 forward it; "Your being <I>brought before governors and kings</I> shall 
 be for <I>a testimony of them</I> (so some read it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 it shall give you an opportunity of preaching the gospel to those 
 before whom you are brought as criminals, to whom otherwise you could 
 not have access." Thus St. Paul's being brought before Felix, and 
 Festus, and Agrippa, and Nero, was a testimony to them concerning 
 Christ and his gospel. Or, as we read it, It shall be for a testimony 
 <I>against them,</I> against both the judges and the prosecutors, who 
 pursue those with the utmost rage that appear, upon examination, to be 
 not only innocent but excellent persons. The gospel is a testimony to 
 us concerning Christ and heaven. If we receive it, it will be a 
 testimony for us: it will justify and save us; if not, it will be a 
 testimony <I>against</I> us in the great day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That, when they were brought before kings and governors for 
 Christ's sake, they should have special assistance from heaven, to 
 plead Christ's cause and their own 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 "<I>Take no thought before-hand what he shall speak,</I> be not 
 solicitous how to address yourselves to great men, so as to obtain 
 their favour; your cause is just and glorious, and needs not be 
 supported by premeditated speeches and harangues; but <I>whatsoever 
 shall be given you in that hour,</I> whatsoever shall be suggested to 
 you, and put into your minds, and into your mouths" (<I>pro re 
 nat&acirc;--on the spur of the occasion</I>), "that <I>speak ye,</I> 
 and fear not the success of it, because it is <I>off-hand,</I> for 
 <I>it is not ye that speak,</I> purely by the strength of your own 
 wisdom, consideration, and resolution, but it is <I>the Holy 
 Ghost.</I>" Note, Those whom Christ calls out to be advocates for him, 
 shall be furnished with full instructions: and when we are engaged in 
 the service of Christ, we may depend upon the aids of the Spirit of 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That heaven at last would <I>make amends for all;</I> "You will 
 meet with a great deal of hardship in your way, but have a good heart 
 on it, your warfare will be accomplished, and your testimony finished, 
 and <I>he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Perseverance gains the crown. The salvation here promised is more than
 a deliverance from evil, it is an everlasting blessedness, which shall 
 be an abundant recompence for all their services and sufferings. All 
 this we have,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken
 of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him
 that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Jud&aelig;a flee to
 the mountains:
 &nbsp; 15  And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the
 house, neither enter <I>therein,</I> to take any thing out of his
 house:
 &nbsp; 16  And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to
 take up his garment.
 &nbsp; 17  But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give
 suck in those days!
 &nbsp; 18  And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.
 &nbsp; 19  For <I>in</I> those days shall be affliction, such as was not
 from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this
 time, neither shall be.
 &nbsp; 20  And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh
 should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen,
 he hath shortened the days.
 &nbsp; 21  And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here <I>is</I> Christ;
 or, lo, <I>he is</I> there; believe <I>him</I> not:
 &nbsp; 22  For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall
 show signs and wonders, to seduce, if <I>it were</I> possible, even
 the elect.
 &nbsp; 23  But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Jews, in rebelling against the Romans, and in persecuting the 
 Christians, were hastening to their own ruin apace, both efficiently 
 and meritoriously, were setting both God and man against them; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15">1 Thess. ii. 15</A>.

 Now here we have a prediction of that ruin which came upon them within
 less than forty years after this: we had it before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:15">Matt. xxiv. 15</A>,

 &c. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What is here foretold concerning it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the Roman <I>armies</I> should make a descent upon Judea, and 
 invest Jerusalem, the holy city. These were the <I>abomination</I> of 
 <I>desolation,</I> which the Jews did <I>abominate,</I> and by which 
 they should be made <I>desolate.</I> The country of thine enemy is 
 called <I>the land which thou abhorrest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:16">Isa. vii. 16</A>.
 
 <I>Therefore</I> it was an abomination, because it brought with it
 nothing but desolation. They had rejected Christ as an 
 <I>abomination,</I> who would have been their <I>salvation;</I> and now 
 God brought upon them an abomination that would be their 
 <I>desolation,</I> thus spoken of by Daniel <I>the prophet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:27"><I>ch.</I> ix. 27</A>),

 as that by which this sacrifice and offering should be made to cease.
 This army stood <I>where it ought not,</I> in and about the <I>holy 
 city,</I> which the heathen ought not to have approached, nor would 
 have been suffered to approach, if Jerusalem had not first profaned the 
 crown of their holiness. This the church complains of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:10">Lam. i. 10</A>,

 The <I>heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that
 they should not enter into the congregation;</I> but sin made the 
 breach, at which the glory went out, and the abomination of desolation 
 broke in, <I>and stood where it ought not.</I> Now, let <I>him that 
 readeth</I> this, <I>understand it,</I> and endeavor to take it right.
 Prophecies should not be too plain, and yet intelligible to those that 
 search them; and they are best understood by comparing them first with 
 one another, and at last with the event.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That when the Roman <I>army</I> should come into the country, there 
 would be no safety any where but by quitting the country, and that with 
 all possible expedition. It will be in vain to <I>fight,</I> the 
 enemies will be too hard for them; in vain to <I>abscond,</I> the 
 enemies will find them out; and in vain to <I>capitulate,</I> the 
 enemies will give them no quarter; a man cannot have so much as his 
 life given him for a prey, but by <I>fleeing to the mountains</I> out 
 of Judea; and let him take the first alarm, and make the best of his 
 way. If he be <I>on the house-top,</I> trying from thence to discover 
 the motions of the enemy, and spies them coming, let him not <I>go 
 down, to take any thing out of the house,</I> for it will occasion his 
 losing of time, which is more precious than his best goods, and will 
 but encumber him, and embarrass his flight. If he be in the field, and 
 there discover the approach of the enemy, let him get away as he is, 
 and not <I>turn back again, to take up his garment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 If he can save his life, let him reckon it is a good bargain, though he
 can save nothing else, and be thankful to God, that, though he is cut 
 short, he is not cut off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That it would go very hard at that time with poor mothers and nurses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 "<I>Woe to them that are with child,</I> that dare not go into strange 
 places, that cannot shift for themselves, nor make haste as others can. 
 And <I>woe to them that give suck,</I> that know not how either to 
 leave the tender infants behind them, or to carry them along with 
 them." Such is the vanity of the creature, that the time may often be, 
 when the greatest comforts may prove the greatest burthens. It would 
 likewise be very uncomfortable, if they should be forced to flee <I>in 
 the winter</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 when the <I>weather</I> and <I>ways</I> were bad, when the roads would 
 be scarcely passable, especially in the mountains to which they must 
 flee. If there be no remedy but that trouble must come, yet we may 
 desire and pray that, if it be God's will, the circumstances of it may 
 be so ordered as to be a mitigation of the trouble; and when things are 
 bad, we ought to consider they might have been worse. It is bad to be 
 forced to flee, but it would have been worse if it had been <I>in the 
 winter.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That throughout all the country of the Jews, there should be such 
 destruction and desolation made, as could not be paralleled in any 
 history 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 <I>In those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the 
 beginning</I> of time; that is, <I>of the creation which God 
 created,</I> for time and the creation are of equal date, <I>unto this 
 day, neither shall be</I> to the end of time; such a complication of 
 miseries, and of such continuance. The destruction of Jerusalem by the 
 Chaldeans was very terrible, but this exceeded it. It threatened a 
 universal slaughter of all the people of the Jews; so barbarously did 
 they devour one another, and the Romans devour them all, that, if their 
 wars had continued a little longer, <I>no flesh could have been 
 saved,</I> not one Jew could have been left alive; but in the midst of 
 wrath God remembered mercy; and, 

 (1.) He <I>shortened the days;</I> he let fall his controversy before 
 he had <I>made a full end.</I> As a church and nation the ruin was 
 complete, but many particular persons had their lives given them for a 
 prey, by the storm's subsiding when it did. 

 2. It was <I>for the elects' sake</I> that those days were shortened;
 <I>many</I> among them fared the better for the sake of the <I>few</I> 
 among them that believed in Christ, and were faithful to him. There was 
 a promise, that <I>a remnant</I> should be saved

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:22">Isa. x. 22</A>),

 and that God would not, for his servants' sakes, <I>destroy them 
 all</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8">Isa. lxvi. 8</A>);

 and these promises must be fulfilled. God's own <I>elect cry day and
 night to him,</I> and their prayers must be answered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:7">Luke xviii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What directions are given to the disciples with reference to 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must shift for the safety of <I>their lives;</I> "When you see 
 the country invaded, and the city invested, flatter not yourselves with 
 thoughts that the enemy will retire, or that you may be able to make 
 your part good with them; but, without further deliberation or delay, 
 <I>let them that are in Judea, flee to the mountains,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Meddle not with the strife that <I>belongs not to you; let the
 potsherds strive with the potsherds of the earth,</I> but do you go out 
 of the ship when you see it sinking, that you die not the <I>death of 
 the uncircumcised</I> in heart."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must provide for the safety of <I>their souls;</I> 
 "<I>Seducers</I> will be busy at that time, for they love to fish in 
 troubled waters, and therefore then you must double your guard; 
 <I>then, if any man shall</I> say unto you, <I>Lo, here is Christ,</I> 
 or, <I>Lo, he is there,</I> you know he is in heaven, and will come 
 again at the end of time, to judge the world, and therefore <I>believe 
 them not;</I> having received <I>Christ,</I> be not drawn into the 
 snares of any <I>antichrist;</I> for <I>false Christs,</I> and <I>false 
 prophets, shall arise,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 When the gospel kingdom was in the setting up, Satan mustered all his
 force, to oppose it, and made use of all his wiles; and God permitted
 it, for the trial of sincerity of some, and the discovery of the
 hypocrisy of others, and the confusion of those who rejected Christ,
 when he was offered to them. <I>False Christs</I> shall <I>rise,</I>
 and false prophets that shall preach them up; or such, as, though they
 pretend not to be Christs, set up for <I>prophets,</I> and undertake to
 foretel things to come, and they shall <I>show signs</I> and lying
 <I>wonders;</I> so early did the <I>mystery of iniquity</I> begin to
 <I>work,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:7">2 Thess. ii. 7</A>.

 They <I>shall seduce, if it were possible, the very elect;</I> so
 plausible shall their pretences be, and so industrious shall they be to 
 impose upon people, that they shall drawn away many that were forward 
 and zealous professors of religion, many that were very likely to have 
 persevered; for nothing will be effectual to secure men but that 
 foundation of God which stands immovably sure, <I>The Lord knoweth them 
 that are his,</I> who shall be preserved when the faith of some is 
 overthrown,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:18,19">2 Tim. ii. 18, 19</A>.

 They <I>shall seduce, if it were possible, the very elect;</I> but it
 is not possible to seduce them; the <I>election shall obtain,</I>
 whoever are <I>blinded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:7">Rom. xi. 7</A>.

 But, in consideration hereof, let the disciples be cautious whom they 
 give credit to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 But <I>take ye heed.</I> Christ knew that they were of the
 <I>elect,</I> who could not possibly be <I>seduced,</I> and yet he said 
 to them, <I>Take heed.</I> An assurance of persevering, and cautions 
 against apostasy, will very well consist with each other. Though Christ 
 said to them, <I>Take heed,</I> it doth not therefore follow, that 
 their perseverance was doubtful, for they were kept by the power of 
 God; and though their perseverance was secured, yet it doth not 
 therefore follow, that this caution was needless, because they must be 
 kept in the use of proper means. God will keep them, but they must keep 
 themselves. "<I>I have foretold you all things;</I> have foretold you 
 of this danger, that, being <I>fore-warned,</I> you may be 
 <I>fore-armed;</I> I have foretold <I>all things</I> which you needed 
 to have foretold to you, and therefore take heed of hearkening to such 
 as pretend to be prophets, and to foretel more than I have foretold." 
 The sufficiency of the scripture is good argument against listening to 
 such as pretend to inspiration.</P>

 &nbsp; 26  And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses seem to point at Christ's second coming, to judge the 
 world; the disciples, in their question, had confounded the 
 <I>destruction</I> of Jerusalem and the <I>end of the world</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:3">Matt. xxiv. 3</A>),

 which was built upon a mistake, as if the temple must needs stand as 
 long as the world stands; this mistake Christ rectifies, and shows that 
 the <I>end of the world in those days,</I> those other days you enquire 
 about, the day of Christ's coming, and the day of judgment, shall be 
 <I>after that tribulation,</I> and not coincident with it. Let those 
 who live to see the Jewish nation destroyed, take heed of thinking 
 that, because the Son of man doth not visibly come in the clouds 
 <I>then,</I> he will never <I>so</I> come; no, he will come <I>after 
 that.</I> And here he foretels,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The final dissolution of the present frame and fabric of the world; 
 even of that part of it which seems least liable to change, the upper 
 part, the pure and more refined part; <I>The sun shall be darkened,</I> 
 and the <I>moon</I> shall no more <I>give her light;</I> for they shall 
 be quite outshone by the glory of the Son of man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:23">Isa. xxiv. 23</A>.

 The <I>stars of heaven,</I> that from the beginning had kept their
 place and regular motion, shall fall as leaves in autumn; and the 
 <I>powers that are in heaven,</I> the heavenly bodies, the fixed stars, 
 <I>shall be shaken.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The visible appearance of the Lord Jesus, to whom the judgment of 
 that day shall be committed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);

 <I>Then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds.</I> 
 Probably he will come over that very place where he sat when he said 
 this; for the clouds are in the lower region of the air. He shall come 
 with <I>great power and glory,</I> such as will be suited to the errand 
 on which he comes. <I>Every eye shall then see him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The gathering together of all the elect to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 He shall <I>send his angels,</I> and <I>gather together his elect</I> 
 to him, to <I>meet him in the air,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:17">1 Thess. iv. 17</A>.

 They shall be fetched from one end of the world to the other, so that
 none shall be missing from that <I>general</I> assembly; they shall be 
 fetched <I>from the uttermost part of the earth,</I> most remote from 
 the places where Christ's tribunal shall be set, and shall be brought 
 to the <I>uttermost part of heaven;</I> so sure, so swift, so easy, 
 shall their conveyance be, that there shall none of them miscarry, 
 though they were to be brought from the uttermost part of the earth one 
 way, to the uttermost part of the heaven another way. A faithful 
 Israelite shall be carried safely, though it were from the utmost 
 border of the land of bondage to the utmost border of the land of 
 promise.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
 tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:
 &nbsp; 29  So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to
 pass, know that it is nigh, <I>even</I> at the doors.
 &nbsp; 30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass,

 &nbsp; 31  Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not

 &nbsp; 34  <I>For the Son of man is</I> as a man taking a far journey, who

 man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the application of this prophetical sermon; <I>now 
 learn</I> to look forward in a right manner.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. "As to the <I>destruction</I> of Jerusalem, <I>expect</I> it to come 
 very <I>shortly;</I> as when the <I>branch of the fig-tree becomes 
 soft,</I> and the <I>leaves sprout forth,</I> ye expect that summer 
 will come shortly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 When second causes begin to work, ye expect their effects in their
 proper order and time. So when <I>ye see these things come to pass,</I> 
 when ye see the Jewish nation embroiled in wars, distracted by false 
 Christs and prophets, and drawing upon them the displeasure of the 
 Romans, especially when ye see them persecuting you for your Master's 
 sake, and thereby standing to what they did when they put him to death, 
 and repeating it, and so filling up the measure of their iniquity, then 
 say that their <I>ruin is nigh, even at the door,</I> and provide for 
 yourselves accordingly." The disciples themselves were indeed all of 
 them, except John, taken away from the evil to come, but the next 
 generation whom they were to train up, would live to see it; and by 
 these instructions which Christ left behind him would be kept from 
 sharing in it; "<I>This generation</I> that is now rising up, shall not 
 all be worn off before <I>all these things</I> come to pass, which I 
 have told you of, relating to Jerusalem, and they shall begin to take 
 effect now shortly. And as this destruction is near and within ken, so 
 it is sure. The decree is gone forth, it is a <I>consummation 
 determined,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27">Dan. ix. 27</A>.

 Christ doth not speak these things, merely to frighten them; no, they
 are declarations of God's fixed purpose; "<I>Heaven and earth shall 
 pass away,</I> at the end of time; but <I>my words shall not pass 
 away</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 not one of these predictions shall fail of a punctual 
 accomplishment."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. "As to the <I>end of the world,</I> do not enquire when it will 
 come, for it is not a question fit to be asked, for of <I>that day,</I> 
 and <I>that hour, knoweth no man;</I> it is a thing at a great 
 distance; the exact time is fixed in the counsel of God, but is not 
 revealed by any word of God, either to <I>men</I> on earth, or to 
 <I>angels in heaven;</I> the angels shall have timely notice to prepare 
 to attend in that day, and it shall be published, when it comes to the 
 children of men, with sound of trumpet; but, at present, <I>men</I> and 
 <I>angels</I> are kept in the dark concerning the precise time of it, 
 that they may both attend to their proper services in the present day." 
 But it follows, <I>neither the Son;</I> but is there any thing which 
 the Son is ignorant of? We read indeed of a book which was sealed, till 
 the Lamb opened the seals; but did not he know what was in it, before 
 the seals were opened? Was not he privy to the writing of it? There 
 were those in the primitive times, who taught from this text, that 
 there were some things that Christ, as man, was <I>ignorant</I> of; and 
 from these were called <I>Agnoet&aelig;;</I> they said, "It was no more
 absurd to say so, than to say that his human soul suffered grief and 
 fear;" and many of the orthodox fathers approved of this. Some would 
 evade it, by saying that Christ spoke this in a way of prudential 
 economy, to divert the disciples from further enquiry: but to this one 
 of the ancients answers, <I>It is not fit to speak too nicely in this 
 matter</I>--<B><I>ou dei pany akribologein</I></B>, so Leontius in Dr.
 Hammond, "It is certain (says Archbishop Tillotson) that Christ, as 
 God, could not be ignorant of any thing; but the divine wisdom which 
 dwelt in our Saviour, did communicate itself to his human soul, 
 according to the divine pleasure, so that his human nature might 
 sometimes not know some things; therefore Christ is said to grow in 
 wisdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:52">Luke ii. 52</A>),

 which he could not be said to do, if the human nature of Christ did 
 necessarily know all things by virtue of its union with the divinity." 
 Dr. Lightfoot explains it thus; Christ calls himself the Son, as 
 Messiah. Now the Messiah, as such, was the father's servant 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa. xlii. 1</A>),

 sent and deputed by him, and as such a one he refers himself often to 
 his Father's will and command, and owns he <I>did nothing of 
 himself</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:19">John v. 19</A>);

 in like manner he might be said to <I>know nothing of himself.</I> The 
 revelation of Jesus Christ was what <I>God gave unto him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:1">Rev. i. 1</A>.

 He thinks, therefore, that we are to distinguish between those
 excellencies and perfections of his, which resulted from the personal 
 union between the divine and human nature, and those which flowed from 
 the anointing of the Spirit; from the former flowed the infinite 
 dignity of his perfect freedom from all sin; but from the latter flowed 
 his power of working miracles, and his foreknowledge of things to come.
 What therefore (saith he) was to be revealed by him to his church, he 
 was pleased to take, not from the union of the human nature with the 
 divine, but from the revelation of the Spirit, by which he yet knew not 
 this, but <I>the Father</I> only knows it; that is, God only, the 
 Deity; for (as Archbishop Tillotson explains it) it is not used here 
 <I>personally,</I> in distinction from the Son and the Holy Ghost, but 
 as the Father is, <I>Fons et Principium Deitatis</I>--<I>The Fountain 
 of Deity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. "As to both, your duty is to <I>watch and pray.</I> Therefore the 
 time is kept a secret, that you may be engaged to stand always upon 
 your guard 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 <I>Take ye heed</I> of every thing that would indispose you for your 
 Master's coming, and would render your accounts <I>perplexed,</I> and 
 your spirits so too; <I>watch</I> for his coming, that it may not at 
 any time be a surprise to you, and <I>pray</I> for that grace which is 
 necessary to qualify you for it, for <I>ye know not when the time 
 is;</I> and you are concerned to be ready for that <I>every day,</I> 
 which may come <I>any day.</I>" This he illustrates, in the close, by a 
 parable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Our Master is gone away, and left us something in trust, in charge, 
 which we must give account of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 He is <I>as a man taking a far journey;</I> for he is gone to be away a
 great while, he has <I>left his house</I> on earth, and left his 
 servants in their offices, given <I>authority</I> to some, who are to 
 be overseers, and <I>work</I> to others, who are to be labourers. They 
 that have <I>authority</I> given them, in that had <I>work</I> assigned 
 them, for those that have the greatest <I>power</I> have the most 
 <I>business;</I> and to them to whom he gave <I>work,</I> he gave some 
 sort of <I>authority,</I> to do that work. And when he took his last 
 leave, he <I>appointed the porter to watch,</I> to be sure to be ready 
 to open to him at his return; and in the mean time to take care to whom 
 he opened his gates, not to thieves and robbers, but only to his 
 Master's friends and servants. Thus our Lord Jesus, when he
 <I>ascended on high,</I> left something for all his servants to do, 
 expecting they should all do him service in his absence, and be ready 
 to receive him at his return. <I>All</I> are appointed to work, and 
 some authorized to rule.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We ought to be always upon our watch, in expectation of his return, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:35-37"><I>v.</I> 35-37</A>.

 (1.) Our Lord <I>will come,</I> and will come as the <I>Master of the 
 house,</I> to take account of his servants, of their work, and of the 
 improvement they have made.

 (2.) We know not <I>when he will come;</I> and he has very wisely kept 
 us at uncertainty, that we might all be always ready. We know not 
 <I>when he will come,</I> just at what precise time; the <I>Master of 
 the house</I> perhaps will come <I>at even,</I> at nine at night; or it 
 may be <I>at midnight,</I> or a <I>cock-crowing,</I> at three in the 
 morning, or perhaps not until six. This is applicable to his coming to
 us in particular, at our death, as well as to the general judgment. Our 
 present life is a <I>night,</I> a dark night, compared with the other 
 life; we know not in which watch of the night our Master will come, 
 whether in the days of youth, or middle age, or old age; but, as soon 
 as we are born, we begin to die, and therefore, as soon as we are 
 capable of expecting any thing, we must expect death. 

 (3.) Our great care must be, that, whenever our Lord comes, he do not 
 <I>find us sleeping,</I> secure in ourselves, off our guard, indulging 
 ourselves in ease and sloth, mindless of our work and duty, and 
 thoughtless of our Lord's coming; <I>ready</I> to say, He will not 
 come, and <I>unready</I> to meet him.

 (4.) His coming will indeed be <I>coming suddenly;</I> it will be a 
 great <I>surprise</I> and <I>terror</I> to those that are careless, and 
 asleep, it will come upon them as a thief in the night. 

 (5.) It is therefore the indispensable duty of all Christ's disciples, 
 to <I>watch,</I> to be awake, and keep awake; "<I>What I say unto 
 you</I> four

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 I <I>say unto all</I> the twelve, or rather to <I>you</I> twelve, I say
 unto all my disciples and followers; what I say to you of this 
 generation, I say to all that shall believe in men, through your word, 
 in every age, <I>Watch, watch,</I> expect my second coming, prepare for 
 it, that you may be found in peace, without spot, and blameless."</P>
