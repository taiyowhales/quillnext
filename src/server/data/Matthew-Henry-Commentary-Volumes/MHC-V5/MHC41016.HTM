 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter, we have a short account of the resurrection and 
 ascension of the Lord Jesus: and the joys and triumphs which it
 furnished all believers with, will be very acceptable to those who
 sympathised and suffered with Christ in the foregoing chapters. Here 
 is, 

 I. Christ's resurrection notified by an angel to the women that came to
 the sepulchre to anoint him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. His appearance to Mary Magdalene, and the account she gave of it to
 the disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>.

 III. His appearance to the two disciples, going to Emmaus, and the
 report they made of it to their brethren, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>.

 IV. His appearance to the eleven with the commission he gave them to 
 set up his kingdom in the world, and full instructions and credentials 
 in order thereunto,, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:14-18">ver. 14-18</A>.

 V. His ascension into heaven, the apostles' close application to their
 work, and God's owning of them in it,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
 <I>mother</I> of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they
 might come and anoint him.
 &nbsp; 2  And very early in the morning the first <I>day</I> of the week,
 they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
 &nbsp; 3  And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the
 stone from the door of the sepulchre?
 &nbsp; 4  And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled
 away: for it was very great.
 &nbsp; 5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting
 on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were
 affrighted.
 &nbsp; 6  And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of
 Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here:
 behold the place where they laid him.
 &nbsp; 7  But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth
 before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto
 you.
 &nbsp; 8  And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for
 they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any
 <I>man;</I> for they were afraid.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Never was there such a <I>sabbath</I> since the sabbath was first 
 instituted as this was, which the first words of this chapter tell us 
 was <I>now past;</I> during all this sabbath our Lord Jesus lay in the 
 grave. It was <I>to him</I> a sabbath of <I>rest,</I> but a 
 <I>silent</I> sabbath, it was to his disciples a melancholy sabbath, 
 spent in tears and fears. Never were the sabbath services in the temple 
 such an <I>abomination to God,</I> though they had been often so, as 
 they were now, when the chief priests, who presided in them, had their 
 hands full of blood, the blood of Christ. Well, this sabbath is over, 
 and the first day of the week is the first day of a new world. We have 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The affectionate visit which the good women that had attended 
 Christ, now made it to his sepulchre--not a <I>superstitious</I> one,
 but a <I>pious</I> one. They set out from their lodgings <I>very early 
 in the morning,</I> at break of day, or sooner; but either they had a 
 long walk, or they met with some hindrance, so that it was 
 <I>sun-rising</I> by the time they got to the sepulchre. The had 
 <I>bought sweet spices</I> too, and came not only to <I>bedew</I> the 
 dead body with their tears (for nothing could more renew their grief
 than this), but to <I>perfume</I> it with their <I>spices,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 Nicodemus had bought a very large quantity of <I>dry spices, myrrh</I> 
 and <I>aloes,</I> which served to dry the wounds, and dry up the blood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:39">John xix. 39</A>.

 But these good women did not think that enough; they bought spices,
 perhaps of another kind, some perfumed oils, to <I>anoint him.</I> 
 Note, The respect which others have showed to Christ's name, should not 
 hinder us from showing our respect to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The care they were in about the rolling away of the stone, and the 
 superseding of that care 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>);

 <I>They said among themselves,</I> as they were coming along, and now 
 drew near the sepulchre, <I>Who shall roll us away the stone from the 
 door of the sepulchre? For it was very great,</I> more than they with 
 their united strength could move. They should have thought of this
 before they came out, and then discretion would have bid them not go, 
 unless they had those to go with them, who could do it. And there was 
 another difficulty much greater than this, to be got over, which they 
 knew nothing of, to wit, a guard of soldiers set to <I>keep</I> the 
 sepulchre; who, had they come before they were frightened away, would 
 have frightened them away. But their gracious love to Christ carried
 them to the sepulchre; and see how by the time they came thither, both 
 these difficulties were removed, both the <I>stone</I> which they 
 <I>knew of,</I> and the <I>guard</I> which they <I>knew not of.</I> 
 They <I>saw that the stone was rolled away,</I> which was the first 
 thing that amazed them. Note, They who are carried by a holy zeal, to 
 seek Christ diligently, will find the difficulties that lie in their 
 way strangely to vanish, and themselves helped over them beyond their 
 expectation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The assurance that was given them by an angel, that the Lord Jesus 
 was risen from the dead, and had taken leave of his sepulchre, and had 
 left him there to tell those so who came thither to enquire after 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They <I>entered into the sepulchre,</I> at least, a little way in, 
 and saw that the body of Jesus was not there where they had left it the 
 other night. He, who by his death undertook to pay our debt, in his 
 resurrection took out our acquittance, for it was a fair and legal 
 discharge, by which it appealed that his satisfaction was accepted for 
 all the purposes for which it was intended, and the matter in dispute 
 was determined by an incontestable evidence that he was the Son of 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They saw a <I>young man sitting on the right side</I> of the 
 sepulchre. The angel appeared in the likeness of <I>a man,</I> of a 
 <I>young man;</I> for angels, though created in the beginning, grow not 
 <I>old,</I> but are always the same perfection of beauty and strength; 
 and so shall glorified saints be, when they are <I>as the angels.</I> 
 This angel was <I>sitting</I> on <I>the right hand</I> as they went 
 into the sepulchre, <I>clothed with a long white garment,</I> a garment 
 down to the feet, such as great men were arrayed with. The sight of him 
 might justly have encouraged them, but they were <I>affrighted.</I> 
 Thus many times that which should be matter of comfort to us, through 
 our own mistakes and misapprehensions proves a terror to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He silences their fears by assuring them that here was cause enough 
 for triumph, but none for trembling 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 <I>He saith to them, Be not affrighted.</I> Note, As angels rejoice in 
 the conversation of sinners, so they do also in the consolation of 
 sinners. Be not affrighted, for, 

 (1.) "Ye are faithful lovers of Jesus Christ, and therefore, instead of 
 being <I>confounded,</I> out to be <I>comforted. Ye seek Jesus of 
 Nazareth, which was crucified.</I>" Note, The enquiries of believing 
 souls after Christ, have a particular regard to him as <I>crucified</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:2">1 Cor. ii. 2</A>),

 that they may know him, and the fellowship of his sufferings. His being 
 <I>lifted up from the earth,</I> is that which <I>draws all men unto 
 him.</I> Christ's cross is the ensign to which the Gentiles seek. 
 Observe, He speaks of Jesus as one that <I>was crucified;</I> "The 
 thing is <I>past,</I> that scene is over, ye must not dwell so much 
 upon the sad circumstances of his crucifixion as to be unapt to believe 
 the joyful news of his resurrection. He was <I>crucified in 
 weakness,</I> yet that doth not hinder but that he may be raised in 
 power, and therefore ye that seek him, be not <I>afraid of missing</I> 
 of him." He <I>was</I> crucified, but he <I>is</I> glorified; and the 
 shame of his sufferings is so far from lessening the glory of his 
 exaltation, that that glory perfectly wipes away all the reproach of 
 his sufferings. And therefore after his entrance upon his glory, he 
 never drew any veil over his sufferings, nor was shy of having his 
 cross spoken of. The angel here that proclaims his resurrection, calls 
 him Jesus that <I>was crucified.</I> He himself owns 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:18">Rev. i. 18</A>),

 <I>I am he that liveth, and was dead;</I> and he appears in the midst 
 of the praises of the heavenly host as a <I>Lamb that had been 
 slain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:6">Rev. v. 6</A>.

 (2.) "It will therefore be good news to you, to hear that, instead of
 anointing him dead, you may rejoice in him living. <I>He is risen, he 
 is not here,</I> not dead, but alive again. We cannot as yet show you
 <I>him,</I> but hereafter you will see him, and you may here see <I>the 
 place where they laid him.</I> You see he is gone hence, not stolen 
 either by his enemies or by his friends, but <I>risen.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He orders them to give speedy notice of this to his disciples. Thus 
 they were made the apostles of the apostles, which was a recompence of 
 their affection and fidelity to him, in attending him on the cross, to 
 the grave, and in the grave. They first came, and were first served; no 
 other of the disciples durst come near his sepulchre, or enquire after 
 him; so little danger was there of their coming by night to <I>steal 
 him away,</I> that none came near him but a few women, who were not 
 able so much as to <I>roll away the stone.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They must tell the <I>disciples,</I> that <I>he is risen.</I> It 
 is a dismal time with them, their dear Master is dead, and all their 
 hopes and joys are buried in his grave; they look upon their cause as 
 sunk, and themselves ready to fall an easy prey into the hands of their 
 enemies, so that there remains no more spirit in them, they are 
 perfectly at their wits' end, and every one is contriving how to shift 
 for himself. "O, go quickly to them," said the angel, "tell them that 
 <I>their Master is risen;</I> this will put some life and spirit into 
 them, and keep them from sinking into despair." Note, 

 [1.] Christ is not ashamed to own his poor disciples, no, not now that
 he is in his exalted state; his preferment doth not make him shy of
 them, for he took early care to have it <I>notified</I> to them.

 [2.] Christ is not extreme to mark what <I>they</I> do amiss, whose
 hearts are upright with him. The disciples had very unkindly deserted
 him, and yet he testified this concern for them. 

 [3.] Seasonable comforts shall be sent to those that are lamenting 
 after the Lord Jesus, and he will find a time to manifest himself to 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They must be sure to tell Peter. This is particularly taken notice 
 of by this evangelist, who is supposed to have written by Peter's 
 direction. If it were told the disciples, it would be told Peter, for, 
 as a token of his repentance for disowning his Master, he still 
 associated with his disciples; yet he is particularly named: <I>Tell 
 Peter,</I> for, 

 [1.] It will be good news to him, more welcome to him than to any of
 them; for he is in sorrow for sin, and no tidings can be more welcome
 to true penitents than to hear of the resurrection of Christ, because
 he rose again for <I>their justification.</I> 

 [2.] He will be afraid, lest the joy of this good news do not belong to
 him. Had the angel said only, <I>Go, tell his disciples,</I> poor
 Peter would have been ready to sigh, and say, "But I doubt I cannot 
 look upon myself as one of them, for I disowned him, and deserve to be 
 disowned by him;" to obviate that, "Go to Peter by name, and tell him, 
 he shall be as welcome as any of the rest to <I>see</I> him in 
 Galilee." Note, A sight of Christ will be very welcome to a true 
 penitent, and a true penitent shall be very welcome to a sight of 
 Christ, for there is joy in heaven concerning him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They must appoint them all, and Peter by name, to give him the 
 meeting in Galilee, as <I>he said unto you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:32">Matt. xxvi. 32</A>.

 In their journey down into Galilee they would have time to recollect
 themselves, and call to mind what he had often said to them there, that 
 he should suffer and die, and <I>the third day be raised again;</I> 
 whereas while they were at Jerusalem, among strangers and enemies, they 
 could not recover themselves from the fright they had been in, nor 
 compose themselves to the due entertainment of better tidings. Note,

 [1.] All the meetings between Christ and his disciples are of his own
 appointing. 

 [2.] Christ never forgets his appointment, but will be sure to meet his
 people with the promised blessing in every place where he records his
 name. 

 [3.] In all meetings between Christ and his disciples, he is the most
 forward. <I>He goes before you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The account which the women did bring of this to the disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 They <I>went out quickly,</I> and <I>ran from the sepulchre,</I> to 
 make all the haste they could to the disciples, <I>trembling</I> and 
 <I>amazed.</I> See how much we are enemies to ourselves and our own 
 comfort, in not considering and mixing faith with that Christ hath said 
 to us. Christ had often told them, that <I>the third day he would rise 
 again;</I> had they given that its due notice and credit, they would 
 have come to the sepulchre, expecting to have found him risen, and 
 would have received the news of it with a joyful assurance, and not 
 with all this terror and amazement. But, being ordered to tell the 
 disciples, because they were to tell it to all the world, they would 
 not tell it to any one else, they showed not any thing of it to any man 
 that they <I>met by the way,</I> for <I>they were afraid,</I> afraid it 
 was too good news to be true. Note, Our disquieting fears often hinder 
 us from doing that service to Christ and to the souls of men, which if 
 faith and the <I>joy of faith</I> were strong, we might do.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Now when <I>Jesus</I> was risen early the first <I>day</I> of the week,
 he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast
 seven devils.
 &nbsp; 10  <I>And</I> she went and told them that had been with him, as they
 mourned and wept.
 &nbsp; 11  And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had
 been seen of her, believed not.
 &nbsp; 12  After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as
 they walked, and went into the country.
 &nbsp; 13  And they went and told <I>it</I> unto the residue: neither
 believed they them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a very short account of two of Christ's appearances, and 
 the little credit which the report of them gained with the 
 disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He appeared to Mary Magdalene, to her first in the garden, which we 
 have a particular narrative of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:14">John xx. 14</A>.

 It was she <I>out of whom he had cast seven devils;</I> much was
 forgiven her, and much was given her, and done for her, and she 
 <I>loved much;</I> and this honour Christ did her, that she was the 
 first that saw him after his resurrection. The closer we cleave to 
 Christ, the sooner we may expect to see him, and the more to see of 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 1. She brings notice of what she had seen, to the disciples; not only
 to the <I>eleven,</I> but to the rest that followed him, <I>as they 
 mourned and wept,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Now was the time of which Christ had told them, that they should 
 <I>mourn and lament,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:20">John xvi. 20</A>.

 And it was an evidence of their great love to Christ, and the deep 
 sense they had of their loss of him. But when their <I>weeping</I> had
 <I>endured a night</I> or two, comfort returned, as Christ has 
 promised; <I>I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice.</I> 
 Better news cannot be brought to disciples in tears, than to tell them 
 of Christ's resurrection. And we should study to be comforters to 
 disciples that are mourners, by communicating to them our experiences, 
 and what we have <I>seen of Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They could not give credit to the report she brought them. They 
 heard that <I>he was alive,</I> and had been seen of her. The story was 
 plausible enough, and yet <I>they believed not.</I> They would not say 
 that she made the story herself, or designed to deceive them; but they 
 fear that she is <I>imposed upon,</I> and that it was but a fancy that 
 she <I>saw him.</I> Had they believed the <I>frequent</I> predictions 
 of it from his own mouth, they would not have been now so incredulous 
 of the report of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He appeared to two of the disciples, <I>as they went into the 
 country,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This refers, no doubt, to that which is largely related

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:13">Luke xxiv. 13</A>,

 &c.), of which passed between Christ and the two disciples <I>going to
 Emmaus.</I> He is here said to have appeared to them in <I>another 
 form,</I> in another dress than what he usually wore, in the form of a 
 <I>traveller,</I> as, in the garden, in such a dress, that Mary 
 Magdalene took him for the gardener; but that he had really his own 
 countenance, appears by this, that <I>their eyes were holden, that they 
 should not know him;</I> and when that restrain on <I>their</I> eyes 
 was taken off, immediately they <I>knew him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:16-31">Luke xxiv. 16-31</A>.
 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. These <I>two</I> witnesses gave in their <I>testimony</I> to this 
 proof of Christ's resurrection; <I>They went and told it to the 
 residue,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Being <I>satisfied</I> themselves, they were desirous to give their 
 brethren the <I>satisfaction</I> they had, that they might be comforted 
 as they were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This did not gain credit with all; <I>Neither believed they 
 them.</I> They suspected that their eyes also deceived them. Now there 
 was a wise providence in it, the proofs of Christ's resurrection were 
 given in thus <I>gradually,</I> and admitted thus <I>cautiously,</I> 
 that so the assurance with which the apostles preached this doctrine 
 afterward, when they ventured their all upon it, might be the more 
 satisfying. We have the more reason to believe those who did themselves 
 believe so slowly: had they swallowed it presently, they might have 
 been thought <I>credulous,</I> and their testimony the less to be 
 <I>regarded;</I> but their <I>disbelieving</I> at first, shows that 
 they did not believe it afterward but upon a full conviction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat,
 and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart,
 because they believed not them which had seen him after he was
 risen.
 &nbsp; 15  And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach
 the gospel to every creature.
 &nbsp; 16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he
 that believeth not shall be damned.
 &nbsp; 17  And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name
 shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
 &nbsp; 18  They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly
 thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick,
 and they shall recover.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The <I>conviction</I> which Christ gave his apostles of the truth of 
 his resurrection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 He <I>appeared to them</I> himself, when they were all together, <I>as 
 they sat at meat,</I> which gave him an opportunity to <I>eat and drink 
 with them,</I> for their full satisfaction; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:41">Acts x. 41</A>.

 And still, when he appeared to them, he <I>upbraided them with their
 unbelief and hardness of heart,</I> for even at the general meeting in
 <I>Galilee, some doubted,</I> as we find 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:17">Matt. xxviii. 17</A>.

 Note, The evidences of the truth of the gospel are so full, that those
 who receive it not, may justly be <I>upbraided</I> with their unbelief; 
 and it is owing not to any weakness or deficiency in the proofs, but to 
 the <I>hardness of their heart,</I> its senselessness and stupidity. 
 Though they had not till now seen him themselves, they are justly 
 blamed <I>because they believed not them who had seen him after he was 
 risen;</I> and perhaps it was owing in part to the <I>pride of their 
 hearts,</I> that they did not; for they thought, "If indeed he be 
 risen, to <I>whom should he delight to do</I> the <I>honour</I> of 
 showing himself but to us?" And if he <I>pass them by,</I> and show 
 himself to <I>others</I> first, they cannot believe it is he. Thus many 
 disbelieve the doctrine of Christ, because they think it <I>below 
 them</I> to give credit to such as he had chosen to be the witnesses 
 and publishers of it. Observe, It will not suffice for an excuse of our 
 infidelity in the great day, to say, "<I>We did not see him</I> after 
 he was risen," for we ought to have believed the testimony of those who 
 did see him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The <I>commission</I> which he gave them to set up his kingdom 
 among men by the preaching of his <I>gospel,</I> the glad tidings of 
 reconciliation to God through a Mediator. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>To whom</I> they were to preach <I>the gospel.</I> Hitherto they 
 had been sent only to <I>the lost sheep of the house of Israel,</I> and 
 were forbidden to go into the <I>way of the Gentiles,</I> or into any 
 city of the Samaritans; but now their commission is enlarged, and they 
 are authorized to <I>go into all the world,</I> into all parts of the 
 world, the habitable world, and to <I>preach the gospel</I> of Christ 
 to <I>every creature,</I> to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews; to 
 every human creature that is capable of receiving it. "Inform them 
 concerning Christ, the history of <I>his life,</I> and <I>death,</I> 
 and <I>resurrection;</I> instruct them in the <I>meaning</I> and 
 <I>intention</I> of these, and of the advantages which the children of 
 men have, or may have, hereby; and invite them, without exception, to 
 come and share in them. This is <I>gospel.</I> Let this be 
 <I>preached</I> in all places, to all persons." These eleven men could 
 not themselves preach it to all the world, much less to <I>every 
 creature</I> in it; but they and the other disciples, seventy in 
 number, with those who should afterward to be added to them, must 
 <I>disperse</I> themselves several ways, and, wherever they went, carry 
 the gospel along with them. They must send <I>others</I> to those 
 places whither they could not <I>go themselves,</I> and, in short, make 
 it the business of their lives to send those glad tidings <I>up and 
 down the world</I> with all possible fidelity and care, not as an 
 amusement or entertainment, but as a solemn message from God to men, 
 and an appointed means of making men happy. "Tell as many as you can, 
 and bid them tell others; it is a message of universal concern, and 
 <I>therefore,</I> ought to <I>have</I> a universal welcome, because it 
 <I>gives</I> a universal welcome."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What is the <I>summary of the gospel</I> they are to preach 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);
 
 "Set before the world life and death, good and evil. Tell the children 
 of men that they are all in a state of misery and danger, 
 <I>condemned</I> by their prince, and <I>conquered</I> and 
 <I>enslaved</I> by their enemies." This is supposed in their being 
 <I>saved,</I> which they would not need to be if they were not 
 <I>lost.</I> "Now go and tell them," 

 (1.) "That if they <I>believe the gospel,</I> and give up themselves to 
 be Christ's disciples; if they <I>renounce</I> the devil, the world, 
 and the flesh, and be <I>devoted</I> to Christ as their prophet, 
 priest, and king, and to God in Christ a their God in covenant, and 
 evidence by their constant adherence to this covenant their sincerity 
 herein, they <I>shall be saved</I> from the guilt and power of sin, it 
 shall not <I>rule</I> them, it shall not <I>ruin</I> them. He that is a 
 true Christian, shall be saved through Christ." <I>Baptism</I> was 
 appointed to be the <I>inaugurating</I> rite, by which those that 
 embraced Christ owned him; but it is here put rather for the <I>thing 
 signified</I> than for the sign, for Simon Magus <I>believed</I> and 
 was <I>baptized,</I> yet was not <I>saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:13">Acts viii. 13</A>.

 <I>Believing with the heart, and confessing with the mouth the Lord
 Jesus</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:9">Rom. x. 9</A>),

 seems to be much the same with this here. Or thus, We must 
 <I>as</I>sent to gospel-truths, and <I>con</I>sent to gospel-terms.
 
 (2.) "<I>If they believe not,</I> if they receive not the record God 
 gives concerning his Son, they cannot expect any other way of 
 salvation, but must inevitably perish; <I>they shall be damned,</I> by 
 the sentence of a <I>despised</I> gospel, added to that of a broken 
 law." And even this is <I>gospel,</I> it is good news, that nothing 
 else but unbelief shall damn men, which is a sin against the remedy.
 Dr. Whitby here observes, that they who hence infer "that the infant 
 seed of believers are not capable of baptism, because they cannot 
 believe, must hence also infer that they cannot be saved; <I>faith</I> 
 being here more expressly required to salvation than to baptism. And 
 that in the latter clause baptism is omitted, because it is not simply 
 the want of baptism, but the contemptuous neglect of it, which makes 
 men guilty of damnation, otherwise infants might be damned for the 
 mistakes or profaneness of their parents."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What power they should be endowed with, for the confirmation of the 
 doctrine they were to preach 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 <I>These signs shall follow them that believe.</I> Not that all who 
 believe, shall be able to produce these signs, but some, even as many 
 as were employed in propagating the faith, and bringing others to it; 
 for signs are intended <I>for them that believe not;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:22">1 Cor. xiv. 22</A>.

 It added much to the glory and evidence of the gospel, that the
 preachers not only wrought miracles themselves, but conferred upon 
 others a power to work miracles, which power <I>followed</I> some of 
 them that believed, wherever they went to preach. They shall do wonders 
 <I>in Christ's name,</I> the same name into which they were baptized, 
 in the virtue of power derived from him, and fetched in by prayer. Some 
 particular signs are mentioned;

 (1.) They shall <I>cast out devils;</I> this power was more common 
 among Christians than any other, and lasted longer, as appears by the 
 testimonies of Justin Martyr, Origen, Iren&aelig;us, Tertullian 
 Minutius Felix, and others, cited by Grotius on this place. 

 (2.) They shall <I>speak with new tongues,</I> which they had never 
 learned, or been acquainted with; and this was both a <I>miracle</I> (a 
 miracle <I>upon the mind</I>), for the confirming of the truth of the 
 gospel, and a <I>means</I> of spreading the gospel among those nations 
 that had not heard it. It saved the preachers a vast labour in learning 
 the languages; and, no doubt, they who by <I>miracle</I> were made 
 <I>masters of languages,</I> were <I>complete</I> masters of them and 
 of all their native elegancies, which were proper both to 
 <I>instruct</I> and <I>affect,</I> which would very much recommend them 
 and their preaching. 

 (3.) They shall <I>take up serpents.</I> This was fulfilled in Paul, 
 who was not hurt by the <I>viper</I> that <I>fastened on his hand,</I> 
 which was acknowledged a great miracle by the barbarous people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:5,6">Acts xxviii. 5, 6</A>.

 They shall be kept unhurt by that <I>generation of vipers</I> among 
 whom they live, and by the malice of the <I>old serpent.</I>

 (4.) If they be compelled by their persecutors to <I>drink any
 deadly</I> poisonous thing, <I>it shall not hurt them:</I> of which 
 very thing some instances are found in ecclesiastical history. 

 (5.) They shall not only be preserved from hurt themselves, but they 
 shall be enabled to do good to others; <I>They shall lay hands on the 
 sick, and they shall recover,</I> as multitudes had done by their 
 master's <I>healing</I> touch. Many of the elders of the church had 
 this power, as appears by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:14">Jam. v. 14</A>,

 where, as an instituted sign of this miraculous healing, they are said
 to <I>anoint</I> the sick <I>with oil in the name of the Lord.</I> With 
 what assurance of success might they go about executing their 
 commission, when they had such credentials as these to produce!</P>

 Here is, 

 1. Christ <I>welcomed</I> into the <I>upper world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>After the Lord had spoken</I> what he had to say to his disciples, 
 he <I>went up into heaven,</I> in a cloud; which we have a particular 
 account of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:9">Acts i. 9</A>),

 and he had not only an admission, but an abundant <I>entrance,</I> into 
 his kingdom there; he was <I>received up,</I> received in state, with 
 loud acclamations of the heavenly hosts; and he <I>sat on the right 
 hand of God:</I> sitting in a posture of <I>rest,</I> for now he had 
 finished his work, and a posture of <I>rule,</I> for now he took 
 possession of his kingdom; he sat <I>at the right hand of God,</I> 
 which denotes the sovereign dignity he is advanced to, and the 
 universal agency he is entrusted with. Whatever God does concerning us, 
 gives to us, or accepts from us, it is <I>by his Son.</I> Now he is 
 glorified with the glory he had before the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ <I>welcomed</I> in this <I>lower world;</I> his being 
 <I>believed on in the world,</I> and <I>received up into glory,</I> are 
 put together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16">1 Tim. iii. 16</A>.

 (1.) We have here the apostles working diligently for him; they <I>went 
 forth, and preached every where</I> far and near. Though the doctrine 
 they preached, was <I>spiritual</I> and <I>heavenly,</I> and directly 
 contrary to the <I>spirit</I> and <I>genius</I> of the world, though it 
 met with abundance of opposition, and was utterly destitute of all 
 secular supports and advantages, yet the preachers of it were neither 
 <I>afraid</I> nor <I>ashamed;</I> they were so industrious in spreading 
 the gospel, that within a few years the sound of it <I>went forth into 
 the ends of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:18">Rom. x. 18</A>.

 (2.) We have here God <I>working</I> effectually <I>with them,</I> to 
 make their labours successful, by <I>confirming the word with signs 
 following,</I> partly by the miracles that were wrought upon the 
 <I>bodies</I> of the people, which were divine seals to the Christian 
 doctrine, and partly by the influence it had upon the <I>minds</I> of 
 the people, through the operation of the Spirit of God, see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:4">Heb. ii. 4</A>.
 
 These were properly <I>signs following</I> the word--the reformation of
 the world, the destruction of idolatry, the conversion of sinners, the 
 comfort of saints; and these signs still follow it, and that they may 
 do so more and more, for the honour of Christ and the good of mankind, 
 the evangelist prays, and teaches us to say <I>Amen.</I> Father in 
 heaven, thus let thy name be hallowed, and let thy kingdom come.</P>
