 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter begins the account which this evangelist gives of the 
 death and sufferings of our Lord Jesus, which we are all concerned to 
 be acquainted, not only with the history of, but with the mystery of. 
 Here is, 

 I. The plot of the chief priests and scribes against Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The anointing of Christ's head at a supper in Bethany, two days
 before his death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:3-9">ver. 3-9</A>.

 III. The contract Judas made with the chief priests, to betray him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 IV. Christ's eating the passover with his disciples, his instituting
 the Lord's supper, and his discourse with his disciples, at and after
 supper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:12-31">ver. 12-31</A>.

 V. Christ's agony in the garden,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:32-42">ver. 32-42</A>.

 VI. The betraying of him by Judas, and the apprehending of him by the
 chief priests' agents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:43-52">ver. 43-52</A>.

 VII. His arraignment before the high priest, his conviction, and the 
 indignities done him at that bar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:53-65">ver. 53-65</A>.

 VIII. Peter's denying him,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  After two days was <I>the feast of</I> the passover, and of
 unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought
 how they might take him by craft, and put <I>him</I> to death.
 &nbsp; 2  But they said, Not on the feast <I>day,</I> lest there be an
 uproar of the people.
 &nbsp; 3  And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he
 sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of
 ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and
 poured <I>it</I> on his head.
 &nbsp; 4  And there were some that had indignation within themselves,
 and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
 &nbsp; 5  For it might have been sold for more than three hundred
 pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against
 her.
 &nbsp; 6  And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath
 wrought a good work on me.
 &nbsp; 7  For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will
 ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.
 &nbsp; 8  She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint
 my body to the burying.
 &nbsp; 9  Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
 preached throughout the whole world, <I>this</I> also that she hath
 done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
 &nbsp; 10  And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
 priests, to betray him unto them.
 &nbsp; 11  And when they heard <I>it,</I> they were glad, and promised to
 give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray
 him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here instances,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the <I>kindness of Christ's friends,</I> and the provision made 
 of respect and honour for him. Some friends he had, even in and about 
 Jerusalem, that loved him, and never thought they could do enough for 
 him, among whom, though Israel be not gathered, he is, and will be, 
 glorious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here was <I>one friend,</I> that was so kind as to <I>invite him to 
 sup with him;</I> and he was so kind as to accept the invitation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Though he had a prospect of his death approaching, yet he did not
 abandon himself to a melancholy retirement from all company, but 
 conversed as freely with his friends as usual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here was <I>another friend,</I> that was so kind as to <I>anoint his 
 head</I> with very precious ointment as he <I>sat at meat.</I> This was 
 an extraordinary piece of respect paid him by a good woman that thought 
 nothing too good to bestow upon Christ, and to do him honour. Now the 
 scripture was fulfilled, <I>When the king sitteth at his table, my 
 spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:12">Cant. i. 12</A>.

 Let us <I>anoint</I> Christ as our <I>Beloved,</I> kiss him with a kiss
 of <I>affection;</I> and anoint him as our <I>Sovereign,</I> kiss him 
 with a kiss of <I>allegiance.</I> Did he pour out his soul unto death 
 for us, and shall we think any box of ointment too precious to pour out 
 upon him? It is observable that she took care to pour it all out upon 
 Christ's head; she <I>broke the box</I> (so we read it); but because it 
 was an <I>alabaster box,</I> not easily broken, nor was it necessary 
 that it should be broken, to get out the ointment, some read it, she 
 <I>shook</I> the box, or <I>knocked it to the ground,</I> to loosen 
 what was in it, that it might be got out the better; or, she 
 <I>rubbed</I> and <I>scraped</I> out all that stuck tot he sides of it.
 Christ must have been honoured with <I>all we</I> have, and we must not 
 think to keep back any part of the price. Do we give him the 
 <I>precious ointment</I> of our best affections? Let him have them 
 <I>all;</I> love him <I>with all the heart.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 (1.) There were those that put a <I>worse construction</I> upon this 
 than it <I>deserved.</I> They called it a <I>waste of the ointment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Because they could not have found their hearts to put themselves to
 such an expense for the honouring of Christ, they thought that she was 
 <I>prodigal,</I> who did. Note, As the <I>vile person</I> ought to be 
 <I>called liberal,</I> nor the <I>churl</I> said to be <I>bountiful</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:5">Isa. xxxii. 5</A>);

 so the <I>liberal</I> and <I>bountiful</I> ought not to be called 
 <I>wasteful.</I> They pretend it might have been <I>sold,</I> and 
 <I>given to the poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 But as a <I>common piety</I> to the <I>corban</I> will not excuse from
 a <I>particular charity</I> to a poor parent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:11"><I>ch.</I> vii. 11</A>),

 so a common charity to the poor will not excuse from a particular act
 of piety to the Lord Jesus. What thy hand finds to do, that is good, 
 <I>do it with thy might.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Our Lord Jesus put a <I>better construction</I> upon it than, for 
 aught that appears, was <I>designed.</I> Probably, she intended no 
 more, than to show the great honour she had for him, before all the 
 company, and to complete his entertainment. But Christ makes it to be
 an act of <I>great faith,</I> as well as <I>great love</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);
 
 "<I>She is come aforehand, to anoint my body to the burying,</I> as if 
 she foresaw that my resurrection would prevent her doing it afterward." 
 This funeral rite was a kind of presage of, or prelude to, his death 
 approaching. See how Christ's heart was filled with the thoughts of his 
 death, how every thing was construed with a reference to that, and how 
 familiarly he spoke of it upon all occasions. It is usual for those who 
 are <I>condemned to die,</I> to have their coffins prepared, and other 
 provision made for their funerals, while they are yet alive; and 
 <I>so</I> Christ accepted <I>this.</I> Christ's death and burial were 
 the lowest steps of his humiliation, and therefore, though he 
 cheerfully submitted to them, yet he would have some marks of honour to 
 attend them, which might help to take off the <I>offence of the 
 cross,</I> and be an intimation how <I>precious in the sight of the 
 Lord the death of his saints is.</I> Christ never rode in triumph into 
 Jerusalem, but when he came thither to suffer; nor had ever his head 
 anointed, but for <I>his burial.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He recommended this piece of heroic piety to the applause of the 
 church in all ages; <I>Wherever this gospel shall be preached, it shall 
 be spoken of, for a memorial of her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, The honour which attends well-doing, even in this world, is
 sufficient to balance the reproach and contempt that are cast upon it.
 <I>The memory of the just is blessed,</I> and they that had <I>trial of
 cruel mockings,</I> yet <I>obtained a good report,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:6,39">Heb. xi. 6, 39</A>.
 
 Thus was this good woman repaid for her box of ointment, <I>Nec oleum
 perdidit nec operam--She lost neither her oil nor her labour.</I> She 
 got by it that good name which is <I>better than precious ointment.</I> 
 Those that <I>honour</I> Christ <I>he will honour.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the <I>malice of Christ's enemies,</I> and the preparation made 
 by them to do him mischief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The chief priests, his <I>open enemies,</I> consulted how they might 
 <I>put him to death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 The feast of the <I>passover</I> was now at hand, and at <I>that</I>
 feast he must be crucified,

 (1.) That his death and suffering might be the more public, and that 
 all <I>Israel,</I> even those <I>of the dispersion,</I> who came from 
 all parts to the feast, might be witnesses of it, and of the wonders 
 that attended it. 

 (2.) That the Anti-type might answer to the type. Christ, our
 Passover, was sacrificed for us, and brought us out of the house of 
 bondage, at the same time that the paschal lamb was sacrificed, and 
 Israel's deliverance out of Egypt was <I>commemorated.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now see, 

 [1.] How <I>spiteful</I> Christ's enemies were; they did not think it 
 enough to banish or imprison him, for they aimed not only to 
 <I>silence</I> him, and <I>stop</I> his progress for the future, but to 
 be revenged on him for all the good he had done. 

 [2.] How <I>subtle</I> they were; <I>Not on the feast-day,</I> when the 
 people are together; they do not say, Lest they should be disturbed in 
 their devotions, and diverted from them, but, <I>Lest there should be 
 an uproar</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 lest they should rise, and rescue him, and <I>fall foul</I> upon those 
 that <I>attempt</I> any thing against him. They who <I>desired</I>
 nothing more than the <I>praise</I> of men, dreaded nothing more than 
 the rage and displeasure of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Judas, his <I>disguised enemy,</I> contracted with them for the 
 betraying of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 He is said to be <I>one of the twelve</I> that were Christ's family,
 intimate with him, trained up for the service of the kingdom; and he 
 <I>went to the chief priests,</I> to tender his service in this 
 affair.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That which he proposed to them, was, to <I>betray Christ</I> to 
 them, and to give them notice when and where they might find him, and 
 seize him, without making an <I>uproar among the people,</I> which they 
 were afraid of, if they should seize him when he appeared <I>in 
 public,</I> in the midst of his admirers. Did he know then what help it 
 was they wanted, and where they were run aground in their counsels? It 
 is probable that he did not, for the debate was held in their close 
 <I>cabal.</I> Did they know that he had a mind to serve them, and make 
 court to him? No, they could not imagine that any of his intimates 
 should be so base; but Satan, who was entered into Judas, knew what 
 occasion they had for him, and could guide him to be <I>guide to 
 them,</I> who were contriving to <I>take Jesus.</I> Note, The spirit 
 that works in all the children of disobedience, knows how to bring them 
 in to the assistance one of another in a wicked project, and then to 
 harden them in it, with the fancy that Providence favours them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That which he proposed to himself, was, to <I>get money</I> by the 
 bargain; he had what he aimed at, when <I>they promised to give him 
 money.</I> Covetousness was Judas's master-lust, <I>his own 
 iniquity,</I> and that betrayed him to the sin of betraying his Master; 
 the devil suited his temptation to <I>that,</I> and so conquered him. 
 It is not said, They promised him <I>preferment</I> (he was not
 ambitious of that), but, they promised him <I>money.</I> See what need 
 we have to double our guard against the sin that <I>most easily besets 
 us.</I> Perhaps it was Judas's covetousness that brought him at first 
 to <I>follow Christ,</I> having a promise that he should be 
 cash-keeper, or purser, to the society, and he loved in his heart to be 
 fingering money; and now that there was money to be got on the other 
 side, he was as ready to betray him as ever he had been to follow him. 
 Note, Where the principle of men's profession of religion is carnal and 
 worldly, and the serving of a secular interest, the very same 
 principle, whenever the wind turns, will be the bitter root of a vile 
 and scandalous apostasy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Having secured the money, he set himself to make good his bargain;
 he sought <I>how he might conveniently betray him,</I> how he might 
 <I>seasonably deliver him up,</I> so as to answer the intention of 
 those who had hired him. See what need we have to be careful that we do 
 not ensnare ourselves in sinful engagements. If at any time we be so 
 ensnared in the words of our mouths, we are concerned to deliver 
 ourselves by a speedy retreat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:1-5">Prov. vi. 1-5</A>.

 It is a rule in our law, as well as in our religion, that an
 <I>obligation</I> to do an <I>evil thing</I> is <I>null</I> and 
 <I>void;</I> it binds to repentance, not to performance. See how the 
 way of sin is down-hill--when men are <I>in,</I> they must be 
 <I>on;</I> and what <I>wicked</I> contrivances many have in their 
 sinful pursuits, to compass their designs <I>conveniently;</I> but such 
 conveniences will prove mischiefs in the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
 passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go
 and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
 &nbsp; 13  And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto
 them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing
 a pitcher of water: follow him.
 &nbsp; 14  And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the
 house, The Master saith, Where is the guest chamber, where I shall
 eat the passover with my disciples?
 &nbsp; 15  And he will show you a large upper room furnished <I>and</I>
 prepared: there make ready for us.
 &nbsp; 16  And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and
 found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
 &nbsp; 17  And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
 &nbsp; 18  And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto
 you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.
 &nbsp; 19  And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by
 one, <I>Is</I> it I? and another <I>said, Is</I> it I?
 &nbsp; 20  And he answered and said unto them, <I>It is</I> one of the
 twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.
 &nbsp; 21  The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but
 woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it
 for that man if he had never been born.
 &nbsp; 22  And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and
 brake <I>it,</I> and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my
 body.
 &nbsp; 23  And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave
 <I>it</I> to them: and they all drank of it.
 &nbsp; 24  And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new
 testament, which is shed for many.
 &nbsp; 25  Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of
 the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of
 God.
 &nbsp; 26  And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount
 of Olives.
 &nbsp; 27  And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because
 of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd,
 and the sheep shall be scattered.
 &nbsp; 28  But after that I am risen, I will go before you into
 Galilee.
 &nbsp; 29  But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
 <I>will</I> not I.
 &nbsp; 30  And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this
 day, <I>even</I> in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt
 deny me thrice.
 &nbsp; 31  But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee,
 I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's eating the passover with his disciples, the night before he 
 died, with the joys and comforts of which ordinance he prepared himself 
 for his approaching sorrows, the full prospect of which did not 
 indispose him for that solemnity. Note, No apprehension of trouble, 
 come or coming, should put us by, or put us out of frame for, our 
 attendance on holy ordinances, as we have opportunity for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ ate the passover at the <I>usual time</I> when the other Jews 
 did, as Dr. Whitby had fully made out, and not, as Dr. Hammond would 
 have it, the night before. It was on the first day of that feast, which 
 (taking in all the eight days of the feast) was called, <I>The feast of 
 unleavened bread,</I> even that day when they <I>killed the 
 passover,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He directed his disciples how to find the place where he intended to 
 eat the passover; and hereby gave such another proof of his infallible 
 knowledge of things distant and future (which to us seem altogether 
 <I>contingent</I>), as he had given when he sent them for the ass on 
 which he rode in triumph 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+11:6"><I>ch.</I> xi. 6</A>);

 "<I>Go into the city</I> (for the <I>passover</I> must be <I>eaten</I>
 in Jerusalem), and <I>there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of 
 water</I> (a servant sent for water to clean the rooms in his master's 
 house); <I>follow him, go in</I> where he <I>goes,</I> enquire for his 
 master, <I>the good man of the house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and desire him to show you a room." No doubt, the inhabitants of 
 Jerusalem had rooms fitted up to be <I>let out,</I> for this occasion, 
 to those that came out of the country to keep the passover, and one of 
 those Christ made use of; not any friend's house, nor any house he had 
 formerly frequented, for then he would have said, "Go to such a 
 friend," or, "You know where we used to be, go thither and prepare." 
 Probably he went where he was not known, that he might be 
 <I>undisturbed</I> with his disciples. Perhaps he notified it by <I>a 
 sign,</I> to conceal it from Judas, that he might not know till he came 
 to the place; and by <I>such a sign</I> to intimate that he will dwell 
 in the <I>clean heart,</I> that is, <I>washed</I> as with <I>pure 
 water.</I> Where he designs to come, a pitcher of water must go before 
 him; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:16-18">Isa.  i. 16-18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He ate the passover in an <I>upper room furnished,</I> 
 <B><I>estromenon</I></B>--<I>laid with carpets</I> (so Dr. Hammond); it
 would seem to have been a very handsome <I>dining-room.</I> Christ was 
 far from affecting any thing that looked stately in eating his common 
 meals; on the contrary, he chose that which was homely, sat down on the 
 grass: but, when he was to keep a sacred feast, in honour of that he 
 would be at the expense of as good a room as he could get. God looks 
 not at <I>outward pomp,</I> but he looks at the tokens and expressions 
 of <I>inward reverence</I> for a divine institution, which, it is to be 
 feared, those want, who, to save charges, deny themselves decencies in 
 the worship of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He ate it <I>with the twelve,</I> who were his family, to teach 
 those who have the charge of families, not only families of 
 <I>children,</I> but families of <I>servants,</I> or families of 
 <I>scholars,</I> or <I>pupils,</I> to keep up religion among them, and 
 worship God with them. If Christ came <I>with the twelve,</I> then 
 Judas was with them, though he was at this time contriving to betray 
 his Master; and it is plain by what follows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 that he was there: he did not absent himself, lest he could have been 
 suspected; had his <I>seat</I> been <I>empty</I> at this feast, they 
 would have said, as Saul of David, <I>He is not clean, surely he is not 
 clean,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:26">1 Sam. xx. 26</A>.

 Hypocrites, though they know it is at their peril, yet crowd into
 special ordinances, to keep up their repute, and palliate their secret 
 wickedness. Christ did not <I>exclude</I> him from the feast, though he 
 <I>knew</I> his wickedness, for it was not as yet become public and 
 scandalous. Christ, designing to put the <I>keys of the kingdom of 
 heaven</I> into the hands of men, who can judge only according to 
 outward appearance, would hereby both direct and encourage them in 
 their admissions to his table, to be satisfied with a justifiable 
 profession, because they cannot discern the <I>root of bitterness</I> 
 till it <I>springs up.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's discourse with his disciples, as they were <I>eating</I> 
 the passover. It is probable that they had discourse, according to the 
 custom of the feast, of the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, and the 
 preservation of the first-born, and were as pleasant as they used to be 
 together on this occasion, till Christ told them that which would mix 
 <I>trembling</I> with their <I>joys.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were <I>pleasing</I> themselves with the society of <I>their 
 Master;</I> but he tells them that they must now presently lose him; 
 <I>The Son of man is betrayed;</I> and they knew, for he had often told 
 them, what followed--If he be <I>betrayed,</I> the next news you will
 hear of him, is, that he is <I>crucified</I> and <I>slain;</I> God hath 
 determined it concerning him, and he agrees to it; <I>The Son of man 
 goes, as it is written of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It was <I>written</I> in the counsels of God, and <I>written</I> in the
 prophecies of the Old Testament, not one jot or tittle of either of 
 which can <I>fall to the ground.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They were <I>pleasing</I> themselves with the society <I>one of 
 another,</I> but Christ casts a damp upon the joy of that, by telling 
 them, <I>One of you that eateth with me shall betray me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 Christ said this, if it might be, to startle the conscience of Judas,
 and to awaken him to repent of his wickedness, and to draw back (for it 
 was not too late) from the brink of the pit. But for aught that 
 appears, he who was <I>most concerned in</I> the warning, was <I>least 
 concerned at</I> it. All the rest were affected with it. 

 (1.) They began to be <I>sorrowful.</I> As the remembrance of our
 former falls into sin, so the fear of the like again, doth often much 
 embitter the comfort of our spiritual feasts, and damp our joy. Here 
 were the <I>bitter herbs,</I> with which this <I>passover-feast</I> was 
 taken.

 (2.) They began to be <I>suspicious</I> of themselves; they said <I>one
 by one, Is it I?</I> <I>And another said, Is it I?</I> They are to be 
 commended for their <I>charity,</I> that they were more jealous of 
 themselves than of <I>one another.</I> It is the law of charity, to 
 <I>hope the best</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:5-7">1 Cor. xiii. 5-7</A>),

 because we assuredly <I>know,</I> therefore we may justly 
 <I>suspect,</I> more evil by ourselves than by our brethren. They are 
 also to be commended for their acquiescence in what Christ said; they 
 trusted more to <I>his words</I> than to <I>their own hearts;</I> and 
 therefore do not say, "I am sure <I>it is not I,</I>" but, "<I>Lord, is 
 it I?</I> see if there be such a <I>way of wickedness in us,</I> such a 
 <I>root of bitterness,</I> and discover it to us, that we may pluck up 
 that <I>root,</I> and stop up that <I>way.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, in answer to their enquiry, Christ saith that, 

 [1.] Which would make them easy; "It is not <I>you,</I> or <I>you;</I> 
 it is this that now <I>dips with me in the dish;</I> the adversary and 
 enemy is this wicked Judas." 

 [2.] Which, one would think, should make Judas very <I>uneasy.</I> If 
 he go on in his undertaking, it is upon the sword's point, for <I>woe 
 to that many by whom the Son of man is betrayed;</I> he is undone, for 
 every undone; his sin will soon <I>find him out;</I> and it were 
 <I>better for him that he had never been born,</I> and had never had a 
 being than such a miserable one as he must have. It is very probable 
 that Judas encouraged himself in it with <I>this</I> thought, that his 
 Master had often said he must be betrayed; "And if it must be done, 
 surely God <I>will not find fault</I> with him that doth it, for who 
 <I>hath resisted his will?</I>" As that objector argues, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:19">Rom. ix. 19</A>.
 
 But Christ tells him that this will be no shelter or excuse to him;
 <I>The Son of man indeed goes; as it is written of him,</I> as a lamb 
 to the slaughter; but <I>woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.</I> 
 God's decree to permit the sins of men, and bring glory to himself out 
 of them, do neither necessitate their sins, nor determine to them, nor 
 will they be any <I>excuse</I> of the sin, or <I>mitigation</I> of the 
 punishment. Christ was delivered indeed by <I>the determinate counsel
 and fore-knowledge of God;</I> but, notwithstanding that, it is <I>with 
 wicked hands that he is crucified and slain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The institution of the Lord's supper.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was instituted in the close of a <I>supper,</I> when they were 
 sufficiently fed with the <I>paschal lamb,</I> to show that in the 
 Lord's supper there is no <I>bodily repast</I> intended; to preface it 
 with such a thing, is to revive Moses again. But it is food for <I>the
 soul</I> only, and therefore a very little of that which is for the 
 body, as much as will serve for a <I>sign,</I> is enough. It was at the 
 close of the <I>passover-supper,</I> which by this was evangelized, and 
 then superseded and set aside. Much of the doctrine and duty of the 
 eucharist is illustrated to us by the law of the passover 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:1-36">Exod. xii.</A>);

 for the Old-Testament institutions, though they do not <I>bind us,</I>
 yet <I>instruct</I> us, by the help of a gospel-key to them. And these 
 two ordinances lying here so near together, it may be good to compare 
 them, and observe how much shorter and plainer the institution of the 
 Lord's supper is, than that of the passover was. Christ's yoke is easy 
 in comparison with that of the ceremonial law, and his ordinances are 
 more spiritual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was instituted by the <I>example</I> of Christ himself; not with 
 the ceremony and solemnity of a law, as the ordinance of baptism was, 
 after Christ's resurrection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:19">Matt. xxviii. 19</A>),

 with, <I>Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid,</I> by a power given 
 to Christ <I>in heaven and on earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 but by the practice of our Master himself, because intended for those 
 who are already his disciples, and taken into covenant with him: but it 
 has the obligation of the law, and was intended to remain in full 
 force, power, and virtue, till his second coming.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It was instituted with <I>blessing</I> and <I>giving of thanks;</I> 
 the gifts of common providence are to be so received 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:4,5">1 Tim. iv. 4, 5</A>),
 
 much more than the gifts of special grace. He <I>blessed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 and <I>gave thanks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 At his other meals, he was wont to <I>bless,</I> and <I>give thanks</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:41,8:7"><I>ch.</I> vi. 41; viii. 7</A>)

 so remarkably, that he was known by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:30,31">Luke xxiv. 30, 31</A>.

 And he did the same at this meal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. It was instituted to be a <I>memorial</I> of his <I>death;</I> and 
 therefore he <I>broke</I> the bread, to show how it pleased the Lord to 
 <I>bruise him;</I> and he called the <I>wine,</I> which is the blood of 
 the grape, the <I>blood of the New Testament.</I> The death Christ died 
 was a <I>bloody death,</I> and frequent mention is made of the 
 <I>blood,</I> the <I>precious</I> blood, as the pride of our 
 redemption; for the blood is <I>the life,</I> and made <I>atonement for 
 the soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+17:11-14">Lev. xvii. 11-14</A>.

 The pouring out of the blood was the most sensible indication of the
 <I>pouring out of his soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:12">Isa. liii. 12</A>.
 
 Blood has a <I>voice</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:10">Gen. iv. 10</A>);

 and <I>therefore</I> blood is so often mentioned, because it was to
 <I>speak,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:24">Heb. xii. 24</A>.

 It is called the <I>blood of the New Testament;</I> for the covenant of
 grace became a <I>testament,</I> and of force by the death of Christ,
 the testator,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:16">Heb. ix. 16</A>.

 It is said to be <I>shed for many,</I> to justify <I>many</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:11">Isa. liii. 11</A>),
 
 to bring <I>many</I> sons to glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10">Heb. ii. 10</A>.

 It was sufficient for <I>many,</I> being of infinite value; it has been 
 of use to <I>many;</I> we read of a great multitude which no man could 
 number, that had all <I>washed their robes, and made them white in the 
 blood of the Lamb</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9-14">Rev. vii. 9-14</A>);

 and still it is a <I>fountain opened.</I> How comfortable is this to 
 poor repenting sinners, that the blood of Christ is <I>shed for 
 many!</I> And if for <I>many,</I> why not for <I>me?</I> If for 
 sinners, sinners of the Gentiles, the chief of sinners, then <I>why not 
 for me?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. It was instituted to be a <I>ratification</I> of the covenant made 
 with us in him, and a sign of the conveyance of those benefits to us, 
 which were purchased for us by his death; and therefore he broke the 
 bread <I>to them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and said, <I>Take, eat</I> of it: he gave the cup <I>to them,</I> and 
 ordered them to <I>drink of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Apply the doctrine of Christ crucified to yourselves, and let it be 
 <I>meat</I> and <I>drink</I> to your souls, strengthening, nourishing, 
 and refreshing, to you, and the support and comfort of your spiritual 
 life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. It was instituted with an eye to the happiness of heaven, and to be 
 an earnest and fore-taste of that, and thereby to put our mouths out of 
 taste for all the pleasures and delights of sense 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 <I>I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine,</I> as it is a bodily 
 refreshment. I have done with it. <I>No one, having tasted 
 spiritual</I> delights, <I>straightway desires</I> sensitive ones, for 
 he saith, The <I>spiritual</I> is better 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:39">Luke v. 39</A>);

 but <I>every one</I> that hath tasted <I>spiritual</I> delights, 
 straightway desires <I>eternal</I> ones, for he saith, Those are 
 <I>better still;</I> and therefore let me <I>drink no more of the fruit 
 of the vine,</I> it is dead and flat to those that have been made to 
 <I>drink</I> of the <I>river</I> of God's pleasures; but, Lord, hasten 
 the day, when I shall <I>drink</I> it new and fresh <I>in the kingdom 
 of God,</I> where it shall be for ever new, and in perfection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. It was closed with a <I>hymn,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Though Christ was in the midst of his enemies, yet he did not, for fear
 of them, omit this sweet duty of singing psalms. Paul and Silas sang, 
 when the <I>prisoners heard them.</I> This was an <I>evangelical 
 song,</I> and gospel times are often spoken of in the Old Testament, as 
 times of rejoicing, and praise is expressed by <I>singing.</I> This was 
 Christ's <I>swan-like</I> song, which he sung just before he entered 
 upon his agony; probably, that which is usually sung,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:1-118:29">Ps. cxiii. to cxviii</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ's discourse with his disciples, as they were returning to 
 Bethany by moonlight. When the had <I>sung the hymn,</I> presently they 
 <I>went out.</I> It was now near bedtime, but our Lord Jesus had his 
 heart so much upon his suffering, that he would not <I>come into the 
 tabernacle of his house,</I> nor<I>go up into his bed,</I> nor <I>give 
 sleep to his eyes,</I> when that work was to be done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:3,4">Ps. cxxxii. 3, 4</A>.

 The Israelites were forbidden to go out of their houses the night that
 they ate the passover, for fear of the sword of the destroying angel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:22,23">Exod. xii. 22, 23</A>.

 But because Christ, the <I>great shepherd,</I> was to be
 <I>smitten,</I> he <I>went out</I> purposely to expose himself to the 
 sword, as a champion; they <I>evaded</I> the destroyer, but Christ 
 <I>conquered</I> him, and brought <I>destructions to a perpetual 
 end.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ here foretels that in his sufferings he should be 
 <I>deserted</I> by all his disciples; "<I>You will all be offended 
 because of me, this night.</I> I know you will 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and what I tell you now, is no other than what the scripture has told 
 you before; <I>I will smite the shepherd,</I> and then <I>the sheep 
 will be scattered.</I>" Christ knew this before, and yet welcomed them 
 at his table; he sees the falls and miscarriages of his disciples, and 
 yet doth not refuse them. Nor should we be discouraged from coming to 
 the Lord's supper, by the fear of relapsing into sin afterward; but, 
 the greater of our danger is, the more need we have to fortify 
 ourselves by the diligent conscientious use of holy ordinances. Christ 
 tells them that they would be <I>offended in him,</I> would begin to 
 question whether he were the Messiah or no, when they saw him 
 <I>overpowered</I> by his enemies. Hitherto, they had <I>continued with 
 him in his temptations;</I> though they had sometimes offended him, yet 
 they had not been <I>offended in him,</I> nor turned the back upon him; 
 but now the storm would be so great, that they would all <I>slip their 
 anchors,</I> and be in danger of <I>shipwreck.</I> Some trials are more 
 particular (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:10">Rev. ii. 10</A>,

 <I>The devil shall cast some of you into prison</I>); but others are 
 more general, an <I>hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the 
 world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:10">Rev. iii. 10</A>.

 The <I>smiting</I> of the shepherd is often the <I>scattering</I> of
 the sheep: magistrates, ministers, masters of families, if these are, 
 as they should be, <I>shepherds</I> to those under their charge, when 
 any thing comes amiss to them, the whole flock suffers for it, and is 
 endangered by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But Christ encourages them with a promise that they shall rally again, 
 shall return both to their duty and to their comfort 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);

 "<I>After I am risen,</I> I will <I>gather you in</I> from all the
 places <I>wither you are scattered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:12">Ezek. xxxiv. 12</A>.

 I will <I>go before you into Galilee,</I> will see our friends, and 
 enjoy one another there."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He foretels that he should be <I>denied</I> particularly by Peter. 
 When they <I>went out</I> to go to the mount of Olives, we may suppose 
 that they dropped Judas (he stole away from them), whereupon the rest
 began to think <I>highly</I> of themselves, that they <I>stuck</I> to 
 their Master, when Judas quitted him. But Christ tells them, that 
 though they should be kept by his grace from Judas's apostasy, yet they 
 would have no reason to boast of their constancy. Note, Though God 
 keeps us from being as bad as the worst, yet we may well be ashamed to 
 think that we are not better than we are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Peter is confident that he should not <I>do so ill</I> as the rest 
 of his disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>);

 <I>Though all should be offended,</I> all his brethren here present, 
 <I>yet will not I.</I> He supposes himself not only stronger than 
 others, but so much stronger, as to be able to receive the shock of a 
 temptation, and bear up against it, <I>all alone;</I> to <I>stand,</I> 
 though nobody stood <I>by him.</I> It is bred in the bone with us, to 
 <I>think well</I> of ourselves, and <I>trust</I> to <I>our own 
 hearts.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ tells him that he will <I>do worse</I> than any of them. 
 They will all <I>desert</I> him, but he will <I>deny</I> him; not once, 
 but <I>thrice;</I> and that presently; "<I>This day, even this night 
 before the cock crow twice,</I> thou wilt <I>deny</I> that ever thou 
 hadst any knowledge of me, or acquaintance with me, as one ashamed and 
 afraid to own me."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He stands to his promise; "<I>If I should die with thee, I will 
 not deny thee;</I> I will adhere to thee, though it cost me my life:" 
 and, no doubt, he thought as he said. Judas said nothing like this, 
 when Christ told him he would betray him. He sinned by contrivance,
 Peter by surprise; he <I>devised the wickedness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:1">Mic. ii. 1</A>),

 Peter was <I>overtaken in this fault,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:1">Gal. vi. 1</A>.

 It was ill done of Peter, to contradict his Master. If he had said, 
 with fear and trembling, "Lord, give me grace to keep me from denying 
 thee, lead me not into this temptation, deliver me from this evil," it 
 might have been prevented: but they were all thus confident; they who 
 said, <I>Lord, is it I?</I> now said, <I>It shall never be me.</I> 
 Being acquitted from their fear of betraying Christ, they were now 
 secure. But he that thinks he stands, must learn to take heed lest he
 fall; and he that <I>girdeth on the harness,</I> not boast <I>as though 
 he had put it off.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>32  And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he
 saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.
 &nbsp; 33  And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began
 to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;
 &nbsp; 34  And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto
 death: tarry ye here, and watch.
 &nbsp; 35  And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and
 prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
 &nbsp; 36  And he said, Abba, Father, all things <I>are</I> possible unto
 thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will,
 but what thou wilt.
 &nbsp; 37  And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto
 Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?
 &nbsp; 38  Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit
 truly <I>is</I> ready, but the flesh <I>is</I> weak.
 &nbsp; 39  And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same
 words.
 &nbsp; 40  And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their
 eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.
 &nbsp; 41  And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on
 now, and take <I>your</I> rest: it is enough, the hour is come;

 Christ is here entering upon his sufferings, and begins with those 
 which were the sorest of all his sufferings, those in his <I>soul.</I> 
 Here we have him in his <I>agony;</I> this melancholy story we had in 
 Matthew; this <I>agony</I> in soul was the <I>wormwood and the gall</I> 
 in the <I>affliction and misery;</I> and thereby it appeared that no 
 sorrow was <I>forced upon him,</I> but that it was what he 
 <I>freely</I> admitted.</P>

 I. He retired for prayer; <I>Sit ye here</I> (saith he to his 
 disciples), while I go a little further, and <I>pray.</I> He had lately 
 prayed <I>with them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1-26">John xvii.</A>);

 and now he appoints them to withdraw while he goes to his Father upon
 an errand peculiar to himself. Note, Our praying with our families will 
 not excuse our neglect of secret worship. When Jacob entered into his 
 agony, he first <I>sent over all that he had,</I> and was <I>left 
 alone,</I> and then <I>there wrestled a man with him</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:23,24">Gen. xxxii. 23, 24</A>),

 though he had been at prayer before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 it is likely, with his family.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Even into that retirement he took with him <I>Peter, and James, and 
 John</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 three competent witnesses of this part of his humiliation; and though 
 great spirits care not how few know any thing of their agonies, he was 
 not ashamed that they should see. These three had boasted most of their 
 ability and willingness to suffer with him; Peter here, in this 
 chapter, and James and John

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:39"><I>ch.</I> x. 39</A>);

 and therefore Christ takes them to stand by, and see what a struggle he
 had with the <I>bloody baptism</I> and the <I>bitter cup,</I> to 
 convince them that they knew not what they said. It is fit that they 
 who are most confident, should be <I>first</I> tried, that they may be 
 made sensible of their folly and weakness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. There he was in a tremendous agitation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 <I>He began to be sore amazed</I>--<B><I>ekthambeisthai</I></B>, a word 
 not used in Matthew, but very significant; it bespeaks something like 
 that <I>horror of great darkness,</I> which <I>fell upon Abraham</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:12">Gen. xv. 12</A>),

 or, rather, something much worse, and more frightful. The <I>terrors
 of God set themselves in array against him,</I> and he allowed himself 
 the actual and intense contemplation of them. Never was <I>sorrow</I> 
 like unto <I>his</I> at that time; never any had such experience as he 
 had from eternity of divine favours, and therefore never any had, or 
 could have, such a sense as he had of divine favours. Yet there was
 not the least disorder or irregularity in this commotion of his 
 spirits; his affections rose not tumultuously, but under direction, and 
 as they were called up, for he had no corrupt nature to mix with them, 
 as we have. If water have a sediment at the bottom, though it may be 
 clear while it stands still, yet, when shaken, it grows muddy; so it is 
 with our affections: but pure water in a clean glass, though ever so 
 much stirred, continues clear; and so it was with Christ. Dr. Lightfoot 
 thinks it very probable that the devil did now appear to our Saviour in 
 a visible shape, in his <I>own shape</I> and <I>proper colour,</I> to 
 terrify and affright him, and to drive him from his hope in God (which 
 he aimed at in persecuting Job, a type of Christ, to make him <I>curse 
 God, and die</I>), and to deter him from the further prosecution of his 
 undertaking; whatever hindered him from that, he looked upon as coming 
 from Satan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:23">Matt. xvi. 23</A>.

 When the devil had tempted him in the wilderness, it is said, He 
 departed <I>from him for a season</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:13">Luke iv. 13</A>),

 intending another grapple with him, and in another way; finding that he 
 could not by his flatteries <I>allure</I> him into sin, he would try by 
 his terrors to <I>affright</I> him into it, and so <I>make void</I> his 
 design.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He made a sad complaint of this agitation. He said, <I>My soul is 
 exceeding sorrowful.</I> 

 1. He was <I>made sin for us,</I> and therefore was thus
 <I>sorrowful;</I> he fully knew the <I>malignity</I> of the <I>sins</I> 
 he was to <I>suffer for;</I> and having the highest degree of love to 
 God, who was <I>offended</I> by them, and of love to <I>man,</I> who 
 was damaged and endangered by them, now that those were set in order 
 before him, no marvel that <I>his soul</I> was <I>exceeding 
 sorrowful.</I> Now was he made to <I>serve with our sins,</I> and was 
 thus <I>wearied with our iniquities.</I> 

 2. He <I>was made a curse</I> for us; the curses of the law were
 transferred to him as our surety and representative, not as originally 
 <I>bound with us,</I> but a <I>bail to the action.</I> And when his 
 soul was thus exceeding sorrowful, he did, as it were, yield to them, 
 and lie down under the load, until by his death he had satisfied for 
 sin, and so for ever abolished the curse. He now <I>tasted death</I> 
 (as he is said to do,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:9">Heb. ii. 9</A>),

 which is not an extenuating expression, as if he did <I>but</I> taste 
 it; no, he <I>drank up</I> even the dregs of the cup; but it is rather 
 <I>aggravating;</I> it did not go down by wholesale, but he 
 <I>tasted</I> all the bitterness of it. This was that <I>fear</I> which 
 the apostle speaks of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>),

 a natural fear of pain and death, which it is natural to human nature 
 to startle at.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the consideration of Christ's sufferings in <I>his soul,</I> and 
 his <I>sorrows</I> for us, should be of use to us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To <I>embitter our sins.</I> Can we ever entertain a 
 <I>favourable</I> or so much as a <I>slight</I> thought of sin, when we 
 see what impression sin (though but imputed) made upon the Lord Jesus? 
 Shall that <I>sit light</I> upon our souls, which sat <I>so heavy</I> 
 upon his? Was Christ in such an agony for our sins, and shall we never 
 be in an agony about them? How should we look upon him whom we have 
 <I>pressed,</I> whom we have <I>pierced,</I> and <I>mourn,</I> and be 
 <I>in bitterness!</I> It becomes us to be <I>exceeding sorrowful</I> 
 for sin, because Christ was so, and never to <I>make a mock</I> at it. 
 If Christ thus suffered for sin, let us <I>arm ourselves with the same 
 mind.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To <I>sweeten our sorrows;</I> if our souls be at any time 
 <I>exceeding sorrowful,</I> through the afflictions of this present 
 time, let us remember that our Master was so before us, and the 
 <I>disciple is not greater than his Lord.</I> Why should we affect to 
 <I>drive away</I> sorrow, when Christ for our sakes courted it, and 
 submitted to it, and thereby not only took out the <I>sting</I> of it, 
 and made it <I>tolerable,</I> but put <I>virtue</I> into it, and made 
 it <I>profitable</I> (for <I>by the sadness of the countenance the 
 heart is made better</I>), nay, and put <I>sweetness</I> into it, and 
 made it comfortable. Blessed Paul was <I>sorrowful,</I> and yet 
 <I>always rejoicing.</I> If we be <I>exceeding sorrowful,</I> it is but 
 <I>unto death;</I> that will be the period of all our sorrows, if 
 Christ be <I>ours;</I> when the <I>eyes</I> are closed, all tears are 
 <I>wiped away</I> from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He ordered his disciples to keep with him, not because he needed 
 their help, but because he would have them to <I>look upon him and 
 receive instruction;</I> he said to them, <I>Tarry ye here and 
 watch.</I> He had said to the other disciples nothing but, Sit ye here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 but these three he bids to tarry <I>and watch,</I> as expecting more 
 from them than from the rest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He addressed himself to God by prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 He <I>fell on the ground, and prayed.</I> It was but a little before 
 this, that in prayer he <I>lifted up his eyes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1">John xvii. 1</A>);

 but here, being in an agony, he <I>fell upon his face,</I> 
 accommodating himself to his present humiliation, and teaching us thus 
 to abase ourselves before God; it becomes us to <I>be low,</I> when we 
 come into the presence of the <I>Most High.</I> 

 1. As <I>Man,</I> he <I>deprecated</I> his sufferings, that, <I>if it
 were possible, the hour might pass from him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 "This <I>short,</I> but <I>sharp</I> affliction, that which I am now 
 <I>this hour</I> to enter upon, let man's salvation be, <I>if 
 possible,</I> accomplished without it." We have his very words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),
 
 <I>Abba, Father.</I> The Syriac word is here retained, which Christ 
 used, and which signifies <I>Father,</I> to intimate what an emphasis 
 our Lord Jesus, in his <I>sorrows,</I> laid upon it, and would have us 
 to lay. It is with an eye to this, that St. Paul retains this word,
 putting it into the mouths of all that have the <I>Spirit of 
 adoption;</I> they are taught to cry, <I>Abba, Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:15,Ga+4:6">Rom. viii. 15; Gal. iv. 6</A>.

 Father, <I>all things are possible to thee.</I> Note, Even that which
 we cannot expect to be done for us, we ought yet to believe that God is 
 <I>able to do:</I> and when we submit to his will, and refer ourselves 
 to his wisdom and mercy, it must be with a believing acknowledgment of 
 his power, that <I>all things are possible to him.</I>

 2. As <I>Mediator,</I> he <I>acquiesced</I> in the will of God
 concerning them; "<I>Nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou 
 wilt.</I> I know the matter is settled, and cannot be altered, <I>I 
 must suffer</I> and die, and I bid it welcome."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. He roused his disciples, who were dropped asleep while he was at 
 prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>.

 He comes to look after them, since they did not look after him; and he
 <I>finds them asleep,</I> so little affected were they with his 
 sorrows, his complaints, and prayers. This carelessness of theirs was a 
 presage of their further offence in deserting him; and it was an 
 aggravation of it, that he had so lately commended them for 
 <I>continuing with him in his temptations,</I> though they had not been 
 without their faults. Was he so willing to make the best of them, and 
 were they so indifferent in approving themselves to him? They had 
 lately promised not to be <I>offended in him;</I> what! and yet mind 
 him so little? He particularly upbraided Peter with his drowsiness; 
 <I>Simon, sleepest thou?</I> <B><I>Kai sy teknon</I></B>;--"<I>What 
 thou, my son?</I> Thou that didst so positively promise thou wouldest 
 not deny me, dost thou slight me thus? From thee I expected better 
 things. <I>Couldest thou not watch one hour?</I>" He did not require 
 him to watch <I>all night</I> with him, only for <I>one hour.</I> It 
 aggravates our faintness and short continuance in Christ's service, 
 that he doth not over-task us, nor weary us with it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:23">Isa. xliii. 23</A>.

 He puts upon us <I>no other burthen</I> than to <I>hold fast till he
 comes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:24,25">Rev. ii. 24, 25</A>);

 and behold, <I>he comes quickly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:11">Rev. iii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As those whom Christ <I>loves</I> he <I>rebukes</I> when they do amiss, 
 so those whom he <I>rebukes</I> he counsels and comforts. 

 1. It was a very wise and faithful word of advice which Christ here
 gave to his disciples; <I>Watch and pray, lest ye enter into 
 temptation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.
 
 It was bad to <I>sleep</I> when Christ was in his agony, but they were
 entering into further temptation, and if they did not stir up 
 themselves, and fetch in grace and strength from God by prayer, they 
 would <I>do worse;</I> and so they did, when they all forsook him, and 
 fled. 

 2. It was a very kind and tender excuse that Christ made for them;
 "<I>The spirit truly is willing;</I> I know it is, it is <I>ready,</I> 
 it is <I>forward;</I> you would willingly <I>keep awake,</I> but you 
 cannot." This may be taken as a reason for that exhortation, "<I>Watch 
 and pray;</I> because, though <I>the spirit is willing,</I> I grant it 
 is (you have sincerely resolved never to be <I>offended in me</I>), yet 
 <I>the flesh is weak,</I> and if you do not <I>watch</I> and 
 <I>pray,</I> and use the means of perseverance, you may be overcome, 
 notwithstanding." The consideration of the <I>weakness</I> and 
 infirmity of <I>our flesh</I> should engage and quicken us to 
 <I>prayer</I> and <I>watchfulness,</I> when we are entering into 
 temptation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. He <I>repeated</I> his address to his Father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>);

 <I>He went again, and prayed,</I> saying, <B><I>ton auton 
 logon</I></B>--<I>the same word,</I> or matter, or business; he spoke 
 to the same purport, and again <I>the third time.</I> This teaches us, 
 that <I>men ought to pray, and not to faint,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:1">Luke xviii. 1</A>.

 Though the answers to our prayers do not come quickly, yet we must
 renew our requests, and <I>continue instant in prayer;</I> for <I>the 
 vision is for an appointed time, and at the end it shall speak, and not 
 lie,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:3">Hab. ii. 3</A>.

 Paul, when he was <I>buffeted by a messenger of Satan, besought the
 Lord thrice,</I> as Christ did here, before he obtained an answer of 
 peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:7,8">2 Cor. xii. 7, 8</A>.

 A little before this, when Christ, in the <I>trouble of his soul,</I>
 prayed, <I>Father, glorify thy name,</I> he had an immediate answer by 
 a voice from heaven, <I>I have both glorified it, and I will glorify it 
 yet again;</I> but now he must come a second and third time, for the 
 visits of God's grace, in answer to prayer, come sooner or later, 
 according to the pleasure of his will, that we may be kept 
 depending.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. He <I>repeated</I> his visits to his disciples. Thus he gave a 
 specimen of his continued care for his church on earth, even when it is 
 <I>half asleep,</I> and not duly concerned for itself, while he ever 
 lives making intercession with his Father <I>in heaven.</I> See how, as 
 became a <I>Mediator,</I> he passes and repasses between both. He came 
 the <I>second time</I> to his disciples, and <I>found them asleep 
 again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 See how the infirmities of Christ's disciples <I>return</I> upon them,
 notwithstanding their resolutions, and <I>overpower</I> them, 
 notwithstanding their resistance; and what clogs those bodies of ours 
 are to our souls, which should make us long for that blessed state in 
 which they shall be no more our encumbrance. This second time he spoke 
 to them as before, but <I>they wist not what to answer him;</I> they 
 were ashamed of their drowsiness, and had nothing to say in excuse for 
 it. Or, They were so overpowered with it, that, like men between 
 sleeping and waking, they knew not where they were, or what they said. 
 But, the <I>third time,</I> they were bid to <I>sleep</I> if they would

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>);

 "<I>Sleep on now, and take your rest.</I> I have now no more occasion 
 for your watching, you may sleep, if you will, for me." <I>It is 
 enough;</I> we had not that word in Matthew. "You have had warning 
 enough to keep awake, and would not take it; and now you shall see what 
 little reason you have to be secure." <B><I>Apekei</I></B>, <I>I 
 discharge you</I> from any <I>further attendance;</I> so some 
 understand it; "Now <I>the hour is come,</I> in which I knew you would 
 all forsake me, even take your course;" as he said to Judas, <I>What 
 thou doest, do quickly.</I> The <I>Son of man</I> is now <I>betrayed 
 into the hands of sinners,</I> the chief priests and elders; those 
 <I>worst</I> of sinners, because they made a profession of sanctity. 
 "Come, <I>rise up,</I> do not lie dozing there. <I>Let us go</I> and
 meet the enemy, for <I>lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand,</I> and I 
 must not now think of making an escape." When we see trouble at the 
 door, we are concerned to stir up ourselves to get ready for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>43  And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of
 the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and
 staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
 &nbsp; 44  And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,
 Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead
 <I>him</I> away safely.
 &nbsp; 45  And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and
 saith, Master, master; and kissed him.
 &nbsp; 46  And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
 &nbsp; 47  And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a
 servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
 &nbsp; 48  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as
 against a thief, with swords and <I>with</I> staves to take me?
 &nbsp; 49  I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me
 not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.
 &nbsp; 50  And they all forsook him, and fled.
 &nbsp; 51  And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen
 cloth cast about <I>his</I> naked <I>body;</I> and the young men laid hold
 on him:
 &nbsp; 52  And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the <I>seizing</I> of our Lord Jesus by the officers of 
 the chief priests. This was what his enemies had long aimed at, they 
 had often sent to <I>take him;</I> but he had escaped out of their 
 hands, because <I>his hour was not come,</I> nor could they now have 
 taken him, had he not freely surrendered himself. He began first to 
 suffer <I>in his soul,</I> but afterward suffered in his body, that he 
 might satisfy for sin, which begins in the heart, but afterwards makes 
 the members of the body <I>instruments of unrighteousness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a band of rude miscreants employed to <I>take</I> our Lord 
 Jesus and make him a prisoner; <I>a great multitude with swords and 
 staves.</I> There is no wickedness so black, no villany so horrid, but 
 there may be found among the children of men fit tools to be made use 
 of, that will not scruple to be employed; so miserably depraved and 
 vitiated is mankind. At the head of this rabble is Judas, <I>one of the 
 twelve,</I> one of those that had been many years intimately conversant 
 with our Lord Jesus, had prophesied in his name, and in his name cast 
 out devils, and yet <I>betrayed</I> him. It is no new thing for a very 
 fair and plausible profession to end in a shameful and fatal apostasy. 
 <I>How art thou fallen, O Lucifer!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Men of no less figure than the <I>chief priests, and the 
 scribes,</I> and <I>the elders,</I> sent them, and set them on work, 
 who pretended to expect the Messiah, and to be ready to welcome him; 
 and yet, when he <I>is come,</I> and has given undeniable proofs that 
 it is he that <I>should come,</I> because he doth not make court to 
 them, nor countenance and support their pomp and grandeur, because he 
 appears not as a temporal prince, but sets up a spiritual kingdom, and 
 preaches repentance, reformation, and a holy life, and directs men's 
 thoughts, and affections, and aims, to another world, they set 
 themselves against him, and, without giving the credentials he produces 
 an impartial examination, resolve to run him down.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Judas betrayed him <I>with a kiss;</I> abusing the freedom Christ 
 used to allow his disciples of kissing his cheek at their return when 
 they had been any time absent. He called him, <I>Master, Master, and 
 kissed him;</I> he said, <I>Rabbi, Rabbi,</I> as if he had been now 
 more respectful to him than ever. It is enough to put one for ever out 
 of conceit with being called of men <I>Rabbi, Rabbi</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:7">Matt. xxiii. 7</A>),
 
 since it was with this compliment that Christ was betrayed. He bid them 
 take him, and <I>lead him away safely.</I> Some think that he spoke 
 this <I>ironically,</I> knowing that they could not secure him unless 
 he pleased, that this Samson could break their bonds asunder as threads 
 of tow, and make is escape, and then he should get the money, and 
 Christ the honour, and no harm done; and I should think so too, but 
 that Satan was <I>entered into him,</I> so that the worst and most 
 malicious intention of this action is not too black to be supposed. 
 Nay, he had often heard his Master say, that, being <I>betrayed,</I> he 
 should be <I>crucified,</I> and had no reason to think otherwise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They arrested him, and made him their prisoner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>);

 <I>They laid their hands on him,</I> rude and violent hands, and 
 <I>took him</I> into custody; triumphing, it is likely, that they had 
 done that which has been often before attempted in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Peter laid about him in defence of his Master, and wounded one of 
 the assailants, being for the present mindful of his promise, to 
 venture his life with his Master. He was <I>one of them that stood 
 by,</I> of them that <I>were with him</I> (so the word signifies), of 
 <I>those three</I> disciples that were <I>with him</I> in the garden; 
 he <I>drew a sword,</I> and aimed, it is likely, to cut off the head, 
 but missed his blow, and only <I>cut off the ear,</I> of a servant of 
 the high priest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 It is easier to <I>fight</I> for Christ, than to <I>die</I> for him;
 but Christ's good soldiers overcome, not by taking other people's 
 lives, but by laying down their own,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Christ argues with them that had seized him, and shows them the 
 absurdity of their proceedings against him. 

 1. That they came out <I>against him,</I> as against a <I>thief,</I>
 whereas he was <I>innocent</I> of any crime; he <I>taught daily in the 
 temple,</I> and if he had any wicked design, there it would some time 
 or other have been discovered; nay, these officers of the <I>chief 
 priests,</I> being <I>retainers</I> to the temple, may be supposed to 
 have heard his sermons there (I was <I>with you</I> in the temple); and 
 had he not taught them excellent doctrine, even his enemies themselves 
 being judges? Were not <I>all the words of his mouth in 
 righteousness?</I> Was there any thing <I>froward or perverse in 
 them?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:8">Prov. viii. 8</A>.

 By his fruits he was known to be a good tree; why then did they come
 out against him <I>as a thief?</I> 

 2. That they came to take him thus <I>privately,</I> whereas he was
 neither <I>ashamed</I> nor <I>afraid</I> to appear <I>publicly</I> in 
 the temple. He was none of those <I>evil-doers</I> that <I>hate the 
 light,</I> neither come <I>to the light,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:20">John iii. 20</A>.

 If their masters had any thing to say to him, they might meet him any
 day in the temple, where he was ready to answer all challenges, all 
 charges; and there they might do as they pleased with him, for the 
 priests had the custody of the temple, and the command of the guards 
 about it: but to come upon him thus at midnight, and in the place of 
 his retirement, was base and cowardly. This was to do as David's enemy, 
 that <I>sat in the lurking places of the villages, to murder the 
 innocent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:8">Ps. x. 8</A>.
 
 But this was not all.

 3. They came <I>with swords and staves,</I> as if he had been in arms
 against the government, and must have the <I>posse comitatus</I> raised 
 to reduce him. There was no occasion for those weapons; but they made 
 this ado,

 (1.) To secure themselves from the rage of some; they came armed, 
 because they <I>feared the people;</I> but thus <I>were they in great 
 fear, where no fear was,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:5">Ps. liii. 5</A>.

 (2.) To expose him to the rage of others. By coming <I>with swords and 
 staves to take him,</I> they represented him to the people (who are apt 
 to take impressions this way) as a dangerous turbulent man, and so 
 endeavored to incense them against him, and make them cry out, 
 <I>Crucify him, crucify him,</I> having no other way to gain their 
 point.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. He reconciled himself to all this injurious, ignominious 
 treatment, by referring himself to the Old-Testament predictions of the 
 Messiah. I am hardly used, <I>but</I> I submit, for <I>the scriptures 
 must be fulfilled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>.

 1. See here what a regard Christ had to the <I>scriptures;</I> he would
 bear any thing rather than that the least jot or tittle of the word of 
 God should fall to the ground; and as he had an eye to them in his 
 sufferings, so he has in his glory; for what is Christ doing in the 
 government of the world, but <I>fulfilling the scriptures?</I> 

 2. See what use we are to make of the Old Testament; we must search for
 Christ, the true <I>treasure hid in that field:</I> as the history of 
 the New Testament expounds the prophecies of Old, so the prophecies of 
 the Old Testament illustrate the history of the New.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. All Christ's disciples, hereupon, deserted him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>);

 <I>They all forsook him, and fled.</I> They were very confident that 
 they should adhere to him; but even good men know not what they will 
 do, till they are tried. If it was such a comfort to him as he had 
 lately intimated, that they had hitherto <I>continued with him</I> in 
 his lesser trials 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:28">Luke xxii. 28</A>),

 we may well imagine what a grief it was to him, that they deserted him 
 now in the greatest, when they might have done him some service--when 
 he was abused, to protect him, and when accused, to witness for him. 
 Let not those that suffer for Christ, think it strange, if they be thus 
 deserted, and if all the herd shun the wounded deer; they are not 
 better than their Master, nor can expect to be better used either by 
 their enemies or by their friends. When St. Paul was in peril, none
 <I>stood by him,</I> but <I>all men forsook him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:16">2 Tim. iv. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. The noise disturbed the neighbourhood, and some of the neighbours 
 were brought into danger by the riot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:51,52"><I>v.</I> 51, 52</A>.

 This passage of story we have not in any other of the evangelists. Here
 is an account of a <I>certain young man,</I> who, as it should seem, 
 was no disciple of Christ, nor, as some have imagined, a servant of the 
 house wherein Christ had eaten the passover, who <I>followed him</I> to 
 see what would become of him (as the <I>sons of the prophets,</I> when 
 they understood that Elijah was to be <I>taken up,</I> went to <I>view 
 afar off,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:7">2 Kings ii. 7</A>),

 but some young man that lived near the garden, perhaps in the house to
 which the garden belonged. Now observe concerning him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he was <I>frightened out of his bed,</I> to be a 
 <I>spectator</I> of Christ's sufferings. Such a <I>multitude,</I> so 
 armed, and coming with so much fury, and in the dead of night, and in a 
 quiet village, could not but produce a great stir; this alarmed our 
 <I>young man,</I> who perhaps thought they was some tumult or rising in 
 the city, some <I>uproar among the people,</I> and had the curiosity to 
 go, and see what the matter was, and was in such haste to inform 
 himself, that he could not stay to dress himself, but threw a sheet 
 about him, as if he would appear like a walking ghost, in grave 
 clothes, to frighten those who had frightened him, and ran among the 
 thickest of them with this question, <I>What is to do here?</I> Being 
 told, he had a mind to see the issue, having, no doubt, heard much of 
 the fame of this Jesus; and therefore, when all his disciples had 
 quitted him, he continued to <I>follow him,</I> desirous to <I>hear</I> 
 what he would say, and <I>see</I> what he would do. Some think that his 
 having no other garment than this <I>linen cloth</I> upon his naked 
 body, intimates that he was one of those Jews who made a great 
 profession of piety that their neighbours, in token of which, among 
 other instances of austerity and mortification of the body, they used 
 no clothes but one linen garment, which, though contrived to be modest 
 enough, was thin and cold. But I rather think that this was not his 
 constant wear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See how he was <I>frightened into his bed</I> again, when he was in 
 danger of being made a <I>sharer</I> in Christ's sufferings. His own 
 disciples had run away from him; but this young man, having no concern 
 for him, thought he might securely attend him, especially being so far 
 from being armed, that he was not so much as clothed; but <I>the young 
 men,</I> the Roman soldiers, who were called to assist, <I>laid hold of 
 him,</I> for all was fish that came to their net. Perhaps they were now 
 vexed at themselves, that they had suffered the disciples to <I>run 
 away,</I> and they being got out of their reach they resolved to seize 
 the first they could <I>lay their hands on;</I> though this young man 
 was perhaps one of the <I>strictest sect</I> of the Jewish church, yet 
 the Roman soldiers made no conscience of abusing him upon this 
 occasion. Finding himself in danger, he <I>left the linen cloth</I> by 
 which they had <I>caught hold of him,</I> and <I>fled away naked.</I> 
 This passage is recorded to show what a barbarous crew this was, that 
 was sent to seize Christ, and what a narrow escape the disciples had of 
 falling into their hands, out of which nothing could have kept them but 
 their Master's care of them; <I>If ye seek me, let these go their 
 way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:8">John xviii. 8</A>.

 It also intimates that there is <I>no hold</I> of those who are led by
 curiosity only, and not by faith and conscience, to follow Christ.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>53  And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him
 were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the
 scribes.
 &nbsp; 54  And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the
 high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at
 the fire.
 &nbsp; 55  And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
 against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
 &nbsp; 56  For many bare false witness against him, but their witness
 agreed not together.
 &nbsp; 57  And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 58  We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made
 with hands, and within three days I will build another made
 without hands.
 &nbsp; 59  But neither so did their witness agree together.
 &nbsp; 60  And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
 saying, Answerest thou nothing? what <I>is it which</I> these witness
 against thee?
 &nbsp; 61  But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high
 priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son
 of the Blessed?
 &nbsp; 62  And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man
 sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of
 heaven.
 &nbsp; 63  Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need
 we any further witnesses?
 &nbsp; 64  Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all
 condemned him to be guilty of death.
 &nbsp; 65  And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to
 buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did
 strike him with the palms of their hands.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's arraignment, trial, conviction, and condemnation, 
 in the <I>ecclesiastical</I> court, before the great sanhedrim, of 
 which the <I>high priest</I> was president, or judge of the court; the 
 same Caiaphas that had lately adjudged it expedient he should be put to 
 death, guilty or not guilty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:50">John xi. 50</A>),

 and who therefore might justly be excepted against as partial.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ is hurried away to his <I>house,</I> his <I>palace</I> it is 
 called, such state did he live in. And there, though, in the dead of 
 the night, <I>all the chief priests, and elders, and scribes,</I> that 
 were in the secret, were <I>assembled,</I> ready to receive the prey; 
 so sure were they of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>Peter followed</I> at a distance, such a degree of cowardice was 
 his late courage dwindled into, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.

 But when he came to the high priest's palace, he <I>sneakingly</I>
 went, and <I>sat with the servants,</I> that he might not be suspected 
 to belong to Christ. The high priest's fire side was no proper place, 
 nor his servants proper company, for Peter, but it was his <I>entrance 
 into a temptation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Great diligence was used to procure, for love or money, false 
 witnesses against Christ. They had seized him as a malefactor, and now 
 they had him they had no indictment to prefer against him, no crime to 
 lay to his charge, but they <I>sought for witnesses against him;</I> 
 pumped some with ensnaring questions, offered bribes to others, if they 
 <I>would accuse him,</I> and endeavored to frighten others, if they 
 <I>would not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:55,56"><I>v.</I> 55, 56</A>.

 The chief priests and elders were by the law entrusted with the 
 prosecuting and punishing of <I>false witnesses</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:16,17">Deut. xix. 16, 17</A>);

 yet those were now ringleaders in a crime that tends to overthrow of 
 all justice. It is time to cry, <I>Help, Lord,</I> when the physicians 
 of a land are its troublers, and those that should be the conservators 
 of peace and equity, are the corrupters of both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He was at length charged with words spoken some years ago, which, 
 as they were represented, seemed to threaten <I>the temple,</I> which 
 they had made no better than an idol of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:57,58"><I>v.</I> 57, 58</A>);

 but the witnesses to this matter did not agree 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>),

 for one swore that he said, <I>I am able to destroy the temple of God, 
 and to build it in three days</I> (so it is in Matthew); the other 
 swore that he said, <I>I will destroy this temple, that is made with 
 hands,</I> and <I>within three days, I will build</I> not it, but 
 <I>another made without hands;</I> now these two differ much from each 
 other; <B><I>oude ise en he martyria</I></B>--<I>their testimony was 
 not sufficient,</I> nor equal to the charge of a capital crime; so Dr.
 Hammond: they did not accuse him of that upon which a <I>sentence of 
 death</I> might be founded, no not by the utmost stretch of their 
 law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He was urged to be his own accuser 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>);

 The <I>high priest stood up</I> in a heat, and said, <I>Answerest thou 
 nothing?</I> This he said under pretence of justice and fair dealing, 
 but really with a design to ensnare him, that they might <I>accuse 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:53,54,20:20">Luke xi. 53, 54; xx. 20</A>.

 We may well imagine with what an air of haughtiness and disdain this
 proud high priest brought our Lord Jesus to this question; "Come you,
 the prisoner at the bar, you hear what is sworn against you; what have
 you now to say for yourself?" Pleased to think that <I>he</I> seemed
 silent, who had so often silenced those that picked quarrels with him.
 Still Christ <I>answered nothing,</I> that he might set us an example,

 1. Of <I>patience</I> under calumnies and false accusations; when we
 are <I>reviled,</I> let us not <I>revile again,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:23">1 Pet. ii. 23</A>.

 And,

 2. Of <I>prudence,</I> when a man shall be made an <I>offender for a
 word</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:21">Isa. xxix. 21</A>),

 and our <I>de</I>fence made our <I>of</I>fence; it is an evil time 
 indeed when the prudent shall <I>keep silence</I> (lest they make bad 
 worse), <I>and commit their cause to him that judgeth righteously.</I> 
 But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. When he was asked <I>whether he was the Christ,</I> he confessed, 
 and denied not, that <I>he was,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:61,62"><I>v.</I> 61, 62</A>.

 He asked, <I>Art thou the Son of the Blessed?</I> that is the Son of
 <I>God?</I> for, as Dr. Hammond observes, the Jews, when they named
 <I>God,</I> generally added, <I>blessed for ever;</I> and thence <I>the 
 Blessed</I> is the title of <I>God,</I> a peculiar title, and applied 
 to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:5">Rom. ix. 5</A>.

 And for the proof of his being the <I>Son of God,</I> he binds them
 over to his second coming; "<I>Ye shall see the Son of man sitting on 
 the right hand of power;</I> that <I>Son of man</I> that now appears so 
 mean and despicable, whom ye <I>see</I> and trample upon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2,3">Isa. liii. 2, 3</A>),

 you shall shortly see and <I>tremble before.</I>" Now, one would think 
 that such a word as this which our Lord Jesus seems to have spoken with 
 a grandeur and majesty not agreeable to his present appearance (for 
 through the thickest cloud of his humiliation some rays of glory were 
 still darted forth), should have startled the court, and at least, in 
 the opinion of some of them, should have amounted to a <I>demurrer,</I> 
 or <I>arrest of judgment,</I> and that they should have stayed process 
 till they had considered further of it; when Paul at the bar reasoned 
 of the <I>judgment to come,</I> the judge <I>trembled,</I> and 
 adjourned the trial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:25">Acts xxiv. 25</A>.

 But these chief priests were so miserably blinded with malice and rage,
 that, like the horse rushing into the battle, they <I>mocked at fear, 
 and were not affrighted,</I> neither <I>believed they that it was the 
 sound of the trumpet,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:22,24">Job xxxix. 22, 24</A>.
 
 And see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:25,26">Job xv. 25, 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The high priest, upon this confession of his, convicted him as a 
 <I>blasphemer</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:63"><I>v.</I> 63</A>);

 He <I>rent his clothes</I>--<B><I>chitonas autou</I></B>. Some think 
 the word signifies his pontifical vestments, which, for the greater 
 state, he had put on, though in the night, upon this occasion. As 
 before, in his enmity to Christ, he said he knew not what 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:51,52">John xi. 51, 52</A>),

 so now he did he knew not what. If Saul's rending Samuel's mantle was 
 made to signify the rending of the kingdom from him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:27,28">1 Sam. xv. 27, 28</A>),
 
 much more did Caiaphas's rending his own clothes signify the rending of 
 the priesthood from him, as the rending of the veil, at Christ's death, 
 signified the throwing of all open. Christ's clothes, even when he was 
 crucified, were kept entire, and not rent: for when the Levitical 
 priesthood was rent in pieces and done away, <I>This Man, because he 
 continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. They agreed that he was a blasphemer, and, as such, was guilty of 
 a capital crime, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:64"><I>v.</I> 64</A>.

 The question <I>seemed</I> to be put fairly, <I>What think ye?</I> But
 it was really <I>prejudged,</I> for the high priest had said, <I>Ye 
 have heard the blasphemy;</I> he gave judgment first, who, as president 
 of the court, ought to have voted last. So they <I>all condemned 
 him</I> to be <I>guilty of death;</I> what friends he had in the great 
 sanhedrim, did not appear, it is probable that they had not notice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. They set themselves to abuse him, and, as the Philistines with 
 Samson, to make sport with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:65"><I>v.</I> 65</A>.

 It should seem that some of the priests themselves that had condemned
 him, so far forgot the dignity, as well as duty, of their place, and 
 the gravity which became them, that they helped their servants in 
 playing the fool with a condemned prisoner. This they made their 
 diversion, while they <I>waited for the morning,</I> to complete their 
 villany. That <I>night of observations</I> (as the passover-night was 
 called) they <I>made a merry night of.</I> If they did not think it 
 below them to abuse Christ, shall we think any thing below us, by which 
 we may do him honour?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>66  And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of
 the maids of the high priest:
 &nbsp; 67  And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him,
 and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
 &nbsp; 68  But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what
 thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
 &nbsp; 69  And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that
 stood by, This is <I>one</I> of them.
 &nbsp; 70  And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood
 by said again to Peter, Surely thou art <I>one</I> of them: for thou
 art a Galil&aelig;an, and thy speech agreeth <I>thereto.</I>
 &nbsp; 71  But he began to curse and to swear, <I>saying,</I> I know not
 this man of whom ye speak.
 &nbsp; 72  And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind
 the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice,
 thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of Peter's denying Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It began in <I>keeping at a distance</I> from him. Peter had 
 followed <I>afar off</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+14:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>),

 and now was <I>beneath in the palace,</I> at the lower end of the hall. 
 Those that are <I>shy</I> of Christ, are in a fair way to <I>deny</I> 
 him, that are shy of attending on holy ordinances, shy of the communion 
 of the faithful, and loth to be seen on the side of despised 
 godliness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was occasioned by his associating with the high priest's 
 servants, and sitting among them. They that think it dangerous to be in 
 company with Christ's disciples, because thence they may be drawn in to 
 <I>suffer for him,</I> will find it much more dangerous to be in 
 company with his enemies, because there they may be drawn in to <I>sin 
 against him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The temptation was, his being charged as a disciple of Christ;
 <I>Thou also wert with Jesus of Nazareth,</I>

 It doth not appear that he was <I>challenged</I> upon it, or in danger 
 of being <I>prosecuted</I> as a criminal for it, but only 
 <I>bantered</I> upon it, and in danger of being ridiculed as a fool for 
 it. While the chief priests were abusing the Master, the servants were 
 abusing the disciples. Sometimes the cause of Christ seems to fall so 
 much on the losing side, that every body has a stone to throw at it, 
 and even the <I>abjects gather themselves together against</I> it. When 
 Job was on the dunghill, he was had in derision of those that were the 
 <I>children of base men,</I>

 Yet, all things considered, the temptation could not be called
 <I>formidable;</I> it was only a <I>maid</I> that casually cast her eye 
 upon him, and, for aught that appears, without design of giving him any 
 trouble, said, <I>Thou art one of them,</I> to which he needed not to 
 have made any reply, or might have said, "And if I be, I hope that is 
 no treason."</P>

 4. The sin was very great; he <I>denied Christ before men,</I> at a 
 time when he ought to have confessed and owned him, and to have 
 appeared in court a witness for him. Christ had often given notice to 
 his disciples of his own sufferings; yet, when they came, they were to 
 Peter as great a surprise and terror as if he had never heard of them 
 before. He had often told them that they must <I>suffer</I> for him, 
 must <I>take up their cross,</I> and follow him; and yet Peter is so 
 terribly afraid of suffering, upon the very first alarm of it, that he 
 will lie and swear, and do any thing, to avoid it. When Christ was 
 admired and flocked after, he could readily own him; but now that he is 
 deserted, and despised, and run down, he is ashamed of him, and will 
 own no relation to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. His repentance was very speedy. He repeated his denial thrice, and 
 the third was worst of all, for then he <I>cursed</I> and <I>swore,</I> 
 to confirm his denial; and that the third blow, which, one would think, 
 should have <I>stunned him,</I> and knocked him down, <I>startled 
 him,</I> and roused him up. Then the <I>cock crew</I> the second time, 
 which put him in mind of his Master's words, the warning he had given 
 him, with that particular circumstance of the <I>cock crowing 
 twice;</I> by recollecting that, he was made sensible of his sin and 
 the aggravations of it; and when he thought thereon, he wept. Some 
 observe that this evangelist, who wrote, as some have thought, by St.
 Peter's direction, speaks as fully of Peter's sin as any of them, but 
 more briefly of his <I>sorrow,</I> which Peter, in modesty, would not 
 have to be magnified, and because he thought he could never sorrow 
 enough for great a sin. His repentance here is thus expressed, 
 <B><I>epibalon eklaie</I></B>, where something must be supplied. He 
 <I>added to weep,</I> so some; making it a Hebraism; he wept, and the 
 more he thought of it, the more he wept; he continued weeping; he 
 <I>flung out,</I> and wept; <I>burst out</I> into tears; <I>threw 
 himself down,</I> and wept; he <I>covered his face,</I> and wept, so 
 some; cast his garment about his head, that he might not be seen to 
 weep; he <I>cast his eyes</I> upon his Master, who turned, and looked 
 upon him; so Dr. Hammond supplies it, and it is a probable conjecture. 
 Or, as we understand it, <I>fixing his mind upon it,</I> he wept. It is 
 not a transient thought of that which is humbling, that will suffice, 
 but we must dwell upon it. Or, what if this word should mean his 
 <I>laying a load</I> upon himself, throwing a confusion into his own 
 face? he did as the <I>publican</I> that smote his breast, in sorrow 
 for sin; and this amounts to his weeping bitterly.</P>
