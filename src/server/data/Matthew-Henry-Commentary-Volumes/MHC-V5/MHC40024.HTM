 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ's preaching was mostly practical; but, in this chapter, we have 
 a prophetical discourse, a prediction of things to come; such however 
 as had a practical tendency, and was intended, not to gratify the 
 curiosity of his disciples, but to guide their consciences and 
 conversations, and it is therefore concluded with a practical 
 application. The church has always had particular prophecies, besides 
 general promises, both for direction and for encouragement to 
 believers; but it is observable, Christ preached this prophetical 
 sermon in the close of his ministry, as the Apocalypse is the last book 
 of the New Testament, and the prophetical books of the Old Testament 
 are placed last, to intimate to us, that we must be well grounded in 
 plain truths and duties, and those must first be well digested, before 
 we dive into those things that are dark and difficult; many run 
 themselves into confusion by beginning their Bible at the wrong end. 
 Now, in this chapter, we have, 

 I. The occasion of this discourse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The discourse itself, in which we have, 

 1. The prophecy of divers events, especially referring to the 
 destruction of Jerusalem, and the utter ruin of the Jewish church and 
 nation, which were not hastening on, and were completed about forty 
 years after; the prefaces to that destruction, the concomitants and 
 consequences of it; yet looking further, to Christ's coming at the end 
 of time, and the consummation of all things, of which that was a type 
 and figure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:4-31">ver. 4-31</A>.

 2. The practical application of this prophecy for the awakening and 
 quickening of his disciples to prepare for these great and awful things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:32-51">ver. 32-51</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his
 disciples came to <I>him</I> for to show him the buildings of the
 temple.
 &nbsp; 2  And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily
 I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon
 another, that shall not be thrown down.
 &nbsp; 3  And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came
 unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be?
 and what <I>shall be</I> the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the
 world?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's quitting <I>the temple,</I> and his public work there. He 
 had said, in the close of the foregoing chapter, <I>Your house is left 
 unto you desolate;</I> and here he made his words good; <I>He went out, 
 and departed from the temple.</I> The manner of expression is 
 observable; he not only went out of the temple, but departed from it, 
 took his final farewell of it; he departed from it, never to return to 
 it any more; and then immediately follows a prediction of its ruin. 
 Note, That house is left desolate indeed, which Christ leaves. <I>Woe 
 unto them when I depart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:12,Jer+6:8">Hos. ix. 12; Jer. vi. 8</A>.

 It was now time to groan out their <I>Ichabod, The glory is departed,
 their defence is departed.</I> Three days after this, the veil of the 
 temple was rent; when Christ left it, all became <I>common and 
 unclean;</I> but Christ departed not till they drove him away; did not 
 reject them, till they first rejected him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His private discourse with his disciples; he left the temple, but 
 he did not leave the twelve, who were the seed of the gospel church, 
 which the casting off of the Jews was the enriching of. When he left 
 the temple, his disciples left it too, and came to him. Note, It is 
 good being where Christ is, and leaving that which he leaves. They came 
 to him, to be instructed in private, when his public preaching was 
 over; for <I>the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him.</I> He 
 had spoken of the destruction of the Jewish church to the multitude in 
 parables, which here, as usual, he explains to his disciples.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>His disciples came to him, to show him the buildings of the 
 temple,</I> It was a stately and beautiful structure, one of the 
 wonders of the world; no cost was spared, no art left untried, to make 
 it sumptuous. Though it came short of Solomon's temple, and <I>its 
 beginning was small,</I> yet <I>its latter end did greatly 
 increase.</I> It was richly furnished with gifts and offerings, to 
 which there were continual additions made. They showed Christ these 
 things, and desired him to take notice of them, either,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As being greatly pleased with them themselves, and expecting he 
 should be so too. They had lived mostly in Galilee, at a distance from 
 the temple, had seldom seen it, and therefore were the more struck with 
 admiration at it, and thought he should admire as much as they did 
 <I>all this glory</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:1">Gen. xxxi. 1</A>);

 and they would have him divert himself (after his preaching, and from
 his sorrow which they saw him perhaps almost overwhelmed with) with
 looking about him. Note, Even good men are apt to be too much enamoured 
 with outward pomp and gaiety, and to overvalue it, even in the things 
 of God; whereas we should be, as Christ was, dead to it, and look upon 
 it with contempt. The temple was indeed glorious, but, 

 [1.] Its glory was sullied and stained with the sin of the priests and 
 people; that wicked doctrine of the Pharisees, which preferred the gold 
 before the temple that sanctified it, was enough to deface the beauty 
 of all the ornaments of the temple.

 [2.] Its glory was eclipsed and outdone by the presence of Christ in 
 it, who was <I>the glory of this latter house</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:9">Hag. ii. 9</A>),

 so that the buildings had no glory, in comparison with that glory which
 excelled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Or, 

 (2.) As grieving that this house should be left desolate; they showed
 him the buildings, as if they would move him to reverse the sentence;
 "Lord, let not this holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised
 thee, be made a desolation." They forgot how many providences,
 concerning Solomon's temple, had manifested how little God cared for
 that outward glory which they had so much admired, when the people were
 wicked, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+7:21">2 Chron. vii. 21</A>.

 <I>This house, which is high,</I> sin will bring low. Christ had lately
 looked upon <I>the precious souls, and wept for them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:41">Luke xix. 41</A>.
 
 The disciples look upon the pompous buildings, and are ready to weep
 for them. In this, as in other things, <I>his thoughts are not like 
 ours.</I> It was weakness, and meanness of spirit, in the disciples, to 
 be so fond of fine buildings; it was a childish thing. <I>Animo magno 
 nihil magnum--To a great mind nothing is great.</I> Seneca.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ, hereupon, foretels the utter ruin and destruction that were 
 coming upon this place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Note, A believing foresight of the defacing of all worldly glory will 
 help to take us off from admiring it, and overvaluing it. The most 
 beautiful body will be shortly worms' meat, and the most beautiful 
 building a ruinous heap. And shall we then set our eyes upon that which 
 so soon is not, and look upon that with so much admiration which ere 
 long we shall certainly look upon with so much contempt? <I>See ye not 
 all these things?</I> They would have Christ look upon them, and be as 
 much in love with them as they were; he would have them look upon them, 
 and be as dead to them as he was. There is such a sight of these
 things as will do us good; so to see them as to see through them and 
 see to the end of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ, instead of reversing the decree, ratifies it; <I>Verily, I say 
 unto you, there shall not be left one stone upon another.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He speaks of it as a certain ruin; "<I>I say unto you. I,</I> that 
 know what I say, and know how to make good what I say; take my word for 
 it, it shall be so; <I>I, the Amen, the true Witness, say it to 
 you.</I>" All judgment being committed to the Son, the threatenings, as 
 well as the promises, are all <I>yea, and amen, in him.</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:17,18">Heb. vi. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He speaks of it as an utter ruin. The temple shall not only be 
 stripped, and plundered, and defaced, but utterly demolished and laid 
 waste; <I>Not one stone shall be left upon another.</I> Notice is 
 taken, in the <I>building</I> of the second temple, of the <I>laying of 
 one stone upon another</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:15">Hag. ii. 15</A>);

 and here, in the <I>ruin,</I> of <I>not leaving one stone upon
 another.</I> History tells us, that this was fulfilled in the latter; 
 for though Titus, when he took the city, did all he could to preserve 
 the temple, yet he could not restrain the enraged soldiers from 
 destroying it utterly; and it was done to that degree, that Turnus 
 Rufus ploughed up the ground on which it had stood: thus that scripture 
 was fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:12">Mic. iii. 12</A>),

 <I>Zion shall, for your sake, be ploughed as a field.</I> And
 afterward, in Julian the Apostate's time, when the Jews were encouraged 
 by him to rebuild their temple, in opposition to the Christian 
 religion, what remained of the ruins was quite pulled down, to level 
 the ground for a new foundation; but the attempt was defeated by the 
 miraculous eruption of fire out of the ground, which destroyed the 
 foundation they laid, and frightened away the builders. Now this 
 prediction of the final and irreparable ruin of the temple includes a 
 prediction of the period of the Levitical priesthood and the ceremonial 
 law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The disciples, not disputing either the truth or the equity of this 
 sentence, nor doubting of the accomplishment of it, enquire more 
 particularly of the time when it should come to pass, and the signs of 
 its approach, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Where they made this enquiry; privately, <I>as he sat upon the 
 mount of Olives;</I> probably, he was returning to Bethany, and there 
 sat down by the way, to rest him; the mount of Olives directly faced 
 the temple, and from thence he might have a full prospect of it at some 
 distance; there he sat as a Judge upon the bench, the temple and city 
 being before him as at the bar, and thus he passed sentence on them. We 
 read 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+11:23">Ezek. xi. 23</A>)

 of the removing of the glory of the Lord from the temple to the
 mountain; so Christ, the great Shechinah, here removes to this 
 mountain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What the enquiry itself was; <I>When shall these things be; and 
 what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?</I> 
 Here are three questions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Some think, these questions do all point at one and the same 
 thing--the destruction of the temple, and the period of the Jewish 
 church and nation, which Christ had himself spoken of as his coming 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:28"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 28</A>),

 and which would be the consummation of the age (for so it may be read),
 the finishing of that dispensation. Or, they thought the destruction of 
 the temple must needs be the end of the world. If that house be laid 
 waste, the world cannot stand; for the Rabbin used to say that the 
 house of the sanctuary was one of the seven things for the sake of 
 which the world was made; and they think, if so, the world will not 
 survive the temple.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Others think their question, <I>When shall these things be?</I> 
 refers to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the other two to the end of 
 the world; or Christ's coming may refer to his setting up his gospel 
 kingdom, and the end of the world to the day of judgment. I rather 
 incline to think that their question looked no further than the event 
 Christ now foretold; but it appears by other passages, that they had 
 very confused thoughts of future events; so that perhaps it is not 
 possible to put any certain construction upon this question of 
 theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But Christ, in his answer, though he does not expressly rectify the 
 mistakes of his disciples (that must be done by the pouring out of the 
 Spirit), yet looks further than their question, and instructs his 
 church, not only concerning the great events of that age, the 
 destruction of Jerusalem, but concerning his second coming at the end 
 of time, which here he insensibly slides into a discourse of, and of 
 that it is plain he speaks in the next chapter, which is a continuation 
 of this sermon.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man
 deceive you.
 &nbsp; 5  For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and
 shall deceive many.
 &nbsp; 6  And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be
 not troubled: for all <I>these things</I> must come to pass, but the
 end is not yet.
 &nbsp; 7  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
 kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and
 earthquakes, in divers places.
 &nbsp; 8  All these <I>are</I> the beginning of sorrows.
 &nbsp; 9  Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall
 kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's
 sake.
 &nbsp; 10  And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one
 another, and shall hate one another.
 &nbsp; 11  And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
 &nbsp; 12  And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall
 wax cold.
 &nbsp; 13  But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be
 saved.
 &nbsp; 14  And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
 world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
 come.
 &nbsp; 15  When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
 spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso
 readeth, let him understand:)
 &nbsp; 16  Then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains:
 &nbsp; 17  Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any
 thing out of his house:
 &nbsp; 18  Neither let him which is in the field return back to take
 his clothes.
 &nbsp; 19  And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
 suck in those days!
 &nbsp; 20  But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither
 on the sabbath day:
 &nbsp; 21  For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since
 the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
 &nbsp; 22  And except those days should be shortened, there should no
 flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be
 shortened.
 &nbsp; 23  Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here <I>is</I> Christ, or
 there; believe <I>it</I> not.
 &nbsp; 24  For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and
 shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if <I>it were</I>
 possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
 &nbsp; 25  Behold, I have told you before.
 &nbsp; 26  Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the
 desert; go not forth: behold, <I>he is</I> in the secret chambers;
 believe <I>it</I> not.
 &nbsp; 27  For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth
 even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man
 be.
 &nbsp; 28  For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be
 gathered together.
 &nbsp; 29  Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the
 sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the
 stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall
 be shaken:
 &nbsp; 30  And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven:
 and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall
 see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and
 great glory.
 &nbsp; 31  And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a
 trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four
 winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The disciples had asked concerning the times, <I>When shall these 
 things be?</I> Christ gives them no answer to that, after what number 
 of days and years his prediction should be accomplished, for <I>it is 
 not for us to know the times</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:7">Acts i. 7</A>);

 but they had asked, <I>What shall be the sign?</I> That question he
 answers fully, for we are concerned to <I>understand the signs of the 
 times,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:3"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 3</A>.

 Now the prophecy primarily respects the events near at hand--the
 destruction of Jerusalem, the period of the Jewish church and state, 
 the calling of the Gentiles, and the setting up of Christ's kingdom in 
 the world; but as the prophecies of the Old Testament, which have an 
 immediate reference to the affairs of the Jews and the revolutions of 
 their state, under the figure of them do certainly look further, to the 
 gospel church and the kingdom of the Messiah, and are so expounded in 
 the New Testament, and such expressions are found in those predictions 
 as are peculiar thereto and not applicable otherwise; so this prophecy, 
 under the type of Jerusalem's destruction, looks as far forward as the 
 general judgment; and, as is usual in prophecies, some passages are 
 most applicable to the type, and others to the antitype; and toward the 
 close, as usual, it points more particularly to the latter. It is 
 observable, that what Christ here saith to his disciples tends more to 
 engage their caution than to satisfy their curiosity; more to prepare 
 them for the events that should happen than to give them a distinct 
 idea of the events themselves. This is that good understanding of the 
 time which we should all covet, thence to infer what Israel ought to 
 do: and so this prophecy is of standing lasting use to the church, and 
 will be so to the end of time; for <I>the thing that hath been, is that 
 which shall be</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:5,6,7,9">Eccl. i. 5, 6, 7, 9</A>),

 and the series, connection, and presages, of events, are much the same
 still that they were then; so that upon the prophecy of this chapter, 
 pointing at that event, moral prognostications may be made, and such 
 constructions of the signs of the times as the wise man's heart will 
 know how to improve.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ here foretels the going forth of deceivers; he begins with a 
 caution, <I>Take heed that no man deceive you.</I> They expected to be 
 told when these things should be, to be let into that secret; but this 
 caution is a check to their curiosity, "<I>What is that to you?</I> 
 Mind you your duty, follow me, and be not seduced from following me." 
 Those that are most inquisitive concerning the secret things which 
 belong not to them are most easily imposed upon by seducers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:3">2 Thess. ii. 3</A>.
 
 The disciples, when they heard that the Jews, their most inveterate
 enemies, should be destroyed, might be in danger of falling into 
 security; "Nay," saith Christ, "you are more exposed other ways." 
 Seducers are more dangerous enemies to the church than persecutors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three times in this discourse he mentions the appearing of <I>false 
 prophets,</I> which was, 

 1. A presage of Jerusalem's ruin. Justly were they who killed the true
 prophets, left to be ensnared by false prophets; and they who crucified 
 the true Messiah, left to be deceived and broken by false Christs and 
 pretended Messiahs. The appearing of these was the occasion of dividing 
 that people into parties and factions, which made their ruin the more 
 easy and speedy; and the sin of the many that were led aside by them, 
 helped to fill the measure. 

 2. It was a trial to the disciples of Christ, and therefore agreeable
 to their state of probation, <I>that they which are perfect, may be 
 made manifest.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now concerning these deceivers, observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The pretences they should come under. Satan acts most 
 mischievously, when he appears as an angel of light: the colour of the 
 greatest good is often the cover of the greatest evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] There should appear <I>false prophets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:11-24"><I>v.</I> 11-24</A>);

 the deceivers would pretend to divine inspiration, an immediate
 mission, and a spirit of prophecy, when it was all a lie. Such they had 
 been formerly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:16,Eze+13:6">Jer. xxiii. 16; Ezek. xiii. 6</A>),
 
 as was foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:3">Deut. xiii. 3</A>.

 Some think, the seducers here pointed to were such as had been settled
 teachers in the church, and had gained reputation as such, but 
 afterward betrayed the truth they had taught, and revolted to error; 
 and from such the danger is the greater, because least suspected. One 
 false traitor in the garrison may do more mischief than a thousand 
 avowed enemies without.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] There should appear <I>false Christs, coming in Christ's name</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 assuming to themselves the name peculiar to him, and saying, <I>I am
 Christ, pseudo-christs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 There was at that time a general expectation of the appearing of the 
 Messiah; they spoke of him; as <I>he that should come;</I> but when he 
 did come, the body of the nation rejected him; which those who were 
 ambitious of making themselves a name, took advantage of, and set up 
 for Christ. Josephus speaks of several such impostors between this and 
 the destruction of Jerusalem; one Theudas, that was defeated by Cospius 
 Fadus; another by Felix, another by Festus. Dosetheus said he was the 
 Christ foretold by Moses. <I>Origen adversus Celsum.</I> See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:36,37">Acts v. 36, 37</A>.

 Simon Magus pretended to be <I>the great power of God,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:10">Acts viii. 10</A>.

 In after-ages there have been such pretenders; one about a hundred
 years after Christ, that called himself <I>Bar-cochobas--The son of a 
 star,</I> but proved <I>Bar-cosba--The son of a lie.</I> About fifty 
 years ago Sabbati-Levi set up for a Messiah in the Turkish empire, and 
 was greatly caressed by the Jews; but in a short time <I>his folly was 
 made manifest.</I> See Sir Paul Rycaut's <I>History.</I> The popish 
 religion doth, in effect, set up a false Christ; the Pope comes, in 
 Christ's name, as his vicar, but invades and usurps all his offices, 
 and so is a rival with him, and, as such, an enemy to him, a deceiver, 
 and an antichrist.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] These false Christs and false prophets would have their agents and 
 emissaries busy in all places to draw people in to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 <I>Then</I> when public troubles are great and threatening, and people 
 will be catching at any thing that looks like deliverance, then Satan 
 will take the advantage of imposing on them; they will say, <I>Lo, here 
 is a Christ, or there</I> is one; but do not mind them: the true Christ 
 did not strive, nor cry; nor was it said of him, <I>Lo, here! or Lo, 
 there!</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:21">Luke xvii. 21</A>),

 therefore if any man say so concerning him, look upon it as a
 temptation. The hermits, who place religion in a monastical life, say, 
 <I>He is in the desert;</I> the priests, who made the consecrated wafer 
 to be Christ, say, "He is <B><I>en tois tameiois</I></B>--<I>in the 
 cupboards, in the secret chambers:</I> lo, he is in this shrine, in 
 that image." Thus some appropriate Christ's spiritual presence to one 
 party or persuasion, as if they had the monopoly of Christ and 
 Christianity; and the kingdom of Christ must stand and fall, must live 
 and die, with them; "Lo, he is in this church, in that council:" 
 whereas Christ is All in all, not here or there, but meets his people 
 with a blessing <I>in every place where he records his name.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The proof they should offer for the making good of these 
 pretences; <I>They shall show great signs and wonders</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 not true miracles, those are a divine seal, and with those the doctrine
 of Christ stands confirmed; and therefore if any offer to draw us from 
 that by signs and wonders, we must have recourse to that rule given of 
 old

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:1-3">Deut. xiii. 1-3</A>),

 <I>If the sign or wonder come to pass,</I> yet follow not him that
 would draw you <I>to serve other gods,</I> or believe in other Christs, 
 <I>for the Lord your God proveth you.</I> But these were <I>lying 
 wonders</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:9">2 Thess. ii. 9</A>),

 wrought by Satan (God permitting him), who is <I>the prince of the
 power of the air.</I> It is not said, <I>They shall work miracles,</I> 
 but, <I>They shall show great signs;</I> they are but a show; either 
 they impose upon men's credulity by false narratives, or deceive their 
 senses by tricks of legerdemain, or arts of divination, as the 
 magicians of Egypt by their enchantments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The success they should have in these attempts,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>They shall deceive many</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Note, The devil and his instruments may prevail far in deceiving poor 
 souls; few find the strait gate, but many are drawn into the broad way; 
 many will be imposed upon by their signs and wonders, and many drawn in 
 by the hopes of deliverance from their oppressions. Note, Neither 
 miracles nor multitudes are certain signs of a true church; for <I>all 
 the world wonders after the beast,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:3">Rev. xiii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>They shall deceive, if it were possible, the very elect,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 This bespeaks, <I>First,</I> The strength of the delusion; it is such 
 as many shall be carried away by (so strong shall the stream be), even 
 those that were thought to stand fast. Men's knowledge, gifts, 
 learning, eminent station, and long profession, will not secure them; 
 but, notwithstanding these, many will be deceived; nothing but the 
 almighty grace of God, pursuant to his eternal purpose, will be a 
 protection. <I>Secondly,</I> The safety of the elect in the midst of 
 this danger, which is taken for granted in that parenthesis, <I>If it 
 were possible,</I> plainly implying that it is not possible, for they 
 are <I>kept by the power of God,</I> that <I>the purpose of God, 
 according to the election, may stand.</I> It is possible for those that 
 have been enlightened to fall away

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:4,5,6">Heb. vi. 4, 5, 6</A>),

 but not for those that were elected. If God's chosen ones should be
 deceived, God's choice would be defeated, which is not to be imagined, 
 <I>for whom he did predestinate, he called, justified, and 
 glorified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:30">Rom. viii. 30</A>.

 They were given to Christ; and of all that were given to him, he will
 lose none, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:28">John x. 28</A>.

 Grotius will have this to be meant of the great difficulty of drawing
 the primitive Christians from their religion, and quotes it as used 
 proverbially by Galen; when he would express a thing very difficult and 
 morally impossible, he saith, "You may sooner draw away a Christian 
 from Christ."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The repeated cautions which our Saviour gives to his disciples to 
 stand upon their guard against them; <I>therefore</I> he gave them 
 warning, that they might watch 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:25">
 <I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 <I>Behold, I have told you before.</I> He that is told before where he
 will be assaulted, may save himself, as the king of Israel did, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:9,10">2 Kings vi. 9, 10</A>.

 Note, Christ's warnings are designed to engage our watchfulness; and
 though the elect shall be preserved from delusion, yet they shall be 
 preserved by the use of appointed means, and a due regard to the 
 cautions of the word; we are kept through faith, faith in Christ's 
 word, which he has told us before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] We must not believe those who say, <I>Lo, here is Christ;</I> or, 
 <I>Lo, he is there,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 We believe that the true Christ is at the right hand of God, and that 
 his spiritual presence is <I>where two or three are gathered together 
 in his name;</I> believe not those therefore who would draw you off 
 from a Christ in heaven, by telling you he is any where on earth; or 
 draw you off from the catholic church on earth, by telling you he is 
 here, or he is there; believe it not. Note, There is not a greater
 enemy to true faith than vain credulity. The simple believeth every
 word, and runs after every cry. <B><I>Memneso
 apistein</I></B>--<I>Beware of believing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] We must not go forth after those that say, <I>He is in the 
 desert,</I> or, <I>He is in the secret chambers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 We must not hearken to every empiric and pretender, nor follow every 
 one that puts up the finger to point us to a new Christ, and a new 
 gospel; "Go not forth, for if you do, you are in danger of being taken 
 by them; therefore keep out of harm's way, <I>be not carried about with 
 every wind;</I> many a man's vain curiosity to go forth hath led him 
 into a fatal apostasy; your strength at such a time is to sit still, to 
 have the heart established with grace."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He foretels wars and great commotions among the nations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.
 
 When Christ was born, there was a universal peace in the empire, the 
 temple of Janus was shut; but <I>think not that Christ came to 
 send,</I> or continue such a <I>peace</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:51">Luke xii. 51</A>);

 no, his city and his wall are to be built even in troublesome times,
 and even wars shall forward his work. From the time that the Jews 
 rejected Christ, and he <I>left their house desolate, the sword did 
 never depart from their house, the sword of the Lord</I> was never 
 quiet, because he had given it a charge against a hypocritical nation 
 and the people of his wrath, and by it brought ruin upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A prediction of the event of the day; You will now shortly <I>hear
 of wars, and rumours of wars.</I> When wars are, they will be heard; 
 for <I>every battle of the warrior is with confused noise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:5">Isa. ix. 5</A>.
 
 See how terrible it is

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:19">Jer. iv. 19</A>),

 <I>Thou hast heard, O my soul, the alarm of war!</I> Even the quiet in
 the land, and the least inquisitive after new things, cannot but hear 
 the rumours of war. See what comes of refusing the gospel! Those that 
 will not hear the messengers of peace, shall be made to hear the 
 messengers of war. God has a sword ready to avenge the quarrel of his 
 covenant, his new covenant. <I>Nation shall rise up against nation,</I> 
 that is, one part or province of the Jewish nation against another, one 
 city against another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:5,6">2 Chron. xv. 5, 6</A>);

 and in the same province and city one party or faction shall rise up
 against another, so that they shall be devoured by, and dashed in
 pieces against one another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:19-21">Isa. ix. 19-21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A prescription of the duty of the day; <I>See that ye be not 
 troubled.</I> Is it possible to hear such sad news, and not be 
 troubled? Yet, where the heart is fixed, trusting in God, it is kept in 
 peace, and is not afraid, no not of the evil tidings of wars, and 
 rumours of wars; no not the noise of <I>Arm, arm. Be not troubled;</I> 
 <B><I>Me throeithe</I></B>--<I>Be not put into confusion or 
 commotion;</I> not put into throes, as a woman with child by a fright; 
 <I>see that ye be not</I> <B><I>orate</I></B>. Note, There is need of 
 constant care and watchfulness to keep trouble from the heart when 
 there are wars abroad; and it is against the mind of Christ, that his 
 people should have troubled hearts even in troublous times.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We must not be troubled, for two reasons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Because we are bid to expect this: the Jews must be punished, ruin 
 must be brought upon them; by this the justice of God and the honour of 
 the Redeemer must be asserted; and therefore <I>all those things must 
 come to pass;</I> the word is gone out of God's mouth, and it shall be 
 accomplished in its season. Note, The consideration of the 
 unchangeableness of the divine counsels, which govern all events, 
 should compose and quiet our spirits, whatever happens. God is but 
 performing the thing that is appointed for us, and our inordinate 
 trouble is an interpretative quarrel with that appointment. Let us 
 therefore acquiesce, because <I>these things must come to pass;</I> not 
 only <I>necessitate decreti--as the product of the divine counsel,</I> 
 but <I>necessitate medii--as a means in order to a further end.</I> The 
 old house must be taken down (though it cannot be done without noise, 
 and dust, and danger), ere the new fabric can be erected: the things 
 that are shaken (and ill shaken they were) <I>must be removed, that the
 things which cannot be shaken may remain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:27">Heb. xii. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Because we are still to expect worse; <I>The end is not yet;</I>
 the end of time is not, and, while time lasts, we must expect trouble, 
 and that the end of one affliction will be but the beginning of 
 another; or, "The end of these troubles is not yet; there must be more 
 judgments that one made use of to bring down the Jewish power; more 
 vials of wrath must yet be poured out; there is but one woe past, more 
 woes are yet to come, more arrows are yet to be spent upon them out of 
 God's quiver; therefore be not troubled, do not give way to fear and 
 trouble, sink not under the present burthen, but rather gather in all 
 the strength and spirit you have, to encounter what is yet before you. 
 Be not troubled to hear of wars and rumours of wars; for then what will 
 become of you when the famines and pestilences come?" If it be to us a 
 vexation but to <I>understand the report</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:19">Isa. xxviii. 19</A>),

 what will it be to feel the stroke when it <I>toucheth the bone and the
 flesh?</I> If running with the footmen weary us, how shall we contend
 with horses? And if we be frightened at a little brook in our way,
 <I>what shall we do in the swellings of Jordan?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:5">Jer. xii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He foretels other judgments more immediately sent of 
 God--<I>famines, pestilences, and earthquakes.</I> Famine is often the 
 effect of war, and pestilence of famine. These were the three judgments 
 which David was to choose one out of; and he was in a great strait, for 
 he knew not which was the worst: but what dreadful desolations will 
 they make, when they all pour in together upon a people! Beside war 
 (and that is enough), there shall be,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Famine,</I> signified by the <I>black horse</I> under the 
 <I>third seal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:5,6">Rev. vi. 5, 6</A>.

 We read of a famine in Judea, not long after Christ's time, which was
 very impoverishing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:28">Acts xi. 28</A>);

 but the sorest famine was in Jerusalem during the siege. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:9,10">Lam. iv. 9, 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>Pestilences,</I> signified by the <I>pale horse, and death upon 
 him,</I> and <I>the grave at his heels,</I> under the <I>fourth 
 seal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:7,8">Rev. vi. 7, 8</A>.

 This destroys without distinction, and in a little time lays heaps upon 
 heaps.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>Earthquakes in divers places,</I> or from place to place, 
 pursuing those that flee from them, as they did from the earthquake 
 <I>in the days of Uzziah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:5">Zech. xiv. 5</A>.

 Great desolations have sometimes been made by earthquakes, of late and
 formerly; they have been the death of many, and the terror of more. In 
 the apocalyptic visions, it is observable, that earthquakes bode good, 
 and no evil, to the church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:12">Rev. vi. 12</A>.
 
 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:15,11:12,13,19,16:17-19">Rev. vi. 15; 
 xi. 12, 13, 19; xvi. 17-19</A>.

 When God <I>shakes terribly the earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:21">Isa. ii. 21</A>),

 it is to <I>shake the wicked out of it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:13">Job xxxviii. 13</A>),
 
 and to introduce <I>the desire of all nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:6,7">Hag. ii. 6, 7</A>.

 But here they are spoken of as dreadful judgments, and yet but <I>the
 beginning of sorrows,</I> <B><I>odinon</I></B>--<I>of travailing
 pains,</I> quick, violent, yet tedious too. Note, When God judgeth, he
 will overcome; <I>when he begins</I> in wrath, <I>he will make</I> a
 full <I>end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:12">1 Sam. iii. 12</A>.

 When we look forward to the eternity of misery that is before the
 obstinate refusers of Christ and his gospel, we may truly say, 
 concerning the greatest temporal judgments, "They are but the beginning 
 of sorrows; bad as things are with them, there are worse behind."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He foretels the persecution of his own people and ministers, and a 
 general apostasy and decay in religion thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:9,10,12"><I>v.</I> 9, 10, 12</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The <I>cross</I> itself foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, Of all future events we are as much concerned, though commonly as 
 little desirous, to know of our own sufferings as of any thing else. 
 <I>Then,</I> when famines and pestilences prevail, then they shall 
 impute them to the Christians, and make that a pretence for persecuting 
 them; <I>Christianos ad leones--Away with Christians to the lions.</I> 
 Christ had told his disciples, when he first sent them out, what hard 
 things they should suffer; but they had hitherto experienced little of 
 it, and therefore he reminds them again, that the less they had 
 suffered, the more there was behind to be filled up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:24">Col. i. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They shall be <I>afflicted</I> with bonds and imprisonments, 
 <I>cruel mockings and scourgings,</I> as blessed Paul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:23-25">2 Cor. xi. 23-25</A>);

 not killed outright, but <I>killed all the day long, in deaths 
 often,</I> killed so as to feel themselves die, <I>made a spectacle to
 the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:9,11">1 Cor. iv. 9, 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They shall be <I>killed;</I> so cruel are the church's enemies, 
 that nothing less will satisfy them than the blood of the saints, which 
 they thirst after, suck, and shed, like water.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They shall be <I>hated of all nations for Christ's name's 
 sake,</I> as he had told them before, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:22"><I>ch.</I> x. 22</A>.

 The world was generally leavened with enmity and malignity to
 Christians: the Jews, though spiteful to the Heathen, were never 
 persecuted by them as the Christians were; they were hated by the Jews 
 that were dispersed among the nations, were the common butt of the 
 world's malice. What shall we think of this world, when the best men 
 had the worst usage in it? It is the cause that makes the martyr, and 
 comforts him; it was for Christ's sake that they were thus hated; their 
 professing and preaching his name incensed the nations so much against 
 them; the devil, finding a fatal shock thereby given to his kingdom, 
 and that his time was likely to be short, <I>came down, having great 
 wrath.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>The offence of the cross,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>.

 Satan thus carries on his interest by force of arms, though Christ, at 
 length, will bring glory to himself out of the sufferings of his people 
 and ministers. Three ill effects of persecution are here foretold.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>apostasy</I> of some. When the profession of Christianity 
 begins to cost men dear, <I>then shall many be offended,</I> shall 
 first fall out with, and then fall off from, their profession; they 
 will begin to pick quarrels with their religion, sit loose to it, grow 
 weary of it, and at length revolt from it. Note, 

 [1.] It is no new thing (though it is a strange thing) for those that 
 have known the way of righteousness, to turn aside out of it. Paul 
 often complains of deserters, who began well, but something hindered 
 them. They were with us, but went out from us, because never truly of 
 us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:19">1 John ii. 19</A>.

 We are told of it before.

 [2.] Suffering times are shaking times; and those fall in the storm,
 that stood in fair weather, like the <I>stony ground hearers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:21"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 21</A>.

 Many will follow Christ in the sunshine, who will shift for themselves,
 and leave him to do so to, in the cloudy dark day. They like their 
 religion while they can have it cheap, and sleep with it in a whole 
 skin; but, if their profession cost them any thing, they quit it 
 presently.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>malignity</I> of others. When persecution is in fashion, 
 envy, enmity, and malice, are strangely diffused into the minds of men 
 by contagion: and charity, tenderness, and moderation, are looked upon 
 as singularities, which make a man like a speckled bird. Then <I>they 
 shall betray one another,</I> that is,"Those that have treacherously 
 deserted their religion, shall hate and betray those who adhere to it, 
 for whom they have pretended friendship." Apostates have commonly been 
 the most bitter and violent persecutors. Note, Persecuting times are 
 discovering times. Wolves in sheep's clothing will then throw off their 
 disguise, and appear wolves: they shall <I>betray one another, and hate 
 one another.</I> The times must needs be perilous, when treachery and 
 hatred, two of the worst things that can be, because directly contrary 
 to two of the best (truth and love), shall have the ascendant. This 
 seems to refer to the barbarous treatment which the several contending 
 factions among the Jews gave to one another; and justly were they who 
 ate up God's people as they ate bread, left thus to bite and devour one 
 another till they were <I>consumed one of another;</I> or, it may refer 
 to the mischiefs done to Christ's disciples by those that were nearest 
 to them, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:21"><I>ch.</I> x. 21</A>.

 <I>The brother shall deliver up the brother to death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The general <I>declining</I> and <I>cooling</I> of most, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 In seducing times, when false prophets arise, in persecuting times, 
 when the saints are hated, expect these two things,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The <I>abounding</I> of iniquity; though the world always lies in 
 wickedness, yet there are some times in which it may be said, that 
 <I>iniquity doth</I> in a special manner abound; as when it is more 
 extensive than ordinary, as in the old world, when <I>all flesh had 
 corrupted their way;</I> and when it is more <I>excessive</I> than 
 ordinary, when <I>violence is risen up to a rod of wickedness</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:11">Ezek. vii. 11</A>),

 so that hell seems to be broke loose in blasphemies against God, and
 enmities to the saints.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The <I>abating</I> of love; this is the consequence of the former; 
 <I>Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</I> 
 Understand it in general of true serious godliness, which is all summed 
 up in <I>love;</I> it is too common for professors of religion to grow 
 cool in their profession, when the wicked are hot in their wickedness; 
 as the church of Ephesus in bad times <I>left her first love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:2-4">Rev. ii. 2-4</A>.

 Or, it may be understood more particularly of brotherly love. When
 iniquity abounds, seducing iniquity, persecuting iniquity, this grace 
 commonly waxes cold. Christians begin to be shy and suspicious one of 
 another, affections are alienated, distances created, parties made, and 
 so love comes to nothing. The devil is the accuser of the brethren, not 
 only to their enemies, which makes persecuting iniquity abound, but one 
 to another, which makes the love of many to wax cold.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This gives a melancholy prospect of the times, that there shall be such 
 a great decay of love; but, <I>First,</I> It is of the love of 
 <I>many,</I> not of <I>all.</I> In the worst of times, God has his 
 remnant that hold fast their integrity, and retain their zeal, as in 
 Elijah's days, when he thought himself left alone. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 This love is grown cold, but not dead; it abates, but is not quite cast 
 off. There is life in the root, which will show itself when the winter 
 is past. The new nature may <I>wax cold,</I> but shall not <I>wax 
 old,</I> for then it would decay and vanish away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Comfort administered in reference to this offence of the cross, for 
 the support of the Lord's people under it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 <I>He that endures to the end, shall be saved.</I>

 (1.) It is comfortable to those who wish well to the cause of Christ in
 general, that, though many are offended, yet some shall endure to the
 end. When we see so many drawing back, we are ready to fear that the
 cause of Christ will sink for want of supporters, and his name be left
 and forgotten for want of some to make profession of it; but even at
 this time there is <I>a remnant according to the election of grace,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:5">Rom. xi. 5</A>.

 It is spoken of the same time that this prophecy has reference to; a
 remnant who are not of <I>them that draw back unto perdition,</I> but 
 believe and persevere <I>to the saving of the soul;</I> they endure to 
 the end, to the end of their lives, to the end of their present state 
 of probation, or to the end of these suffering trying times, to the 
 last encounter, though they should be called to resist unto blood.

 (2.) It is comfortable to those
 who do thus endure to the end, and suffer for their constancy, that
 they shall be saved. Perseverance wins the crown, through free grace,
 and shall wear it. <I>They shall be saved:</I> perhaps they may be
 delivered out of their troubles, and comfortably survive them in this
 world; but it is eternal salvation that is here intended. They that
 endure to the end of their days, shall then receive the end of their
 faith and hope, <I>even the salvation of their souls,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:9,Ro+2:7,Re+3:20">1 Pet. i. 9; 
 Rom. ii. 7; Rev. iii. 20</A>.

 The crown of glory will make amends for all; and a believing regard to
 that will enable us to choose rather to die at a stake with the 
 persecuted, than to live in a palace with the persecutors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He foretels the preaching of the gospel in all the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);
 
 <I>This gospel shall be preached, and then shall the end come.</I>
 Observe here, 

 1. It is called <I>the gospel of the kingdom,</I> because it reveals
 the kingdom of grace, which leads to the kingdom of glory; sets up
 Christ's kingdom in this world; and secures ours in the other world. 

 2. This gospel, sooner or later, is to be preached in all the world,
 to every creature, and all nations are to be discipled by it; for in it
 Christ is to be <I>Salvation to the ends of the earth;</I> for this end
 the gift of tongues was <I>the first-fruits of the Spirit.</I> 

 3. The gospel is preached <I>for a witness to all nations,</I> that is,
 a faithful declaration of the mind and will of God concerning the duty 
 which God requires from man, and the recompence which man may expect 
 from God. It is a <I>record</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:11">1 John v. 11</A>),

 it is a <I>witness,</I> for those who believe, that they shall be
 saved, and against those who persist in unbelief, that they shall be
 damned. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:16">Mark xvi. 16</A>.
 
 But how does this come in here?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is intimated that the gospel should be, if not heard, yet at 
 least heard of, throughout the then known world, before the destruction 
 of Jerusalem; that the Old-Testament church should not be quite 
 dissolved till the New Testament was pretty well settled, had got 
 considerable footing, and began to make some figure. Better is the face 
 of a corrupt degenerate church than none at all. Within forty years 
 after Christ's death, the <I>sound</I> of the gospel was <I>gone forth 
 to the ends of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:18">Rom. x. 18</A>.

 St. Paul <I>fully preached the gospel from Jerusalem, and round about
 unto Illyricum;</I> and the other apostles were not idle. The 
 persecuting of the saints at Jerusalem helped to disperse them, so that 
 they <I>went every where, preaching the word,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:1-4">Acts viii. 1-4</A>.

 And when the tidings of the Redeemer are sent over all parts of the
 world, then shall come the end of the Jewish state. Thus, that which 
 they thought to prevent, by putting Christ to death, they thereby 
 procured; all men <I>believed on him, and the Romans came, and took 
 away their place and nation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:48">John xi. 48</A>.

 Paul speaks of the gospel being <I>come to all the world, and preached
 to every creature,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:6-23">Col. i. 6-23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is likewise intimated that even in times of temptation, 
 trouble, and persecution, the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached 
 and propagated, and shall force its way through the greatest 
 opposition. Though the enemies of the church grow very <I>hot,</I> and 
 many of her friends very <I>cool,</I> yet the gospel shall be preached. 
 And even <I>then,</I> when many fall by the sword and by flame, and 
 many do wickedly, and are corrupted by flatteries, yet then the people 
 that do know their God, shall be strengthened to do the greatest 
 exploits of all, in instructing many; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:32,33">Dan. xi. 32, 33</A>;

 and see an instance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:12-14">Phil. i. 12-14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That which seems chiefly intended here, is, that the end of the 
 world shall be <I>then,</I> and not till then, when the gospel has done 
 its work in the world. The gospel shall be preached, and that work 
 carried on, when you are dead; so that all nations, first or last, 
 shall have either the enjoyment, or the refusal, of the gospel; and 
 <I>then cometh the end,</I> when the kingdom <I>shall be delivered up 
 to God, even the Father;</I> when the mystery of God shall be finished, 
 the mystical body completed, and the nations either converted and
 saved, or convicted and silenced, by the gospel; <I>then shall the end 
 come,</I> of which he had said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 <I>not yet,</I> not till those intermediate counsels be fulfilled. The
 world shall stand as long as any of God's chosen ones remain uncalled; 
 but, when they are all gathered in, it will be set on fire 
 immediately.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He foretels more particularly the ruin that was coming upon the 
 people of the Jews, their city, temple, and nation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,

 &c. Here he comes more closely to answer their questions concerning the
 desolation of the temple; and what he said here, would be of use to his 
 disciples, both for their conduct and for their comfort, in reference 
 to that great event; he describes the several steps of that calamity, 
 such as are usual in war.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The Romans <I>setting up the abomination of desolation in the holy 
 place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Now,

 (1.) Some understand by this an image, or statue, set up in the temple
 by some of the Roman governors, which was very offensive to the Jews, 
 provoked them to rebel, and so brought the desolation upon them. The 
 image of Jupiter Olympius, which Antiochus caused to be set upon the 
 altar of God, is called <B><I>Bdelygma eremoseos</I></B>--<I>The 
 abomination of desolation,</I> the very word here used by the 
 historian, 
 
 <U>1 Mac. i. 54</U>.

 Since the captivity in Babylon, nothing was, nor could be, more
 distasteful to the Jews than an image in the holy place, as appeared by 
 the mighty opposition they made when Caligula offered to set up his 
 statue there, which had been of fatal consequence, if it had not been 
 prevented, and the matter accommodated, by the conduct of Petronius; 
 but Herod did set up an eagle over the temple-gate; and, some say, the 
 statue of Titus was set up in the temple.

 (2.) Others choose to expound it by the parallel place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:20">Luke xxi. 20</A>),

 <I>when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies.</I> Jerusalem was
 the holy city, Canaan the holy land, the Mount Moriah, which lay about 
 Jerusalem, for its nearness to the temple was, they thought in a 
 particular manner holy ground; on the country lying round about 
 Jerusalem the Roman army was encamped, that was the abomination that 
 made desolate. The land of an enemy is said to be <I>the land which 
 thou abhorrest</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:16">Isa. vii. 16</A>);

 so an enemy's army to a weak but wilful people may well be called
 <I>the abomination.</I> Now this is said to be <I>spoken of by Daniel, 
 the prophet,</I> who spoke more plainly of the Messiah and his kingdom 
 than any of the Old-Testament prophets did. He speaks of an abomination 
 making desolate, which should be set up by Antiochus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:31,12:11">Dan. xi. 31; xii. 11</A>);

 but this that our Saviour refers to, we have in the message that the
 angel brought him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27">Dan. ix. 27</A>),

 of what should come at the end of seventy weeks, long after the former;
 <I>for the overspreading of abominations,</I> or, as the margin reads 
 it, <I>with the abominable armies</I> (which comes home to the prophecy 
 here), <I>he shall make it desolate.</I> Armies of idolaters may well 
 be called <I>abominable armies;</I> and some think, the tumults, 
 insurrections, and abominable factions and seditions, in the city and 
 temple, may at least be taken in as part of the abomination making 
 desolate. Christ refers them to that prophecy of Daniel, that they 
 might see how the ruin of their city and temple was spoken of in the 
 Old Testament, which would both confirm his prediction, and take off 
 the odium of it. They might likewise from thence gather the time of 
 it--soon after the cutting off of Messiah the prince; the sin that 
 procured it--their rejecting him, and the certainty of it--<I>it is a 
 desolation determined.</I> As Christ by his precepts confirmed the law, 
 so by his predictions he confirmed the prophecies of the Old Testament, 
 and it will be of good use to compare both together.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Reference being here had to a prophecy, which is commonly dark and 
 obscure, Christ inserts this memorandum, "<I>Whoso readeth, let him 
 understand;</I> whoso readeth the prophecy of Daniel, let him 
 understand that it is to have its accomplishment now shortly in the 
 desolations of Jerusalem." Note, Those that read the scriptures, should 
 labour to understand the scriptures, else their reading is to little 
 purpose; we cannot use that which we do not understand. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:39,Ac+8:30">John v. 39; Acts viii. 30</A>.

 The angel that delivered this prophecy to Daniel, stirred him up to
 <I>know and understand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:25">Dan. ix. 25</A>.

 And we must not despair of understanding even dark prophecies; the
 great New-Testament prophecy is called a <I>revelation,</I> not a 
 <I>secret.</I> Now <I>things revealed belong to us,</I> and therefore 
 must be humbly and diligently searched into. Or, <I>Let him 
 understand,</I> not only the scriptures which speak of those things, 
 but by the scriptures let him <I>understand the times,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:32">1 Chron. xii. 32</A>.

 Let him observe, and take notice; so some read it; let him be assured,
 that, notwithstanding the vain hopes with which the deluded people feed 
 themselves, the abominable armies will make desolate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The means of preservation which thinking men should betake 
 themselves to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:16,20"><I>v.</I> 16, 20</A>);

 <I>Then let them which are in Judea, flee.</I> Then conclude there is
 no other way to help yourselves than by flying for the same. We may 
 take this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As a prediction of the ruin itself; that it should be 
 irresistible; that it would be impossible for the stoutest hearts to 
 make head against it, or contend with it, but they must have recourse 
 to the last shift, getting out of the way. It bespeaks that which 
 Jeremiah so much insisted upon, but in vain, when Jerusalem was 
 besieged by the Chaldeans, that it would be to no purpose to resist, 
 but that it was their wisdom to yield and capitulate; so Christ here, 
 to show how fruitless it would be to stand it out, bids every one make 
 the best of his way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We may take it as a direction to the followers of Christ what to 
 do, not to <I>say, A confederacy</I> with those who fought and warred 
 against the Romans for the preservation of their city and nation, only 
 that they might consume the wealth of both upon their lusts (for to 
 this very affair, the struggles of the Jews against the Roman power, 
 some years before their final overthrow, the apostle refers, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:1-3">Jam. iv. 1-3</A>);

 but let them acquiesce in the decree that was gone forth, and with all
 speed quit the city and country, as they would quit a falling house or 
 a sinking ship, as Lot quitted Sodom, and Israel the tents of Dathan 
 and Abiram; he shows them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Whither they must flee--from Judea <I>to the mountains;</I> not 
 the mountains round about Jerusalem, but those in the remote corners of 
 the land, which would be some shelter to them, not so much by their 
 strength as by their secrecy. Israel is said to be <I>scattered upon 
 the mountains</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:16">2 Chron. xviii. 16</A>);
 
 and see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:38">Heb. xi. 38</A>.

 It would be safer among the lions' dens, and the mountains of the
 leopards, than among the seditious Jews or the enraged Romans. Note, In 
 times of imminent peril and danger, it is not only lawful, but our 
 duty, to seek our own preservation by all good and honest means; and if 
 God opens a door of escape, we ought to make our escape, otherwise we 
 do not trust God but tempt him. There may be a time when even <I>those 
 that are in Judea,</I> where God is known, and his name is great, must 
 <I>flee to the mountains;</I> and while we only go out of the way of 
 danger, not out of the way of duty, we may trust God to provide <I>a 
 dwelling for his outcasts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:4,5">Isa. xvi. 4, 5</A>.

 In times of public calamity, when it is manifest that we cannot be
 serviceable at home and may be safe abroad, Providence calls us to make 
 our escape. He that flees, may fight again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What haste they must make, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 The life will be in danger, in imminent danger, the scourge will slay 
 suddenly; and therefore he <I>that is on the house-top,</I> when the 
 alarm comes, let him not <I>come down into the house,</I> to look after 
 his effects there, but go the nearest way down, to make his escape; and 
 so he that shall be <I>in the field,</I> will find it his wisest course 
 to run immediately, and not return to fetch his clothes or the wealth 
 of his house, for two reasons, <I>First,</I> Because the time which 
 would be taken up in packing up his things, would delay his flight. 
 Note, When death is at the door, delays are dangerous; it was the 
 charge to Lot, <I>Look not behind thee.</I> Those that are convinced of 
 the misery of a sinful state, and the ruin that attends them in that 
 state, and, consequently, of the necessity of their fleeing to Christ, 
 must take heed, lest, after all these convictions, they perish 
 eternally by delays. <I>Secondly,</I> Because the carrying of his
 clothes, and his other movables and valuables with him, would but 
 burthen him, and clog his flight. The Syrians, in their flight, <I>cast 
 away their garments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:15">2 Kings vii. 15</A>.

 At such a time, we must be thankful <I>if our lives be given us for a
 prey,</I> though we can save nothing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+45:4,5">Jer. xlv. 4, 5</A>.

 <I>For the life is more than meat,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25"><I>ch.</I> vi. 25</A>.

 Those who carried off least, were safest in their flight. <I>Cantabit
 vacuus coram latrone viator--The pennyless traveller can lose nothing 
 by robbers.</I> It was to his own disciples that Christ recommended 
 this forgetfulness of their house and clothes, who had a habitation in 
 heaven, treasure there, and durable clothing, which the enemy could not 
 plunder them of. <I>Omnia mea mecum porto--I have all my property with
 me,</I> said Bias the philosopher in his flight, empty-handed. He that 
 has grace in his heart carries his all along with him, when tripped of 
 all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now those to whom Christ said this immediately, did not live to see 
 this dismal day, none of all the twelve but John only; they needed not 
 to be hidden in the mountains (Christ hid them in heaven), but they 
 left the direction to their successors in profession, who pursued it, 
 and it was of use to them; for when the Christians in Jerusalem and 
 Judea saw the ruin coming on, they all retired to a town called 
 <I>Pella,</I> on the other side Jordan, where they were safe; so that 
 of the many thousands that perished in the destruction of Jerusalem, 
 there was not so much as one Christian. See <I>Euseb. Eccl. Hist.</I> 
 lib. 3, cap. 5. Thus <I>the prudent man foresees the evil, and hides 
 himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:3,Heb+11:7">Prov. xxii. 3; Heb. xi. 7</A>.

 This warning was not kept private. St. Matthew's gospel was published
 long before that destruction, so that others might have taken the 
 advantage of it; but their perishing through their unbelief of this, 
 was a figure of their eternal perishing through their unbelief of the 
 warnings Christ gave concerning the wrath to come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Whom it would go hard with at that time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 <I>Woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck.</I> To
 this same event that saying of Christ at his death refers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:29">Luke xxiii. 29</A>),

 They shall say, <I>Blessed are the wombs that never bare, and the paps
 that never gave suck.</I> Happy are they that have no children to see
 the murder of; but most unhappy they whose wombs are then bearing,
 their paps then giving suck: they of all others will be in the most
 melancholy circumstances. <I>First,</I> To them the famine would be
 most grievous, when they should see the <I>tongue of the sucking child
 cleaving to the roof of his mouth for thirst,</I> and themselves by the
 calamity made more cruel than the sea monsters, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:3,4">Lam. iv. 3, 4</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> To them the sword would be most terrible, when in the
 hand of worse than brutal rage. It is a direful midwifery, when the 
 women with child come to be ripped up by the enraged conqueror

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:16,Ho+13:16,Am+1:13">2 Kings xv. 16;
 Hos. xiii. 16; Amos i. 13</A>),

 or the children <I>brought forth to their murderer,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:13">Hos. ix. 13</A>.
 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> To them also the flight would be most afflictive,; the
 women with child cannot make haste, or go far; the sucking child cannot
 be left behind, or, if it should, <I>can a woman forget it, that she
 should not have compassion on it?</I> If it be carried along, it
 retards the mother's flight, and so exposes her life, and is in danger
 of Mephibosheth's fate, who was lamed by a fall he got in his nurse's
 flight. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:4">2 Sam. iv. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] What they should pray against at that time--<I>that your flight be 
 not in the winter, nor on the sabbath day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Observe, in general, it becomes Christ's disciples, in times of public 
 trouble and calamity, to be much in prayer; that is a salve for every 
 sore, never out of season, but in a special manner seasonable when we 
 are distressed on every side. There is no remedy but you must flee, the 
 decree is gone forth, so that God will not be entreated to take away 
 his wrath, no, not if <I>Noah, Daniel, and Job, stood before him. Let 
 it suffice thee, speak no more of that matter,</I> but labour to make 
 the best of that which is; and when you cannot in faith pray that you 
 may not be forced to flee, yet pray that the circumstances of it may be 
 graciously ordered, that, though the cup may not pass from you, yet the 
 extremity of the judgment may be prevented. Note, God has the disposing 
 of the circumstances of events, which sometimes make a great alteration 
 one way or other; and therefore in those our eyes must be ever toward 
 him. Christ's bidding them pray for this favour, intimates his purpose 
 of granting it to them; and in a general calamity we must not overlook 
 a circumstantial kindness, but see and own wherein it might have been 
 worse. Christ still bids his disciples to pray for themselves and their 
 friends, that, whenever they were forced to flee, it might be in the 
 most convenient time. Note, When trouble is in prospect, at a great 
 distance, it is good to lay in a stock of prayers beforehand; they must 
 pray, <I>First, That their flight,</I> if it were the will of God, 
 <I>might not be in the winter,</I> when the days are short, the weather 
 cold, the ways dirty, and therefore travelling very uncomfortable, 
 especially for whole families. Paul hastens Timothy to come to him 
 before winter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:21">2 Tim. iv. 21</A>.

 Note, Though the ease of the body is not to be <I>mainly</I> consulted,
 it ought to be <I>duly</I> considered; though we must take what God 
 sends, and when he sends it, yet we may pray against bodily 
 inconveniences, and are encouraged to do so, in that <I>the Lord is for 
 the body. Secondly,</I> That it might not be <I>on the sabbath day;</I> 
 not on the Jewish sabbath, because travelling then would give offence 
 to them who were angry with the disciples for plucking the ears of corn 
 on the day; not on the Christian sabbath, because being forced to 
 travel on the day would be a grief to themselves. This intimates 
 Christ's design, that a weekly sabbath should be observed in his church 
 after the preaching of the gospel to all the world. We read not of any 
 of the ordinances of the Jewish church, which were purely ceremonial, 
 that Christ ever expressed any care about, because they were all to 
 vanish; but for the sabbath he often showed a concern. It intimates 
 likewise that the sabbath is ordinarily to be observed as a day of rest 
 from travel and worldly labour; but that, according to his own 
 explication of the fourth commandment, works of necessity were lawful 
 on the sabbath day, as this of fleeing from an enemy to save our lives: 
 had it not been lawful, he would have said, "Whatever becomes of you, 
 do not flee on the sabbath day, but abide by it, though you die by it." 
 For we must not commit the least sin, to escape the greatest trouble. 
 But it intimates, likewise, that it is very uneasy and uncomfortable to 
 a good man, to be taken off by any work of necessity from the solemn 
 service and worship of God on the sabbath day. We should pray that we 
 may have quiet undisturbed sabbaths, and may have no other work than 
 sabbath work to do on sabbath days; that we may attend upon the Lord 
 without distraction. It was desirable, that, if they must flee, they 
 might have the benefit and comfort of one sabbath more to help to bear 
 their charges. To flee in the winter is uncomfortable to the body; but 
 to flee on the sabbath day is so to the soul, and the more so when it 
 remembers former sabbaths, as

 3. The greatness of the troubles which should immediately ensue 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 <I>Then shall be great tribulation;</I> then when the measure of
 iniquity is full; then when the servants of God are sealed and secured, 
 then come the troubles; nothing can be done against Sodom till Lot is 
 entered into Zoar, and then look for fire and brimstone immediately.
 <I>There shall be great tribulation.</I> Great, indeed, when within the 
 city plague and famine raged, and (worse than either) faction and 
 division, so that every man's sword was against his fellow; then and 
 there it was that the hands of the pitiful women flayed their own 
 children. Without the city was the Roman army ready to swallow them up, 
 with a particular rage against them, not only as Jews, but as 
 rebellious Jews. War was the only one of the three sore judgments that 
 David excepted against; but that was it by which the Jews were ruined; 
 and there were famine and pestilence in extremity besides. Josephus's 
 <I>History of the Wars of the Jews,</I> has in it more tragical 
 passages than perhaps any history whatsoever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It was a desolation unparalleled, such as <I>was not since the 
 beginning of the world, nor ever shall be.</I> Many a city and kingdom 
 has been made desolate, but never any with a desolation like this. Let 
 not daring sinners think that God has done his worst, he can heat the 
 furnace seven times and yet seven times hotter, and will, when he sees 
 greater and still greater abominations. The Romans, when they destroyed 
 Jerusalem, were degenerated from the honour and virtue of their 
 ancestors, which had made even their victories easy to the vanquished. 
 And the wilfulness and obstinacy of the Jews themselves contributed 
 much to the increase of the tribulation. No wonder that the ruin of 
 Jerusalem was an unparalleled ruin, when the sin of Jerusalem was an 
 unparalleled sin--even their crucifying Christ. The nearer any people 
 are to God in profession and privileges, the greater and heavier will 
 his judgments be upon them, if they abuse those privileges, and be 
 false to that profession, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was a desolation which, if it should continue long, would be 
 intolerable, so that <I>no flesh should be saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:22">
 <I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 So triumphantly would death ride, in so many dismal shapes, and with 
 such attendants, that there would be no escaping, but, first or last, 
 all would be cut off. He that escaped one sword, would fall by another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:17,18">Isa. xxiv. 17, 18</A>.

 The computation which Josephus makes of those that were slain in
 several places, amounts to above two millions. <I>No flesh shall be 
 saved;</I> he doth not say, "No <I>soul</I> shall be saved," for the 
 destruction of the flesh may be for <I>the saving of the spirit in the 
 day of the Lord Jesus;</I> but temporal lives will be sacrificed so 
 profusely, that one would think, if it last awhile, it would make a 
 full end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But here is one word of comfort in the midst of all this terror--that 
 <I>for the elects' sake these days shall be shortened,</I> not made 
 shorter than what God had determined (for <I>that which is determined, 
 shall be poured upon the desolate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27">Dan. ix. 27</A>),

 but shorter than what he might have decreed, if he had dealt with them
 according to their sins; shorter than what the enemy designed, who 
 would have cut all off, if God who made use of them to serve his own 
 purpose, had not set bounds to their wrath; shorter than one who judged 
 by human probabilities would have imagined. Note, 

 [1.] In times of common calamity God manifests his favour to the elect 
 remnant; his jewels, which he will then make up; his peculiar treasure, 
 which he will secure when the lumber is abandoned to the spoiler.

 [2.] The shortening of calamities is a kindness God often grants for 
 the elects' sake. Instead of complaining that our afflictions last so 
 long, if we consider our defects, we shall see reason to be thankful 
 that they do not last always; when it is bad with us, it becomes us to 
 say, "Blessed be God that it is no worse; blessed be God that it is not 
 hell, endless and remediless misery." It was a lamenting church that 
 said, <I>It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed;</I> and 
 it is for the sake of the elect, lest their spirit should fail before 
 them, if he should contend for ever, and lest they should be tempted to 
 put forth, if not their heart, yet their hand, to iniquity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And now comes in the repeated caution, which was opened before, to take 
 heed of being ensnared by false Christs, and false prophets; 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>,

 &c.), who would promise them deliverance, as the lying prophets in
 Jeremiah's time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:13,23:16,17,27:16,28:2">Jer. xiv. 13;
 xxiii. 16, 17; xxvii. 16; xxviii. 2</A>),

 but would delude them. Times of great trouble are times of great
 temptation, and therefore we have need to double our guard then. If 
 they shall say, <I>Here is a Christ, or there is one,</I> that shall 
 deliver us from the Romans, do not heed them, it is all but talk; such 
 a deliverance is not to be expected, and therefore not such a 
 deliverer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. He foretels the sudden spreading of the gospel in the world, about 
 the time of these great events 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>);

 <I>As the lightning comes out of the east, so shall the coming of the
 Son of man be.</I> It comes in here as an antidote against the poison
 of those seducers, that said, <I>Lo, here is Christ,</I> or, <I>Lo, he
 is there;</I> compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:23,24">Luke xvii. 23, 24</A>.

 Hearken not to them, for the coming of the Son of man will be as the
 lightning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It seems primarily to be meant of his coming to set up his spiritual 
 kingdom in the world; where the gospel came in its light and power, 
 there the Son of man came, and in a way quite contrary to the fashion 
 of the seducers and false Christs, who came creeping <I>in the 
 desert,</I> or the <I>secret chambers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:6">2 Tim. iii. 6</A>);

 whereas Christ comes not with such a <I>spirit of fear,</I> but <I>of
 power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</I> The gospel would be 
 remarkable for two things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Its swift spreading; it shall fly as the lightning; so shall the 
 gospel be preached and propagated. The gospel is light 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:19">John iii. 19</A>);

 and it is not in this as the lightning, that it is a sudden flash, and
 away, for it is sun-light, and day-light; but it is as lightning in 
 these respects:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] It is light from heaven, as the lightning. It is God, and not man, 
 that sends the lightnings, and summons them, that they may go, and say, 
 <I>Here we are,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:35">Job xxxviii. 35</A>.
 
 It is God that directs it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:3">Job xxxvii. 3</A>);

 to man it is one of nature's miracles, above his power to effect, and
 of nature's mysteries, above his skill to account for: but it is from 
 above; <I>his lightnings enlightened the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:4">Ps. xcvii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It is visible and conspicuous as the lightning. The seducers 
 carried on their depths of Satan in the desert and the secret chambers, 
 shunning the light; heretics were called 
 <I>lucifug&aelig;--light-shunners.</I> But truth seeks no corners, 
 however it may sometimes be forced into them, as the <I>woman in the 
 wilderness,</I> though <I>clothed with the sun,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:1,6">Rev. xii. 1, 6</A>.
 
 Christ preached his gospel openly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:20">John xviii. 20</A>),

 and his apostles on <I>the housetop</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:27"><I>ch.</I> x. 27</A>),
 
 not <I>in a corner,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:26">Acts xxvi. 26</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:2">Ps. xcviii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] It was sudden and surprising to the world as the lightning; the 
 Jews indeed had predictions of it, but to the Gentiles it was 
 altogether unlooked for, and came upon them with unaccountable energy, 
 or ever they were aware. It was <I>light out of darkness,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:16,2Co+4:6"><I>ch.</I> iv. 16; 2 Cor. iv. 6</A>.

 We read of the discomfiting of armies by lightning,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:15,Ps+144:6">2 Sam. xxii. 15; Ps. cxliv. 6</A>.

 The powers of darkness were dispersed and vanquished by the gospel
 lightning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] It spread far and wide, and that quickly and irresistibly, like 
 the lightning, which comes, suppose, out of the east (Christ is said to 
 ascend <I>from the east,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:2,Isa+41:2">Rev. vii. 2; Isa. xli. 2</A>),

 and lighteneth to the west. The propagating of Christianity to so many
 distant countries, of divers languages, by such unlikely instruments, 
 destitute of all secular advantages, and in the face of so much 
 opposition, and this in so short a time, was one of the greatest 
 miracles that was ever wrought for the confirmation of it; here was 
 Christ upon his white horse, denoting speed as well as strength, and 
 <I>going on conquering and to conquer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2">Rev. vi. 2</A>.

 Gospel light rose with the sun, and went with the same, so that the 
 beams of it reached to the ends of the earth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:18">Rom. x. 18</A>.
 
 Compare with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:3,4">Ps. xix. 3, 4</A>.

 Though it was fought against, it could never be cooped up
 in a desert, or in a secret place, as the seducers were; but by this, 
 according to Gamaliel's rule, proved itself to be <I>of God,</I> that 
 it <I>could not be overthrown,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:38,39">Acts v. 38, 39</A>.

 Christ speaks of <I>shining into the west,</I> because it spread most
 effectually into those countries which lay west from Jerusalem, as Mr. 
 Herbert observes in his <I>Church-militant.</I> How soon did the gospel 
 lightning reach this island of Great Britain! Tertullian, who wrote in 
 the second century, takes notice of it, <I>Britannorum in accessa 
 Romanis loca, Christo tamen subdita--The fastnesses of Britain, though 
 inaccessible to the Romans, were occupied by Jesus Christ.</I> This was 
 the Lord's doing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Another thing remarkable concerning the gospel, was, its strange 
 success in those places to which is was spread; it gathered in 
 multitudes, not by external compulsion, but as it were by such a 
 natural instinct and inclination, as brings the birds of prey to their 
 prey; for <I>wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be 
 gathered together</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 where Christ is preached, souls will be gathered in to him. The
 <I>lifting up of Christ from the earth,</I> that is, the preaching of 
 Christ crucified, which, one would think, should drive all men from 
 him, will <I>draw all men to him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:32">John xii. 32</A>),

 according to Jacob's prophecy, that <I>to him shall the gathering of
 the people be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:8">Isa. lx. 8</A>.

 The eagles will be where the carcase is, for it is food for them, it is
 a feast for them; <I>where the slain are, there is she,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:30">Job xxxix. 30</A>.
 
 Eagles are said to have a strange sagacity and quickness of scent to
 find out the prey, and they fly swiftly to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:26">Job ix. 26</A>.

 So those whose spirits God shall stir up, will be effectually drawn to
 Jesus Christ, to feed upon him; whither should the eagle go but to the 
 prey? Whither should the soul go but to Jesus Christ, who <I>has the 
 words of eternal life?</I> The eagles will distinguish what is proper 
 for them from that which is not; so those who have spiritual senses 
 exercised, will know the voice of the good Shepherd from that of a 
 thief and a robber. Saints will be where the true Christ is, not the
 false Christs. This is applicable to the desires that are wrought in 
 every gracious soul after Christ, and communion with him. Where he is 
 in his ordinances, there will his servants choose to be. A living 
 principle of grace is a kind of natural instinct in all the saints, 
 drawing them to Christ to live upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Some understand 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:29-31">these verses</A>

 of the coming of the Son of man <I>to destroy Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1,2,5">Mal. iii. 1, 2, 5</A>.

 So much was there of an extraordinary display of divine power and
 justice in that event, that it is called <I>the coming of 
 Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now here are two things intimated concerning it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That to the most it would be as unexpected as a flash of 
 lightning, which indeed gives warning of the clap of thunder which 
 follows, but is itself surprising. The seducers say, <I>Lo, here is 
 Christ</I> to deliver us; or there is one, a creature of their own 
 fancies; but ere they are aware, the wrath of the Lamb, the true 
 Christ, will arrest them, and they shall not escape.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That it might be as justly expected as that the eagle should fly 
 to the carcases; though they put far from them the evil day, yet the 
 desolation will come as certainly as the birds of prey to a dead
 carcase, that lies exposed in the open field. 

 [1.] The Jews were so corrupt and degenerate, so vile and vicious, that 
 they were become a carcase, obnoxious to the righteous judgment of God; 
 they were also so factious and seditious, and every way so provoking to 
 the Romans, that they had made themselves obnoxious to their 
 resentments, and an inviting prey to them.

 [2.] The Romans were as an eagle, and the ensign of their armies was an 
 eagle. The army of the Chaldeans is said <I>to fly as the eagle that 
 hasteth to eat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:8">Hab. i. 8</A>.

 The ruin of the New-Testament Babylon is represented by a call to the
 birds of prey to come and feast upon the slain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:17,18">Rev. xix. 17, 18</A>.

 Notorious malefactors have their eyes eaten out by <I>the young
 eagles</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:17">Prov. xxx. 17</A>);
 
 the Jews were hung up in chains, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:33,16:4">Jer. vii. 33; xvi. 4</A>.

 [3.] The Jews can no more preserve themselves from the Romans than the
 carcase can secure itself from the eagles.

 [4.] The destruction shall find out the Jews wherever they are, as the
 eagle scents the prey. Note, When a people do by their sin make
 themselves carcases, putrid and loathsome, nothing can be expected but 
 that God should send eagles among them, to devour and destroy them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is very applicable to the day of judgment, the coming of our Lord 
 Jesus Christ in that day, and <I>our gathering together unto him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1">2 Thess. ii. 1</A>.
 
 Now see here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How he shall come; <I>as the lightning,</I> The time was now at 
 hand, when he should <I>depart out of the world, to go to the 
 Father.</I> Therefore those that enquire after Christ must not go into 
 the desert or the secret place, nor listen to every one that will put 
 up the finger to invite them to a sight of Christ; but let them look 
 upward, for the heavens must contain him, and thence <I>we look for the 
 Saviour</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:20">Phil. iii. 20</A>);

 he shall <I>come in the clouds,</I> as the lightning doth, and <I>every
 eye shall see him,</I> as they say it is natural for all living 
 creatures to turn their faces towards the lightning,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:7">Rev. i. 7</A>.

 Christ will appear to all the world, from one end of heaven to the
 other; nor shall any thing be hid from the light and heat of that 
 day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How the saints shall be gathered to him; as the eagles are to the 
 carcase by natural instinct, and with the greatest swiftness and 
 alacrity imaginable. Saints, when they shall be fetched to glory, will 
 be carried as on eagles' wings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:4">Exod. xix. 4</A>),

 as on angels' wings. <I>They shall mount up with wings, like
 eagles,</I> and like them renew their youth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. He foretels his second coming at the <I>end of time,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:29-31"><I>v.</I> 29-31</A>.
 
 <I>The sun shall be darkened,</I> &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Some think this is to be understood only of the destruction of 
 Jerusalem and the Jewish nation; the darkening of the sun, moon, and 
 stars, denotes the eclipse of the glory of that state, its convulsions, 
 and the general confusion that attended that desolation. Great 
 slaughter and devastation are in the Old Testament thus set forth (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+13:10,34:4,Eze+32:7,Joe+2:31">Isa. xiii. 10; xxxiv. 4;
 Ezek. xxxii. 7; Joel ii. 31</A>);

 or by the sun, moon, and stars, may be meant the temple, Jerusalem, and
 the cities of Judah, which should all come to ruin. The <I>sign of the 
 Son of man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 means a signal appearance of the power and justice of the Lord Jesus in
 it, avenging his own blood on them that imprecated the guilt of it upon 
 themselves and their children; and the gathering <I>of his elect</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>)

 signifies the delivering of a remnant from this sin and ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It seems rather to refer to Christ's second coming. The destruction 
 of the particular enemies of the church was typical of the complete 
 conquest of them all; and therefore what will be done really at the 
 great day, may be applied metaphorically to those destructions: but 
 still we must attend to the principal scope of them; and while we are 
 all agreed to expect Christ's second coming, what need is there to put 
 such strained constructions as some do, upon 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:29-31">these verses</A>,

 which speak of it so clearly, and so agreeably to other scriptures,
 especially when Christ is here answering an enquiry concerning his 
 coming at the end of the world, which Christ was never shy of speaking 
 of to his disciples?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The only objection against this, is, that it is said to be 
 <I>immediately after the tribulation of those days;</I> but as to that, 
 
 (1.) It is usual in the prophetical style to speak of things great and
 certain as near and just at hand, only to express the greatness and 
 certainty of them. Enoch spoke of Christ's second coming as within ken, 
 <I>Behold, the Lord cometh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>.

 (2.) <I>A thousand years are</I> in God's sight <I>but as one day,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:8">2 Pet. iii. 8</A>.

 It is there urged, with reference to this very thing, and so it might
 be said to be immediately after. The tribulation of those days includes 
 not only the destruction of Jerusalem, but all the other tribulations 
 which the church must pass through; not only its share in the 
 calamities of the nations, but the tribulations peculiar to itself; 
 while the nations are torn with wars, and the church with schisms, 
 delusions, and persecutions, we cannot say that the tribulation of 
 those days is over; the whole state of the church on earth is militant, 
 we must count upon that; but when the church's tribulation is over, her 
 warfare accomplished, and what is behind of the sufferings of Christ 
 filled up, then look for the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now concerning Christ's second coming, it is here foretold,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That there shall be then a great and amazing change of the 
 creatures, and particularly the <I>heavenly bodies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>).

 <I>The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her
 light.</I> The moon shines with a borrowed light, and therefore if the 
 sun, from whom she borrows her light, is turned into darkness, she must 
 fail of course, and become bankrupt. <I>The stars shall fall;</I> they 
 shall lose their light, and disappear, and be as if they were fallen; 
 and <I>the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</I> This intimates,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> That there shall be a great change, in order to the 
 making of all things new. Then shall be <I>the restitution of all 
 things,</I> when the heavens shall not be cast away as a rag, but 
 <I>changed as a vesture,</I> to be worn in a better fashion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:26">Ps. cii. 26</A>.

 They shall <I>pass away with a great noise,</I> that there may be
 <I>new heavens,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:10-13">2 Pet. iii. 10-13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> It shall be a visible change, and such as all the 
 world must take notice of; for such the darkening of the sun and moon 
 cannot but be: and it would be an amazing change; for the heavenly 
 bodies are not so liable to alteration as the creatures of this lower 
 world are. The days of heaven, and the continuance of the sun and moon, 
 are used to express that which is lasting and unchangeable (As 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:29,Ps+36:37">
 Ps. lxxxix. 29; xxxvi. 37</A>);

 yet they shall thus be shaken.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> It shall be a universal change. If the sun be turned 
 into darkness, and the powers of heaven be shaken, the earth cannot but 
 be turned into a dungeon, and its foundation made to tremble. <I>Howl, 
 fir trees, if the cedars be shaken.</I> When the stars of heaven drop, 
 no marvel if the <I>everlasting mountains melt,</I> and the 
 <I>perpetual hills bow.</I> Nature shall sustain a general shock and 
 convulsion, which yet shall be no hindrance to the joy and rejoicing of 
 heaven and earth <I>before the Lord, when he cometh to judge the 
 world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:11,13">Ps. xcvi. 11, 13</A>);

 they shall as it were <I>glory in the tribulation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> The darkening of the sun, moon, and stars, which were 
 <I>made to rule over the day, and over the night</I> (which is the 
 first dominion we find of any creature,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:16-18">Gen. i. 16-18</A>),

 signifies the <I>putting down of all rule, authority, and power</I>
 (even that which seems of the greatest antiquity and usefulness), 
 <I>that the kingdom may be delivered up to God, even the Father,</I> 
 and he may be <I>All in all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24,28">1 Cor. xv. 24, 28</A>.

 The sun was darkened at the death of Christ, for then was in one sense
 <I>the judgment of this world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:31">John xii. 31</A>),

 an indication of what would be at the general judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fifthly,</I> The glorious appearance of our Lord Jesus, who will 
 then show himself as the <I>Brightness of his Father's glory, and the 
 express Image of his person,</I> will darken the sun and moon, as a 
 candle is darkened in the beams of the noon-day sun; they will have no 
 glory, <I>by reason of the glory that excelleth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:10">2 Cor. iii. 10</A>.

 Then <I>the sun shall be ashamed, and the moon confounded,</I> when God 
 shall appear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:23">Isa. xxiv. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Sixthly,</I> The sun and moon shall be then darkened, because there 
 will be no more occasion for them. To sinners, that choose their 
 portion in this life, all comfort will be eternally denied; as they 
 shall not have a drop of water, so not a ray of light. Now God causeth 
 his sun to rise on the earth, but then <I>Interdico tib sole et luna--I 
 forbid thee the light of the sun and the moon.</I> Darkness must be 
 their portion. To the saints that had their treasure above, such light 
 of joy and comfort will be given as shall supersede that of the sun and 
 moon, and render it useless. What need is there of vessels of light, 
 when we come to <I>the Fountain and Father of light</I>? See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:19,Re+22:5">Isa. lx. 19; Rev. xxii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That <I>then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 the Son of man himself, as it follows here, <I>They shall see the Son
 of man coming in the clouds.</I> At his first coming, he was <I>set for 
 a Sign that should be spoken against</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:34">Luke ii. 34</A>),

 but at his second coming, a sign that should be admired. Ezekiel was
 <I>a son of man set for a sign,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:6">Ezek. xii. 6</A>.

 Some make this a prediction of the harbingers and forerunners of his
 coming, giving notice of his approach; <I>a light shining before him, 
 and the fire devouring</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:3,1Ki+19:11,12">Ps. l. 3; 1 Kings xix. 11, 12</A>),

 <I>the beams coming out of his hand, where had long been the hiding of
 his power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:4">Hab. iii. 4</A>.

 It is a groundless conceit of some of the ancients, that this sign of
 the Son of man, will be the sign of the cross displayed as a banner. It 
 will certainly be such a clear convincing sign as will dash infidelity 
 quite out of countenance, and fill their faces with shame, who said, 
 <I>Where is the promise of his coming?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] That <I>then all the tribes of the earth shall mourn,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 
 See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:7">Rev. i. 7</A>.

 <I>All the kindreds of the earth shall then wail because of him;</I> 
 some of all the tribes and kindreds of the earth shall mourn; for the 
 greater part will tremble at his approach, while the chosen remnant, 
 one of a family and two of a tribe, shall lift up their heads with joy, 
 knowing that their redemption draws nigh, and their Redeemer. Note, 
 Sooner or later, all sinners will be mourners; penitent sinners look to 
 Christ, and mourn after a godly sort; and they who sow in those tears, 
 shall shortly reap in joy; impenitent sinners <I>shall look unto him 
 whom they have pierced,</I> and, though they laugh now, shall mourn and 
 weep after a devilish sort, in endless horror and despair.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] That <I>then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of 
 heaven, with power and great glory.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> The 
 judgment of the great day will be committed to the Son of man, both in 
 pursuance and in recompence of his great undertaking for us as 
 Mediator, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:22,27">John v. 22, 27</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> The Son of man will at that day come in the clouds of
 heaven. Much of the sensible intercourse between heaven and earth is by 
 the clouds; they are betwixt them, as it were, the <I>medium 
 participationis--the medium of participation,</I> drawn by heaven from 
 the earth, distilled by heaven upon the earth. Christ went to heaven
 in a cloud, and <I>will in like manner come again,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:9,11">Acts i. 9, 11</A>.
 
 <I>Behold, he cometh in the clouds,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:7">Rev. i. 7</A>.

 A cloud will be the Judge's chariot

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:3">Ps. civ. 3</A>),
 
 his robe
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:1">Rev. x. 1</A>),
 
 his pavilion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:11">Ps. xviii. 11</A>),
 
 his throne, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:14">Rev. xiv. 14</A>.

 When the world was destroyed by water, the judgment came in the clouds
 of heaven, for the windows of heaven were opened; so shall it be when 
 it shall be destroyed by fire. Christ went before Israel in a cloud, 
 which had a bright side and a dark side; so will the cloud have in 
 which Christ will come at the great day, it will bring both comfort and 
 terror. <I>Thirdly,</I> He will <I>come with power and great
 glory:</I> his first coming was in weakness and great meanness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:4">2 Cor. xiii. 4</A>);

 but his second coming will be with power and glory, agreeable both to
 the dignity of his person and to the purposes of his coming.
 <I>Fourthly,</I> He will be seen with bodily eyes in his coming: 
 <I>therefore</I> the Son of man will be the Judge, that he may be seen, 
 that sinners thereby may be the more confounded, who shall see him as 
 Balaam did, <I>but not nigh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:17">Num. xxiv. 17</A>),

 see him, but not as theirs. It added to the torment of that damned
 sinner, that <I>he saw Abraham afar off.</I> "Is this he whom we have 
 slighted, and rejected, and rebelled against; whom we have crucified to 
 ourselves afresh; who might have been our Saviour, but is our Judge, 
 and will be our enemy for ever?" <I>The Desire of all nations</I> will 
 then be their dread.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [5.] That <I>he shall send his angels with a great sound of a 
 trumpet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Note, <I>First,</I> The angels shall be attendants upon Christ at his 
 second coming; they are called <I>his</I> angels, which proves him to 
 be God, and Lord of the angels; they shall be obliged to wait upon him. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> These attendants shall be employed by him as officers 
 of the court in the judgment of that day; they are now ministering 
 spirits sent forth by him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:14">Heb. i. 14</A>),

 and will be so then. <I>Thirdly,</I> Their ministration will be ushered
 in with a great sound of a trumpet, to awaken and alarm a sleeping
 world. This trumpet is spoken of,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:52,1Th+4:16">1 Cor. xv. 52, and 1 Thess. iv. 16</A>.

 At the giving of the law on mount Sinai, the sound of the trumpet was
 remarkably terrible

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:13,16">Exod. xix. 13, 16</A>);

 but much more will it be so in the great day. By the law, trumpets
 were to be sounded for the calling of assemblies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=nu+10:2">Num. x. 2</A>),
 
 in praising God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:3">Ps. lxxxi. 3</A>),
 
 in offering sacrifices

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:10">Num. x. 10</A>),

 and in proclaiming the year of jubilee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:9">Lev. xxv. 9</A>.

 Very fitly therefore shall there be the sound of a trumpet at the last
 day, when the general assembly shall be called, when the praises of God 
 shall be gloriously celebrated, when sinners shall fall as sacrifices 
 to divine justice, and when the saints shall enter upon their eternal 
 jubilee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [6.] That <I>they shall gather together his elect from the four 
 winds.</I> Note, At the second coming of Jesus Christ, there will be a 
 general meeting of all the saints. <I>First,</I> The <I>elect</I> only 
 will be gathered, the chosen remnant, who are but few in comparison 
 with the many that are only <I>called.</I> This is the foundation of 
 the saints' eternal happiness, that they are God's elect. The gifts of 
 love to eternity follow the thought of love from eternity; and <I>the 
 Lord knows them that are his. Secondly,</I> The angels shall be 
 employed to bring them together, as Christ's servants, and as the 
 saints' friends; we have the commission given them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:5">Ps. l. 5</A>.

 <I>Gather my saints together unto me;</I> nay, it will be said to them,
 <I>Habetis fratres--These are your brethren;</I> for the elect will 
 then <I>be equal to the angels,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:36">Luke xx. 36</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> They <I>shall be gathered from one end of heaven to the
 other;</I> the elect of God are scattered abroad

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52">John xi. 52</A>),

 there are some in all places, in all nations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>);

 but when that great gathering day comes, there shall not one of them be
 missing; distance of place shall keep none out of heaven, if distance 
 of affection do not. <I>Undique ad c&oelig;los tantundem est 
 vi&aelig;--Heaven is equally accessible from every place.</I> See

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>32  Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
 tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer <I>is</I> nigh:
 &nbsp; 33  So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know
 that it is near, <I>even</I> at the doors.
 &nbsp; 34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till
 all these things be fulfilled.
 &nbsp; 35  Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not
 pass away.
 &nbsp; 36  But of that day and hour knoweth no <I>man,</I> no, not the
 angels of heaven, but my Father only.
 &nbsp; 37  But as the days of Noe <I>were,</I> so shall also the coming of
 the Son of man be.
 &nbsp; 38  For as in the days that were before the flood they were
 eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the
 day that Noe entered into the ark,
 &nbsp; 39  And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away;
 so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
 &nbsp; 40  Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and
 the other left.
 &nbsp; 41  Two <I>women shall be</I> grinding at the mill; the one shall be
 taken, and the other left.
 &nbsp; 42  Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth
 come.
 &nbsp; 43  But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in
 what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would
 not have suffered his house to be broken up.
 &nbsp; 44  Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think
 not the Son of man cometh.
 &nbsp; 45  Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath
 made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
 &nbsp; 46  Blessed <I>is</I> that servant, whom his lord when he cometh
 shall find so doing.
 &nbsp; 47  Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all
 his goods.
 &nbsp; 48  But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
 delayeth his coming;
 &nbsp; 49  And shall begin to smite <I>his</I> fellow-servants, and to eat
 and drink with the drunken;
 &nbsp; 50  The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh
 not for <I>him,</I> and in an hour that he is not aware of,
 &nbsp; 51  And shall cut him asunder, and appoint <I>him</I> his portion
 with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of
 teeth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the practical application of the foregoing prediction; in 
 general, we must expect and prepare for the events here foretold.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We must expect them; "<I>Now learn a parable of the fig-tree,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 Now learn what use to make of the things you have heard; so observe and 
 understand the signs of the times, and compare them with the 
 predictions of the word, as from thence to foresee what is at the door, 
 that you may provide accordingly." The parable of the fig-tree is no 
 more than this, that its budding and blossoming are a presage of 
 summer; for as the <I>stork</I> in the heaven, so the trees of the 
 field, <I>know their appointed time.</I> The beginning of the working 
 of second causes assures us of the progress and perfection of it. Thus 
 when God begins to fulfil prophecies, he will make an end. There is a 
 certain series in the works of providence, as there is in the works of 
 nature. The signs of the times are compared with the prognostics of 
 <I>the face of the sky</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:3"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 3</A>),

 so here with those of <I>the face of the earth;</I> when that is
 renewed, we foresee that summer is coming, not immediately, but at some 
 distance; after <I>the branch grows tender,</I> we expect the March 
 winds, and the April showers, before the summer comes; however, we are 
 sure it is coming; "so likewise ye, when the gospel day shall dawn, 
 count upon it, that through this variety of events which I have told 
 you of, the perfect day will come. <I>The things revealed must shortly 
 come to pass</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:1">Rev. i. 1</A>);

 they must come in their own order, in the order appointed for them.
 <I>Know that it is near.</I>" He does not here say what, but it is that 
 which the hearts of his disciples are upon, and which they are 
 inquisitive after, and long for; <I>the kingdom of God is near,</I> so 
 it is expressed in the parallel place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:31">Luke xxi. 31</A>.

 Note, When the trees of righteousness begin to bud and blossom, when
 God's people promise faithfulness, it is a happy presage of good times. 
 In them God begins his work, first prepares their heart, and then he 
 will go on with it; for, <I>as for God, his work is perfect;</I> and he 
 will <I>revive it in the midst of their years.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now touching the events foretold here, which we are to expect,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ here assures us of the certainty of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 <I>Heaven and earth shall pass away;</I> they continue this day indeed,
 according to God's ordinance, but they shall not continue for ever

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:25,26,2Pe+3:10">Ps. cii. 25, 26; 2 Pet. iii. 10</A>);

 <I>but my words shall not pass away.</I> Note, The word of Christ is
 more sure and lasting than heaven and earth. <I>Hath he spoken? And 
 shall he not do it?</I> We may build with more assurance upon the word 
 of Christ than we can upon the pillars of heaven, or the strong 
 foundations of the earth; for, when they shall be made to tremble and 
 totter, and shall be no more, the word of Christ shall remain, and be 
 in full force, power, and virtue. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:24,25">1 Pet. i. 24, 25</A>.

 <I>It is easier for heaven and earth to pass,</I> than the word of
 Christ; so it is expressed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:17">Luke xvi. 17</A>.
 
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:10">Isa. liv. 10</A>.

 The accomplishment of these prophecies might seem to be delayed, and
 intervening events might seem to disagree with them, but do not think 
 that therefore the word of Christ is fallen to the ground, for that 
 shall never pass away: though it be not fulfilled, either in the time 
 or in the way that we have prescribed; yet, in God's time, which is the 
 best time, and in God's way, which is the best way, it shall certainly 
 be fulfilled. Every word of Christ is very pure, and therefore very 
 sure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He here instructs us as to the time of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:34,36"><I>v.</I> 34, 36</A>.

 As to this, it is well observed by the learned Grotius, that there is a 
 manifest distinction made between the <B><I>tauta</I></B>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 and the <B><I>ekeine</I></B>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 <I>these things,</I> and <I>that day and hour;</I> which will help to
 clear this prophecy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As to <I>these things,</I> the wars, seductions, and persecutions, 
 here foretold, and especially the ruin of the Jewish nation; "<I>This 
 generation shall not pass away, till all these things be fulfilled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 there are those now alive, that shall see Jerusalem destroyed, and the
 Jewish church brought to an end." Because it might seem strange, he 
 backs it with a solemn asseveration; "<I>Verily, I say unto you.</I> 
 You may take my word for it, these things are at the door." Christ 
 often speaks of the nearness of that desolation, the more to affect 
 people, and quicken them to prepare for it. Note, There may be greater 
 trials and troubles yet before us, in our own day, than we are aware 
 of. They that are old, know not what sons of Anak may be reserved for 
 their last encounters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) But as to <I>that day and hour</I> which will put a period to 
 time, <I>that knoweth no man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 Therefore take heed of confounding these two, as <I>they</I> did, who, 
 from the words of Christ and the apostles; letters, inferred that 
 <I>the day of Christ was at hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:2">2 Thess. ii. 2</A>.

 No, it was not; <I>this generation,</I> and many another, <I>shall
 pass,</I> before <I>that day and hour</I> come. Note,

 [1.] There is a certain day and hour fixed for the judgment to come; it 
 is called <I>the day of the Lord,</I> because so unalterably fixed. 
 None of God's judgments are adjourned <I>sine die--without the 
 appointment of a certain day.</I>

 [2.] That day and hour are a great secret.</P>

 <BR>And sown their seeds in depth of nights.--H<FONT SIZE=-1>ORACE</FONT>.</TD></TR>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>No man knows it;</I> not the wisest by their sagacity, not the best 
 by any divine discovery. We all know that there shall be such a day; 
 but none knows when it shall be, no, not the angels; though their 
 capacities for knowledge are great, and their opportunities of knowing 
 this advantageous (they dwell at the fountain-head of light), and 
 though they are to be employed in the solemnity of that day, yet they 
 are not told when it shall be: none <I>knows but my Father only.</I> 
 This is one of those <I>secret things</I> which <I>belong to the Lord 
 our God.</I> The uncertainty of the time of Christ's coming, is, to 
 those who are watchful, <I>a savour of life unto life,</I> and makes 
 them more watchful; but to those who are careless, it is <I>a savour of 
 death unto death,</I> and makes them more careless.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To this end we must expect these events, that we may prepare for 
 them; and here we have a caution against security and sensuality, which 
 will make it a dismal day indeed to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:37-41"><I>v.</I> 37-41</A>.

 In these verses we have such an idea given us of the judgment day, as 
 may serve to startle and awaken us, that we may not sleep as others 
 do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It will be a surprising day, and a separating day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It will be a surprising day, as the deluge was to the old world, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:37-39"><I>v.</I> 37-39</A>.

 That which he here intends to describe, is, the posture of the world at 
 the coming of the Son of man; besides his first coming, to save, he has 
 other comings to judge. He saith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:39">John ix. 39</A>),

 <I>For judgment I am come;</I> and for judgment he will come; for all
 judgment is committed to him, both that of the word, and that of the 
 sword.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this here is applicable,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To <I>temporal judgments,</I> particularly that which was now 
 hastening upon the nation and people of the Jews; though they had fair 
 warning given them of it, and there were many prodigies that were 
 presages of it, yet it found them secure, crying, <I>Peace and 
 safety,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:3">1 Thess. v. 3</A>.

 The siege was laid to Jerusalem by Titus Vespasian, when they were met 
 at the passover in the midst of their mirth; like the men of Laish, 
 they dwelt careless when the ruin arrested them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:7,27">Judg. xviii. 7, 27</A>.

 The destruction of Babylon, both that in the Old Testament and that in
 the New, comes when she saith, <I>I shall be a lady for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:7-9,Re+18:7">Isa. xlvii. 7-9; Rev. xviii. 7</A>.

 Therefore the plagues come in a moment, in one day. Note, Men's
 unbelief shall not make God's threatenings of no effect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To <I>the eternal judgment;</I> so the judgment of the great day 
 is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:2">Heb. vi. 2</A>.

 Though notice has been given of it from Enoch, yet, when it comes, it
 will be unlooked for by the most of men; the latter days, which are 
 nearest to that day, will produce scoffers, that say, <I>Where is the 
 promise of his coming?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:3,4,Lu+18:8">2 Pet. iii. 3, 4; Luke xviii. 8</A>.

 Thus it will be when the world that now is shall be destroyed by fire;
 for thus it was when the old world, being overflowed by water, 
 perished,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:6,7">2 Pet. iii. 6, 7</A>.
 
 Now Christ here shows what were the temper and posture of the old world
 when the deluge came.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They were sensual and worldly; <I>they were eating and drinking, 
 marrying and giving in marriage.</I> It is not said, They were killing 
 and stealing, and whoring and swearing (these were indeed the horrid 
 crimes of some of the worst of them; <I>the earth was full of 
 violence</I>); but they were all of them, except Noah, over head and 
 ears in the world, and regardless of the word of God, and this ruined 
 them. Note, Universal neglect of religion is a more dangerous symptom 
 to any people than particular instances here and there of daring 
 irreligion. <I>Eating and drinking</I> are necessary to the 
 preservation of man's life; <I>marrying and giving in marriage</I> are 
 necessary to the preservation of mankind; but, <I>Licitus perimus 
 omnes--These lawful things undo us,</I> unlawfully managed. 
 <I>First,</I> They were unreasonable in it, inordinate and entire in 
 the pursuit of the delights of sense, and the gains of the world; they 
 were wholly taken up with these things, <B><I>esan trogontes</I></B>--<I>they 
 were eating;</I> they were in these things as in their
 element, as if they had their being for no other end than <I>to eat and
 drink,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:12">Isa. lvi. 12</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> They were unreasonable in it; they were entire and
 intent upon the world and the flesh, when the destruction was at the 
 door, which they had had such fair warning of. They were eating and
 drinking, when they should have been repenting and praying; when God, 
 by the ministry of Noah, called to <I>weeping and mourning, then joy 
 and gladness.</I> This was to them, as it was to Israel afterwards, the 
 unpardonable sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:12,14">Isa. xxii. 12, 14</A>),

 especially, because it was in defiance of those warnings by which they
 should have been awakened. "<I>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we
 die;</I> if it must be a short life, let it be a merry one." The
 apostle James speaks of this as the general practice of the wealthy
 Jews before the destruction of Jerusalem; when they should have been
 <I>weeping for the miseries that were coming upon them, they were
 living in pleasure, and nourishing their hearts as in a day of
 slaughter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:1,5">Jam. v. 1, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] They were secure and careless; <I>they knew not, until the flood 
 came,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 <I>Knew not!</I> Surely they could not but know. Did not God, by Noah, 
 give them fair warning of it? Did he not call them to repentance, while 
 his long-suffering waited? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:19,20">1 Pet. iii. 19, 20</A>.

 But they knew not, that is, they believed not; they might have known,
 but would not know. Note, What we know of <I>the things that belong to 
 our everlasting peace,</I> if we do not mix faith with it, and improve 
 it, is all one as if we did not know it at all. Their <I>not 
 knowing</I> is joined with their <I>eating, and drinking, and 
 marrying;</I> for, <I>First, Therefore</I> they were sensual, because 
 they were secure. Note, the reason why people are so eager in the
 pursuit, and so entangled in the pleasures of this world, is, because 
 they do not know, and believe, and consider, the eternity which they 
 are upon the brink of. Did we know aright that all these things must 
 shortly be dissolved, and we must certainly survive them, we should not 
 set our eyes and hearts so much upon them as we do. <I>Secondly, 
 Therefore</I> they were secure, because they were sensual; 
 <I>therefore</I> they knew not that the flood was coming, because they 
 were eating and drinking; were so taken up with things seen and 
 present, that they had neither time nor heart to mind the things not 
 seen as yet, which they were warned of. Note, As security bolsters men
 up in their brutal sensuality; so sensuality rocks them asleep in their 
 carnal security. <I>The knew not, until the flood came.</I> 

 1. The flood did come, though they would not foresee it. Note, Those
 that will not know by faith, shall be made to know by feeling, <I>the 
 wrath of God revealed from heaven against their ungodliness and 
 unrighteousness.</I> The evil day is never the further off for men's 
 putting it far off from them. 

 2. They did not know it till it was too late to prevent it, as they
 might have done if they had known it in time, which made it so much the 
 more grievous. Judgments are most terrible and amazing to the secure, 
 and those that have made a jest of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The application of this, concerning the old world, we have in these 
 words; <I>So shall the coming of the Son of man be;</I> that is, 

 (1.) In such a posture shall he find people, eating and drinking, and
 not expecting him. Note, Security and sensuality are likely to be the 
 epidemical diseases of the latter days. All <I>slumber and sleep, and 
 at midnight the bridegroom comes.</I> All are off their watch, and at 
 their ease.

 (2.) With such a power, and for such a purpose, will he come upon them.
 As the flood took away the sinners of the old world, irresistibly and 
 irrecoverably; so shall secure sinners, that mocked at Christ and his 
 coming, be taken away by <I>the wrath of the Lamb, when the great day 
 of his wrath comes,</I> which will be like the coming of the deluge, a 
 destruction which there is no fleeing from.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It will be a separating day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:40,41"><I>v.</I> 40, 41</A>);

 <I>Then shall two be in the field.</I> Two ways this may be
 applied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We may apply it to the success of the gospel, especially at the 
 first preaching of it; it divided the world; <I>some believed the 
 things which were spoken,</I> and were taken to Christ; <I>others 
 believed not,</I> and were left to perish in their unbelief. Those of 
 the same age, place, capacity, employment, and condition, in the world, 
 <I>grinding in the same mill,</I> those of the same family, nay, those 
 that were joined in the same bond of marriage, were, one effectually 
 called, the other passed by, and left in the gall of bitterness. This 
 is that division, that separating fire, which Christ <I>came to 
 send,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:49,51">Luke xii. 49, 51</A>.

 <I>This</I> renders free grace the more obliging, that it is
 distinguishing; <I>to us, and not to the world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:22">John xiv. 22</A>),

 nay to us, and not to those in the same field, the same mill, the same
 house.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When ruin came upon Jerusalem, a distinction was made by Divine 
 Providence, according to that which had been before made by divine 
 grace; for all the Christians among them were saved from perishing in 
 that calamity, by the special care of Heaven. If two were at work in 
 the field together, and one of them was a Christian, he was taken into 
 a place of shelter, and had his life given him for a prey, while the 
 other was left to the sword of the enemy. Nay, if but two women were 
 grinding at the mill, if one of them belonged to Christ, though but a 
 woman, a poor woman, a servant, she was taken to a place of safety, and 
 the other abandoned. Thus <I>the meek of the earth are hid in the day 
 of the Lord's anger</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:3">Zeph. ii. 3</A>),

 either in heaven, or <I>under</I> heaven. Note, Distinguishing
 preservations, in times of general destruction, are special tokens of 
 God's favour, and ought so to be acknowledged. If we are safe when 
 thousands fall on our right hand and our left, are not consumed when 
 others are consumed round about us, so that we are as brands plucked 
 out of the fire, we have reason to say, <I>It is of the Lord's 
 mercies,</I> and it is a great mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We may apply it to the second coming of Jesus Christ, and the 
 separation which will be made in that day. He had said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 
 that the elect will be <I>gathered together.</I> Here he tells us,
 that, in order to that, they will be distinguished from those who were 
 nearest to them in this world; the choice and chosen ones taken to 
 glory, the other left to perish eternally. Those who sleep in the dust 
 of the earth, two in the same grave, their ashed mixed, shall yet 
 arise, one to be taken to everlasting life, the other left <I>to shame 
 and everlasting contempt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:2">Dan. xii. 2</A>.

 Here it is applied to them who shall be found alive. Christ will come
 unlooked for, will find people busy at their usual occupations, <I>in 
 the field, at the mill;</I> and then, according as they are vessels of 
 mercy prepared for glory, or vessels of wrath prepared for ruin, 
 accordingly it will be with them; the one taken <I>to meet the Lord and 
 his angels in the air, to be for ever with him and them;</I> the other 
 left to the devil and his angels, who, when Christ has gathered out his 
 own, will sweep up the residue. This will aggravate the condemnation
 of sinners that others shall be taken from the midst of them to glory, 
 and they left behind. And it speaks abundance of comfort to the Lord's 
 people.

 [1.] Are they mean and despised in the world, as the man-servant in the 
 field, or the maid at the mill

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:5">Exod. xi. 5</A>)?

 Yet they shall not be forgotten or overlooked in that day. The poor in
 the world, if rich in faith, are <I>heirs of the kingdom.</I> 

 [2.] Are they dispersed in distant and unlikely places, where one would
 not expect to find the heirs of glory, <I>in the field, at the 
 mill?</I> Yet the angels will find them there (hidden as Saul among the 
 stuff, when they are to be enthroned), and fetch them thence; and well 
 may they be said to be <I>changed,</I> for a very great change it will 
 be to go to heaven from ploughing and grinding.

 [3.] Are they weak, and unable of themselves to move heavenward? They
 shall be taken, or <I>laid hold of,</I> as Lot was taken out of Sodom
 by a gracious violence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:16">Gen. xix. 16</A>.

 Those whom Christ has once apprehended and laid hold on, he will never
 lose his hold of.

 [4.] Are they intermixed with others, linked with them in the same 
 habitations, societies, employments? Let not that discourage any true 
 Christian; God knows how to separate between the precious and the vile, 
 the gold and dross in the same lump, the wheat and chaff in the same 
 floor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is a general exhortation to us, <I>to watch, and be ready</I> 
 against that day comes, enforced by divers weighty considerations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>,

 &c. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The duty required; <I>Watch, and be ready,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:42,44"><I>v.</I> 42, 44</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Watch therefore,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 Note, It is the great duty and interest of all the disciples of Christ 
 to watch, to be awake and keep awake, that they may mind their 
 business. As a sinful state or way is compared to <I>sleep,</I> 
 senseless and inactive

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:6">1 Thess. v. 6</A>),

 so a gracious state or way is compared to <I>watching</I> and
 <I>waking.</I> We must watch for our Lord's coming, to us in particular 
 at our death, <I>after which is the judgment,</I> that is <I>the great 
 day</I> with us, the end of our time; and his coming at the end of all 
 time to judge the world, the <I>great day</I> with all mankind. To 
 watch implies not only to believe that our Lord will come, but to 
 desire that he would come, to be often thinking of his coming, and 
 always looking for it as sure and near, and the time of it uncertain. 
 To watch for Christ's coming, is to maintain that gracious temper and 
 disposition of mind which we should be willing that our Lord, when he 
 comes, should find us in. To watch is to be aware of the first notices 
 of his approach, that we may immediately attend his motions, and 
 address ourselves to the duty of meeting him. Watching is supposed to 
 be in the night, which is sleeping time; while we are in this world, it 
 is <I>night</I> with us, and we must take pains to keep ourselves 
 awake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Be ye also ready.</I> We wake in vain, if we do not get ready. 
 It is not enough to <I>look</I> for such things; but we must therefore 
 <I>give diligence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:11,14">2 Pet. iii. 11, 14</A>.

 We have then our Lord to attend upon, and we must have our lamps ready
 trimmed; a cause to be tried, and we must have our plea ready drawn and 
 signed by our Advocate; a reckoning to make up, and we must have our 
 accounts ready stated and balanced; there is an inheritance which we 
 then hope to enter upon, and we must have ourselves ready, made meet to 
 partake of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:12">Col. i. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reasons to induce us to this watchfulness and diligent 
 preparation for that day; which are two.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Because the time of our Lord's coming is very uncertain. This is 
 the reason immediately annexed to the double exhortation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:42,44"><I>v.</I> 42, 44</A>);

 and it is illustrated by a comparison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.
 
 Let us consider then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That <I>we know not what hour he will come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 We know not <I>the day of our death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:2">Gen. xxvii. 2</A>.

 We may know that we have but <I>a little time to live (The time of my
 departure is at hand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:6">2 Tim. iv. 6</A>);

 but we cannot know that we have a long time to live, for our souls are
 continually in our hands; nor can we know how little a time we have to 
 live, for it may prove less than we expect; much less do we know the 
 time fixed for the general judgment. Concerning both we are kept at 
 uncertainty, that we may, every day, expect that which may come any 
 day; may never boast of a year's continuance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:13">James iv. 13</A>),

 no, nor of tomorrow's return, as if it were ours, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:1,Lu+12:20">Prov. xxvii. 1; Luke xii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That he may <I>come at such an hour as we think not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.
 
 Though there be such uncertainty in the time, there is none in the 
 thing itself: though we know not <I>when</I> he will come, we are sure 
 he <I>will</I> come. His parting word was, <I>Surely I come 
 quickly;</I> his saying, "I come <I>surely,</I>" obliges us to expect 
 him: his saying "I come <I>quickly.</I>" obliges us to be always 
 expecting him; for it keeps us in a state of expectancy. <I>In such an 
 hour as you think not,</I> that is, such an hour as they who are 
 unready and unprepared, think not 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>);

 nay, such an hour as the most lively expectants perhaps thought least
 likely. The bridegroom came when the wise were slumbering. It is 
 agreeable to our present state, that we should be under the influence 
 of a constant and general expectation, rather than that of particular 
 presages and prognostications, which we are sometimes tempted vainly to 
 desire and wish for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] That the children of this world are thus wise in their generation, 
 that, when they know of a danger approaching, they will keep awake, and 
 stand on their guard against it. This he shows in a particular 
 instance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 If the master of a house had notice that a thief would come such a 
 night, and such a watch of the night (for they divided the night into 
 four watches, allowing three hours to each), and would make an attempt 
 upon his house, though it were the midnight-watch, when he was most 
 sleepy, yet he would be up, and listen to every noise in every corner, 
 and be ready to give him a warm reception. Now, though we know not 
 <I>just when</I> our Lord will come, yet, knowing that he <I>will</I> 
 come, and come quickly, and without any other warning than what he hath 
 given in his word, it concerns us to watch always. Note, <I>First,</I> 
 We have every one of us a house to keep, which lies exposed, in which 
 all we are worth is laid up: that house is our own souls, which we must 
 <I>keep with all diligence. Secondly,</I> The day of the Lord comes 
 <I>by surprise, as a thief in the night.</I> Christ chooses to come 
 when he is least expected, that the triumphs of his enemies may be 
 turned into the greater shame, and the fears of his friends into the 
 greater joy. <I>Thirdly,</I> If Christ, when he comes, finds us asleep 
 and unready, our house will be broken up, and we shall lose all we are 
 worth, not as by a thief unjustly, but as by a just and legal process; 
 death and judgment will seize upon all we have, to our irreparable 
 damage and utter undoing. Therefore be ready, <I>be ye also ready;</I> 
 as ready at all times as the good man of the house would be at the hour 
 when he expected the thief: we must put on the armour of God, that we 
 may not only stand in that evil day, but, as more than conquerors, may 
 divide the spoil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Because the issue of our Lord's coming will be very happy and 
 comfortable to those that shall be found ready, but very dismal and 
 dreadful to those that shall not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>,

 &c. This is represented by the different state of good and bad
 servants, when their lord comes to reckon with them. It is likely to be 
 well or ill with us to eternity, according as we are found ready or 
 unready at that day; for Christ comes <I>to render to every man 
 according to his works.</I> Now this parable, with which the chapter 
 closes, is applicable to all Christians, who are in profession and 
 obligation God's servants; but it seems especially intended as a 
 warning to ministers; for the servant spoken of is a <I>steward.</I> 
 Now observe what Christ here saith,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Concerning the <I>good servant;</I> he shows here what he is--<I>a 
 ruler of the household;</I> what, being so, he should 
 be--<I>faithful</I> and <I>wise;</I> and what, if he be so, he shall be 
 eternally-<I>blessed.</I> Here are good instructions and encouragements 
 to the ministers of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> We have here his place and office. He is one <I>whom the 
 Lord has made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due 
 season.</I> Note, 

 1. The church of Christ is his household, or family, standing in
 relation to him as the Father and Master of it. It is <I>the household 
 of God,</I> a family named from Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:15">Eph. iii. 15</A>.

 2. Gospel ministers are appointed <I>rulers</I> in this household; not
 at princes (Christ has entered a caveat against that), but as stewards, 
 or other subordinate officers; not as lords, but as guides; not to 
 prescribe new ways, but to show and lead in the ways that Christ has 
 appointed: that is the signification of the <B><I>hegoumenoi</I></B>, 
 which we translate, <I>having rule over you</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:17">Heb. xiii. 17</A>);

 as <I>overseers,</I> not to cut out new work, but to direct in, and
 quicken to, the work which Christ has ordered; that is the 
 signification of <B><I>episkopoi</I></B>--<I>bishops.</I> They are 
 rulers by Christ; what power they have is derived from him, and none 
 may take it from them, or abridge it to them; he is one whom <I>the 
 Lord has made ruler;</I> Christ has the <I>making</I> of ministers.
 They are rulers <I>under</I> Christ, and act in subordination to him; 
 and rulers <I>for</I> Christ, for the advancement of his kingdom. 

 3. The work of gospel ministers is to give to Christ's household their
 meat in due season, as stewards, and therefore they have the keys 
 delivered to them.

 (1.) Their work is <I>to give,</I> not take to themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:8">Ezek. xxxiv. 8</A>),

 but give to the family what the Master has bought, to <I>dispense</I>
 what Christ has <I>purchased.</I> And to ministers it is said, that
 <I>it is more blessed to give than to receive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:35">Acts xx. 35</A>.

 (2.) It is to give <I>meat;</I> not to give <I>law</I> (that is
 Christ's work), but to deliver those doctrines to the church which, if 
 duly digested, will be nourishment to souls. They must give, not the 
 poison of false doctrines, not the stones of hard and unprofitable 
 doctrines, but the meat that is <I>sound</I> and <I>wholesome.</I>

 (3.) It must be given <I>in due season,</I> <B><I>en
 kairo</I></B>--<I>while there is time for it;</I> when eternity comes, 
 it will be too late; we must <I>work while it is day:</I> or <I>in 
 time,</I> that is, whenever any opportunity offers itself; or in the 
 stated time, time after time, according as the duty of every day 
 requires.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> His right discharge of this office. The good servant, 
 if thus preferred, will be a good <I>steward;</I> for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He is <I>faithful;</I> stewards must be so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:2">1 Cor. iv. 2</A>.

 He that is <I>trusted,</I> must be trusty; and the greater the trust
 is, the more is expected from them. It is a great good thing that is 
 committed to <I>ministers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:14">2 Tim. i. 14</A>);

 and they must be faithful, as Moses was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:2">Heb. iii. 2</A>.

 Christ counts those ministers, and those only, that are
 <I>faithful,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:12">1 Tim. i. 12</A>.

 A faithful minister of Jesus Christ is one that sincerely designs his
 master's honour, not his own; delivers <I>the whole counsel of God,</I> 
 not his own fancies and conceits; follows Christ's institutions and 
 adheres to them; regards the meanest, reproves the greatest, and doth 
 not respect persons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is wise to understand his duty and the proper season of it; and 
 in guiding of the flock there is need, not only of the integrity of the 
 heart, but the skilfulness of the hands. Honesty may suffice for a good 
 <I>servant,</I> but wisdom is necessary to a <I>good steward;</I> for 
 it is profitable to direct.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He is doing; <I>so doing</I> as his office requires. The ministry is 
 a good work, and they whose office it is, have always something to do; 
 they must not indulge themselves in ease, nor leave the work undone, or 
 carelessly turn it off to others, but be doing, and doing to the 
 purpose--<I>so doing,</I> giving meat to the household, minding their 
 own business, and not meddling with that which is foreign; <I>so 
 doing</I> as the Master has appointed, as the office imports, and as 
 the case of the family requires; not <I>talking,</I> but <I>doing.</I> 
 It was the motto Mr. Perkins used, <I>Minister verbi es--You are a 
 minister of the word.</I> Not only <I>Age--Be doing;</I> but <I>Hoc 
 age--Be so doing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He is <I>found doing</I> when his Master comes; which intimates, 
 
 (1.) Constancy at his work. At what hour soever his Master comes, he is
 found busy at the work of the day. Ministers should not leave empty 
 spaces in their time, lest their Lord should come in one of those empty 
 spaces. As with a good God the end of one mercy is the beginning of 
 another, so with a good man, a good minister, the end of one duty is 
 the beginning of another. When Calvin was persuaded to remit his 
 ministerial labours, he answered, with some resentment, "What, would 
 you have my Master find me idle?" 

 (2.) Perseverance in his work till the Lord come. <I>Hold fast till
 then,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:25">Rev. ii. 25</A>.

 <I>Continue in these things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:16,6:14">1 Tim. iv. 16; vi. 14</A>.

 Endure to the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> The recompence of reward intended him for this, in 
 three things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He shall be taken notice of. This is intimated in these words, Who 
 then is that <I>faithful and wise servant?</I> Which supposes that 
 there are but few who answer this character; such an interpreter is 
 <I>one of a thousand,</I> such a faithful and wise <I>steward.</I> 
 Those who thus distinguish themselves now by humility, diligence, and 
 sincerity in their work, Christ will in the great day both dignify and 
 distinguish by the glory conferred on them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He shall be blessed? <I>Blessed is that servant;</I> and Christ's 
 pronouncing him blessed makes him so. All the dead that die n the Lord 
 are blessed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:13">Rev. xiv. 13</A>.

 But there is a peculiar blessedness secured to them that approve 
 themselves faithful stewards, and are found so doing. Next to the
 honour of those who die in the field of battle, suffering for Christ as 
 the martyrs, is the honour of those that die in the field of service, 
 ploughing, and sowing, and reaping, for Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He shall be preferred 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>);

 <I>He shall make him ruler over all his goods.</I> The allusion is to
 the way of great men, who, if the stewards of their house conduct 
 themselves well in that place, commonly prefer them to be the managers 
 of their estates; thus Joseph was preferred in the house of Potiphar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:4,6">Gen. xxix. 4, 6</A>.

 But the greatest honour which the kindest master ever did to his most
 tried servants in this world, is nothing to that weight of glory which 
 the Lord Jesus will confer upon his faithful watchful servants in the 
 world to come. What is here said by a similitude, is the same that is
 said more plainly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:26">John xi. 26</A>,

 <I>Him will my Father honour.</I> And God's servants, when thus
 preferred; shall be perfect in wisdom and holiness to bear that weight 
 of glory, so that there is no danger from these servants when they 
 reign.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Concerning the <I>evil</I> servant. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> His description given 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:48,49"><I>v.</I> 48, 49</A>);

 where we have the wretch drawn in his own colours. The vilest of
 creatures is a wicked man, the vilest of men is a wicked Christian, and 
 the vilest of them a wicked minister. <I>Corruptio optimi est 
 pessima--What is best, when corrupted, becomes the worst.</I> 
 Wickedness in the prophets of Jerusalem is a <I>horrible</I> thing 
 indeed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:14">Jer. xxiii. 14</A>.
 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The cause of his wickedness; and that is, a practical disbelief of 
 Christ's second coming; He hath <I>said in his heart, My Lord delays 
 his coming;</I> and therefore he begins to think he will never come, 
 but has quite forsaken his church. Observe,

 (1.) Christ knows that <I>they</I> say in their hearts, who with their
 lips cry, <I>Lord, Lord,</I> as this servant here. 

 (2.) The delay of Christ's coming, though it is a gracious instance of
 his patience, is greatly abused by wicked people, whose hearts are 
 thereby hardened in their wicked ways. When Christ's coming is looked 
 upon as doubtful, or a thing at an immense distance, the hearts of 
 <I>men are fully set to do evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:11">Eccl. viii. 11</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:27">Ezek. xii. 27</A>.

 They that walk by sense, are ready to say of the unseen Jesus, as the
 people did of Moses when he tarried in the mount upon their errand, 
 <I>We wot not what is become of him,</I> and therefore <I>up, make us 
 gods,</I> the world a god, the belly a god, any thing but him that 
 should be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The particulars of his wickedness; and they are sins of the first 
 magnitude; he is a slave to his passions and his appetites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Persecution is here charged upon him. He begins to <I>smite his 
 fellow servants.</I> Note, 

 [1.] Even the stewards of the house are to look upon all the servants 
 of the house as their fellow servants, and therefore are forbidden to 
 <I>lord it over them.</I> If the angel call himself <I>fellow 
 servant</I> to John

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:10">Rev. xix. 10</A>),

 no marvel if John have learned to call himself <I>brother</I> to the
 Christians of the churches of Asia, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:9">Rev. i. 9</A>.

 [2.] It is no new thing to see evil servants smiting their fellow 
 servants; both private Christians and faithful ministers. He smites 
 them, either because they reprove him, or because they will not bow, 
 and do him reverence; will not say as he saith, and do as he doeth, 
 against their consciences: he smites them with the tongue, as they 
 smote the prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:18">Jer. xviii. 18</A>.

 And if he get power into his hand, or can press those into his service
 that have, as the ten horns upon the head of the beast, it goes 
 further. Pashur the priest smote Jeremiah, and put him in the stocks,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:2">Jer. xx. 2</A>.

 The revolters have often been of all others most <I>profound to make
 slaughter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:2">Hos. v. 2</A>.

 The steward, when he smites his fellow servants, does it under colour
 of his Master's authority, and in his name; he says, <I>Let the Lord be 
 glorified</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5">Isa. lxvi. 5</A>);

 but he shall know that he could not put a greater affront upon his
 Master.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Profaneness and immorality; <I>He begins to eat and drink with the 
 drunken.</I> 

 [1.] He associates with the worst of sinners, has fellowship with them, 
 is intimate with them; he walks in their counsel, stands in their way, 
 sits in their seat, and sings their songs. The drunken are the merry 
 and jovial company, and those he is for, and thus he hardens them in 
 their wickedness.

 [2.] He does like them; <I>eats, and drinks, and is drunken;</I> so it
 is in Luke. This is an inlet to all manner of sin. Drunkenness is a 
 leading wickedness; they who are slaves to that, are never masters of 
 themselves in any thing else. The persecutors of God's people have 
 commonly been the most vicious and immoral men. Persecuting 
 consciences, whatever the pretensions be, are commonly the most 
 profligate and debauched consciences. What will not <I>they</I> be 
 drunk with, that will be <I>drunk with the blood of the saints?</I> 
 Well, this is the description of a wicked minister, who yet may have 
 the common gifts of learning and utterance above others; and, as hath 
 been said of some, may preach so well in the pulpit, that it is a pity 
 he should ever come out, and yet live so ill out of the pulpit, that it 
 is a pity he should ever come in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> His doom read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:50,51"><I>v.</I> 50, 51</A>.

 The coat and character of wicked ministers will not only not secure 
 them from condemnation, but will greatly aggravate it. They can plead 
 no exemption from Christ's jurisdiction, whatever they pretend to, in 
 the church of Rome, from that of the civil magistrate; there is no 
 benefit of clergy at Christ's bar. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The surprise that will accompany his doom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>);

 <I>The Lord of that servant will come.</I> Note,

 (1.) Our putting off the thoughts of Christ's coming will not put off
 his coming. Whatever fancy he deludes himself with, his Lord will come. 
 The unbelief of man shall not make that great promise, or threatening 
 (call it which you will), of no effect.

 (2.) The coming of Christ will be a most dreadful surprise to secure
 and careless sinners, especially to wicked ministers; <I>He shall come 
 in a day when he looketh not for him.</I> Note, Those that have 
 slighted the warnings of the word, and silenced those of their own 
 consciences concerning the judgment to come, cannot expect any other 
 warnings; these will be adjudged sufficient legal notice given, whether 
 taken or no; and no unfairness can be charged on Christ, if he come 
 suddenly, without giving other notice. Behold, he has told us 
 before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The severity of his doom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>.

 It is not more severe than righteous, but it is a doom that carries in 
 it utter ruin, wrapt up in two dreadful words, <I>death</I> and 
 <I>damnation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Death. His Lord shall <I>cut him asunder,</I> <B><I>dikotomesei 
 auton</I></B>, "he shall cut him off from the land of the living," from 
 the congregation of the righteous, shall separate him unto evil; which 
 is the definition of a <I>curse</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:21">Deut. xxix. 21</A>),

 shall cut him down, as a tree that cumbers the ground; perhaps it
 alludes to the sentence often used in the law, <I>That soul shall be 
 cut off from his people;</I> denoting an utter extirpation. Death cuts 
 off a good man, as a choice imp is cut off to be grafted in a better 
 stock; but it cuts off a wicked man, as a withered branch is cut off 
 for the fire-cuts him off from this world, which he set his heart so 
 much upon, and was, as it were, one with. Or, as we read it, <I>shall 
 cut him asunder,</I> that is, part body and soul, send the body to the 
 grave to be a prey for worms, and the soul to hell to be a prey for 
 devils, and there is the sinner cut asunder. The soul and body of a 
 godly man at death part fairly, the one cheerfully lifted up to God, 
 the other left to the dust; but the soul and body of a wicked man at 
 death are cut asunder, torn asunder, for to them death is the <I>king 
 of terrors,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:14">Job xviii. 14</A>.

 The wicked servant divided himself between God and the world, Christ
 and Belial, his profession and his lusts, justly therefore will he thus 
 be divided.</P>
