 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The cure which our Lord Jesus wrought upon a man that had the
 dropsy, on the sabbath day, and his justifying himself therein against 
 those who were offended at his doing it on that day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. A lesson of humility gives to those who were ambitious of the
 highest rooms, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:7-11">ver. 7-11</A>.

 III. A lesson of charity to those who feasted the rich, and did not
 feed the poor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 IV. The success of the gospel not foretold in the parable of the
 guests invited to a feast, signifying the rejection of the Jews and all
 others that set their hearts upon this world, and the entertainment of
 the Gentiles and all others that come to be filled with Christ, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:15-24">ver. 15-24</A>.

 V. The great law of discipleship laid down, with a caution to all that 
 will be Christ's disciples to undertake it deliberately and with 
 consideration, and particularly to ministers, to retain their savour,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the
 chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they
 watched him.
 &nbsp; 2 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the
 dropsy.
 &nbsp; 3 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees,
 saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?
 &nbsp; 4 And they held their peace. And he took <I>him,</I> and healed him,
 and let him go;
 &nbsp; 5 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or
 an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on
 the sabbath day?
 &nbsp; 6 And they could not answer him again to these things.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this passage of story we find,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That <I>the Son of man came eating and drinking,</I> conversing 
 familiarly with all sorts of people; not declining the society of 
 publicans, though they were of <I>ill fame,</I> nor of Pharisees, 
 though they bore him <I>ill will,</I> but accepting the friendly 
 invitations both of the one and the other, that, if possible, he might 
 do good to <I>both.</I> Here he <I>went into the house of one of the 
 chief Pharisees,</I> a ruler, it may be, and a magistrate in his 
 country, <I>to eat bread on the sabbath day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 See how favourable God is to us, that he allows us time, even on his
 own day, for bodily refreshments; and how careful we should be not to 
 abuse that liberty, or turn it into licentiousness. Christ went only to 
 <I>eat bread,</I> to take such refreshment as was necessary on the 
 sabbath day. Our sabbath meals must, with a particular care, be guarded 
 against all manner of excess. On sabbath days we must do as Moses and 
 Jethro did, <I>eat bread before God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:12">Exod. xviii. 12</A>),

 and, as is said of the primitive Christians, on the Lord's day, must 
 <I>eat and drink</I> as those that must <I>pray again before we go to 
 rest,</I> that we may not be unfit for that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That he <I>went about doing good.</I> Wherever he came he 
 <I>sought</I> opportunities to <I>do good,</I> and not only improved 
 those that <I>fell in his way.</I> Here was <I>a certain man before him 
 who had the dropsy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 We do not find that he offered himself, or that his friends offered him
 to be Christ's patient, but Christ <I>prevented him</I> with the 
 blessings of his goodness, and <I>before he called</I> he answered him. 
 Note, It is a happy thing to be where Christ is, to be present 
 <I>before him,</I> though we be not presented <I>to him.</I> This man 
 had the <I>dropsy,</I> it is probable, in a high degree, and appeared 
 much swoln with it; probably he was some relation of the Pharisee's, 
 that now <I>lodged</I> in his house, which is more likely than that he 
 should be an <I>invited guest</I> at the table.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That he <I>endured the contradiction of sinners against himself: 
 They watched him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The Pharisee that invited him, it should seem, did it with a design to
 pick some quarrel with him; if it were so, Christ <I>knew</I> it, and 
 yet <I>went,</I> for he knew himself a match for the most <I>subtle</I> 
 of them, and knew how to order his steps with an eye to <I>his 
 observers.</I> Those that are <I>watched</I> had need to be 
 <I>wary.</I> It is, as Dr. Hammond observes, contrary to all laws of 
 hospitality to seek advantage against one that you invited to be your 
 guest, for such a one you have taken under your protection. These 
 lawyers and Pharisees, like the fowler that lies in wait to 
 <I>ensnare</I> the birds, <I>held their peace,</I> and acted very 
 <I>silently.</I> When Christ asked them <I>whether</I> they thought it 
 <I>lawful to heal on the sabbath day</I> (and herein he is said to 
 <I>answer</I> them, for it was an answer to <I>their thoughts,</I> and 
 thoughts are <I>words</I> to Jesus Christ), they would say neither 
 <I>yea</I> nor <I>nay,</I> for their design was to <I>inform against 
 him,</I> not to be <I>informed by him.</I> They would not say <I>it was 
 lawful to heal,</I> for then they would preclude themselves from 
 imputing it to him as a crime; and yet the thing was so plain and 
 self-evident that they could not for shame say it was <I>not 
 lawful.</I> Note, Good men have often been persecuted for doing that 
 which even their persecutors, if they would but give their consciences 
 leave to speak out, could not but own to be lawful and good. Many a 
 <I>good work</I> Christ did, for which they <I>cast stones</I> at him 
 and his name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That Christ would not be hindered from <I>doing good</I> by the 
 <I>opposition</I> and <I>contradiction</I> of sinners. He <I>took him, 
 and healed him, and let him go,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Perhaps he <I>took him aside</I> into another room, and healed him
 <I>there,</I> because he would neither <I>proclaim</I> himself, such 
 was his humility, nor <I>provoke</I> his adversaries, such was his 
 wisdom, his <I>meekness of wisdom.</I> Note, Though we must not be 
 driven off from our duty by the malice of our enemies, yet we should 
 order the circumstances of it so as to make it the least offensive. Or, 
 He <I>took him,</I> that is, he <I>laid hands</I> on him, to cure him; 
 <B><I>epilabomenos</I></B>, <I>complexus--he embraced him,</I> took him 
 in his arms, big and unwieldy as he was (for so dropsical people 
 generally are), and reduced him to shape. The cure of a dropsy, as much 
 as any disease, one would think, should be gradual; yet Christ cured 
 even <I>that</I> disease, perfectly cured it, in a moment. He then let 
 him go, lest the Pharisees should fall upon him for <I>being 
 healed,</I> though he was purely passive; for what absurdities would 
 not such men as they were be guilty of?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That our Lord Jesus <I>did nothing but what he could justify,</I> to 
 the conviction and confusion of those that quarrelled with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 He still answered their thoughts, and made them <I>hold their peace for
 shame</I> who before held their peace for <I>subtlety,</I> by an appeal 
 to their own practice, as he had been used to do upon such occasions, 
 that he might show them how in condemning him they condemned 
 themselves: <I>which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a 
 pit,</I> by accident, <I>and will not pull him out on the sabbath 
 day,</I> and that straightway, not deferring it till the sabbath be 
 over, lest it perish? Observe, It is not so much out of <I>compassion 
 to the poor creature</I> that they do it as a concern for their own 
 interest. It is <I>their own ox,</I> and <I>their own ass,</I> that is 
 worth money, and they will dispense with the law of the sabbath for the 
 <I>saving of.</I> Now this was an evidence of their hypocrisy, and that 
 it was not out of any real regard to the sabbath that they found fault 
 with Christ for healing on the <I>sabbath day</I> (that was only the 
 pretence), but really because they were angry at the <I>miraculous good 
 works</I> which Christ wrought, and the <I>proof</I> he thereby gave of 
 his divine mission, and the interest he thereby <I>gained</I> among the 
 people. Many can easily dispense with that, for their own interest, 
 which they cannot dispense with for God's glory and the good of their 
 brethren. This question <I>silenced</I> them: <I>They could not answer 
 him again to these things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Christ will be justified when he speaks, and every mouth must be
 stopped before him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when
 he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,
 &nbsp; 8 When thou art bidden of any <I>man</I> to a wedding, sit not down
 in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be
 bidden of him;
 &nbsp; 9 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this
 man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.
 &nbsp; 10 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest
 room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee,
 Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the
 presence of them that sit at meat with thee.
 &nbsp; 11 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
 humbleth himself shall be exalted.
 &nbsp; 12 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a
 dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren,
 neither thy kinsmen, nor <I>thy</I> rich neighbours; lest they also
 bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.
 &nbsp; 13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
 lame, the blind:
 &nbsp; 14 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee:
 for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus here sets us an example of profitable edifying discourse 
 at our tables, when we are in company with our friends. We find that 
 when he had none but his disciples, who were his own family, with him 
 at his table, his discourse with them was <I>good, and to the use of 
 edifying;</I> and not only so, but when he was in company with 
 strangers, nay, with enemies that <I>watched him,</I> he took occasion 
 to reprove what he saw amiss in them, and to instruct them. Though the 
 <I>wicked were before him,</I> he did not <I>keep silence from good</I> 
 (as David did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:1,2">Ps. xxxix. 1, 2</A>),

 for, notwithstanding the provocation given him, he had not his <I>heart 
 hot within him,</I> nor was <I>his spirit stirred.</I> We must not only 
 not allow any corrupt communication at our tables, such as that of the 
 <I>hypocritical mockers at feasts,</I> but we must go beyond common 
 harmless talk, and should take occasion from God's goodness to us at 
 our tables to speak well of him, and learn to <I>spiritualize</I> 
 common things. The lips of the righteous should then <I>feed many.</I> 
 Our Lord Jesus was among persons of quality, yet, as one that had not 
 respect of persons,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He takes occasion to reprove <I>the guests</I> for striving to 
 <I>sit uppermost,</I> and thence gives us a lesson of 
 <I>humility.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He observed how these lawyers and Pharisees affected the <I>highest 
 seats,</I> towards the head-end of the table, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He had charged that sort of men with this in general,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:43"><I>ch.</I> xi. 43</A>.

 Here he brings home the charge to particular persons; for Christ will
 give <I>every man his own.</I> He <I>marked</I> how they <I>chose out 
 the chief rooms;</I> every man, as he came in, got as near the best 
 seat as he could. Note, Even in the common actions of life, Christ's 
 eye is upon us, and he <I>marks</I> what we do, not only in our 
 religious assemblies, but at our tables, and <I>makes remarks</I> upon 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He observed how those who were thus aspiring often exposed 
 themselves, and came off <I>with a slur;</I> whereas, those who were 
 modest, and seated themselves in the lowest seats, often <I>gained 
 respect</I> by it. 

 (1.) Those who, when they come in, assume the highest seats, may 
 perhaps be <I>degraded,</I> and forced to <I>come down</I> to give 
 place to one <I>more honourable,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 Note, It ought to check our high thoughts of ourselves to think how
 many there are that are <I>more honourable</I> than we, not only in 
 respect of worldly dignities, but of personal merits and 
 accomplishments. Instead of being proud that so many give place to us, 
 it should be humbling to us that there are so many that we must give 
 place to. The master of the feast will marshal his guests, and will not 
 see the <I>more honourable</I> kept out of the seat that is his due, 
 and therefore will make bold to take him lower that usurped it; <I>Give 
 this man place;</I> and this will be a disgrace before all the company 
 to him that would be thought more deserving than he really was. Note, 
 Pride will have <I>shame,</I> and will at last have a <I>fall.</I>

 (2.) Those who, when they come in, content themselves with the lowest 
 seats, are likely to be preferred

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "Go, and <I>seat thyself in the lowest room,</I> as taking it for 
 granted that thy friend, who invited thee, has guests to come that are 
 of better rank and quality than thou are; but perhaps it may not prove 
 so, and then it will be said to thee, <I>Friend, go up higher.</I> The 
 master of the feast will be so just to thee as not to keep thee at the 
 lower end of the table because thou wert so <I>modest</I> as to seat 
 thyself there." Note, The way to <I>rise high</I> is to <I>begin 
 low,</I> and this recommends a man to those about him: "<I>Thou shalt 
 have honour and respect before those that sit with thee.</I> They will 
 see thee to be an <I>honourable man,</I> beyond what at first they 
 thought; and honour appears the brighter for shining <I>out of 
 obscurity.</I> They will likewise see thee to be a <I>humble man,</I> 
 which is the greatest honour of all. Our Saviour here refers to that
 advice of Solomon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:6">Prov. xxv. 6, 7</A>),

 <I>Stand not in the place of great men, for better it is that it be 
 said unto thee, Come up hither, than that thou shouldest be put 
 lower.</I>" And Dr. Lightfoot quotes a parable out of one of the
 rabbin somewhat like this. "Three men," said he, "were bidden to a
 feast; one sat highest, For, said he, I am a prince; the other next, 
 For, said he, I am a wise man; the other lowest, For, said he, I am a 
 humble man. The king seated the humble man highest, and put the prince 
 lowest."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He applied this generally, and would have us all learn not to 
 <I>mind high things,</I> but to content ourselves with mean things, as 
 for other reasons, so for this, because pride and ambition are 
 disgraceful before men: for <I>whosoever exalteth himself shall be 
 abased;</I> but humility and self-denial are really honourable: <I>he 
 that humbleth himself shall be exalted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 We see in other instances that <I>a man's pride will bring him low,</I>
 but <I>honour shall uphold the humble in spirit,</I> and <I>before 
 honour is humility.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He takes occasion to reprove the master of the feast for inviting 
 so many <I>rich people,</I> who had wherewithal to dine very well at 
 home, when he should rather have <I>invited the poor,</I> or, which was 
 all one, have <I>sent portions to them for whom nothing was 
 prepared,</I> and who could not afford themselves a good meal's meat. 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:10">Neh. viii. 10</A>.

 Our Saviour here teaches us that the using of what we have in works of
 charity is better, and will turn to a better account, than using it in 
 works of generosity and in magnificent house-keeping.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. "Covet not to <I>treat the rich;</I> invite not <I>thy friends, and 
 brethren, and neighbours, that are rich,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This does not <I>prohibit</I> the entertaining of such; there may be
 occasion for it, for the cultivating of friendship among relations and 
 neighbours. But,

 (1.) "Do not make a common custom of it; spend as little as thou canst 
 that way, that thou mayest not disable thyself to lay out in a much 
 better way, in almsgiving. Thou wilt find it very expensive and 
 troublesome; one feast for the rich will make a great many meals for 
 the poor." Solomon saith, <I>He that giveth to the rich shall surely 
 come to want,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:16">Prov. xxii. 16</A>.

 "Give" (saith Pliny, Epist.) "to thy friends, but let it be to thy
 <I>poor</I> friends, not to those that need thee not."

 (2.) "Be not <I>proud of it.</I>" Many <I>make feasts</I> only to 
 <I>make a show,</I> as Ahasuerus did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:3,4">Esth. i. 3, 4</A>),

 and it is no reputation to them, they think, if they have not persons 
 of quality to dine with them, and thus rob their families, to please 
 their fancies.

 (3.) "Aim not at being paid again in your own coin." This is that which 
 our Saviour blames in making such entertainments: "You commonly do it 
 in hopes that you will be invited by them, and <I>so a recompence will 
 be made you;</I> you will be gratified with such dainties and varieties 
 as you treat your friends with, and this will feed your sensuality and 
 luxury, and you will be no real gainer at last."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. "Be forward to <I>relieve the poor</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>):

 <I>When thou makest a feast,</I> instead of furnishing thyself with 
 what is rare and nice, get thy table spread with a competency of plain 
 and wholesome meat, which will not be so costly, and invite <I>the poor 
 and maimed,</I> such as have nothing to live upon, nor are able to work 
 for their living. These are objects of charity; they want necessaries; 
 furnish them, and they will recompense thee with their prayers; they 
 will commend thy provisions, which the rich, it may be, will despise.
 They will go away, and thank God for thee, when the rich will go away 
 and reproach thee. Say not that thou art a <I>loser,</I> because 
 <I>they cannot recompense thee,</I> thou art so much out of pocket; no, 
 it is so much set out to the best interest, on the best security, for 
 <I>thou shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.</I>" 
 There will be a <I>resurrection of the just, a future state</I> of the 
 just. There is a state of happiness reserved for them in the other 
 world; and we may be sure that the <I>charitable</I> will be remembered 
 in the <I>resurrection of the just,</I> for alms are 
 <I>righteousness.</I> Works of charity perhaps may not be rewarded 
 <I>in this world,</I> for the things of this world are not the <I>best 
 things,</I> and therefore God does not pay the best men in <I>those 
 things;</I> but they shall <I>in no wise lose their reward;</I> they 
 shall be recompensed in the <I>resurrection.</I> It will be found that 
 the longest voyages make the richest returns, and that the charitable 
 will be no losers, but unspeakable gainers, by having their recompense 
 adjourned <I>till the resurrection.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
 things, he said unto him, Blessed <I>is</I> he that shall eat bread in
 the kingdom of God.
 &nbsp; 16 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper,
 and bade many:
 &nbsp; 17 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were
 bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.
 &nbsp; 18 And they all with one <I>consent</I> began to make excuse. The
 first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must
 needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.
 &nbsp; 19 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go
 to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.
 &nbsp; 20 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I
 cannot come.
 &nbsp; 21 So that servant came, and showed his lord these things. Then
 the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out
 quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in
 hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.
 &nbsp; 22 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast
 commanded, and yet there is room.
 &nbsp; 23 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways
 and hedges, and compel <I>them</I> to come in, that my house may be
 filled.
 &nbsp; 24 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden
 shall taste of my supper.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is another discourse of our Saviour's, in which he 
 <I>spiritualizes</I> the feast he was invited to, which is another way 
 of keeping up good discourse in the midst of common actions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The occasion of the discourse was given by one of the guests, who, 
 when Christ was giving rules about feasting, said to him, <I>Blessed is 
 he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 which, some tell us, was a saying commonly used among the rabbin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. But with what design does this man bring it in here? 

 (1.) Perhaps this man, observing that Christ reproved first the guests 
 and then the master of the house, fearing he should put the company out 
 of humour, started this, to <I>divert</I> the discourse to something 
 else. Or, 

 (2.) Admiring the good rules of humility and charity which Christ had 
 now given, but despairing to see them lived up to in the present 
 degenerate state of things, he longs for <I>the kingdom of God,</I> 
 when these and other good laws shall prevail, and pronounces them 
 <I>blessed</I> who shall have a place in that kingdom. Or, 

 (3.) Christ having mentioned <I>the resurrection of the just,</I> as a 
 recompence for acts of charity to the poor, he here confirms what he 
 said, "Yea, Lord, they that shall be recompensed in the resurrection of 
 the just, shall <I>eat bread in the kingdom,</I> and that is a greater 
 recompence than being reinvited to the table of the greatest man on 
 earth." Or, 

 (4.) Observing Christ to be silent, after he had given the foregoing 
 lessons, he was willing to draw him in again to further discourse, so 
 wonderfully well-pleased was he with what he said; and he knew nothing 
 more likely to engage him than to mention the <I>kingdom of God.</I> 
 Note, Even those that are not of ability to carry on good discourse 
 themselves ought to put in a word now and then, to countenance it, and 
 help it forward.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Now what this man said was a plain and acknowledged truth, and it 
 was quoted very <I>appositely</I> now that they were <I>sitting at 
 meat;</I> for we should take occasion from common things to think and 
 speak of those heavenly and spiritual things which in scripture are 
 <I>compared</I> to them, for that is one end of borrowing similitudes 
 from them. And it will be good for us, when we are receiving the gifts 
 of God's providence, to pass through them to the consideration of the 
 gifts of his grace, those <I>better things.</I> This thought will be 
 very seasonable when we are partaking of bodily refreshments: 
 <I>Blessed are they that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</I> 
 
 (1.) In the kingdom of grace, in the kingdom of the Messiah, which was 
 expected now shortly to be set up. Christ promised his disciples that 
 they should <I>eat and drink with him in his kingdom.</I> They that 
 partake of the Lord's supper <I>eat bread in the kingdom of God.</I> 
 
 (2.) In the kingdom of glory, at the resurrection. The happiness of 
 heaven is an <I>everlasting feast;</I> blessed are they that shall sit 
 down at that table, whence they shall rise no more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The parable which our Lord Jesus put forth upon this occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>,

 &c. Christ joins with the good man in what he said: "It is very true,
 <I>Blessed are they that shall partake</I> of the privileges of the 
 Messiah's kingdom. But who are they that shall enjoy that privilege? 
 You Jews, who think to have the monopoly of it, will generally reject 
 it, and the Gentiles will be the greatest sharers in it." This he shows 
 by a parable, for, if he had spoken it plainly, the Pharisees would not 
 have borne it. Now in the parable we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The free grace and mercy of God, shining in the gospel of Christ; it 
 appears,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In the rich provision he has made for poor souls, for their 
 nourishment, refreshment, and entertainment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>A certain man made a great supper.</I> There is that in Christ and 
 the grace of the gospel which will be <I>food</I> and a <I>feast</I> 
 for the soul of man that knows its own capacities, for the soul of a 
 sinner that knows its own necessities and miseries. It is called a 
 <I>supper,</I> because in those countries supper time was the chief 
 feasting time, when the business of the day was over. The manifestation 
 of gospel grace to the world was the evening of the world's day; and 
 the fruition of the fulness of that grace in heaven is reserved for the 
 evening of our day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In gracious invitation given us to come and partake of this 
 provision. Here is, 

 [1.] A general invitation given: He <I>bade many.</I> Christ invited 
 the whole nation and people of the Jews to partake of the benefits of 
 his gospel. There is provision enough for as many as come; it was 
 prophesied of as a <I>feast for all people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:6">Isa. xxv. 6</A>.

 Christ in the gospel, as he keeps a <I>good</I> house, so he keeps an
 <I>open</I> house.

 [2.] A particular memorandum given, when the supper time was at hand; 
 the servant was sent round to put them in mind of it: <I>Come, for all 
 things are now ready.</I> When the Spirit was poured out, and the 
 gospel church planted, those who before were invited were more closely 
 pressed to come in <I>presently:</I> Now <I>all things are ready,</I> 
 the full discovery of the gospel mystery is now made, all the 
 ordinances of the gospel are now instituted, the society of Christians 
 is now incorporated, and, which crowns all, the Holy Ghost is now 
 given. This is the call now given to us: "<I>All things are now 
 ready,</I> now is the <I>accepted time;</I> it is now, and <I>has 
 not</I> been long; it is now, and <I>will not</I> be long; it is a 
 season of grace that will be soon over, and therefore <I>come now;</I> 
 do not delay; accept the invitation; believe yourselves welcome; 
 <I>eat, O friends; drink, yea drink abundantly, O beloved.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The cold entertainment which the grace of the gospel meets with. The 
 invited guests declined coming. They did not say flatly and plainly 
 that they <I>would not come,</I> but <I>they all with one consent began 
 to make excuse,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 One would have expected that they should <I>all with one consent</I>
 have come to a good supper, when they were so kindly invited to it: who 
 would have refused such an invitation? Yet, on the contrary, they all
 found out some pretence or other to shift off their attendance. This 
 bespeaks the general neglect of the Jewish nation to close with Christ, 
 and accept of the offers of his grace, and the contempt they put upon 
 the invitation. It also intimates the backwardness there is in most 
 people to close with the gospel call. They cannot for shame avow their
 refusal, but they desire to be <I>excused:</I> they all <B><I>ato 
 mias</I></B>, some supply <B><I>horas</I></B>, <I>all straightway,</I> 
 they could give an answer <I>extempore,</I> and needed not to study for 
 it, had <I>not to seek</I> for an excuse. Others supply 
 <B><I>gnomes</I></B>, they were <I>unanimous</I> in it; <I>with one 
 voice.</I>

 (1.) Here were <I>two</I> that were <I>purchasers,</I> who were in such 
 haste to go and see their purchases that they could not find time to go 
 to this supper. One had <I>purchased land;</I> he had <I>bought a piece 
 of ground,</I> which was represented to him to be a good bargain, and 
 he must needs <I>to and see</I> whether it was so or no; and therefore 
 <I>I pray thee have me excused.</I> His heart was so much upon the 
 enlarging of his estate that he could neither be civil to his friend 
 nor kind to himself. Note, Those that have their hearts full of the 
 world, and fond of <I>laying house to house</I> and <I>field to 
 field,</I> have their ears deaf to the gospel invitation. But what a 
 frivolous excuse was this! He might have deferred going to see his 
 piece of ground till the next day, and have found it in the same place 
 and plight it was now in, if he had so pleased. Another had purchased 
 <I>stock</I> for his land. "<I>I have bought five yoke of oxen</I> for 
 the plough, and I must just now go and <I>prove them,</I> must go and 
 try whether they be fit for my purpose; and therefore excuse me for 
 this time." The former intimates that inordinate <I>complacency</I> in 
 the world, this the inordinate <I>care</I> and <I>concern</I> about the 
 world, which keep people from Christ and his grace; both intimate 
 a preference given to the body above the soul, and to the things of time 
 above those of eternity. Note, It is very criminal, when we are called 
 to any duty, to make excuses for our neglect of it: it is a sign that 
 there are convictions that it is duty, but no inclination to it. These 
 things here, that were the matter of the excuses, were,

 [1.] <I>Little things,</I> and of small concern. It had better become 
 them to have said, "I am invited <I>to eat bread in the kingdom of 
 God,</I> and therefore must be excused from going to see the 
 <I>ground</I> or the <I>oxen.</I>" 

 [2.] <I>Lawful things.</I> Note, <I>Things lawful in themselves,</I> 
 when the heart is too much set upon them, <I>prove fatal</I> hindrances 
 in religion--<I>Licitus perimus omnes.</I> It is a hard matter so to 
 manage our worldly affairs that they may not divert us from spiritual 
 pursuits; and this ought to be our great care. 

 (2.) Here was one that was <I>newly married,</I> and could not leave 
 his wife to go out to supper, no, not for once
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>I have married a wife, and therefore,</I> in short, <I>I cannot 
 come.</I> He pretends that he <I>cannot,</I> when the truth is he 
 <I>will not.</I> Thus many pretend <I>inability</I> for the duties of 
 religion when really they have an <I>aversion</I> to them. He has 
 <I>married a wife.</I> It is true, he that married was excused by the 
 law from going to war for the first year 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:5">Deut. xxiv. 5</A>),

 but would that excuse him from going up to the feasts of the Lord, 
 which all the males were yearly to attend? Much less will it excuse
 from the gospel feast, of which the other were but types. Note, Our
 affection to our relations often proves a hindrance to us in our duty 
 to God. Adam's excuse was, <I>The woman that thou gavest me persuaded 
 me to eat;</I> this here was, <I>The woman persuaded me not to eat.</I> 
 He might have gone and taken his wife along with him; they would both 
 have been welcome.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The account which was brought to the master of the feast of the 
 affront put upon him by his friends whom he had invited, who now showed 
 how little they valued him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>That servant came, and showed his lord these things,</I> told him 
 with surprise that he was likely to sup alone, for the guests that were 
 invited, though they had had timely notice a good while before, that 
 they might order their affairs accordingly, yet were now engaged in 
 some other business. He made the matter neither better nor worse, but 
 related it just as it was. Note, Ministers must give account of the 
 success of their ministry. They must do it now at the throne of grace. 
 If they see of <I>the travail of their soul,</I> they must go to God 
 with their <I>thanks;</I> if they <I>labour in vain,</I> they must go 
 to God with their <I>complaints.</I> They will do it hereafter at the 
 judgment-seat of Christ: they shall be produced as witnesses 
 <I>against</I> those who persist and perish in their unbelief, to prove 
 that they were fairly invited; and <I>for those</I> who accepted the 
 call, <I>Behold, I and the children thou hast given me.</I> The apostle 
 urges this as a reason why people should give ear to the word of God 
 sent them by his ministers; for <I>they watch for your souls, as those 
 that must give account,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:17">Heb. xiii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The master's just resentment of this affront: <I>He was angry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Note, The ingratitude of those that slight gospel offers, and the
 contempt they put upon the God of heaven thereby, are a very great 
 provocation to him, and justly so. Abused mercy turns into the greatest 
 wrath. The doom he passed upon them was, <I>None of the men that were 
 bidden shall taste of my supper.</I> This was like the doom passed upon 
 the ungrateful Israel, when they despised the pleasant land: God 
 <I>swore in his wrath that they should not enter into his rest.</I> 
 Note, Grace despised is grace forfeited, like Esau's birthright. They 
 that will not have Christ when they <I>may</I> shall not have him when 
 they <I>would.</I> Even those that <I>were bidden,</I> if they slight 
 the invitation, <I>shall be for</I>bidden; when the door is shut, the 
 foolish virgins will be denied entrance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The care that was taken to furnish the table with guests, as well as 
 meat. "Go" (saith he to the servants), "<I>go first into the streets 
 and lanes of the city,</I> and invite, not the merchants that are going 
 from the custom-house, nor the tradesmen that are shutting up their 
 shops; they will <I>desire to be excused</I> (one is going to his 
 counting-house to cast up his books, another to the tavern to drink a 
 bottle with his friend); but, that you may invite those that will be 
 glad to come, bring in <I>hither the poor and the maimed, the halt and 
 the blind;</I> pick up the common beggars." The servants object not 
 that it will be a disparagement to the master and his house to have 
 such guests at his table; for they know his mind, and they soon gather 
 an abundance of such guests: <I>Lord, it is done as thou hast 
 commanded.</I> Many of the Jews are brought in, not of the scribes and 
 Pharisees, such as Christ was <I>now at dinner with,</I> who thought 
 themselves most likely to be guests at the Messiah's table, but the 
 publicans and sinners; these are <I>the poor and the maimed.</I> But 
 <I>yet there is room</I> for more guests, and provision enough for them 
 all. "Go, then, <I>secondly, into the highways and hedges.</I> Go out 
 into the country, and pick up the vagrants, or those that are returning 
 now in the evening from their work in the field, from hedging and 
 ditching there, and <I>compel them to come in,</I> not by force of 
 arms, but by force of arguments. Be earnest with them; for in this case 
 it will be necessary to convince them that the invitation is 
 <I>sincere</I> and not a <I>banter;</I> they will be shy and modest, 
 and will hardly believe that they shall be welcome, and therefore be 
 importunate with them and do not leave them till you have prevailed 
 with them." This refers to the <I>calling of the Gentiles,</I> to whom 
 the apostles were to <I>turn</I> when the Jews refused the offer, and 
 with them the church was filled. Now observe here, 

 (1.) The provision made for precious souls in the gospel of Christ 
 shall appear not to have been made <I>in vain;</I> for, if some 
 <I>reject it,</I> yet others will thankfully <I>accept</I> the offer of 
 it. Christ comforts himself with this, that, <I>though Israel be not 
 gathered,</I> yet he shall be <I>glorious, as a light to the 
 Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:5,6">Isa. xlix. 5, 6</A>.

 God will have a church in the world, though there are those that are 
 unchurched; for <I>the unbelief of man shall not make the promise of 
 God of no effect.</I>

 (2.) Those that are very poor and low in the world shall be as welcome
 to Christ as the rich and great; nay, and many times the gospel has 
 greatest success among those that labour under worldly disadvantages, 
 as the <I>poor,</I> and bodily infirmities, as <I>the maimed, and the 
 halt,</I> and <I>the blind.</I> Christ here plainly refers to what he 
 had said just before, in direction to us, to invite to our tables 
 <I>the poor and maimed, the lame and blind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 For consideration for the countenance which Christ's gospel gives to
 the poor should engage us to be charitable to them. His condescensions 
 and compassions towards them should engage ours.

 (3.) Many times the gospel has the <I>greatest success</I> among those 
 that are <I>least likely</I> to have the benefit of it, and whose 
 submission to it was least expected. The publicans and harlots went 
 into the kingdom of God before the scribes and Pharisees; <I>so the 
 last shall be first, and the first last.</I> Let us not be 
 <I>confident</I> concerning those that are most forward, nor despair of 
 those that are least promising.

 (4.) Christ's ministers must be both very expeditious and very 
 importunate in inviting to the gospel feast: "<I>Go out quickly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 lose not time, because <I>all things are now ready.</I> Call to them to 
 come <I>to-day, while it is called to-day;</I> and <I>compel them to 
 come in,</I> by accosting them kindly, and <I>drawing</I> them <I>with 
 the cords of a man and the bands of love.</I>" Nothing can be more 
 absurd than fetching an argument hence for compelling men's 
 consciences, nay, for compelling men against their consciences, in 
 matters of religion: "You shall receive the Lord's supper, or you shall 
 be fined and imprisoned, and ruined in your estate." Certainly nothing 
 like this was the compulsion here meant, but only that of reason and 
 love; for <I>the weapons of our warfare are not carnal.</I> 

 (5.) Though many have been brought in to partake of the benefits of the 
 gospel, yet still <I>there is room for more;</I> for the riches of 
 Christ are <I>unsearchable</I> and <I>inexhaustible;</I> there is in 
 him enough for all, and enough for each; and the gospel excludes none 
 that do not exclude themselves. 

 (6.) Christ's house, though it be <I>large,</I> shall at last be 
 <I>filled;</I> it will be so when the number of the elect is completed, 
 and as many as were <I>given him</I> are <I>brought to him.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See how Christ in his doctrine suited himself to those to whom he 
 spoke, and <I>gave every one his portion of meat.</I> To Pharisees he 
 preached humility and charity. He is in these verses directing his 
 discourse to the multitudes that crowded after him, and seemed zealous 
 in following him; and his exhortation to them is to understand the 
 terms of discipleship, before they undertook the profession of it, and 
 to consider what they did. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How zealous people were in their attendance on Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):
 
 <I>There went great multitudes with him,</I> many for love and more for 
 company, for where there are <I>many</I> there will be <I>more.</I> 
 Here was a <I>mixed multitude,</I> like that which went with Israel out 
 of Egypt; such we must expect there will always be in the church, and 
 it will therefore be necessary that ministers should carefully separate 
 <I>between the precious and the vile.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How <I>considerate</I> he would have them to be in their 
 <I>zeal.</I> Those that undertake to follow Christ must count upon the 
 worst, and prepare accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He tells them what the worst is that they must count upon, much the 
 same with what he had gone through <I>before</I> them and <I>for</I> 
 them. He takes it for granted that they had a mind to be <I>his 
 disciples,</I> that they might be <I>qualified</I> for preferment in 
 his kingdom. They expected that he should say, "If any man come to me, 
 and be my disciple, he shall have wealth and honour in abundance; let 
 me alone to make him a great man." But he tells them quite the 
 contrary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They must be willing to <I>quit</I> that which was <I>very 
 dear,</I> and therefore must come to him thoroughly <I>weaned from</I> 
 all their creature-comforts, and <I>dead</I> to them, so as cheerfully 
 to part with them rather than quit their interest in Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 A man cannot be Christ's disciple but he must <I>hate father, and
 mother, and his own life.</I> He is not <I>sincere,</I> he will be 
 <I>constant</I> and persevering, unless he love Christ better than any 
 thing in this world, and be willing to part with that which he may and 
 must leave, either as a <I>sacrifice,</I> when Christ may be glorified 
 by our parting with it (so the martyrs, who <I>loved not their lives to 
 death</I>), or as a <I>temptation,</I> when by our parting with it we 
 are put into a better capacity of serving Christ. Thus Abraham parted 
 with his own country, and Moses with Pharaoh's court. Mention is not 
 made here of <I>houses</I> and <I>lands;</I> philosophy will teach a 
 man to look upon these with contempt; but Christianity carries it 
 higher.

 [1.] Every good man loves <I>his relations;</I> and yet, if he be a 
 disciple of Christ, he must comparatively <I>hate them,</I> must love 
 them <I>less than Christ,</I> as Leah is said to be <I>hated</I> when 
 Rachel was better loved. Not that their persons must be in any degree 
 hated, but our comfort and satisfaction in them must be lost and 
 swallowed up in our love to Christ, as Levi's was, when he <I>said to 
 his father, I have not seen him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">Deut. xxxiii. 9</A>.

 When our duty to our parents comes in competition with our evident duty
 to Christ, we must give Christ the preference. If we must either 
 <I>deny Christ</I> or be <I>banished</I> from our families and 
 relations (as many of the primitive Christians were), we must rather 
 lose their society than his favour.

 [2.] Every man loves <I>his own life,</I> no man ever yet <I>hated 
 it;</I> and we cannot be Christ's disciples if we do not love him 
 better than our own lives, so as rather to have our lives 
 <I>embittered</I> by cruel <I>bondage,</I> nay, and <I>taken away</I> 
 by cruel <I>deaths,</I> than to dishonour Christ, or depart from any of 
 his truths and ways. The experience of the pleasures of the 
 <I>spiritual life,</I> and the believing hopes and prospects of 
 <I>eternal life,</I> will make this <I>hard saying</I> easy. When 
 tribulation and persecution arise because of the word, then chiefly the 
 trial is, whether we love better, Christ or our relations and lives; 
 yet even in the <I>days of</I> peace this matter is sometimes brought 
 to the trial. Those that decline the service of Christ, and 
 opportunities of converse with him, and are ashamed to confess him, for 
 fear of disobliging a relation or friend, or losing a customer, give 
 cause to suspect that they love him better than Christ.</P>

 (2.) That they must be willing to <I>bear</I> that which was very 
 <I>heavy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>Whosoever doth not bear his cross,</I> as those did that were 
 condemned to be crucified, in <I>submission</I> to the sentence and in 
 <I>expectation</I> of the execution of it, and so <I>come after me</I> 
 whithersoever I shall lead him, he <I>cannot be my disciple;</I> that 
 is (says Dr. Hammond), he is not <I>for my turn;</I> and my service, 
 being so sure to bring persecution along with it, will not be <I>for 
 his.</I> Though the disciples of Christ are not <I>all crucified,</I> 
 yet they all <I>bear their cross,</I> as if they counted upon being 
 crucified. They must be content to be put into an ill name, and to be 
 loaded with infamy and disgrace; for no name is more ignominious than 
 <I>Furcifer--the bearer of the gibbet.</I> He must bear his cross, and 
 <I>come after Christ;</I> that is, he must bear it in the way of his 
 duty, whenever it lies in that way. He must bear it when Christ calls 
 him to it, and in bearing it he must have an eye to Christ, and fetch 
 encouragements from him, and live in hope of a recompence with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He bids them count upon it, and then consider of it. Since he has 
 been so <I>just to us</I> as to tell us plainly what difficulties we 
 shall meet with in following him, let us be so <I>just to ourselves</I> 
 as to weigh the matter seriously before we take upon us a profession of 
 religion. Joshua obliged the people to consider what they did when they 
 promised to <I>serve the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:19">Josh. xxiv. 19</A>.

 It is better never to begin than not to proceed; and therefore before
 we begin we must consider what it is to proceed. This is to act 
 rationally, and as becomes men, and as we do in other cases. The cause 
 of Christ will bear a scrutiny. Satan shows the best, but hides the 
 worst, because his best will not counter-vail his worst; but Christ's 
 will abundantly. This considering of the case is necessary to
 perseverance, especially in suffering times. Our Saviour here 
 illustrates the necessity of it by two similitudes, the former showing 
 that we must consider the <I>expenses</I> of our religion, the latter 
 that we must consider the <I>perils</I> of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) When we take upon us a profession of religion we are like a man 
 that undertakes to <I>build a tower,</I> and therefore must consider 
 the <I>expense of it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:28-30"><I>v.</I> 28-30</A>):

 <I>Which of you, intending to build a tower</I> or stately house for 
 himself, <I>sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost?</I> and he 
 must be sure to count upon a great deal more than his workmen will tell 
 him it will cost. Let him compare the charge with his purse, lest he 
 make himself to be laughed at, by <I>beginning to build</I> what he is 
 <I>not able to finish.</I> Note,

 [1.] All that take upon them a profession of religion undertake to 
 <I>build a tower,</I> not as the tower of Babel, in opposition to 
 Heaven, which therefore was left unfinished, but in obedience to 
 Heaven, which therefore shall have its <I>top-stone brought forth.</I> 
 Begin low, and lay the foundation deep, lay it on the rock, and make 
 sure work, and then aim as high as heaven. 

 [2.] Those that intend to build this tower must <I>sit down and count 
 the cost.</I> Let them consider that it <I>will cost them</I> the 
 mortifying of their sins, even the most beloved lusts; it will cost 
 them a life of self-denial and watchfulness, and a constant course of 
 holy duties; it <I>may,</I> perhaps, <I>cost them</I> their reputation 
 among men, their estates and liberties, and all that is dear to them in 
 this world, even life itself. And if it should cost us all this, what 
 is it in comparison with what it cost Christ to purchase the advantages 
 of religion for us, which come to us without money and without price? 
 
 [3.] Many that begin to <I>build this tower</I> do not <I>go on with 
 it,</I> nor persevere in it, and it is their folly; they have not 
 courage and resolution, have not a rooted fixed principle, and so bring 
 nothing to pass. It is true, we have none of us in ourselves 
 <I>sufficient to finish</I> this tower, but Christ hath said, <I>My 
 grace is sufficient for thee,</I> and that grace shall not be wanting 
 to any of us, if we seek for it and make use of it. 

 [4.] Nothing is more <I>shameful</I> than for those that have begun 
 well in religion to break off; every one will justly <I>mock him,</I> 
 as having lost all his labour hitherto for want of perseverance. We 
 <I>lose the things we have wrought</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:8">2 John 8</A>),

 and all we have done and suffered is <I>in vain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:4">Gal. iii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) When we undertake to be Christ's disciples we are like a man that 
 <I>goes to war,</I> and therefore must consider the <I>hazard</I> of 
 it, and the difficulties that are to be encountered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 A king that declares war against a neighbouring prince considers
 whether he has strength wherewith to make his part good, and, if not, 
 he will lay aside his thoughts of war. Note,

 [1.] The state of a Christian in this world is a military state. <I>Is 
 not</I> the Christian <I>life a warfare?</I> We have many passes in our 
 way, that must be disputed with dint of sword; nay, we must fight every 
 step we go, so restless are our spiritual enemies in their opposition. 
 
 [2.] We ought to consider whether we can <I>endure the hardness</I> 
 which a good soldier of Jesus Christ must expect and count upon, before 
 we enlist ourselves under Christ's banner; <I>whether</I> we are able 
 to encounter the forces of hell and earth, which come against us 
 <I>twenty thousand</I> strong.

 [3.] Of the two it is better to make the best terms we can with the 
 world than pretend to renounce it and afterwards, when tribulation and 
 persecution arise because of the word, to <I>return to it.</I> That 
 <I>young man</I> that could not find in his heart to part with his 
 possessions for Christ did better to go away from Christ 
 <I>sorrowing</I> than to have staid with him <I>dissembling.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This parable is another way applicable, and may be taken as designed to 
 teach us to begin <I>speedily</I> to be religious, rather than to begin 
 <I>cautiously;</I> and may mean the same with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:25">Matt. v. 25</A>,

 <I>Agree with thine adversary quickly.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> Those
 that persist in sin make war against God, the most unnatural, 
 unjustifiable war; they rebel against their lawful sovereign, whose 
 government is perfectly just and good. <I>Secondly,</I> The proudest 
 and most daring sinner is no equal match for God; the disproportion of 
 strength is much greater than that here supposed between <I>ten 
 thousand</I> and <I>twenty thousand. Do we provoke the Lord to 
 jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</I> No, surely; <I>who knows the 
 power of his anger?</I> In consideration of this, it is our interest to 
 make peace with him. We need not send to <I>desire conditions of 
 peace;</I> they are offered to us, and are unexceptionable, and highly 
 to our advantage. Let us acquaint ourselves with them, and be at peace; 
 do this in time, <I>while the other is yet a great way off;</I> for 
 delays in such a case are highly dangerous, and make after-applications 
 difficult.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But the application of this parable here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>)

 is to the consideration that ought to be exercised when we take upon us 
 a profession of religion. Solomon saith, <I>With good advice make 
 war</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:18">Prov. xx. 18</A>);

 for he that <I>draws the sword throws away the scabbard;</I> so <I>with 
 good advice</I> enter upon a profession of religion, as those that know 
 that <I>except you forsake all you have you cannot be Christ's 
 disciples;</I> that is, except you count upon forsaking all and consent 
 to it, for all that will live godly in Christ Jesus must <I>suffer 
 persecution,</I> and yet continue to <I>live godly.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He warns them against apostasy and a degeneracy of mind from the 
 truly Christian spirit and temper, for that would make them utterly 
 useless, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>.

 (1.) Good Christians are <I>the salt of the earth,</I> and good
 ministers especially 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:13">Matt. v. 13</A>);

 and this <I>salt is good</I> and of great use; by their instructions 
 and examples they season all they converse with, to keep them from 
 putrefying, and to quicken them, and make them savoury. 

 (2.) Degenerate Christians, who, rather than part with what they have 
 in the world, will throw up their profession, and then of course become 
 carnal, and worldly, and wholly destitute of a Christian spirit, are 
 like <I>salt that has lost its savour,</I> like that which the chemists 
 call the <I>caput mortuum,</I> that has all its salts drawn from it, 
 that is the most useless worthless thing in the world; it has no manner 
 of virtue or good property in it.

 [1.] It can never be recovered: <I>Wherewith shall it be seasoned?</I> 
 You cannot salt it. This intimates that it is extremely difficult, and 
 next to impossible, to recover an apostate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:4-6">Heb. vi. 4-6</A>.

 If Christianity will not prevail to cure men of their worldliness and
 sensuality, if that remedy has been tried in vain, their ease must even 
 be concluded desperate.

 [2.] It is of no use. It is <I>not fit,</I> as dung is, <I>for the 
 land,</I> to manure that, nor will it be the better if it be laid in 
 the dunghill to rot; there is nothing to be got out of it. A professor 
 of religion whose mind and manners are depraved is the most 
 <I>insipid</I> animal that can be. If he speaks of the things of God, 
 of which he has had some knowledge, it is so <I>awkwardly</I> that none 
 are the better for it: it is a <I>parable in the mouth of a fool.</I> 
 
 [3.] It is abandoned: <I>Men cast it out,</I> as that which they will 
 have no more to do with. Such scandalous professors ought to be cast 
 out of the church, not only because they have forfeited all the honours 
 and privileges of their church-membership, but because there is danger 
 that others will be infected by them. Our Saviour concludes this with a 
 call to all to take notice of it, and to take warning: <I>He that hath 
 ears to hear, let him hear.</I> Now can the faculty of hearing be 
 better employed than in attending to the word of Christ, and 
 particularly to the alarms he has given us of the danger we are in 
 <I>of</I> apostasy, and the danger we run ourselves into <I>by</I> 
 apostasy?</P>
