 We have in the gospels a faithful record of all that Jesus began both 
 to do and to teach, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:1">Acts i. 1</A>.

 These two are interwoven, because what he taught explained what he did,
 and what he did confirmed what he taught. Accordingly, we have in this
 chapter a miracle and a sermon.

 I. The miracle was the cure of an impotent man that had been diseased
 thirty-eight years, with the circumstances of that cure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:1-16">ver. 1-16</A>.

 II. The sermon was Christ's vindication of himself before the
 sanhedrim, when he was prosecuted as a criminal for healing the man on
 the sabbath day, in which, 

 1. He asserts his authority as Messiah, and Mediator between God and
 man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:17-29">ver. 17-29</A>.

 2. He proves it by the testimony of his Father, of John Baptist, of his 
 miracles, and of the scriptures of the Old Testament, and condemns the 
 Jews for their unbelief, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:30-47">ver. 30-47</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up
 to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 2  Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep <I>market</I> a pool, which
 is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
 &nbsp; 3  In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind,
 halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
 &nbsp; 4  For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and
 troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of
 the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
 &nbsp; 5  And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty
 and eight years.
 &nbsp; 6  When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long
 time <I>in that case,</I> he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
 &nbsp; 7  The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the
 water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am
 coming, another steppeth down before me.
 &nbsp; 8  Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
 &nbsp; 9  And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed,
 and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
 &nbsp; 10  The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the
 sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry <I>thy</I> bed.
 &nbsp; 11  He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto
 me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
 &nbsp; 12  Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee,
 Take up thy bed, and walk?
 &nbsp; 13  And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had
 conveyed himself away, a multitude being in <I>that</I> place.
 &nbsp; 14  Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto
 him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing
 come unto thee.
 &nbsp; 15  The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which
 had made him whole.
 &nbsp; 16  And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to
 slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.

 This miraculous cure is not recorded by any other of the evangelists, 
 who confine themselves mostly to the miracles wrought in Galilee, but 
 John relates those wrought at Jerusalem. Concerning this observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>The time when</I> this cure was wrought: it was at a <I>feast of 
 the Jews,</I> that is, the passover, for that was the most celebrated 
 feast. Christ, though residing in Galilee, yet <I>went up to 
 Jerusalem</I> at the feast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 1. Because it was an <I>ordinance of God,</I> which, as a 
 <I>subject,</I> he would observe, being made under the law; though as a 
 <I>Son</I> he might have pleaded an exemption. Thus he would teach us
 to attend religious assemblies.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:25">Heb. x. 25</A>.

 2. Because it was an <I>opportunity of good;</I> for,

 (1.) there were great numbers gathered together there at that time; it
 was a general rendezvous, at least of all serious thinking people, from
 all parts of the country, besides proselytes from other nations: and
 Wisdom must <I>cry in the places of concourse,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:21">Prov. i. 21</A>.

 (2.) It was to be hoped that they were in a <I>good frame,</I> for they
 came together to <I>worship God</I> and to spend their time in 
 religious exercises. Now a mind <I>inclined to devotion,</I> and 
 sequestering itself to the exercises of piety, <I>lies very open</I> to 
 the further discoveries of divine light and love, and to it Christ will 
 be acceptable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The <I>place where</I> this cure was wrought: at the <I>pool of 
 Bethesda,</I> which had a miraculous healing virtue in it, and is here 
 particularly described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Where it was situated: <I>At Jerusalem, by the sheep-market;</I> 
 <B><I>epi te probatike</I></B>. It might as well be rendered the 
 <I>sheep-cote,</I> where the sheep were kept, or the <I>sheep-gate,</I> 
 which we read of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:1">Neh. iii. 1</A>,

 through which the sheep were <I>brought,</I> as the
 <I>sheep-market,</I> where they were <I>sold.</I> Some think it was 
 near the temple, and, if so, it yielded a melancholy but profitable 
 spectacle to those that went up to the temple to pray.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How it was called: It was a <I>pool</I> (a pond or bath), <I>which 
 is called in Hebrew, Bethesda--the house of mercy;</I> for therein
 appeared much of the <I>mercy of God</I> to the sick and diseased. In a 
 world of so much misery as this is, it is well that there are some 
 <I>Bethesdas--houses of mercy</I> (remedies against those maladies),
 that the scene is not all melancholy. An <I>alms-house,</I> so Dr. 
 Hammond. Dr. Lightfoot's conjecture is that this was the <I>upper 
 pool</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:3">Isa. vii. 3</A>),
 
 and the <I>old pool,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:11">Isa. xxii. 11</A>;

 that it had been used for <I>washing</I> from ceremonial pollutions, 
 for convenience of which the porches were built to dress and undress 
 in, but it was lately become medicinal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How it was fitted up: It had <I>five porches, cloisters, 
 piazzas,</I> or <I>roofed walks,</I> in which the sick lay. Thus the 
 charity of men concurred with the mercy of God for the relief of the 
 distressed. Nature has provided <I>remedies,</I> but men must provide 
 <I>hospitals.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. How it was frequented with sick and cripples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folks.</I> How many are 
 the afflictions of the afflicted in this world! How full of complaints 
 are all places, and what multitudes of impotent folks! It may do us
 good to visit the hospitals sometimes, that we may take occasion, from 
 the calamities of others, to thank God for our comforts. The evangelist 
 specifies three sorts of diseased people that lay here, <I>blind, 
 halt,</I> and <I>withered</I> or <I>sinew--shrunk,</I> either in one 
 particular part, as the man with the <I>withered hand,</I> or all over 
 paralytic. These are mentioned because, being least able to help 
 themselves into the water, they lay longest waiting in the 
 <I>porches.</I> Those that were sick of these bodily diseases took the 
 pains to come <I>far</I> and had the patience to wait <I>long</I> for a 
 cure; any of us would have done the same, and we ought to do so: but O 
 that men were as wise for their souls, and as solicitous to get their 
 spiritual diseases healed! We are all by nature <I>impotent folks</I> 
 in spiritual things, <I>blind, halt,</I> and <I>withered;</I> but 
 effectual provision is made for our cure if we will but observe 
 orders.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. What virtue it had for the cure of these impotent folks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>).
 
 <I>An angel went down,</I> and <I>troubled the water;</I> and <I>whoso 
 first stepped in was made whole.</I> That this strange virtue in the 
 pool was <I>natural,</I> or <I>artificial</I> rather, and was the 
 effect of the washing of the sacrifices, which impregnated the water 
 with I know not what healing virtue even for <I>blind</I> people, and 
 that the angel was a <I>messenger,</I> a common person, sent down to 
 stir the water, is altogether groundless; there was a room in the 
 temple on purpose to wash the sacrifices in. Expositors generally agree 
 that the virtue this pool had was supernatural. It is true the Jewish 
 writers, who are not sparing in recounting the praises of Jerusalem, do 
 none of them make the least mention of this <I>healing pool,</I> of 
 which silence in this matter perhaps this is the reason, that it was 
 taken for a presage of the near approach of the Messiah, and therefore 
 those who denied him to be come industriously concealed such an 
 indication of his coming; so that this is all the account we have of 
 it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>preparation</I> of the medicine by an angel, who <I>went 
 down into the pool,</I> and <I>stirred the water.</I> Angels are God's 
 servants, and friends to mankind; and perhaps are more active in the 
 removing of diseases (as evil angels in the inflicting of them) than we 
 are aware of. Raphael, the apocryphal name of an angel, signifies 
 <I>medicina Dei--God's physic,</I> or <I>physician</I> rather. See what
 mean offices the holy angels condescend to, for the good of men. If we 
 would do the will of God as the angels do it, we must think nothing 
 below us but sin. The <I>troubling of the water</I> was the signal 
 given of the descent of the angel, as the <I>going upon the tops of the 
 mulberry trees</I> was to David, and then they must <I>bestir 
 themselves.</I> The waters of the sanctuary are then <I>healing</I> 
 when they are put in <I>motion.</I> Ministers must <I>stir up the 
 gift</I> that is in them. When they are cold and dull in their 
 ministrations, the waters <I>settle,</I> and are not apt to 
 <I>heal.</I> The angel descended, to <I>stir the water,</I> not daily, 
 perhaps not frequently, but <I>at a certain season;</I> some think, at 
 the three solemn feasts, to grace those solemnities; or, <I>now and 
 then,</I> as Infinite Wisdom saw fit. God is a free agent in dispensing 
 his favours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>operation</I> of the medicine: <I>Whoever first stepped in 
 was made whole.</I> here is, 

 [1.] miraculous extent of the virtue as to the <I>diseases</I> cured; 
 what disease soever it was, this water cured it. Natural and artificial 
 baths are as <I>hurtful</I> in some cases as they are useful in others, 
 but this was a remedy for every malady, even for those that came from 
 contrary causes. The power of miracles <I>succeeds</I> where the power 
 of nature <I>succumbs.</I> 

 [2.] A miraculous limitation of the virtue as to the <I>persons</I> 
 cured: He that first stepped in had the benefit; that is, he or they 
 that stepped in immediately were cured, not those that lingered and 
 came in afterwards. This teaches us to observe and improve our 
 opportunities, and to <I>look about us,</I> that we slip not a season 
 which may never return. The angel <I>stirred</I> the waters, but left 
 the diseased to themselves to <I>get in.</I> God has put virtue into 
 the scriptures and ordinances, for he would have healed us; but, if we 
 do not make a due improvement of them, it is our own fault, we <I>would 
 not be healed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this is all the account we have of this <I>standing</I> miracle; it 
 is uncertain when it began and when it ceased. Some conjecture it began 
 when Eliashib the high priest began the building of the wall about 
 Jerusalem, and sanctified it with prayer; and that God testified his 
 acceptance by putting this virtue into the adjoining pool. Some think 
 it began now lately at Christ's birth; nay, others at his baptism. Dr. 
 Lightfoot, finding in <I>Josephus, Antiq.</I> 15. 121-122, mention of a
 great earthquake in the seventh year of Herod, thirty years before 
 Christ's birth, supposed, since there used to be earthquakes at the 
 descent of angels, that then the angel first descended to stir this 
 water. Some think it ceased with this miracle, others at Christ's 
 death; however, it is certain it had a gracious signification. 
 <I>First,</I> it was a <I>token</I> of God's good will to that people, 
 and an indication that, though they had been long without prophets and 
 miracles, yet God had not <I>cast them off;</I> though they were now an 
 oppressed despised people, and many were ready to say, <I>Where are all 
 the wonders that our fathers told us of?</I> God did hereby let them 
 know that he had still a kindness for the <I>city of their 
 solemnities.</I> We may hence take occasion to acknowledge with 
 thankfulness God's power and goodness in the mineral waters, that 
 contribute so much to the health of mankind; for God <I>made the 
 fountains of water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:7">Rev. xiv. 7</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> It was a type of the Messiah, who is the <I>fountain 
 opened;</I> and was intended to raise people's expectations of him who 
 is the <I>Sun of righteousness,</I> that arises <I>with healing under 
 his wings.</I> These waters had formerly been used for purifying, now 
 for healing, to signify both the <I>cleansing</I> and <I>curing</I> 
 virtue of the blood of Christ, that incomparable bath, which <I>heals 
 all our diseases.</I> The waters of Siloam, which filled this pool, 
 signified the kingdom of David, and of Christ the Son of David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:6">Isa. viii. 6</A>);

 fitly therefore have they now this <I>sovereign</I> virtue put into 
 them. The laver of regeneration is to us as Bethesda's pool, healing 
 our spiritual diseases; not at certain seasons, but at all times. 
 <I>Whoever will, let him come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The patient on whom this cure was wrought 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 one that <I>had been infirm thirty-eight years.</I> 

 1. His <I>disease</I> was <I>grievous:</I> He had an <I>infirmity,</I> 
 a weakness; he had lost the use of his limbs, at least on one side, as 
 is usual in palsies. It is sad to have the body so disabled that, 
 instead of being the soul's instrument, it is become, even in the 
 affairs of this life, its burden. What reason have we to thank God for
 bodily strength, to use it for him, and to pity those who are <I>his 
 prisoners!</I> 

 2. The duration of it was <I>tedious: Thirty-eight years.</I> He was 
 lame longer than most live. Many are so long disabled for the offices 
 of life that, as the psalmist complains, they seem to be <I>made in 
 vain;</I> for suffering, not for service; born to be always dying. 
 Shall we complain of one wearisome night, or one fit of illness, who 
 perhaps for many years have scarcely known what it has been to be a day 
 sick, when many others, better than we, have scarcely known what it has 
 been to be a day well? Mr. Baxter's note on this passage is very
 affecting: "How great a mercy was it to live thirty-eight years under 
 God's wholesome discipline! O my God," saith he, "I thank thee for the 
 like discipline of fifty-eight years; how safe a life is this, in 
 comparison of full prosperity and pleasure!"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The cure and the circumstances of it briefly related, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:6-9"><I>v.</I> 6-9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Jesus saw him lie.</I> Observe, When Christ came up to Jerusalem 
 he visited not the palaces, but the hospitals, which is an instance of 
 his humility, and condescension, and tender compassion, and an 
 <I>indication</I> of his great design in coming into the world, which 
 was to seek and save the sick and wounded. There was a great multitude 
 of poor cripples here at Bethesda, but Christ fastened his eye upon 
 this one, and singled him out from the rest, because he was 
 <I>senior</I> of the house, and in a more deplorable condition than any 
 of the rest; and Christ delights to help the helpless, and hath mercy 
 <I>on whom he will have mercy.</I> Perhaps his companions in 
 tribulation insulted over him, because he had often been disappointed 
 of a cure; therefore Christ took him for his patient: it is his honour 
 to side with the weakest, and bear up those whom he sees <I>run 
 down.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He knew and considered <I>how long he had lain</I> in this 
 condition. Those that have been long in affliction may comfort 
 themselves with this, that God keeps account <I>how long,</I> and knows 
 our frame.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He asked him, <I>Wilt thou be made whole?</I> A strange question to 
 be asked one that had been so long ill. Some indeed would not be made 
 whole, because their sores serve them to beg by and serve them for an 
 excuse for idleness; but this poor man was as unable to <I>go a 
 begging</I> as to <I>work,</I> yet Christ put it to him, 

 (1.) To <I>express</I> his own pity and concern for him. Christ is 
 tenderly inquisitive concerning the desires of those that are in 
 affliction, and is willing to know <I>what is their petition:</I> "What 
 shall I do for you?" 

 (2.) To try him whether he would be beholden for a cure to him against 
 whom the great people were so prejudiced and sought to prejudice 
 others. 

 (3.) To teach him to value the mercy, and to excite in him desires 
 after it. In spiritual cases, people are not willing to be cured of 
 their sins, are loth to part with them. If this point therefore were 
 but gained, if people were willing to be <I>made whole,</I> the work 
 were half done, for Christ is willing to heal, if we be but willing to 
 be healed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:3">Matt. viii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The poor impotent man takes this opportunity to renew his complaint, 
 and to set forth the misery of his case, which makes his cure the more 
 illustrious: <I>Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 He seems to take Christ's question as an imputation of carelessness and 
 neglect: "If thou hadst had a mind to be healed, thou wouldest have 
 looked better to thy hits, and have got into the healing waters long 
 before now." "No, Master," saith the poor man, "It is not for want of a 
 <I>good will,</I> but of a <I>good friend,</I> that I am unhealed. I 
 have done what I could to help myself, but in vain, for no one else 
 will help me." 

 (1.) He does not think of any other way of being cured than by these 
 waters, and desires no other friendship than to be helped into 
 <I>them;</I> therefore, when Christ cured him, his imagination or 
 expectation could not contribute to it, for he thought of no such 
 thing. 

 (2.) He complains for want of friends to help him in: "<I>I have no 
 man,</I> no friend to do me that kindness." One would think that some 
 of those who had been themselves healed should have lent him a hand; 
 but it is common for the poor to be destitute of friends; <I>no man 
 careth for their soul.</I> To the sick and impotent it is as true a 
 piece of charity to work for them as to relieve them; and thus the poor 
 are capable of being charitable to one another, and ought to be so, 
 though we seldom find that they are so; I speak it to their shame. 

 (3.) He bewails his infelicity, that very often when <I>he</I> was 
 coming <I>another stepped in before him.</I> But a step between him and 
 a cure, and yet he continues impotent. None had the charity to say, 
 "Your case is worse than mine, do you go in now, and I will stay till 
 the next time;" for there is no getting over the old maxim, <I>Every 
 one for himself.</I> Having been so often disappointed, he begins to 
 despair, and now is Christ's time to come to his relief; he delights to 
 help in desperate cases. Observe, How mildly this man speaks of the 
 unkindness of those about him, without any peevish reflections. As we 
 should be thankful for the least kindness, so we should be patient 
 under the greatest contempts; and, let our resentments be ever so 
 <I>just,</I> yet our expressions should ever be <I>calm.</I> And 
 observe further, to his praise, that, though he had waited so long in 
 vain, yet still he continued lying by the pool side, hoping that some 
 time or other help would come, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:3">Hab. ii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Our Lord Jesus hereupon cures him with a word speaking, though he 
 neither asked it nor thought of it. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The word he said: <I>Rise, take up thy bed,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 [1.] He is bidden to <I>rise and walk;</I> a strange command to be 
 given to an <I>impotent</I> man, that had been long disabled; but this 
 divine word was to be the vehicle of a divine power; it was a command 
 to the disease to <I>be gone,</I> to nature to <I>be strong,</I> but it 
 is expressed as a command to him to <I>bestir himself.</I> He must 
 <I>rise and walk,</I> that is, attempt to do it, and in the 
 <I>essay</I> he should receive strength to do it. The conversion of a 
 sinner is the cure of a chronic disease; this is ordinarily done by the 
 word, a word of command: Arise, and walk; <I>turn, and live; make ye a 
 new heart;</I> which no more supposes a power in us to do it, without 
 the grace of God, <I>distinguishing</I> grace, than this supposed such 
 a power in the impotent man. But, if he had not attempted to help 
 himself, he had not been cured, and he must have <I>borne the 
 blame;</I> yet it does not therefore follow that, when he did rise and 
 walk, it was by his own strength; no, it was by the power of Christ, 
 and he must have all the glory. Observe, Christ did not bid him rise 
 and go into the waters, but <I>rise and walk.</I> Christ did that for 
 us which the law could not do, and set that aside. 

 [2.] He is bidden to <I>take up his bed. First,</I> To make it to 
 appear that it was a <I>perfect cure,</I> and purely miraculous; for he 
 did not recover strength by degrees, but from the extremity of weakness 
 and impotency he suddenly stepped into the highest degree of bodily 
 strength; so that he was able to carry as great a load as any porter 
 that had been as long <I>used</I> to it as he had been <I>disused.</I> 
 He, who this minute was not able to turn himself in his bed, the next 
 minute was able to carry his bed. The man sick of the palsy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:6">Matt. ix. 6</A>)

 was bidden to <I>go to his house,</I> but probably this man had no 
 house to go to, the hospital was his home; therefore he is bidden to 
 <I>rise and walk. Secondly,</I> It was to <I>proclaim</I> the cure,
 and make it public; for, being the sabbath day, whoever carried a 
 burden through the streets made himself very remarkable, and every one 
 would enquire what was the meaning of it; thereby notice of the miracle 
 would spread, to the honour of God. <I>Thirdly,</I> Christ would thus
 witness against the tradition of the elders, which had stretched the 
 law of the sabbath beyond its intention; and would likewise show that 
 he was <I>Lord of the sabbath,</I> and had power to make what 
 alterations he pleased about it, and to over-rule the law. Joshua, and 
 the host of Israel, marched about Jericho on the sabbath day, when God 
 commanded them, so did this man carry his bed, in obedience to a 
 command. The case may be such that it may become a work of 
 <I>necessity,</I> or <I>mercy,</I> to carry a bed on the sabbath day; 
 but here it was more, it was a work of <I>piety,</I> being designed 
 purely for the glory of God. <I>Fourthly,</I> He would hereby try the
 faith and obedience of his patient. By carrying his bed publicly, he 
 exposed himself to the censure of the ecclesiastical court, and was 
 liable, at least, to be <I>scourged in the synagogue.</I> Now, will he 
 run the hazard of this, in obedience to Christ? Yes, he will. Those 
 that have been <I>healed by Christ's word</I> should be <I>ruled by his 
 word,</I> whatever it cost them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The efficacy of this word 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 a divine power went alone with it, and immediately he was <I>made 
 whole, took up his bed, and walked.</I> 

 [1.] He felt the power of Christ's word healing him: <I>Immediately he 
 was made whole.</I> What a joyful surprise was this to the poor 
 cripple, to find himself all of a sudden so easy, so strong, so able to 
 help himself! What a new world was he in, in an instant! Nothing is too 
 hard for Christ to do. 

 [2.] He obeyed the power of Christ's word commanding him. He <I>took
 up his bed and walked,</I> and did not care who blamed him or 
 threatened him for it. The proof of our spiritual cure is our rising 
 and walking. Hath Christ healed our spiritual diseases? Let us go 
 whithersoever he sends us, and <I>take up</I> whatever he is pleased to 
 lay upon us, and <I>walk before him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. What became of the poor man after he was cured. We are here 
 told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What passed between him and the Jews who saw him carry his bed on 
 the sabbath day; for on that day this cure was wrought, and it was the 
 sabbath that fell within the passover week, and therefore a <I>high 
 day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:31"><I>ch.</I> xix. 31</A>.

 Christ's work was such that he needed not make any difference between
 sabbath days and other days, for he was always about his Father's 
 business; but he wrought many remarkable cures on that day, perhaps to 
 encourage his church to expect those spiritual favours from him, in 
 their observance of the Christian sabbath, which were typified by his 
 miraculous cures. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The Jews quarrelled with the man for carrying his bed on the 
 sabbath day, telling him that <I>it was not lawful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It does not appear whether they were magistrates, who had power to 
 <I>punish</I> him, or common people, who could only <I>inform</I> 
 against him; but thus far was commendable, that, while they knew not by 
 <I>what authority</I> he did it, they were jealous for the honour of 
 the sabbath, and could not unconcernedly see it <I>profaned;</I> like 
 Nehemiah. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:17">Neh. xiii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The man justified himself in what he did by a warrant that would 
 bear him out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 "I do not do it in contempt of the law and the sabbath, but in 
 obedience to one who, by <I>making me whole,</I> has given me an 
 undeniable proof that he is greater than either. He that could work 
 such a miracle as to <I>make me whole</I> no doubt might give me such a 
 command as to carry <I>my bed;</I> he that could overrule the powers of 
 nature no doubt might overrule a positive law, especially in an 
 instance not of the essence of the law. He that was so kind as to make 
 me whole would not be so unkind as to bid me do what is sinful." 
 Christ, by curing another paralytic, proved his power to <I>forgive 
 sin,</I> here to <I>give law;</I> if his pardons are valid, his edicts 
 are so, and his miracles prove both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The Jews enquired further who it was that gave him this warrant
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>What man is that?</I> Observe, How industriously they 
 <I>overlooked</I> that which might be a ground of their <I>faith in 
 Christ.</I> They enquire not, no, not for curiosity, "Who is it that 
 <I>made thee whole?</I>" While they industriously caught at that which 
 might be a ground of reflection upon Christ (<I>What man is</I> it who 
 said unto thee, <I>Take up thy bed?</I>) they would fain
 <I>subpoena</I> the patient to be witness against his physician, and to 
 be his betrayer. In their question, observe, 

 [1.] They resolve to look upon Christ as a <I>mere man: What man is 
 that?</I> For, though he gave ever such convincing proofs of it, they 
 were resolved that they would never own him to be the <I>Son of 
 God.</I> 

 [2.] They resolve to look upon him as a bad <I>man,</I> and take it for 
 granted that he who bade this man carry his bed, whatever divine 
 commission he might <I>produce,</I> was certainly a delinquent, and as 
 such they resolve to prosecute him. <I>What man is that</I> who durst 
 give such orders?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The poor man was unable to give them any account of him: <I>He
 wist not who he was,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Christ was <I>unknown</I> to him when he healed him. Probably he
 had heard of the name of Jesus, but had never seen him, and therefore
 could not tell that this was he. Note, Christ does many a good turn for
 those that know him not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:4,5">Isa. xlv. 4, 5</A>.

 He enlightens, strengthens, quickens, comforts us, and we <I>wist not 
 who he is;</I> nor are aware how much we receive daily by his 
 mediation. This man, being unacquainted with Christ, could not actually 
 believe in him for a cure; but Christ knew the dispositions of his 
 soul, and suited his favours to them, as to the blind man in a like 
 case,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:36"><I>ch.</I> ix. 36</A>.

 Our covenant and communion with God take rise, not so much from our
 knowledge of him, as from his knowledge of us. We <I>know God,</I> or,
 rather, are <I>known of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:9">Gal. iv. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] For the present he <I>kept himself unknown;</I> for as soon as he 
 had wrought the cure he <I>conveyed himself away,</I> he <I>made 
 himself unknown</I> (so some read it), <I>a multitude being in that 
 place.</I> This is mentioned to show, either, <I>First,</I> How Christ 
 conveyed himself away--by retiring into the crowd, so as not to be
 distinguished from a common person. He that was the chief of ten 
 thousand often made himself one of the throng. It is sometimes the lot 
 of those who have by their services signalized themselves to be 
 levelled with the multitude, and overlooked. Or <I>Secondly, Why</I> he 
 conveyed himself away, because there was <I>a multitude</I> there, and 
 he industriously avoided both the <I>applause</I> of those who would 
 admire the miracle and <I>cry that up,</I> and the censure of those who 
 would censure him as a sabbath-breaker, and <I>run him down.</I> Those 
 that are active for God in their generation must expect to pass through 
 <I>evil report</I> and <I>good report;</I> and it is wisdom as much as 
 may be to keep out of the hearing of both; lest by the one we be 
 <I>exalted,</I> and by the other <I>depressed,</I> above measure. 
 Christ left the miracle to commend itself, and the man on whom it was 
 wrought to justify it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What passed between him and our Lord Jesus at their next interview, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Where Christ found him: <I>in the temple,</I> the place of public 
 worship. In our attendance on public worship we may expect to meet with 
 Christ, and improve our acquaintance with him. Observe, 

 [1.] Christ <I>went to the temple.</I> Though he had many enemies, yet 
 he appeared in public, because there he bore his testimony to divine 
 institutions, and had opportunity of doing good. 

 [2.] The man that was cured <I>went to the temple.</I> There Christ 
 found him the same day, as it should seem, that he was healed; thither 
 he straightway went, <I>First,</I> Because he had, <I>by his 
 infirmity,</I> been so long <I>detained</I> thence. Perhaps he had not 
 been there for thirty-eight years, and therefore, as soon as ever the 
 embargo is taken off, his first visit shall be to the temple, as 
 Hezekiah intimates his shall be

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:22">Isa. xxxviii. 22</A>):

 <I>What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord? 
 Secondly,</I> Because he had <I>by his recovery</I> a good errand 
 thither; he went up to the temple to return thanks to God for his 
 recovery. When God has at any time restored us our health we ought to 
 attend him with solemn praises 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:18,19">Ps. cxvi. 18, 19</A>),

 and the sooner the better, while the sense of the mercy is fresh. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> Because he had, by <I>carrying his bed,</I> seemed to 
 put a contempt on the sabbath, he would thus show that he had an honour 
 for it, and made conscience of sabbath-sanctification, in that on which 
 the chief stress of it is laid, which is the <I>public worship</I> of 
 God. Works of necessity and mercy are allowed; but when they are over 
 we must <I>go to the temple.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What he said to him. When Christ has cured us, he has not done 
 with us; he now applies himself to the healing of his soul, and this 
 <I>by the word</I> too. 

 [1.] He gives him a <I>memento</I> of his cure: <I>Behold thou art made 
 whole.</I> He found himself made whole, yet Christ calls his attention 
 to it. <I>Behold, consider</I> it seriously, how sudden, how strange, 
 how cheap, how easy, the cure was: <I>admire it;</I> behold, and 
 wonder: <I>Remember it;</I> let the impressions of it abide, and never 
 be lost, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:9">Isa. xxxviii. 9</A>.

 [2.] He gives him a caution against sin, in consideration hereof,
 <I>Being made whole, sin no more.</I> This implies that his disease was 
 the punishment of sin; whether of some remarkably flagrant sin, or only 
 of sin in general, we cannot tell, but we know that sin is the 
 procuring cause of sickness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:17,18">Ps. cvii. 17, 18</A>.

 Some observe that Christ did not make mention of sin to any of his
 patients, except to this <I>impotent</I> man, and another who was in 
 like manner diseased,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:5">Mark ii. 5</A>.

 While those chronical diseases lasted, they prevented the outward acts
 of many sins, and therefore watchfulness was the more necessary when 
 the disability was removed. Christ intimates that those who are
 <I>made whole,</I> who are eased of the present sensible punishment of 
 sin, are in danger of <I>returning</I> to sin when the terror and 
 restraint are over, unless divine grace dry up the fountain. When the 
 trouble which only dammed up the current is over, the waters will 
 return to their old course; and therefore there is great need of 
 watchfulness, lest after healing mercy we return again to folly. The 
 <I>misery</I> we were <I>made whole from</I> warns us to sin no more, 
 having felt the smart of sin; the <I>mercy</I> we were <I>made whole 
 by</I> is an engagement upon us not to offend him who healed us. This 
 is the voice of every providence, <I>Go and sin no more.</I> This man 
 began his new life very hopefully <I>in the temple,</I> yet Christ saw 
 it necessary to give him this caution; for it is common for people, 
 when they are sick, to <I>promise much,</I> when newly recovered to 
 <I>perform something,</I> but after awhile to <I>forget all.</I>

 [3.] He gives him warning of his danger, in case he should return to 
 his former sinful course: <I>Lest a worse thing come to thee.</I> 
 Christ, who knows all men's hearts, knew that he was one of those that 
 must be <I>frightened</I> from sin. Thirty-eight years' lameness, one
 would think, was a thing bad enough; yet there is something 
 <I>worse</I> that will come to him if he relapse into sin after God has 
 <I>given him such a deliverance</I> as this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:13,14">Ezra ix. 13, 14</A>.

 The hospital where he lay was a melancholy place, but hell is much more
 so: the doom of apostates is a worse thing than thirty-eight years' 
 lameness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Now, after this interview between Christ and his patient, observe 
 in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:15,16">two following verses</A>,

 1. The notice which the poor simple man gave to the Jews concerning
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He told them it was Jesus that had <I>made him whole.</I> We have 
 reason to think that he intended this for the honour of Christ and the 
 benefit of the Jews, little thinking that he who had so much power and 
 goodness could have <I>any</I> enemies; but those who wish well to 
 Christ's kingdom must have the <I>wisdom of the serpent,</I> lest they 
 do more hurt than good with their zeal, and must not cast pearls before 
 swine. 

 2. The rage and enmity of the Jews against him: <I>Therefore did 
 the</I> rulers of the Jews <I>persecute Jesus.</I> See,

 (1.) How absurd and unreasonable their enmity to Christ was. 
 <I>Therefore,</I> because he had made a poor sick man well, and so 
 eased the public charge, upon which, it is likely, he had subsisted; 
 <I>therefore</I> they persecuted him, because he did good in Israel.
 
 (2.) How bloody and cruel it was: <I>They sought to slay him;</I> 
 nothing less than his blood, his life, would satisfy them. 

 (3.) How it was varnished over with a colour of zeal for the honour of 
 the sabbath; for this was the pretended crime, <I>Because he had done 
 these things on the sabbath day,</I> as if that circumstance were 
 enough to vitiate the best and most divine actions, and to render 
 <I>him</I> obnoxious whose deeds were otherwise most meritorious. Thus 
 hypocrites often cover their real enmity against the <I>power</I> of 
 godliness with a pretended zeal for the <I>form</I> of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I
 work.
 &nbsp; 18  Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he
 not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his
 Father, making himself equal with God.
 &nbsp; 19  Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I
 say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he
 seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also
 doeth the Son likewise.
 &nbsp; 20  For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things
 that himself doeth: and he will show him greater works than
 these, that ye may marvel.
 &nbsp; 21  For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth
 <I>them;</I> even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.
 &nbsp; 22  For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all
 judgment unto the Son:
 &nbsp; 23  That all <I>men</I> should honour the Son, even as they honour
 the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the
 Father which hath sent him.
 &nbsp; 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
 believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall
 not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
 &nbsp; 25  Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now
 is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and
 they that hear shall live.
 &nbsp; 26  For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to
 the Son to have life in himself;
 &nbsp; 27  And hath given him authority to execute judgment also,
 because he is the Son of man.
 &nbsp; 28  Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all
 that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
 &nbsp; 29  And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
 resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
 resurrection of damnation.
 &nbsp; 30  I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and
 my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the
 will of the Father which hath sent me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's discourse upon occasion of his being accused as a 
 sabbath-breaker, and it seems to be his vindication of himself before 
 the sanhedrim, when he was arraigned before them: whether on the same 
 day, or two or three days after, does not appear; probably the same 
 day. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The doctrine laid down, by which he justified what he did on the 
 sabbath day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>He answered them.</I> This supposes that he had something laid to 
 his charge: or what they suggested one to another, when they sought to 
 slay him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 he <I>knew,</I> and gave this reply to, <I>My Father worketh hitherto, 
 and I work.</I> At other times, in answer to the like charge, he had 
 pleaded the example of David's eating the show-bread, of the priests' 
 slaying the sacrifices, and of the people's watering their cattle on 
 the sabbath day; but here he goes higher and alleges the example of his 
 Father and his divine authority; waiving all other pleas, he insists 
 upon that which was <I>instar omnium--equivalent to the whole,</I> and 
 abides by it, which he had mentioned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:8">Matt. xii. 8</A>.

 <I>The Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day;</I> but he here
 enlarges on it.

 1. He pleads that he was the Son of God, <I>plainly intimated in his 
 calling God his Father;</I> and, if so, his holiness was 
 <I>unquestionable</I> and his sovereignty <I>incontestable;</I> and he 
 might make what alterations he pleased of the divine law. <I>Surely 
 they will reverence the Son,</I> the heir of all things. 

 2. That he was a worker together with God.

 (1.) <I>My Father worketh hitherto.</I> The example of God's resting on 
 the seventh day from all his work is, in the fourth commandment, made 
 the ground of our observing it as a <I>sabbath</I> or <I>day of 
 rest.</I> Now God rested only from such work as he had done the six 
 days before; otherwise he <I>worketh hitherto,</I> he is every day 
 working, sabbath days and week-days, upholding and governing all the 
 creatures, and concurring by his common providence to all the motions 
 and operations of nature, <I>to his own glory;</I> therefore, when we 
 are appointed to rest on the sabbath day, yet we are not restrained 
 from doing that which has a direct tendency <I>to the glory of God,</I> 
 as the man's carrying his bed had. 

 (2.) <I>I work;</I> not only therefore I <I>may</I> work, <I>like 
 him,</I> in doing good on sabbath days as well as other days, but I 
 also <I>work with him.</I> As God created all things by Christ, so he 
 supports and governs all by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:3">Heb. i. 3</A>.

 This sets what he does above all exception; he that is so great a
 worker must needs be an uncontrollable governor; he that does all is 
 Lord of all, and therefore <I>Lord of the sabbath,</I> which particular 
 branch of his authority he would now assert, because he was shortly to 
 show it further, in the change of the day from the seventh to the 
 first.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The offence that was taken at his doctrine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>The Jews sought the more to kill him.</I> His defence was made his 
 offence, as if by justifying himself he had made bad worse. Note, Those 
 that will not be enlightened by the word of Christ will be enraged and 
 exasperated by it, and nothing more vexes the enemies of Christ than 
 his asserting his authority; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:3-5">Ps. ii. 3-5</A>.

 They sought to kill him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Because he had broken the sabbath; for, let him say what he would in 
 his own justification, they are resolved, right or wrong, to <I>find 
 him guilty</I> of sabbath breaking. When malice and envy sit upon the 
 bench, reason and justice may even be silent at the bar, for whatever 
 they can say will undoubtedly be over-ruled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Not only so, but he had said also <I>that God was his Father.</I> 
 Now they pretend a jealousy for <I>God's honour,</I> as before for the 
 sabbath day, and charge Christ with it as a heinous crime that he made 
 himself equal with God; and a heinous crime it had been if he had not 
 really been so. It was the sin of Lucifer, <I>I will be like the Most 
 High.</I> Now, 

 (1.) This was justly inferred from what he said, that he was the <I>Son 
 of God,</I> and that God was <I>his Father,</I> <B><I>patera 
 idion</I></B>--<I>his own Father;</I> his, so as he was no one's else. 
 He had said that he worked with his Father, by the same authority and 
 power, and hereby he made himself equal with God. <I>Ecce intelligunt 
 Jud&aelig;i, quod non intelligunt Ariani--Behold, the Jews understand 
 what the Arians do not.</I> 

 (2.) Yet it was unjustly imputed to him as an offence that he equalled 
 himself with God, for he was and is God, equal with the Father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:6">Phil. ii. 6</A>);

 and therefore Christ, in answer to this charge, does not except against 
 the innuendo as strained or forced, makes out his claim and proves that 
 he is equal with God in power and glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's discourse upon this occasion, which continues without
 interruption to the end of the chapter. In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:19-47">these verses</A>

 he explains,
 and afterwards confirms, his commission, as Mediator and
 plenipotentiary in the treaty between God and man. And, as the honours 
 he is hereby <I>entitled to</I> are such as it is not fit for any 
 creature to receive, so the work he is hereby entrusted with is such as 
 it is not possible for any creature to go through with, and therefore 
 he is God, equal with the Father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>In general.</I> He is one with the Father in all he does as 
 Mediator, and there was a perfectly good understanding between them in 
 the whole matter. It is ushered in with a solemn preface 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>Verily, verily, I say unto you;</I> I the Amen, the Amen, say it. 
 This intimates that the things declared are, 

 (1.) Very awful and great, and such as should command the most serious 
 attention. 

 (2.) Very sure, and such as should command an unfeigned assent. 

 (3.) That they are matters purely of divine revelation; things which 
 Christ has told us, and which we could not otherwise have come to the 
 knowledge of. Two things he saith in general concerning the Son's 
 oneness with the Father in working:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That the Son <I>conforms to the Father</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>The Son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the Father 
 do;</I> for <I>these things does the Son.</I> The Lord Jesus, as 
 Mediator, is <I>First, Obedient to his Father's will;</I> so entirely 
 obedient that he <I>can do nothing of himself,</I> in the same sense as 
 it is said, <I>God cannot</I> lie, <I>cannot deny</I> himself, which 
 expresses the perfection of his truth, not any imperfection in his 
 strength; so here, Christ was so entirely devoted to his Father's will 
 that it was impossible for him in any thing to act separately. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> He is <I>observant of his Father's counsel;</I> he 
 can, he will, do nothing <I>but what he sees the Father do.</I> No man 
 can <I>find out the work of God,</I> but the only-begotten Son, who lay 
 in his bosom, sees what he does, is intimately acquainted with his 
 purposes, and has the plan of them ever before him. What he did as 
 Mediator, throughout his whole undertaking, was the exact transcript or 
 counterpart of what the Father did; that is, what he designed, when he 
 formed the plan of our redemption in his eternal counsels, and settled 
 those measures in every thing which never could be <I>broken,</I> nor 
 ever needed to be <I>altered.</I> It was the copy of that <I>great 
 original;</I> it was Christ's faithfulness, as it was Moses's, that he 
 did all <I>according to the pattern shown him in the mount.</I> This is 
 expressed in the present tense, what he <I>sees the Father do,</I> for 
 the same reason that, when he was here upon earth, it was said, He 
 <I>is</I> in heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:13"><I>ch.</I> iii. 13</A>),
 
 and <I>is</I> in the bosom of the Father
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18"><I>ch.</I> i. 18</A>);

 as he was even then by his divine nature present in heaven, so the
 things done in heaven were <I>present</I> to his knowledge. What the 
 Father did in his counsels, the Son had ever in his view, and still he 
 had his eye upon it, as David in spirit spoke of him, <I>I have set the 
 Lord always before me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:8">Ps. xvi. 8</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> Yet he is <I>equal</I> with the Father in
 <I>working;</I> for <I>what things soever</I> the Father does <I>these 
 also does the Son likewise;</I> he did the <I>same</I> things, not 
 <I>such</I> things, but <B> <I>tauta</I></B>, the <I>same</I> things;
 and he did them in the <I>same manner,</I> <B><I>homoios</I></B>, 
 <I>likewise,</I> with the same authority, and liberty, and wisdom, the 
 same energy and efficacy. Does the Father enact, repeal, and alter,
 positive laws? Does he over-rule the course of nature, know men's 
 hearts? So does the Son. The power of the Mediator is a divine 
 power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That the Father <I>communicates</I> to the Son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The inducement to it: <I>The Father loveth the Son;</I> 
 he declared, <I>This is my beloved Son.</I> He had not only a good will 
 to the undertaking, but an infinite complacency in the undertaker. 
 Christ was now hated of men, one whom the nation abhorred 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:7">Isa. xlix. 7</A>);
 
 but he comforted himself with this, that his Father loved him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The instances of it. He shows it, 

 1. In what he <I>does</I> communicate to him: <I>He shows him all 
 things that himself doth.</I> The Father's measures in making and 
 ruling the world are shown to the Son, that he may take the same 
 measures in framing and governing the church, which work was to be a 
 duplicate of the work of creation and providence, and it is therefore 
 called <I>the world to come.</I> He shows him all things <B><I>ha autos 
 poiei</I></B>--<I>which he does,</I> that is, which the <I>Son</I> 
 does, so it might be construed; all that the Son does is by direction 
 from the Father; he <I>shows</I> him. 

 2. In what he <I>will</I> communicate; he will <I>show him,</I> that 
 is, will appoint and direct him to do <I>greater works than these.</I>

 (1.) Works of greater <I>power</I> than the <I>curing of the impotent 
 man;</I> for he should raise the dead, and should himself rise from the 
 dead. By the power of nature, with the use of means, a disease may 
 possibly in time be cured; but nature can never, by the use of any 
 means, in any time raise the dead. 

 (2.) Works of greater <I>authority</I> than warranting the man to 
 <I>carry his bed on the sabbath day.</I> They thought this a daring 
 attempt; but what was this to his abrogating the whole ceremonial law, 
 and instituting new ordinances, which he would shortly do, "<I>that you 
 may marvel!</I>" Now they looked upon his works with contempt and 
 indignation, but he will shortly do that which they will look upon with 
 amazement, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:16">Luke vii. 16</A>.

 Many are brought to marvel at Christ's works, whereby he has the honour
 of them, who are not brought to believe, by which they would have the 
 benefit of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>In particular.</I> He proves his equality with the Father, by 
 specifying some of those works which he does that are the peculiar 
 works of God. This is enlarged upon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:21-30"><I>v.</I> 21-30</A>.

 He does, and shall do, that which is the peculiar work of God's
 sovereign dominion and jurisdiction--<I>judging</I> and <I>executing 
 judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:22-24,27"><I>v.</I> 22-24, 27</A>.

 These two are interwoven, as being nearly connected; and what is said 
 once is repeated and inculcated; put both together, and they will prove 
 that Christ said not amiss when he made himself <I>equal with 
 God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Observe what is here said concerning the Mediator's power to 
 <I>raise the dead</I> and <I>give life.</I> See 

 [1.] His <I>authority</I> to do it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>As the Father raiseth up the dead,</I> so <I>the Son quickeneth whom 
 he will. First,</I> It is God's prerogative to raise the dead, and give 
 life, even his who first <I>breathed</I> into man the <I>breath of 
 life,</I> and so made him a <I>living soul;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:30,1Sa+2:6,Ps+68:20,Ro+4:17">Deut. xxxii. 30; 
 1 Sam. ii. 6; Ps. lxviii. 20; Rom. iv. 17</A>.

 This God had done by the prophets Elijah and Elisha, and it was a
 confirmation of their mission. A <I>resurrection from the dead</I> 
 never lay in the common road of nature, nor ever fell within the 
 thought of those that studied only the compass of nature's power, one 
 of whose received axioms was point blank against it: <I>A privatione ad 
 habitum non datur regressus--Existence, when once extinguished, cannot 
 be rekindled.</I> It was therefore ridiculed at Athens as an 
 <I>absurd</I> thing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:32">Acts xvii. 32</A>.

 It is purely the work of a divine power, and the knowledge of it purely
 by divine revelation. This the Jews would own. <I>Secondly,</I> The 
 Mediator is invested with this prerogative: <I>He quickens whom he 
 will;</I> raises to life whom he pleases, and when he pleases. He does 
 not enliven things by natural necessity, as the sun does, whose beams 
 revive of course; but he acts as a free agent, has the dispensing of 
 his power in his own hand, and is never either <I>con</I>strained, or 
 <I>re</I>strained, in the use of it. As he has the power, so he has the 
 wisdom and sovereignty, of a God; has the <I>key of the grave and of 
 death</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:18">Rev. i. 18</A>),

 not as a servant, to open and shut as he is bidden, for he has it as 
 the <I>key of David,</I> which he is master of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:7">Rev. iii. 7</A>.

 An absolute prince is described by this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:19">Dan. v. 19</A>):

 <I>Whom he would he slew or kept alive;</I> it is true of Christ
 without hyperbole.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] His <I>ability</I> to do it. <I>Therefore</I> he has power to 
 quicken whom he will as the Father does, because <I>he has life in 
 himself, as the Father has,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 <I>First,</I> It is certain that the Father <I>has life in himself.</I> 
 Not only he is a <I>self-existent</I> Being, who does not derive from, 
 or depend upon, any other

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:14">Exod. iii. 14</A>),

 but he is a sovereign giver of life; he has the disposal of life in 
 himself; and of all good (for so <I>life</I> sometimes signifies); it 
 is all derived from him, and dependent on him. He is to his creatures
 the fountain of life, and all good; author of their being and 
 well-being; the living God, and the God of all living.
 <I>Secondly,</I> It is as certain that he has <I>given to the Son to 
 have life in himself.</I> As the Father is the original of all natural 
 life and good, being the great Creator, so the Son, as Redeemer, is the 
 original of all spiritual life and good; is that to the church which 
 the Father is to the world; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:6,Col+1:19">1 Cor. viii. 6; Col. i. 19</A>.

 The kingdom of grace, and all the life in that kingdom, are as fully
 and absolutely in the hand of the Redeemer as the kingdom of providence 
 is in the hand of the Creator; and as God, who gives being to all 
 things, has his being of himself, so Christ, who gives life, raised 
 himself to life by his own power,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:18"><I>ch.</I> x. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] His <I>acting</I> according to this authority and ability. Having 
 <I>life in himself,</I> and being authorized to <I>quicken whom he 
 will,</I> by virtue hereof there are, accordingly, two resurrections 
 performed by his powerful word, both which are here spoken of:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> A resurrection that <I>now is</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 a resurrection from the death of sin to the life of righteousness, by 
 the power of Christ's grace. <I>The hour is coming, and now is.</I> It 
 is a resurrection begun already, and further to be carried on, <I>when 
 the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God.</I> This is plainly 
 distinguished from that in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>,

 which speaks of the resurrection at the end of time. This says nothing, 
 as that does, of the dead in their graces, and of all of them, and 
 their coming forth. Now, 

 1. Some think this was fulfilled in those whom he miraculously raised 
 to life, Jairus's daughter, the widow's son, and Lazarus; and it is 
 observable that all whom Christ raised were <I>spoken to,</I> as, 
 <I>Damsel, arise; Young man, arise; Lazarus, come forth;</I> whereas 
 those raised under the Old Testament were raised, not by a word, but 
 other applications, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:21,2Ki+4:34,13:21">1 Kings xvii. 21; 
 2 Kings iv. 34; xiii. 21</A>.

 Some understand it of those saints that rose with Christ; but we do not
 read of the <I>voice of the Son of God</I> calling them. But,

 2. I rather understand it of the power of the doctrine of Christ, for 
 the recovering and quickening of those that were <I>dead in trespasses 
 and sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:1">Eph. ii. 1</A>.

 The <I>hour</I> was <I>coming</I> when dead souls should be made alive
 by the <I>preaching</I> of the gospel, and a spirit of life from God 
 accompanying it: nay, it <I>then was,</I> while Christ was upon earth.
 It may refer especially to the <I>calling of the Gentiles,</I> which is 
 said to be as life from the dead, and, some think, was prefigured by 
 Ezekiel's vision

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:1"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 1</A>),
 
 and foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:19">Isa. xxvi. 19</A>.

 <I>Thy dead men shall live.</I> But it is to be applied to all the
 wonderful success of the gospel, among both Jews and Gentiles; an hour 
 which still <I>is,</I> and is still <I>coming,</I> till all the elect 
 be effectually called. Note, 

 (1.) Sinners are spiritually <I>dead,</I> destitute of spiritual life, 
 sense, strength, and motion, dead to God, miserable, but neither 
 sensible of their misery nor able to help themselves out of it. 

 (2.) The conversion of a soul to God is its resurrection from death to 
 life; then it begins to live when it begins to <I>live to God,</I> to 
 breathe after him, and move towards him. 

 (3.) It is by the <I>voice of the Son of God</I> that souls are raised 
 to spiritual life; it is wrought by his power, and that power conveyed 
 and communicated by his word: <I>The dead shall hear,</I> shall be made 
 to hear, to understand, receive, and believe, the <I>voice of the Son 
 of God,</I> to hear it as his voice; then the Spirit by it gives life, 
 otherwise the <I>letter kills.</I> 

 (4.) The voice of Christ must be heard by us, that we may live by it.
 They that hear, and attend to what they hear, shall live. <I>Hear and
 your soul shall live,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:3">Isa. lv. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> A resurrection yet <I>to come;</I> this is spoken of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>,

 introduced with, "<I>Marvel not at this,</I> which I have said of the 
 <I>first</I> resurrection, do not reject it as incredible and absurd, 
 for at the end of time you shall all see a more sensible and amazing 
 proof of the power and authority of the Son of man." As <I>his own</I> 
 resurrection was reserved to be the final and concluding proof of his 
 personal commission, so the resurrection of <I>all men</I> is reserved 
 to be a like proof of his commission to be executed by his spirit. Now 
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> When this resurrection shall be: <I>The hour is coming;</I> 
 it is <I>fixed</I> to an hour, so very punctual is this great 
 appointment. The judgment is not adjourned <I>sine die--to some time not
 yet pitched upon;</I> no, <I>he hath appointed a day. The hour is 
 coming.</I> 

 (<I>a.</I>) It is <I>not yet</I> come, it is not the hour spoken of at 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>,

 that is coming, and <I>now is.</I> Those erred dangerously who said 
 that the <I>resurrection was past already,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:18">2 Tim. ii. 18</A>,
 
 But,
 
 (<I>b.</I>) It <I>will certainly</I> come, it is coming on, nearer
 every day than other; it is at the door. How far off it is we know not; 
 but we know that it is infallibly designed and unalterably 
 determined.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> Who shall be raised: <I>All that are in the graves,</I> all 
 that have died from the beginning of time, and all that shall die to 
 the end of time. It was said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:2">Dan. xii. 2</A>),

 <I>Many</I> shall arise; Christ here tells us that those <I>many</I> 
 shall be <I>all; all</I> must appear before the Judge, and therefore 
 <I>all</I> must be raised; every person, and the whole of every person; 
 every soul shall return to its body, and every <I>bone to its bone.</I> 
 The grave is the prison of dead bodies, where they are <I>detained;</I> 
 their furnace, where they are <I>consumed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:19">Job xxiv. 19</A>);

 yet, in prospect of their resurrection, we may call it their 
 <I>bed,</I> where they sleep to be <I>awaked</I> again; their treasury, 
 where they are laid up to be used again. Even those that are not <I>put 
 into graves</I> shall arise; but, because most are put into graves, 
 Christ uses this expression, <I>all that are in the graves.</I> The 
 Jews used the word <I>sheol</I> for the <I>grave,</I> which signifies 
 <I>the state of the dead;</I> all that are in that state <I>shall 
 hear.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>c.</I> How they shall be raised. Two things are here told us:--

 (<I>a.</I>) The efficient of this resurrection: <I>They shall hear his 
 voice;</I> that is, he shall cause them to hear it, as Lazarus was made 
 to hear that word, <I>Come forth;</I> a divine power shall go along 
 with the voice, to put life into them, and enable them to obey it. When 
 Christ rose, there was no voice heard, not a word spoken, because he 
 rose by his own power; but at the resurrection of the children of men 
 we find three voices spoken of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:16">1 Thess. iv. 16</A>.

 The Lord shall descend with a <I>shout,</I> the shout of a king, with
 <I>the voice of the archangel;</I> either Christ himself, the prince of 
 the angels, or the commander-in-chief, under him, of the heavenly 
 hosts; and with <I>the trumpet of God:</I> the soldier's trumpet 
 sounding the alarm of war, the judge's trumpet publishing the summons 
 to the court.

 (<I>b.</I>) The effect of it: <I>They shall come forth</I> out of their 
 graves, as prisoners out of their prison-house; they shall <I>arise 
 out</I> of the dust, and shake themselves from it; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:1,2,11">Isa. lii. 1, 2, 11</A>.

 But this is not all; they shall <I>appear</I> before Christ's tribunal,
 shall <I>come forth</I> as those that are to be tried, <I>come 
 forth</I> to the bar, publicly to receive their doom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>d.</I> To what they shall be raised; to a different state of 
 happiness or misery, according to their different character; to a state 
 of retribution, according to what they did in the state of 
 probation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) <I>They that have done good shall come forth to the 
 resurrection of life;</I> they shall live again, to live for ever. 
 Note, 

 [<I>a.</I>] Whatever name men are called by, or whatever plausible 
 profession they make, it will be well in the great day with those only 
 that have <I>done good,</I> have done that which is pleasing to God and 
 profitable to others. 

 [<I>b.</I>] The resurrection of the body will be a resurrection of life 
 to all those, and those only, that have been sincere and constant in 
 <I>doing good.</I> They shall not only be publicly <I>acquitted,</I> as 
 a pardoned criminal, we say, has <I>his life,</I> but they shall be 
 <I>admitted</I> into the presence of God, and that is life, it is 
 better than life; they shall be <I>attended</I> with comforts in 
 perfection. To live is to be <I>happy,</I> and they shall be 
 <I>advanced</I> above the fear of death; that is <I>life</I> indeed in 
 which <I>mortality</I> is for ever <I>swallowed</I> up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) <I>They that have done evil to the resurrection of 
 damnation;</I> they shall live again, to be for ever dying. The 
 Pharisees thought that the resurrection pertained only to the just, but 
 Christ here rectifies that mistake. Note, 

 [<I>a.</I>] <I>Evil doers,</I> whatever they pretend, will be treated 
 in the day of judgment as <I>evil men.</I> 

 [<I>b.</I>] The resurrection will be to evil doers, who did not by 
 repentance undo what they had done amiss, a <I>resurrection</I> of 
 damnation. They shall come forth to be publicly convicted of rebellion 
 against God, and publicly <I>condemned</I> to everlasting punishment; 
 to be <I>sentenced</I> to it, and immediately <I>sent</I> to it without 
 reprieve. Such will the resurrection be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Observe what is here said concerning the Mediator's <I>authority 
 to execute judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:22-24,27"><I>v.</I> 22-24, 27</A>.

 As he has an almighty power, so he has a sovereign jurisdiction; and 
 who so fit to preside in the great affairs of the other life as he who 
 is the Father and fountain of life? Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Christ's commission or delegation to the office of a judge, which 
 is twice spoken of here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>He hath committed all judgment to the Son;</I> and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):
 
 <I>he hath given him authority.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The <I>Father judges no man;</I> not that the Father hath
 resigned the government, but he is pleased to govern by Jesus Christ; 
 so that man is not under the terror of dealing with God immediately, 
 but has the comfort of access to him by a Mediator. Having made us, he 
 <I>may</I> do what he <I>pleases</I> with us, as the potter with the 
 clay; yet he does not take advantage of this, but draws us <I>with the 
 cords of a man.</I>

 2. He does not determine our everlasting condition by the <I>covenant 
 of innocency,</I> nor take the advantage he has against us for the 
 violation of that covenant. The Mediator having undertaken to make a 
 <I>vicarious</I> satisfaction, the matter is referred to him, and God 
 is willing to enter upon a new treaty; <I>not under the law</I> of the 
 Creator, <I>but the grace</I> of the Redeemer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly, He has committed all judgment to the Son,</I> has 
 constituted him <I>Lord of all</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:36,Ro+14:9">Acts x. 36; Rom. xiv. 9</A>),

 as Joseph in Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:40">Gen. xli. 40</A>.
 
 This was prophesied of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:1,Isa+11:3,4,Jer+23:5,Mic+5:1-4,Ps+67:4,96:13,98:9">Ps. lxxii. 1;
 Isa. xii. 3, 4; Jer. xxiii. 5; Mic. v. 1-4; Ps. lxvii. 4; xcvi. 13; xcviii. 9</A>.

 All judgment is committed to our Lord Jesus; for 

 1. He is <I>entrusted</I> with the administration of the 
 <I>providential kingdom,</I> is <I>head over all things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:11">Eph. i. 11</A>),

 head of every man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:3">1 Cor. xii. 3</A>.

 All things consist by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:17">Col. i. 17</A>.

 2. He is empowered to make laws immediately to bind conscience. <I>I
 say unto you</I> is now the form in which the statues of the kingdom of
 heaven run. <I>Be it enacted</I> by the Lord Jesus, and by <I>his</I>
 authority. All the acts now in force are touched with his sceptre. 

 3. He is authorized to appoint and settle the terms of the new
 covenant, and to draw up the articles of peace between God and man; it
 is God in Christ that reconciles the world, and to him he has given
 power to confer eternal life. The book of life is the Lamb's book; by
 his award we must stand or fall. 

 4. He is commissioned to carry on and complete the war with the powers 
 of darkness; to cast out and <I>give judgment against the prince of 
 this world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:31"><I>ch.</I> xii. 31</A>.

 He is commissioned not only to <I>judge,</I> but to <I>make war,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:11">Rev. xix. 11</A>.

 All that will fight <I>for God against Satan</I> must enlist themselves
 under <I>his</I> banner. 

 5. He is constituted sole manager of the judgment of the great day. The
 ancients generally understood these words of that <I>crowning act</I> 
 of his judicial power. The final and universal judgment is committed to 
 the Son of man; the tribunal is <I>his,</I> it is the judgment-seat of 
 Christ; the retinue is his, <I>his</I> mighty angels; he will try the 
 causes, and pass the sentence. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:31">Acts xvii. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> He has <I>given him authority to execute judgment 
 also,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. What the authority is which our Redeemer is invested with: <I>An 
 authority to execute judgment;</I> he has not only a legislative and 
 judicial power, but an <I>executive</I> power too. The phrase here is 
 used particularly for the judgment of condemnation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:15">Jude 15</A>.

 <B><I>poiesai krisin</I></B>--<I>to execute judgment</I> upon all; the
 same with his <I>taking vengeance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:8">2 Thess. i. 8</A>.

 The ruin of impenitent sinners comes from the hand of Christ; he that
 <I>executes judgment</I> upon them is the same that would have 
 <I>wrought salvation</I> for them, which makes the sentence 
 unexceptionable; and there is no relief against the sentence of the 
 Redeemer; salvation itself cannot save those whom the Saviour 
 <I>condemns,</I> which makes the ruin <I>remediless.</I> 

 2. Whence he has that authority: the Father <I>gave it to him.</I> 
 Christ's authority as Mediator is delegated and derived; he acts as the 
 Father's Viceregent, as the Lord's Anointed, the Lord's Christ. Now all 
 this redounds very much to the honour of Christ, acquitting him from 
 the guilt of blasphemy, in making himself <I>equal with God;</I> and 
 very much to the comfort of all believers, who may with the greatest 
 assurance venture their all in such hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Here are the reasons (reasons of state) for which this commission 
 was given him. He has all judgment committed to him for two 
 reasons:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Because he is the <I>Son of man;</I> which denotes these 
 three things:--

 1. His humiliation and gracious condescension. Man is a worm, the son
 of man a worm; yet this was the nature, this the character, which the 
 Redeemer assumed, in pursuance of the counsels of love; to this low 
 estate he stooped, and submitted to all the mortifications attending 
 it, because it was <I>his Father's will;</I> in recompence therefore of 
 this wonderful obedience, God did thus dignify him. Because he 
 condescended to be the <I>Son of man,</I> his Father made him <I>Lord 
 of all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:8,9">Phil. ii. 8, 9</A>.

 2. His affinity and alliance to us. The Father has committed the 
 government of the children of men to him, because, being the <I>Son of 
 man,</I> he is of the same nature with those whom he is <I>set 
 over,</I> and therefore the more unexceptionable, and the more 
 acceptable, as a Judge. <I>Their governor shall proceed from the midst 
 of them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:21">Jer. xxx. 21</A>.

 Of this that law was typical; <I>One of thy brethren shalt thou set
 king over thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:15">Deut. xvii. 15</A>.

 3. His being the Messiah promised. In that famous vision of his kingdom
 and glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13,14">Dan. vii. 13, 14</A>,

 he is called the <I>Son of man;</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:4-6">Ps. viii. 4-6</A>.

 Thou has made the Son of man have <I>dominion over the works of thy
 hands.</I> He is the Messiah, and therefore is invested with all this 
 power. The Jews usually called the Christ the <I>Son of David;</I> but 
 Christ usually called himself the <I>Son of man,</I> which was the more 
 humble title, and bespeaks him a prince and Saviour, not the Jewish 
 nation only, but to the whole race of mankind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly, That all men should honour the Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The honouring of Jesus Christ is here spoken of as God's great design 
 (the Son intended to glorify the Father, and therefore the Father 
 intended to glorify the Son,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:32"><I>ch.</I> xii. 32</A>);

 and as man's great duty, in compliance with that design. If God will
 have the Son honoured, it is the duty of all to whom he is made known 
 to honour him. Observe here, 

 1. The <I>respect</I> that is to be paid to our Lord Jesus: We must 
 <I>honour the Son,</I> must look upon him as one that is to be 
 <I>honoured,</I> both on account of his transcendent excellences and 
 perfections in himself, and of the relations he stands in to us, and 
 must study to give him honour accordingly; must <I>confess that he is 
 Lord,</I> and worship him; must honour him who was dishonoured for us. 

 2. The degree of it: <I>Even as they honour the Father.</I> This 
 <I>supposes</I> it to be our duty to <I>honour the Father;</I> for 
 revealed religion is founded on natural religion, and <I>directs</I> us 
 to <I>honour the Son,</I> to honour him with <I>divine</I> honour; we 
 must honour the Redeemer with the same honour with which we honour the 
 Creator. So far was it from blasphemy for him to make himself <I>equal 
 with God</I> that it is the highest injury that can be for us to make 
 him otherwise. The truths and laws of the Christian religion, so far
 as they are revealed, are as sacred and honourable as those of natural 
 religion, and to be equally had in estimation; for we lie under the 
 same obligations to Christ, the Author of our being; and have as 
 necessary a dependence upon the Redeemer's grace as upon the Creator's 
 providence, which is a sufficient ground for this law--<I>to honour the 
 Son as we honour the Father.</I> To enforce this law, it is added, 
 <I>He that honours not the Son honours not the Father</I> who has sent 
 him. Some pretend a reverence for the Creator, and speak 
 <I>honourably</I> of him, who make light of the Redeemer, and speak 
 <I>contemptibly</I> of him; but let such know that the honours and 
 interests of the Father and Son are so inseparably twisted and 
 interwoven that the Father never reckons himself <I>honoured</I> by any 
 that <I>dishonour</I> the Son. Note,

 (1.) Indignities done to the Lord Jesus reflect upon God himself, and 
 will so be construed and reckoned for in the court of heaven. The Son 
 having so far espoused the Father's honour as to take <I>to himself</I> 
 the <I>reproaches cast on him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:3">Rom. xv. 3</A>),

 the Father does no less espouse the Son's honour, and counts himself 
 struck at through him.

 (2.) The reason of this is because the Son is sent and commissioned by 
 the Father; it is the <I>Father who hath sent him.</I> Affronts to an 
 ambassador are justly resented by the prince that sends him. And by 
 this rule those who truly <I>honour the Son honour the Father also;</I> 
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:11">Phil. ii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Here is the rule by which the Son goes in executing this 
 commission, so those words seem to come in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>He that heareth and believeth</I> hath <I>everlasting life.</I> Here 
 we have the substance of the whole gospel; the preface commands 
 <I>attention</I> to a thing most weighty, and <I>assent</I> to a thing 
 most certain: "<I>Verily, verily, I say unto you, I,</I> to whom you 
 hear <I>all judgment is committed,</I> I, in whose lips is a divine 
 sentence; take from <I>me</I> the Christian's <I>character</I> and 
 <I>charter.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The <I>character</I> of a Christian: <I>He that heareth 
 my word, and believeth on him that sent me.</I> To be a Christian 
 indeed is,

 1. To <I>hear the word of Christ.</I> It is not enough to be within
 hearing of it, but we must <I>attend on</I> it, as scholars on the 
 instructions of their teachers; and <I>attend to</I> it, as servants to 
 the commands of their masters; we must hear and obey it, must abide by 
 the gospel of Christ as the fixed rule of our faith and practice. 

 2. To <I>believe on him that sent him;</I> for Christ's design is to 
 <I>bring us to God;</I> and, as he is the first original of all grace, 
 so is he the last object of all faith. Christ is our <I>way;</I> God is 
 our rest. We must believe on God as <I>having sent</I> Jesus Christ, 
 and recommended himself to our faith and love, by manifesting his glory 
 in <I>the face of Jesus Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:6">2 Cor. iv. 6</A>),

 as <I>his</I> Father and <I>our Father.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The <I>charter</I> of a Christian, in which all that
 are Christians indeed are interested. See what we get by Christ.

 1. A charter of pardon: <I>He shall not come into condemnation.</I> The 
 grace of the gospel is a full discharge from the curse of the law. A 
 believer shall not only not <I>lie under</I> condemnation eternally, 
 but shall not <I>come into condemnation</I> now, not come into the 
 danger of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:1">Rom. viii. 1</A>),

 not <I>come into judgment,</I> not be so much as arraigned. 

 2. A charter of privileges: He is <I>passed out of death to life,</I> 
 is invested in a present happiness in spiritual life and entitled to a 
 future happiness in eternal life. The tenour of the first covenant was, 
 <I>Do this and live;</I> the man that doeth them shall live in them.
 Now this proves Christ equal with the Father that he has power to 
 propose the <I>same</I> benefit to the <I>hearers of his word</I> that 
 had been proposed to the <I>keepers of the old law,</I> that is, life: 
 <I>Hear and live, believe and live,</I> is what we may venture our 
 souls upon, when we are disabled to <I>do and live;</I> see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:2"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] Here is the righteousness of his proceedings pursuant to this 
 commission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 All judgment being committed to him, we cannot but ask <I>how he 
 manages it.</I> And here he answers, <I>My judgment is just.</I> All 
 Christ's acts of government, both <I>legislative</I> and 
 <I>judicial,</I> are exactly agreeable to the rules of equity; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:8">Prov. viii. 8</A>.

 There can lie no exceptions against any of the determinations of the 
 Redeemer; and therefore, as there shall be no repeal of any of his 
 statutes, so there shall be no appeal from any of his sentences. His 
 judgments are certainly just, for they are directed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> By the Father's <I>wisdom: I can of my ownself</I> do 
 nothing, nothing without the Father, but <I>as I hear I judge,</I> as 
 he had said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 The Son <I>can do nothing but what he sees the Father do;</I> so here, 
 nothing but what he hears the Father <I>say: As I hear,</I> 

 1. From the secret eternal counsels of the Father, <I>so I judge.</I> 
 Would we know what we may depend upon in our dealing with God? <I>Hear 
 the word</I> of Christ. We need not dive into the divine counsels, 
 those <I>secret things</I> which belong not to us, but attend to the 
 revealed dictates of Christ's government and judgment, which will 
 furnish us with an unerring guide; for what Christ has adjudged is an 
 exact copy or counterpart of what the Father has decreed. 

 2. From the published records of the Old Testament. Christ, in all the 
 execution of his undertaking, had an eye to the scripture, and made it 
 his business to conform to this, and <I>fulfil</I> it: <I>As it was 
 written in the volume of the book.</I> Thus he taught us to do 
 <I>nothing of ourselves,</I> but, <I>as we hear</I> from the word of 
 God, <I>so to judge</I> of things, and act accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> By the Father's <I>will: My judgment is just,</I> and 
 cannot be otherwise, <I>because I seek not my own will,</I> but <I>his 
 who sent me.</I> Not as if the will of Christ were contrary to the will 
 of the Father, as the flesh is contrary to the spirit in us; but, 

 1. Christ had, as man, the natural and innocent affections of the
 human nature, <I>sense of pain</I> and <I>pleasure,</I> an inclination 
 to life, an aversion to death: yet he <I>pleased not himself,</I> did 
 not confer with these, nor consult these, when he was to go on his 
 undertaking, but acquiesced entirely in the will of his Father. 

 2. What he did as Mediator was not the result of any <I>peculiar</I> or 
 <I>particular</I> purpose and design of his own; what he did 
 <I>seek</I> to do was not for his own mind's sake, but he was therein 
 guided by his Father's will, and the purpose which he had <I>purposed 
 to himself.</I> This our Saviour did upon all occasions <I>refer 
 himself to</I> and govern himself by.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
 &nbsp; 32  There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that
 the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
 &nbsp; 33  Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
 &nbsp; 34  But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I
 say, that ye might be saved.
 &nbsp; 35  He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing
 for a season to rejoice in his light.
 &nbsp; 36  But I have greater witness than <I>that</I> of John: for the
 works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works
 that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
 &nbsp; 37  And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne
 witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor
 seen his shape.
 &nbsp; 38  And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath
 sent, him ye believe not.
 &nbsp; 39  Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal
 life: and they are they which testify of me.
 &nbsp; 40  And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
 &nbsp; 41  I receive not honour from men.
 &nbsp; 42  But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.

 another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
 &nbsp; 44  How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and
 seek not the honour that <I>cometh</I> from God only?
 &nbsp; 45  Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is
 <I>one</I> that accuseth you, <I>even</I> Moses, in whom ye trust.

 wrote of me.
 &nbsp; 47  But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my
 words?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses our Lord Jesus proves and confirms the commission he
 had produced, and makes it out that he was sent of God to be the 
 Messiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He <I>sets aside</I> his own testimony of himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "<I>If I bear witness of myself,</I> though it is infallibly true

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:14"><I>ch.</I> viii. 14</A>),

 yet, according to the common rule of judgment among men, you will not 
 admit it as <I>legal proof,</I> nor allow it to be <I>given in 
 evidence.</I>" Now, 

 1. This reflects reproach upon the sons of men, and their veracity and 
 integrity. Surely we may say deliberately, what David said in haste, 
 <I>All men are liars,</I> else it would never have been such a received 
 maxim that a man's testimony of himself is suspicious, and not to be 
 relied on; it is a sign that self-love is stronger than the love of 
 truth. And yet, 

 2. It reflects honour on the Son of God, and bespeaks his wonderful 
 condescension, that, though he is the <I>faithful witness,</I> the 
 truth itself, who may challenge to be credited <I>upon his honour,</I> 
 and his own single testimony, yet he is pleased to <I>waive his 
 privilege,</I> and, for the confirmation of our faith, refers himself 
 to his <I>vouchers,</I> that we may have full satisfaction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He produces other witnesses that bear testimony to him that he was 
 sent of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The Father himself bore testimony to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>There is another that beareth witness.</I> I take this to be meant 
 of God the Father, for Christ mentions <I>his</I> testimony with his 
 own

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:18"><I>ch.</I> viii. 18</A>):

 <I>I bear witness of myself, and the Father beareth witness of me.</I>
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The seal which the Father put to his commission: He <I>beareth 
 witness of me,</I> not only has done so by a voice from heaven, but 
 still does so by the tokens of his presence with me. See who they are 
 to whom God will bear witness. 

 [1.] Those whom he <I>sends</I> and <I>employs;</I> where he gives 
 commissions he give credentials. 

 [2.] Those who <I>bear witness</I> to him; so Christ did. God will own 
 and honour those that own and honour him. 

 [3.] Those who decline <I>bearing witness of themselves;</I> so Christ 
 did. God will take care that those who humble and abase themselves, and 
 seek not their own glory, shall not <I>lose by it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The satisfaction Christ had in this testimony: "<I>I know that the 
 witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</I> I am very well assured 
 that I have a divine mission, and do not in the least hesitate 
 concerning it; thus he had the <I>witness in himself.</I>" The devil 
 tempted him to question his being the Son of God, but he never 
 yielded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. John Baptist witnessed to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>,

 &c. John came to <I>bear witness of the light</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:7"><I>ch.</I> i. 7</A>);

 his business was to prepare his way, and direct people to him:
 <I>Behold the Lamb of God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Now the testimony of John was, 

 [1.] A <I>solemn</I> and public testimony: "You sent an embassy of 
 priests and Levites to John, which gave him an opportunity of 
 publishing what he had to say; it was not a popular, but a judicial 
 testimony." 

 [2.] It was a <I>true</I> testimony: <I>He bore witness to the 
 truth,</I> as a witness ought to do, the <I>whole truth,</I> and 
 <I>nothing but the truth.</I> Christ does not say, <I>He bore witness 
 to me</I> (though every one knew he did), but, like an honest man, 
 <I>He bore witness to the truth.</I> Now John was confessedly such a 
 holy, good man, so mortified to the world, and so conversant with 
 divine things, that it could not be imagined he should be guilty of 
 such a forgery and imposture as to say what he did concerning Christ if 
 it had not been so, and if he had not been sure of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Two things are added concerning John's testimony:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That it was a testimony <I>ex abundanti</I>--<I>more than he needed
 to vouch</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>I receive not testimony from man.</I> Though Christ saw fit to quote 
 John's testimony, it was with a protestation that it shall not be 
 deemed or construed so as to prejudice the prerogative of his 
 self-sufficiency. Christ needs no letters or commendation, no 
 testimonials or certificates, but what his own worth and excellency 
 bring with him; why then did Christ here urge the testimony of John? 
 Why, <I>these things I say, that you may be saved.</I> This he aimed at 
 in all this discourse, to save not his own life, but the souls of 
 others; he produced John's testimony because, being one <I>of 
 themselves,</I> it was to be hoped that they would hearken to it.
 Note, <I>First,</I> Christ desires and designs the salvation even of 
 his enemies and persecutors. <I>Secondly,</I> The word of Christ is the 
 ordinary means of salvation. <I>Thirdly,</I> Christ in his word 
 considers our infirmities and condescends to our capacities, consulting 
 not so much what it befits so great a prince to say as what we can 
 bear, and what will be most likely to do us good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That it was a testimony <I>ad hominem</I>--<I>to the man,</I>
 because John Baptist was one whom <I>they</I> had a respect for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):
 
 <I>He was a light</I> among you.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The character of John Baptist: <I>He was a burning and a 
 shining light.</I> Christ often spoke honourably of John; he was now in 
 prison under a cloud, yet Christ gives him his <I>due praise,</I> which 
 we must be ready to do to all that faithfully serve God. 

 1. He was a <I>light,</I> not <B><I>phos</I></B>--<I>lux, light</I> (so
 Christ was <I>the</I> light), but <B><I>lyknos</I></B>--<I>lucerna, a 
 luminary,</I> a derived subordinate light. His office was to enlighten
 a dark world with notices of the Messiah's approach, to whom he was as 
 the <I>morning star.</I> 

 2. He was a <I>burning</I> light, which denotes <I>sincerity;</I> 
 painted fire may be made to shine, but that which burns is true fire. 
 It denotes also his <I>activity,</I> zeal, and fervency, burning in 
 love to God and the souls of men; fire is always working on itself or 
 something else, so is a good minister. 

 3. He was a <I>shining</I> light, which denotes either his
 <I>exemplary conversation,</I> in which our light should shine

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:16">Matt. v. 16</A>),

 or an <I>eminent</I> diffusive influence. He was illustrious in the 
 sight of others; though he affected obscurity and retirement, and was 
 <I>in the deserts,</I> yet such were his doctrine, his baptism, his 
 life, that he became very <I>remarkable,</I> and attracted the eyes of 
 the nation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The affections of the people to him: <I>you were 
 willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</I> 

 1. It was a <I>transport</I> that they were <I>in,</I> upon the 
 appearing of John: "<I>You were willing</I>--<B> <I>ethelesate</I></B>, 
 <I>you delighted to rejoice in his light;</I> you were very proud that 
 you had such a man among you, who was the honour of your country; you 
 were willing <B><I>agalliasthenai</I></B>--willing to <I>dance,</I> and 
 make a noise about this light, as boys about a bonfire." 

 2. It was but <I>transient,</I> and soon over: "You were fond of him, 
 <B><I>pros horan</I></B>--<I>for an hour,</I> for <I>a season,</I> as 
 little children are fond of a new thing, you were pleased with John 
 awhile, but soon grew weary of him and his ministry, and said that 
 <I>he had a devil,</I> and now you have him in prison." Note, Many, 
 that seem to be affected and pleased with the gospel at first, 
 afterwards despise and reject it; it is common for forward and noisy 
 professors to cool and fall off. These here rejoiced in John's light, 
 but never walked in it, and therefore did not keep to it; they were 
 like the stony ground. While Herod was a friend to John Baptist, the
 people caressed him; but when he fell under Herod's frowns he lost 
 their favours: "<I>You were willing</I> to countenance John, <B><I>pros 
 horan</I></B> that is, for <I>temporal ends</I>" (so some take it); 
 "you were glad of him, in hopes to make a tool of him, by his interest 
 and under the shelter of his name to have shaken off the Roman yoke, 
 and recovered the civil liberty and honour of your country." Now,

 (1.) Christ mentions their respect to John, to <I>condemn</I> them for 
 their present opposition to himself, to whom John bore witness. If they 
 had continued their veneration for John, as they ought to have done, 
 they would have embraced Christ. 

 (2.) He mentions the passing away of their respect, to justify God in 
 depriving them, as he had now done, of John's ministry, and putting 
 that light under a bushel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ's own works witnessed to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>I have a testimony greater than that of John;</I> for <I>if we 
 believe the witness of men</I> sent of God, as John was, the <I>witness 
 of God</I> immediately, and not by the ministry of men, <I>is 
 greater,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:9">1 John v. 9</A>.

 Observe, Though the witness of John was a less <I>cogent</I> and less
 <I>considerable</I> witness, yet our Lord was pleased to make use of 
 it. We must be glad of all the supports that offer themselves for the 
 confirmation of our faith, though they may not amount to a 
 demonstration, and we must not <I>invalidate</I> any, under pretence 
 that there are others more <I>conclusive;</I> we have occasion for them 
 all. Now this greater testimony was that of the <I>works</I> which 
 <I>his Father had given him to finish.</I> That is,

 (1.) In general the whole course of his life and ministry--his 
 revealing God and his will to us, setting up his kingdom among men, 
 reforming the world, destroying Satan's kingdom, restoring fallen man 
 to his primitive purity and felicity, and shedding abroad in men's 
 hearts the love of God and of one another--all that work of which he 
 said when he died, <I>It is finished,</I> it was all, from first to 
 last, <I>opus Deo dignum--a work worthy of God;</I> all he said and did 
 was <I>holy</I> and <I>heavenly,</I> and a divine purity, power, and 
 grace shone in it, proving abundantly that he was <I>sent of God.</I>

 (2.) In particular. The miracles he wrought for the proof of his
 divine mission witnessed of him. Now it is here said, 

 [1.] That these works were <I>given him by the Father,</I> that is, he 
 was both <I>appointed</I> and <I>empowered</I> to work them; for, as 
 Mediator, he <I>derived</I> both commission and strength from his 
 Father. 

 [2.] They were given to him to <I>finish;</I> he must do all those 
 works of wonder which the counsel and foreknowledge of God had before 
 determined to be done; and his finishing them proves a divine power; 
 for as <I>for God his work is perfect.</I> 

 [3.] These works did <I>bear witness of him,</I> did prove that he was 
 sent of God, and that what he said concerning himself was true; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:4,Ac+2:22">Heb. ii. 4; Acts ii. 22</A>.

 That the Father had sent him as <I>a Father,</I> not as a master sends
 his servant on an errand, but as a father sends his son to take 
 possession for himself; if God had not sent him, he would not have 
 <I>seconded</I> him, would not have <I>sealed</I> him, as he did by the 
 works he gave him to do; for the world's Creator will never be its 
 deceiver.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He produces, more fully than before, his Father's testimony 
 concerning him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>The Father that sent me hath borne witness of me.</I> The prince is 
 not accustomed to follow his ambassador himself, to confirm his 
 commission <I>viva voce--by speaking;</I> but God was pleased to bear 
 witness of his Son himself by a voice from heaven at his baptism 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:17">Matt. iii. 17</A>):

 This is my ambassador, <I>This is my beloved Son.</I> The Jews reckoned 
 <I>Bath-kol;--the daughter of a voice,</I> a voice from heaven, one of 
 the ways by which God made known his mind; and in that way he had owned 
 Christ publicly and solemnly, and repeated it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:5">Matt. xvii. 5</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) Those whom God <I>sends</I> he will <I>bear witness</I> of; where
 he gives a commission, he will not fail to seal it; he that never 
 <I>left himself without witness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:17">Acts xiv. 17</A>)

 will never leave any of his servants so, who go upon his errand. 

 (2.) Where God demands belief, he will not fail to give sufficient 
 <I>evidence,</I> as he has done concerning Christ. That which was to
 be witnessed concerning Christ was chiefly this, that the God we had 
 offended was willing to accept of him as a Mediator. Now concerning 
 this he has <I>himself</I> given us full satisfaction (and he was 
 fittest to do it), declaring himself well-pleased in him; if we be so, 
 the work is done. Now, it might be suggested, if God himself thus bore 
 witness of Christ, how came it to pass that he was not universally 
 received by the Jewish nation and their rulers? To this Christ here 
 answers that it was not to be thought strange, nor could their 
 infidelity weaken his credibility, for two reasons:--

 [1.] Because they were not acquainted with such extraordinary 
 revelations of God and his will: <I>You have neither heard his voice at 
 any time, nor seen his shape,</I> or <I>appearance.</I> They showed 
 themselves to be as ignorant of God, though they professed relation to 
 him, as we are of a man we never either saw or heard. "But why do I 
 talk to you of God's bearing witness of me? He is one you know nothing 
 of, nor have any acquaintance or communion with." Note, Ignorance of 
 God is the true reason of men's rejecting the record he has given 
 concerning his Son. A right understanding of <I>natural religion</I> 
 would discover to us such admirable congruities in the <I>Christian</I> 
 religion as would greatly dispose our minds to the entertainment of it.
 Some give this sense of it: "The Father bore witness of me by a 
 <I>voice,</I> and the <I>descent of a dove,</I> which is such an 
 extraordinary thing that you never saw or heard the like; and yet for 
 my sake there was such a voice and appearance; yea, and you might have 
 <I>heard that voice,</I> you might have <I>seen that appearance,</I> as 
 others did, if you had closely attended the ministry of John, but by 
 slighting it you missed of that testimony." 

 [2.] Because they were not affected, no, not with the ordinary ways by 
 which God had revealed himself to them: <I>You have not his word 
 abiding in you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 They had the scriptures of the Old Testament; might they not by them be 
 disposed to receive Christ? Yes, if they had had their due influence 
 upon them. But, <I>First,</I> The word of God was not in them; it was 
 <I>among them,</I> in their country, in their hands, but not <I>in 
 them,</I> in their hearts; not ruling in their souls, but only shining 
 in their eyes and sounding in their ears. What did it avail them that 
 they had the oracles of God <I>committed</I> to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:2">Rom. iii. 2</A>),

 when they had not these oracles <I>commanding</I> in them? If they had, 
 they would readily have embraced Christ. <I>Secondly,</I> It did not 
 <I>abide.</I> Many have the word of God coming into them, and making 
 some impressions for awhile, but it does not <I>abide</I> with them; it 
 is not constantly in them, as a man at home, but only now and then, as 
 a <I>wayfaring man.</I> If the word <I>abide in</I> us, if we converse 
 with it by frequent meditation, consult with it upon every occasion, 
 and conform to it in our conversation, we shall then readily receive 
 the witness of the Father concerning Christ; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17"><I>ch.</I> vii. 17</A>.

 But how did it appear that they <I>had not the word of God abiding in
 them?</I> It appeared by this, <I>Whom he hath sent, him ye believe 
 not.</I> There was so much said in the Old Testament concerning Christ, 
 to direct people when and where to look for him, and so to facilitate 
 the discovery of him, that, if they had duly considered these things, 
 they could not have avoided the conviction of Christ's being sent of 
 God; so that their not believing in Christ was a certain sign that the 
 word of God did not abide in them. Note, The in-dwelling of the word, 
 and Spirit, and grace of God in us, is best tried by its effects, 
 particularly by our <I>receiving what he sends,</I> the commands, the 
 messengers, the providences he sends, especially Christ whom he hath 
 sent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The last witness he calls is the Old Testament, which witnessed of 
 him, and to it he appeals 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>,

 &c.): <I>Search the scriptures,</I> <B><I>ereunate</I></B>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This may be read, either, 

 [1.] "<I>You search the scriptures,</I> and you do well to do so; you 
 read them daily in your synagogues, you have rabbies, and doctors, and 
 scribes, that make it their business to study them, and criticize upon 
 them." The Jews boasted of the flourishing of scripture-learning in the 
 days of Hillel, who died about twelve years after Christ's birth, and 
 reckoned some of those who were then members of the sanhedrim the 
 <I>beauties of their wisdom</I> and the <I>glories of their law;</I> 
 and Christ owns that they did indeed search the scriptures, but it was 
 in search of their <I>own glory: "You search the scriptures,</I> and 
 therefore, if you were not <I>wilfully blind,</I> you would <I>believe 
 in me.</I>" Note, It is possible for men to be very studious in the 
 letter of the scripture, and yet to be strangers to the power and 
 influence of it. Or, 

 [2.] As we read it: <I>Search the scriptures;</I> and so, <I>First,</I> 
 It was spoken to <I>them</I> in the nature of an <I>appeal:</I> "You 
 profess to receive and believe the scripture; here I will <I>join 
 issue</I> with you, let this be the judge, provided you will not 
 <I>rest in the letter" (h&aelig;rere in cortice</I>), "but will 
 <I>search</I> into it." Note, when appeals are made to the scriptures, 
 they must be searched. Search the whole book of scripture 
 <I>throughout,</I> compare one passage with another, and explain one by 
 another. We must likewise search particular passages <I>to the 
 bottom,</I> and see not what they <I>seem</I> to say <I>prima facie--at 
 the first appearance,</I> but what they say <I>indeed. Secondly,</I> It 
 is spoken to <I>us</I> in the nature of an <I>advice,</I> or a command 
 to all Christians to search the scriptures. Note, All those who would
 <I>find Christ</I> must <I>search the scriptures;</I> not only read 
 them, and hear them, but search them, which denotes, 

 1. <I>Diligence</I> in seeking, labour, and study, and close
 application of mind. 

 2. <I>Desire</I> and <I>design</I> of finding. We must aim at some 
 spiritual benefit and advantage in reading and studying the scripture, 
 and often ask, "What am I now searching for?" We must search as for 
 <I>hidden treasures</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:4">Prov. ii. 4</A>),

 as those that <I>sink</I> for gold or silver, or that <I>dive</I> for 
 pearl, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:1-11">Job xxviii. 1-11</A>.
 
 This ennobled the Bereans, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:11">Acts xvii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Now there are two things which we are here directed to have in our
 eye, in our searching the scripture: <I>heaven</I> our end, and 
 <I>Christ</I> our way. 

 [1.] We must search the scriptures for <I>heaven</I> as our <I>great 
 end: For in them you think you have eternal life.</I> The scripture 
 assures us of an eternal state set before us, and offers to us an 
 eternal life in that state: it contains the <I>chart</I> that 
 <I>describes</I> it, the <I>charter</I> that <I>conveys</I> it, the 
 <I>direction</I> in the way that leads to it, and the <I>foundation</I> 
 upon which the hope of it is built; and this is worth searching for 
 where we are sure to find it. But to the Jews Christ saith only, <I>You 
 think</I> you have <I>eternal life</I> in the scriptures, because, 
 though they did retain the belief and hope of eternal life, and 
 grounded their expectations of it upon the scriptures, yet herein they 
 missed it, that they looked for it by the bare reading and studying of 
 the scripture. It was a common but corrupt saying among them, <I>He 
 that has the words of the law has eternal life;</I> they thought they 
 were sure of heaven if they could say by <I>heart,</I> or rather by 
 <I>rote,</I> such and such passages of scripture as they were directed 
 to by the tradition of the elders; as they thought all the 
 <I>vulgar</I> cursed because they did not thus know the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:49"><I>ch.</I> vii. 49</A>),

 so they concluded all the <I>learned</I> undoubtedly <I>blessed.</I>
 
 [2.] We must <I>search the scriptures</I> for <I>Christ,</I> as the new 
 and living <I>way</I> that leads to this <I>end.</I> These are 
 <I>they,</I> the great and principal witnesses, <I>that testify of 
 me.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> The scriptures, even those of the Old 
 Testament, <I>testify</I> of Christ, and by them God <I>bears 
 witness</I> to him. The Spirit of Christ in the prophets testified 
 beforehand of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11">1 Pet. i. 11</A>),

 the purposes and promises of God concerning him, and the previous 
 notices of him. The Jews knew very well that the Old Testament 
 testified of the Messiah, and were critical in their remarks upon the 
 passages that looked that way; and yet were careless, and wretchedly 
 overseen, in the application of them. <I>Secondly, Therefore</I> we
 must <I>search the scriptures,</I> and may hope to find eternal life in 
 that search, because they testify of Christ; for this is <I>life 
 eternal, to know him;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:11">1 John v. 11</A>.

 Christ is the treasure hid in the field of the scriptures, the water in
 those wells, the milk in those breasts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) To this testimony he annexes a reproof of their infidelity and 
 wickedness in four instances; particularly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Their <I>neglect of him</I> and his doctrine: "<I>You will not 
 come tome, that you might have life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 You search the scriptures, you believe the prophets, who you cannot but 
 see testify of me; and yet you will not <I>come to me,</I> to whom they 
 direct you." Their estrangement from Christ was the fault not so much 
 of their <I>understandings</I> as of their <I>wills.</I> This is 
 expressed as a complaint; Christ offered life, and it was not accepted. 
 Note, <I>First,</I> There is <I>life</I> to be had with Jesus Christ 
 for poor souls; we may have life, the life of <I>pardon</I> and 
 <I>grace,</I> and <I>comfort</I> and <I>glory:</I> life is the 
 perfection of our being, and inclusive of all happiness; and Christ is 
 our life. <I>Secondly,</I> Those that would have this life must
 <I>come</I> to Jesus Christ for it; we may have it for the coming for. 
 It <I>supposes</I> an assent of the understanding to the doctrine of 
 Christ and the record given concerning him; it <I>lies in</I> the 
 consent of the will to his government and grace, and it <I>produces</I> 
 an answerable compliance in the affections and actions. <I>Thirdly,</I> 
 The only reason why sinners die is because they <I>will not come</I> to 
 Christ for life and happiness; it is not because they <I>cannot,</I> 
 but because they <I>will not.</I> They will neither <I>accept</I> the 
 life offered, because <I>spiritual</I> and <I>divine,</I> nor will they 
 <I>agree</I> to the terms on which it is offered, nor <I>apply</I> 
 themselves to the use of the appointed means: they will not be cured, 
 for they will not observe the methods of cure. <I>Fourthly,</I> The 
 wilfulness and obstinacy of sinners in rejecting the tenders of grace 
 are a great grief to the Lord Jesus, and what he complains of. Those 
 words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 <I>I receive not honour from men,</I> come in a parenthesis, to obviate 
 an objection against him, as if he sought his own glory, and made 
 himself the head of a party, in obliging all to come to <I>him,</I> and 
 applaud him. Note, 

 1. He did not <I>covet</I> nor <I>court</I> the applause of men, did 
 not in the least affect that worldly pomp and splendour in which the 
 carnal Jews expected their Messiah to appear. He charged those whom he 
 cured not to make him known, and withdrew from those that would have 
 made him king. 

 2. He <I>had not</I> the applause of men. Instead of <I>receiving 
 honour</I> from men, he received a great deal of <I>dishonour</I> and 
 disgrace from men, for he made himself of no reputation. 

 3. He <I>needed</I> not the applause of men; it was no addition to his 
 glory whom all the angels of God worship, nor was he any otherwise 
 pleased with it than as it was according to his Father's will, and for 
 the happiness of those who, in giving honour <I>to him,</I> received 
 much greater honour <I>from him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Their <I>want of the love of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):

 "<I>I know you</I> very well, <I>that you have not the love of God in 
 you.</I> Why should I wonder that you do not come to me, when you want 
 even the first principle of <I>natural religion,</I> which is the 
 <I>love of God?</I>" Note, The reason why people <I>slight Christ</I> 
 is because they do not <I>love God;</I> for, if we did indeed love God, 
 we should love him who is his express image, and hasten to him by whom 
 only we may be restored to the favour of God. He charged them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>)
 
 with <I>ignorance</I> of God, and here with want of love to him; 
 <I>therefore</I> men have not the love of God because they desire not 
 the knowledge of him. Observe, <I>First,</I> The crime charged upon 
 them: <I>You have not the love of God in you.</I> They pretended a 
 great love to God, and thought they proved it by their zeal for the 
 law, the temple, and the sabbath; and yet they were really without the 
 love of God. Note, There are many who make a great profession of 
 religion who yet show they want the love of God by their neglect of 
 Christ and their contempt of his commandments; they hate his holiness 
 and undervalue his goodness. Observe, It is the love of God <I>in</I> 
 us, that love seated <I>in the heart,</I> a living active principle 
 there, that God will <I>accept;</I> the love <I>shed abroad</I> there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:5">Rom. v. 5</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> The proof of this charge, by the personal knowledge of 
 Christ, who <I>searches the heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:23">Rev. ii. 23</A>)

 and knows what is <I>in man: I know you.</I> Christ sees through all
 our disguises, and can say to each of us, <I>I know thee.</I> 

 1. Christ knows men better than <I>their neighbours know them.</I> The 
 people thought that the scribes and Pharisees were very devout and good 
 men, but Christ knew that they had not the love of God in them. 

 2. Christ knows men better than <I>they know themselves.</I> These
 Jews had a very good opinion of themselves, but Christ knew how corrupt 
 their inside was, notwithstanding the speciousness of their outside; we 
 may deceive ourselves, but we cannot deceive him. 

 3. Christ knows men who do not, and will not, know him; he looks 
 <I>on</I> those who industriously look <I>off</I> from him, and calls 
 by their own name, their true name, those who have not known him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Another crime charged upon them is their readiness to entertain 
 false Christs and false prophets, while they obstinately opposed him 
 who was the true Messias 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>I am come in my Father's name, and you receive me not. If another 
 shall come in his own name, him you will receive. Be astonished, O 
 heavens, at this</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:12,13">Jer. ii. 12, 13</A>);

 <I>for my people have committed two evils,</I> great evils indeed.
 <I>First,</I> They have <I>forsaken the fountain of living waters,</I> 
 for they would not receive Christ, who came in his Father's name, had 
 his commission from his Father, and did all for his glory.
 <I>Secondly,</I> They have <I>hewn out broken cisterns,</I> they 
 hearken to every one that will set up in his own name. They forsake 
 their own mercies, which is bad enough; and it is for <I>lying 
 vanities,</I> which is worse. Observe here,

 1. Those are false prophets who come in their own name, who run without 
 being sent, and set up for themselves only. 

 2. It is just with God to suffer those to be deceived with false 
 prophets who receive not the truth in the love of it. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:10,11">2 Thess. ii. 10, 11</A>.
 
 The errors of antichrist are the just punishment of those who obey not
 the doctrine of Christ. They that shut their eyes against the true 
 light are by the judgment of God given up to wander endlessly after 
 <I>false lights,</I> and to be led aside after every <I>ignis 
 fatuus.</I> 

 3. It is the gross folly of many that, while they <I>nauseate</I> 
 ancient truths, they are <I>fond</I> of upstart errors; they loathe 
 manna, and at the same time <I>feed upon ashes.</I> After the Jews had 
 rejected Christ and his gospel, they were continually haunted with 
 spectres, with <I>false Christs</I> and <I>false prophets</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:24">Matt. xxiv. 24</A>),

 and their proneness to follow such occasioned those distractions and 
 seditions that hastened their ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] They are here charged with pride and vain-glory, and unbelief, the 
 effect of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 Having sharply reproved their unbelief, like a wise physician, he here 
 searches into the cause, lays the axe to the root. They 
 <I>therefore</I> slighted and undervalued Christ because they 
 <I>admired</I> and <I>overvalued</I> themselves. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Their ambition of worldly honour. Christ despised it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 They set their hearts upon it: <I>You receive honour one of 
 another;</I> that is, "You look for a Messiah in outward pomp, and 
 promise yourselves worldly honour by him." <I>You receive 
 honour:</I>--

 1. "You desire to receive it, and aim at this in all you do."

 2. "You give honour to others, and applaud them, only that they may
 return it, and may applaud you." <I>Petimus dabimusque vicissim--We ask 
 and we bestow.</I> It is the proud man's art to throw honour upon 
 others only that it may rebound upon himself. 

 3. "You are very careful to keep all the honours to yourselves, and 
 confine them to your own party, as if you had the monopoly of that 
 which is honourable." 

 4. "What respect is shown to you you <I>receive</I> yourselves, and do
 not transmit to God, as Herod." Idolizing men and their sentiments, and 
 affecting to be idolized by them and their applauses, are pieces of 
 idolatry as directly contrary to Christianity as any other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Their neglect of spiritual honour, called here <I>the 
 honour that comes from God only;</I> this they sought not, nor minded. 
 Note, 

 1. True honour is that which <I>comes from God only,</I> that is real 
 and lasting honour; those are honourable indeed whom he takes into 
 covenant and communion with himself. 

 2. <I>This honour have all the saints.</I> All that believe in Christ, 
 through him receive the honour that comes from God. He is not partial, 
 but will give glory wherever he gives grace. 

 3. This honour that comes from God we must <I>seek,</I> must aim at it,
 and act for it, and take up with nothing short of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:29">Rom. ii. 29</A>);

 we must account it <I>our reward,</I> as the Pharisees accounted the 
 praise of men. 

 4. Those that will not come to Christ, and those that are ambitious of 
 worldly honour, make it appear that they seek not the honour that comes 
 from God, and it is their folly and ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> The influence this had upon their infidelity. <I>How 
 can you believe</I> who are thus affected? Observe here, 

 1. The difficulty of believing arises from ourselves and our own 
 corruption; we make our work hard to ourselves, and then complain it is 
 impracticable. 

 2. The ambition and affectation of worldly honour are a great hindrance
 to faith in Christ. How can they believe who make the praise and 
 applause of men their idol? When the profession and practice of serious 
 godliness are unfashionable, are <I>every where spoken 
 against,</I>--when Christ and his followers are men wondered at, and to 
 be a Christian is to be like a <I>speckled bird</I> (and this is the 
 common case),--how can they believe the summit of whose ambition is to 
 <I>make a fair show in the flesh?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The last witness here called is Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>,

 &c. The Jews had a great veneration for Moses, and valued themselves
 upon their being the <I>disciples</I> of Moses, and pretended to adhere 
 to Moses, in their opposition to Christ; but Christ here shows 
 them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That Moses was a witness against the unbelieving Jews, <I>and 
 accused them to the Father: There is one that accuses you, even 
 Moses.</I> This may be understood either, 

 [1.] As showing the difference between the law and the gospel. Moses, 
 that is, the law, <I>accuses you,</I> for by the law is the knowledge 
 of sin; it <I>condemns</I> you, it is to those that trust to it a 
 ministration of death and condemnation. But it is not the design of 
 Christ's gospel to <I>accuse</I> us: <I>Think not that I will accuse 
 you.</I> Christ did not come into the world as a <I>Momus,</I> to find 
 fault and pick quarrels with every body, or as a <I>spy</I> upon the 
 actions of men, or a <I>promoter,</I> to fish for crimes; no, he came 
 to be an advocate, not an accuser; to reconcile God and man, and not to 
 set them more at variance. What fools were they then that adhered to 
 Moses against Christ, and <I>desired to be under the law!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:21">Gal. iv. 21</A>.
 
 Or,

 [2.] As showing the manifest unreasonableness of their infidelity:
 "Think not that I will appeal from your bar to God's and challenge you 
 to answer there for what you do against me, as injured innocency 
 usually does; no, I do not need; you are already accused, and cast, in 
 the court of heaven; Moses himself says enough to convict you of, and 
 condemn you for, your unbelief." Let them not mistake <I>concerning 
 Christ;</I> though he was a prophet, he did not improve his interest in 
 heaven against those that persecuted him, did not, as Elias, <I>make 
 intercession against Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:2">Rom. vi. 2</A>),

 nor as Jeremiah desire to <I>see God's vengeance on them.</I> Nor let 
 them mistake concerning Moses, as if he would stand by them in 
 rejecting Christ; no, <I>There is one that accuses you, even Moses in 
 whom you trust.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> External privileges and 
 advantages are commonly the vain confidence of those who reject Christ 
 and his grace. The Jews <I>trusted</I> in Moses, and thought their 
 having his laws and ordinances would save them. <I>Secondly,</I> Those 
 that confide in their privileges, and do not improve them, will find 
 not only that their confidence is disappointed, but that those very 
 privileges will be witnesses against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That Moses was a witness for Christ and to his doctrine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:46,47"><I>v.</I> 46, 47</A>):

 <I>He wrote of me.</I> Moses did particularly prophesy of Christ, as 
 the Seed of the woman, the Seed of Abraham, the Shiloh, the great 
 Prophet; the ceremonies of the law of Moses were <I>figures of him that 
 was to come.</I> The Jews made Moses the patron of their opposition to 
 Christ; but Christ here shows them their error, that Moses was so far 
 from writing against Christ that he wrote <I>for him,</I> and <I>of 
 him.</I> But, 

 [1.] Christ here charges it on the Jews that they <I>did not believe 
 Moses.</I> He had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>)

 that they <I>trusted</I> in Moses, and yet here he undertakes to make 
 out that they did not believe Moses; they trusted to his name, but they 
 did not receive his doctrine in its true sense and meaning; they did 
 not rightly understand, nor give credit to, what there was in the 
 writings of Moses concerning the Messiah. 

 [2.] He proves this charge from their disbelief of him: <I>Had you 
 believed Moses, you would have believed me.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> The 
 surest trial of faith is by the effects it produces. Many say that they 
 believe whose actions give their words the lie; for had they believed 
 the scriptures they would have done otherwise than they did.
 <I>Secondly,</I> Those who rightly believe one part of scripture will 
 receive every part. The prophecies of the old Testament were so fully 
 accomplished in Christ that those who rejected Christ did in effect 
 deny those prophecies, and set them aside. 

 [3.] From their disbelief of Moses he infers that it was not strange 
 that they rejected him: <I>If you believe not his writings, how shall 
 you believe my words?</I> How can it be thought that you should?
 <I>First,</I> "If you do not believe sacred <I>writings,</I> those 
 oracles which are in black and white, which is the most certain way of 
 conveyance, <I>how shall you believe my words,</I> words being usually 
 less regarded?" <I>Secondly,</I> "If you do not believe Moses, for whom 
 you have such a profound veneration, how is it likely that you should 
 believe me, whom you look upon with so much contempt?" See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:12">Exod. vi. 12</A>.
 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> "If you believe not what Moses spoke and wrote of me,
 which is a strong and cogent testimony for me, how shall you believe me 
 and my mission?" If we admit not the premises, how shall we admit the 
 conclusion? The truth of the Christian religion, it being a matter 
 purely of divine revelation, depends upon the divine authority of the 
 scripture; if therefore we believe not the divine inspiration of those 
 writings, how shall be receive the doctrine of Christ?</P>
