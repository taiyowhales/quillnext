 The evangelist seemed to have concluded his history with the foregoing 
 chapter; but (as St. Paul sometimes in his epistles), new matter 
 occurring, he begins again. He had said that there were many other 
 signs which Jesus did for the proof of his resurrection. And in this 
 chapter he mentions one of these many, which was Christ's appearance to 
 some of his disciples at the sea of Tiberias, in which we have an 
 account, 

 I. How he discovered himself to them as they were fishing, filled their
 net, and then very familiarly came and dined with them upon what they 
 had caught, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:1-14">ver. 1-14</A>.

 II. What discourse he had with Peter after dinner, 

 1. Concerning himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>.
 
 2. Concerning John, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:20-23">ver. 20-23</A>.

 III. The solemn conclusion of this gospel,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:24,25">ver. 24, 25</A>.

 It is strange that any should suppose that this chapter was added by
 some other hand, when it is expressly said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:24">ver. 24</A>)

 that the disciple whom Jesus loved is he which testifieth of these
 things.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  After these things Jesus showed himself again to the
 disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed he
 <I>himself.</I>
 &nbsp; 2  There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus,
 and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the <I>sons</I> of Zebedee, and
 two other of his disciples.
 &nbsp; 3  Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto
 him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a
 ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
 &nbsp; 4  But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore:
 but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
 &nbsp; 5  Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They
 answered him, No.
 &nbsp; 6  And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the
 ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were
 not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
 &nbsp; 7  Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It
 is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he
 girt <I>his</I> fisher's coat <I>unto him,</I> (for he was naked,) and did
 cast himself into the sea.
 &nbsp; 8  And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were
 not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging
 the net with fishes.
 &nbsp; 9  As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of
 coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
 &nbsp; 10  Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now
 caught.
 &nbsp; 11  Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great
 fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so
 many, yet was not the net broken.
 &nbsp; 12  Jesus saith unto them, Come <I>and</I> dine. And none of the
 disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the
 Lord.
 &nbsp; 13  Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and
 fish likewise.
 &nbsp; 14  This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his
 disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.

 We have here an account of Christ's appearance to his disciples at the 
 sea of Tiberias. Now, 

 1. Let us compare this appearance with those that <I>went before,</I>
 In those Christ showed himself to his disciples when they were met in a 
 solemn assembly (it should seem, for religious worship) upon a Lord's 
 day, and when they were all together, perhaps expecting his appearing; 
 but in this he showed himself to some of them occasionally, upon a 
 week-day, when they were fishing, and little thought of it. Christ has
 many ways of making himself known to his people usually in his 
 ordinances, but sometimes by his Spirit he visits them when they are 
 employed in common business, as the <I>shepherds</I> who were 
 <I>keeping their flocks by night</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:8">Luke ii. 8</A>),

 even so <I>here also,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:13">Gen. xvi. 13</A>.

 2. Let us compare it with that which followed at the mountain in 
 Galilee, where Christ had appointed them to meet him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:16">Matt. xxviii. 16</A>.
 
 Thitherward they moved as soon as the days of unleavened bread were
 over, and disposed of themselves as they saw fit, till the time fixed 
 for this interview, or general rendezvous. Now this appearance was
 while they were waiting for that, that they might not be weary of 
 waiting. Christ is often better than his word, but never worse, often 
 anticipates and outdoes the believing expectations of his people, but 
 never disappoints them. As to the particulars of the story, we may 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who they were to whom Christ now showed himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 not to all the twelve, but to seven of them only. Nathanael is 
 mentioned as one of them, whom we have not met with since,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:45-51"><I>ch.</I> i</A>.

 But some think he was the same with Bartholomew, one of the twelve. The
 two not named are supposed to be Philip of Bethsaida and Andrew of
 Capernaum. Observe here,

 1. It is good for the disciples of Christ to be much together; not only
 in solemn religious assemblies, but in common conversation, and about 
 common business. Good Christians should by this means both testify and 
 increase their affection to, and delight in, each other, and edify one 
 another both by discourse and example. 

 2. Christ chose to manifest himself to them when they were together;
 not only to countenance Christian society, but that they might be joint 
 witnesses of the same matter of fact, and so might corroborate one 
 another's testimony. Here were seven together to attest this, on which 
 some observe that the Roman law required seven witnesses to a 
 testament. 

 3. Thomas was one of them, and is named next to Peter, as if he now
 kept closer to the meetings of the apostles than ever. It is well if 
 losses by our neglects make us more careful afterwards not to let 
 opportunities slip.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they were employed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their agreement to go a fishing. They knew not well what to do with 
 themselves. For my part, says Peter, <I>I will go a fishing; We will go 
 with thee</I> then, say they, for we will keep together. Though 
 commonly two of a trade cannot agree, yet they could. Some think they 
 did amiss in returning to their boats and nets, which they had left; 
 but then Christ would not have countenanced them in it with a visit. It 
 was rather commendable in them; for they did it, 

 (1.) To redeem time, and not be idle. They were not yet appointed to
 preach the resurrection of Christ. Their commission was in the drawing, 
 but not perfected. The hour for entering upon action was to come. It is 
 probable that their Master had directed them to say nothing of his 
 resurrection till after his ascension, nay, not till after the pouring 
 out of the Spirit, and then they were to begin at Jerusalem. Now, in 
 the mean time, rather than do nothing, they would go a fishing; not for 
 recreation, but for business. It is an instance of their humility.
 Though they were advanced to be sent of Christ, as he was of the 
 Father, yet they did not take state upon them, but remembered <I>the 
 rock out of which they were hewn.</I> It is an instance likewise of 
 their industry, and bespeaks them good husbands of their time. While 
 they were waiting, they would not be idling. Those who would give an 
 account of their time with joy should contrive to fill up the vacancies 
 of it, to gather up the fragments of it. 

 (2.) That they might help to maintain themselves and not be burdensome 
 to any. While their Master was with them those who ministered to him 
 were kind to them; but now that the <I>bridegroom was taken from 
 them</I> they must <I>fast</I> in those days, and therefore their own 
 hands, as Paul's, must <I>minister to their necessities</I> and for 
 this reason Christ asked them, <I>Have you any meat?</I> This teaches 
 us with quietness <I>to work and eat our own bread.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their disappointment in their fishing. That night they caught 
 nothing, though, it is probable, they <I>toiled all night,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:5">Luke v. 5</A>.

 See the vanity of this world; the hand of the diligent often returns
 empty. Even good men may come short of desired success in their honest 
 undertakings. We may be in the way of our duty, and yet not prosper. 
 Providence so ordered it that all that night they should catch nothing, 
 that the miraculous draught of fishes in the morning might be the more 
 wonderful and the more acceptable. In those disappointments which to us 
 are very grievous God has often designs that are very gracious. Man has 
 indeed <I>a dominion over the fish of the sea,</I> but they are not 
 always at his beck; God only knows the <I>paths of the sea,</I> and 
 commands that which passeth through them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. After what manner Christ made himself known to them. It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>He showed himself.</I> His body, though a true and real body, was 
 raised, as ours will be, a spiritual body, and so was visible only when 
 he himself was pleased to make it so; or, rather, came and removed so 
 quickly that it was here or there in an instant, <I>in a moment, in the 
 twinkling of an eye.</I> Four things are observable in the appearance 
 of Christ to them:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He showed himself to them seasonably 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>When the morning was now come,</I> after a fruitless night's toil, 
 Jesus <I>stood on the shore.</I> Christ's time of making himself known 
 to his people is when they are most at a loss. When they think they 
 have lost themselves, he will let them know that they have not lost 
 him. Weeping may <I>endure for a night; but joy comes,</I> if Christ 
 comes, <I>in the morning.</I> Christ appeared to them, not <I>walking 
 upon the water,</I> because, being <I>risen from the dead,</I> he was 
 not to be with them as he had been; but <I>standing upon the shore,</I> 
 because now they were to make towards him. Some of the ancients put 
 this significancy upon it, that Christ, having finished his work, was 
 got through a stormy sea, a sea of blood, to a safe and quiet shore, 
 where he stood in triumph; but the disciples, having their work before 
 them, were yet at sea, in toil and peril. It is a comfort to us, when 
 our passage is rough and stormy, that our Master is at shore, and we 
 are hastening to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He showed himself to them gradually. The disciples, though they had 
 been intimately acquainted with him, <I>knew not,</I> all at once, 
 <I>that it was Jesus.</I> Little expecting to see him there, and not 
 looking intently upon him, they took him for some common person waiting 
 the arrival of their boat, to buy their fish. Note, Christ is often 
 nearer to us than we think he is, and so we shall find afterwards, to 
 our comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He showed himself to them by an instance of his pity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He called to them, <I>Children,</I> <B><I>paidia</I></B>--"<I>Lads, 
 have you any meat?</I> Have you caught any fish?" Here,

 (1.) The compellation is very familiar; he speaks unto them as unto his 
 sons, with the care and tenderness of a father: <I>Children.</I> Though 
 he had now entered upon his exalted state, he spoke to his disciples 
 with as much kindness and affection as ever. They were not children in 
 age, but they were his children, the children which God had given him. 
 
 (2.) The question is very kind: <I>Have you any meat?</I> He asks as a 
 tender father concerning his children whether they be provided with 
 that which is fit for them, that if they be not, he may take care for 
 their supply. Note, <I>The Lord is for the body,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:13">1 Cor. vi. 13</A>.

 Christ takes cognizance of the temporal wants of his people, and has
 promised them not only grace sufficient, but food convenient. <I>Verily 
 they shall be fed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:3">Ps. xxvii. 3</A>.

 Christ looks into the cottages of the poor, and asks, <I>Children, have
 you any meat?</I> thereby inviting them to open their case before him, 
 and by the prayer of faith to <I>make their requests known</I> to him: 
 and then let them <I>be careful for nothing;</I> for Christ takes care 
 of them, takes care for them. Christ has herein set us an example of 
 compassionate concern for our brethren. There are many poor 
 householders disabled for labour, or disappointed in it, that are 
 reduced to straits, whom the rich should enquire after thus, <I>Have 
 you any meat?</I> For the most necessitous are commonly the least 
 clamorous. To this question the disciples gave a short answer, and, 
 some think, with an air of discontent and peevishness. They said, 
 <I>No;</I> not giving him any such friendly and respectful title as he 
 had given them. So short do the best come in their returns of love to 
 the Lord Jesus. Christ put the question to them, not because he did not 
 know their wants, but because he would know them <I>from them.</I> 
 Those that would have supplies from Christ must own themselves empty 
 and needy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He showed himself to them by an instance of his power; and this 
 perfected the discovery 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 he ordered them to <I>cast the net on the right side of the ship,</I> 
 the contrary side to what they had been casting it on; and then they, 
 who were going home empty-handed, were enriched with a great draught of 
 fishes. Here we have, 

 (1.) The orders Christ gave them, and the promise annexed to those 
 orders: <I>Cast the net</I> there in such a place, and <I>you shall 
 find.</I> He from whom nothing is hid, no, not the <I>inhabitants under 
 the waters</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:5">Job xxvi. 5</A>),

 knew on what side of the ship the shoal of fishes was, and to that side 
 he directs them. Note, Divine providence extends itself to things most
 minute and contingent; and they are happy that know how to take hints 
 thence in the conduct of their affairs, and acknowledge it in all their 
 ways.

 (2.) Their obedience of these orders, and the good success of it. As 
 yet <I>they knew not that it was Jesus;</I> however, they were willing 
 to be advised by any body, and did not bid this supposed stranger mind 
 his own business and not meddle with theirs, but took his counsel; in 
 being thus observant of strangers, they were obedient to their Master 
 unawares. And it sped wonderfully well; now they had a draught that 
 paid them for all their pains. Note, Those that are humble, diligent, 
 and patient (though their labours may be crossed) shall be crowned; 
 they sometimes live to see their affairs take a happy turn, after many 
 struggles and fruitless attempts. There is nothing lost by observing 
 Christ's orders. Those are likely to speed well that follow the rule of 
 the word, the guidances of the Spirit, and the intimations of 
 Providence; for this is <I>casting the net on the right side of the 
 ship.</I> Now the draught of fishes may be considered, 

 [1.] As a miracle in itself: and so it was designed to prove that Jesus 
 Christ was <I>raised in power,</I> though <I>sown in weakness,</I> and 
 that all things were <I>put under his feet, the fishes of the sea</I> 
 not excepted. Christ manifests himself to his people by doing that for 
 them which none else can do, and things which <I>they looked not 
 for.</I> 

 [2.] As a mercy to them; for the seasonable and abundant supply of 
 their necessities. When their ingenuity and industry failed them, the 
 power of Christ came in opportunely for their relief; for he would take 
 care that those who had left all for him should not want any good 
 thing. When we are most at a loss, <I>Jehovah--jireh.</I> 

 [3.] As the memorial of a former mercy, with which Christ had formerly 
 recompensed Peter for the loan of his boat,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:4">Luke v. 4</A>,

 &c. This miracle nearly resembled that, and could not but put Peter in
 mind of it, which helped him to improve this; for both that and this 
 affected him much, as meeting him in his own element, in his own 
 employment. Latter favours are designed to bring to mind former 
 favours, that eaten bread may not be forgotten. 

 [4.] As a mystery, and very significant of that work to which Christ 
 was now with an enlarged commission sending them forth. The prophets 
 had been fishing for souls, and caught nothing, or very little; but the 
 apostles, who let down the net at Christ's word, had wonderful success. 
 <I>Many were the children of the desolate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:27">Gal. iv. 27</A>.

 They themselves, in pursuance of their former mission, when they were
 first made <I>fishers of men,</I> had had small success in comparison 
 with what they should now have. When, soon after this, three thousand 
 were converted in one day, then the net was <I>cast on the right side 
 of the ship.</I> It is an encouragement to Christ's ministers to 
 continue their diligence in their work. One happy draught, at length, 
 may be sufficient to repay many years of toil at the gospel net.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How the disciples received this discovery which Christ made of 
 himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>,
 
 where we find,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That John was the most intelligent and quick-sighted disciple. He 
 whom Jesus loved was the first that said, <I>It is the Lord;</I> for 
 those whom Christ loves he will in a special manner manifest himself 
 to: his secret is with his favourites. John had adhered more closely to 
 his Master in his sufferings than any of them: and therefore he has a 
 clearer eye and a more discerning judgment than any of them, in 
 recompence for his constancy. When John was himself aware that it was 
 the Lord, he communicated his knowledge to those with him; for this 
 <I>dispensation of the Spirit is given to every one to profit 
 withal.</I> Those that know Christ themselves should endeavor to bring 
 others acquainted with him; we need not engross him, there is enough in 
 him for us all. John tells Peter particularly his thoughts, that it was 
 the Lord, knowing he would be glad to see him above any of them. Though 
 Peter had denied his Master, yet, having repented, and being taken into 
 the communion of the disciples again, they were as free and familiar 
 with him as ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That Peter was the most zealous and warm-hearted disciple; for as 
 soon as he heard it was the Lord (for which he took John's word) the 
 ship could not hold him, nor could he stay till the bringing of it to 
 shore, but into the sea he throws himself presently, that he might come 
 first to Christ. 

 (1.) He showed his respect to Christ by <I>girding his fisher's 
 coat</I> about him that he might appear before his Master in the best 
 clothes he had, and to rudely rush into his presence, stripped as he 
 was to his waistcoat and drawers, because the work he was about was 
 toilsome, and he was resolved to take pains in it. Perhaps the fisher's 
 coat was made of leather, or oil-cloth, and would keep out wet; and he 
 girt it to him that he might make the best of his way through the water 
 to Christ, as he used to do after his nets, when he was intent upon his 
 fishing. 

 (2.) He showed the strength of his affection to Christ, and his earnest 
 desire to be with him, by casting himself into the sea; and either 
 wading or swimming to shore, to come to him. When he walked upon the 
 water to Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:28">Matt. xiv. 28, 29</A>),

 it was said, <I>He came down out of the ship</I> deliberately; but here 
 it is said, <I>He cast himself into the sea</I> with precipitation; 
 sink or swim, he would show his good-will and aim to be with Jesus. "If 
 Christ suffer me," thinks he, "to drown, and come short of him, it is 
 but what I deserve for denying him." Peter had had much forgiven, and 
 made it appear he loved much by his willingness to run hazards, and 
 undergo hardships, to come to him. Those that have been with Jesus
 will be willing to swim through a stormy sea, a sea of blood, to come 
 to him. And it is a laudable contention amongst Christ's disciples to
 strive who shall be first with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That the rest of the disciples were careful and honest hearted. 
 Though they were not in such a transport of zeal as to throw themselves 
 into the sea, like Peter, yet they hastened in the boat to the shore, 
 and made the best of their way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>The other disciples,</I> and John with them, who had first 
 discovered that it was Christ, came slowly, yet they came to Christ. 
 Now here we may observe, 

 (1.) How variously God dispenses his gifts. Some excel, as Peter and
 John; are very eminent in gifts and graces, and are thereby 
 distinguished from their brethren; others are but ordinary disciples, 
 that mind their duty, and are faithful to him, but do nothing to make 
 themselves remarkable; and yet both the one and the other, the eminent 
 and the obscure, shall sit down together with Christ in glory; nay, and 
 perhaps <I>the last shall be first.</I> Of those that do excel, some, 
 like John, are eminently contemplative, have great gifts of knowledge, 
 and serve the church with them; others, like Peter, are eminently 
 active and courageous, are strong, and do exploits, and are thus very 
 serviceable to their generation. Some are useful as the church's eyes, 
 others as the church's hands, and all for the good of the body. 

 (2.) What a great deal of difference there may be between some good 
 people and others in the way of their honouring Christ, and yet both 
 <I>accepted of him.</I> Some serve Christ more in acts of devotion, and 
 extraordinary expressions of a religious zeal; and they do well, <I>to 
 the Lord they do it.</I> Peter ought not to be censured for casting 
 himself into the sea, but commended for his zeal and the strength of 
 his affection; and so must those be who, in love to Christ, quit the 
 world, with Mary, to <I>sit at his feet.</I> But others serve Christ 
 more in the affairs of the world. They continue in that ship, drag the 
 net, and bring the fish to shore, as the other disciples here; and such 
 ought not to be censured as worldly, for they, in their place, are as 
 truly serving Christ as the other, even in serving tables. If all the 
 disciples had done as Peter did, what had become of their fish and 
 their nets? And yet if Peter had done as they did we had wanted this 
 instance of holy zeal. Christ was well pleased with both, and so must 
 we be. 

 (3.) That there are several ways of bringing Christ's disciples to 
 shore to him from off the sea of this world. Some are brought to him by 
 a violent death, as the martyrs, who threw themselves into the sea, in 
 their zeal for Christ; others are brought to him by a natural death, 
 dragging the net, which is less terrible; but both meet at length on 
 the safe and quiet shore with Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. What entertainment the Lord Jesus gave them when they came 
 ashore.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He had provision ready for them. When they came to land, wet and 
 cold, weary and hungry, they found a good fire there to warm them and 
 dry them, and fish and bread, competent provision for a good meal. 

 (1.) We need not be curious in enquiring whence this fire, and fish, 
 and bread, came, any more than whence the meat came which the ravens 
 brought to Elijah. He that could multiply the loaves and fishes that 
 were could make new ones if he pleased, or turn stones into bread, or 
 send his angels to fetch it, where he knew it was to be had. It is 
 uncertain whether this provision was made ready in the open air, or in 
 some fisher's cabin or hut upon the shore; but here was nothing stately 
 or delicate. We should be content with mean things, for Christ was.
 
 (2.) We may be comforted in this instance of Christ's care of his 
 disciples; he has wherewith to supply all our wants, and <I>knows what 
 things we have need of.</I> He kindly provided for those fishermen, 
 when they came weary from their work; for <I>verily those shall be fed 
 who trust in the Lord and do good.</I> It is encouraging to Christ's 
 ministers, whom he hath made fishers of men, that they may depend upon 
 him who employs them to provide for them; and if they should miss of 
 encouragement in this world, should be reduced as Paul was to 
 <I>hunger, and thirst,</I> and <I>fastings often,</I> let them content 
 themselves with what they have here; they have better things in 
 reserve, and shall <I>eat and drink with Christ at his table in his 
 kingdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:30">Luke xxii. 30</A>.

 Awhile ago, <I>the disciples</I> had entertained Christ with a 
 <I>broiled fish</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:42">Luke xxiv. 42</A>),

 and now, as a friend, he returned their kindness, and entertained them 
 with one; nay, in the draught of fishes, he repaid them more than a 
 hundred fold.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He called for some of that which they had caught, and they produced 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The command Christ gave them to bring their draught of fish to 
 shore: "Bring of the fish hither, which you have now caught, and let us 
 have some of them;" not as if he needed it; and could not make up a 
 dinner for them without it; but, 

 [1.] He would have them eat the labour of their hands,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:2">Ps. cxxviii. 2</A>.

 What is got by God's blessing on our own industry and honest labour, if 
 withal <I>God give us power to eat of it, and enjoy good in our 
 labour,</I> hath a peculiar sweetness in it. It is said of the
 slothful man that <I>he roasteth not that which he took in hunting;</I> 
 he cannot find in his heart to dress what he has been at the pains to 
 take,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+12:27">Prov. xii. 27</A>.

 But Christ would hereby teach us to use what we have. 

 [2.] He would have them taste the gifts of his miraculous bounty, that 
 they might be witnesses both of his power and of his goodness. The 
 benefits Christ bestows upon us are not to be buried and laid up, but 
 to be used and laid out. 

 [3.] He would give a specimen of the spiritual entertainment he has for 
 all believers, which, in this respect, is most free and familiar--that 
 <I>he sups with them, and they with him;</I> their graces are pleasing 
 to him, and his comforts are so to them; what he works in them he 
 accepts from them.

 [4.] Ministers, who are fishers of men, must bring all they catch to 
 their Master, for on him their success depends.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their obedience to this command, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 It was said
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 <I>They were not able to draw the net to shore, for the multitude of 
 fishes;</I> that is, they found it difficult, it was more than they 
 could well do; but he that bade them bring it to shore made it easy. 
 Thus the fishers of men, when they have enclosed souls in the gospel 
 net, cannot bring them to shore, cannot carry on and complete the good 
 work begun, without the continued influence of the divine grace. If he 
 that helped us to catch them, when without his help we should have 
 caught nothing, do not help us to keep them, and draw them to land, by 
 <I>building them up in their most holy faith,</I> we shall lose them at 
 last, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:7">1 Cor. iii. 7</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 [1.] Who it was that was most active in landing the fishes: it was 
 Peter, who, as in the former instance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 had shown a more zealous affection to his Master's person than any of
 them, so in this he showed a more ready obedience to his Master's 
 command; but all that are faithful are not alike forward. 

 [2.] The number of the fishes that were caught. They had the curiosity 
 to count them, and perhaps it was in order to the making of a dividend; 
 they were in all <I>a hundred and fifty three,</I> and all <I>great 
 fishes.</I> These were many more than they needed for their present 
 supply, but they might sell them, and the money would serve to bear 
 their charges back to Jerusalem, whither they were shortly to return.
 
 [3.] A further instance of Christ's care of them, to increase both the 
 miracle and the mercy: <I>For all there were so many,</I> and <I>great 
 fishes</I> too, <I>yet was not the net broken;</I> so that they lost 
 none of their fish, nor damaged their net. It was said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:6">Luke v. 6</A>),
 
 <I>Their net broke.</I> Perhaps this was a borrowed net, for they had 
 long since left their own; and, if so, Christ would teach us to take 
 care of what we have borrowed, as much as if it were our own. It was 
 well that their net did not break, for they had not now the leisure 
 they had formerly had to mend their nets. The net of the gospel has
 enclosed multitudes, three thousand in one day, and yet is not broken; 
 it is still as mighty as ever to bring souls to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He invited them to dinner. Observing them to keep their distance and 
 that <I>they were afraid to ask him, Who art thou?</I> because they 
 <I>knew it was their Lord,</I> he called to them very familiarly, 
 <I>Come, and dine.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) See here how free Christ was with his disciples; he treated them 
 as friends; he did not say, Come, and wait, Come, and attend me, but 
 <I>Come, and dine;</I> not, Go dine by yourselves, as servants are 
 appointed to do, but <I>Come, and dine</I> with me. This kind 
 invitation may be alluded to, to illustrate, 

 [1.] The call Christ gives his disciples into communion with him in 
 grace here. <I>All things are now ready; Come, and dine.</I> Christ is 
 a feast; come, dine upon him; his flesh is meat indeed, his blood drink 
 indeed. Christ is a friend; come, dine with him, he will bid you 
 welcome, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:1">Cant. v. 1</A>.

 [2.] The call he will give into the fruition of him in glory hereafter:
 <I>Come, ye blessed of my Father; come, and sit down with Abraham, and 
 Isaac, and Jacob.</I> Christ has wherewithal to dine all his friends 
 and followers; there is room and provision enough for them all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) See how reverent the disciples were before Christ. They were 
 somewhat shy of using the freedom he invited them to, and, by his 
 courting them to their meat, it should seem that they stood pausing. 
 Being <I>to eat with a ruler,</I> such a ruler, <I>they consider 
 diligently what is before them. None of them durst ask him, Who art 
 thou?</I> Either, 

 [1.] Because they would not be so bold with him. Though perhaps he
 appeared now in something of a disguise at first, as to the two 
 disciples when <I>their eyes were holden that they should not know 
 him,</I> yet they had very good reason to think it was he, and could be 
 no other. Or, 

 [2.] Because they would not so far betray their own folly. When he had 
 given them this instance of his power and goodness, they must be stupid 
 indeed if they questioned whether it was he or no. When God, in his
 providence, has given us sensible proofs of his care for our bodies, 
 and has given us, in his grace, manifest proofs of his good-will to our 
 souls, and good work upon them, we should be ashamed of our distrusts, 
 and not dare to question that which he has left us no room to question. 
 Groundless doubts must be stifled, and not started.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He carved for them, as the master of the feast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Observing them to be still shy and timorous, <I>he comes, and takes 
 bread himself,</I> and <I>gives them,</I> some to each of them, <I>and 
 fish likewise.</I> No doubt he craved a blessing and gave thanks (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:30">Luke xxiv. 30</A>),

 but, it being his known and constant practice, it did not need to be 
 mentioned. 

 (1.) The entertainment here was but ordinary; it was only a 
 fish-dinner, and coarsely dressed; here was nothing pompous, nothing 
 curious; plentiful indeed, but plain and homely. Hunger is the best 
 sauce. Christ, though he entered upon his exalted state, <I>showed 
 himself alive by eating,</I> not showed himself a prince by feasting.
 Those that could not content themselves with bread and fish, unless 
 they had sauce and wine, would scarcely have found in their hearts to 
 dine with Christ himself here. 

 (2.) Christ himself began. Though, perhaps, having a glorified body, he 
 needed not eat, yet he would show that he had a true body, which was 
 capable of eating. The apostles produced this as one proof of his 
 resurrection, that <I>they had eaten and drank with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:41">Acts x. 41</A>.

 (3.) He gave the meat about to all his guests. He not only provided it
 for them, and invited them to it, but he himself divided it among them, 
 and put it into their hands. Thus to him we owe the application, as 
 well as the purchase, of the benefits of redemption. He gives us power 
 to eat of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The evangelist leaves them at dinner, and makes this remark 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 <I>This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself alive to his 
 disciples,</I> or the greater part of them. <I>This is the third 
 day;</I> so some. On the day he rose he appeared five times; the second 
 day was that day seven-night; and this was the third. Or this was his 
 third appearance to any considerable number of his disciples together; 
 though he had appeared to Mary, to the women, to the two disciples, and 
 to Cephas, yet he had but twice before this appeared to any company of 
 them together. This is taken notice of, 

 [1.] For confirming the truth of his resurrection; the vision was 
 doubled, was trebled, for the thing was certain. Those who believed not 
 the first sign would be brought to believe the voice of the latter 
 signs. 

 [2.] As an instance of Christ's continued kindness to his disciples; 
 once, and again, and a third time, he visited them. It is good to keep 
 account of Christ's gracious visits; for he keeps account of them, and 
 they will be remembered against us if we walk unworthily of them, as 
 they were against Solomon, when he was reminded that the Lord God of 
 Israel had appeared unto him twice. <I>This is now the third;</I> have 
 we made a due improvement of <I>the first and second?</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:14">2 Cor. xii. 14</A>.
 
 <I>This is the third,</I> perhaps it may be the last.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon,
 <I>son</I> of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto
 him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him,
 Feed my lambs.
 &nbsp; 16  He saith to him again the second time, Simon, <I>son</I> of
 Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest
 that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
 &nbsp; 17  He saith unto him the third time, Simon, <I>son</I> of Jonas,
 lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the
 third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou
 knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith
 unto him, Feed my sheep.
 &nbsp; 18  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
 girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when
 thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and
 another shall gird thee, and carry <I>thee</I> whither thou wouldest
 not.
 &nbsp; 19  This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify
 God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's discourse with Peter after dinner, so much of it 
 as relates to himself, in which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He examines his love to him, and gives him a charge concerning his 
 flock, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When Christ entered into this discourse with Peter.--It was after 
 they had dined: they had all eaten, and were filled, and, it is 
 probable, were entertained with such edifying discourse as our Lord 
 Jesus used to make his table-talk. Christ foresaw that what he had to 
 say to Peter would give him some uneasiness, and therefore would not 
 say it till they had dined, because he would not spoil his dinner. 
 Peter was conscious to himself that he had incurred his Master's 
 displeasure, and could expect no other than to be upbraided with his 
 treachery and ingratitude. "Was this thy kindness to thy friend? Did 
 not I tell thee what a coward thou wouldest prove?" Nay, he might 
 justly expect to be struck out of the roll of the disciples, and to be 
 expelled the sacred college. Twice, if not thrice, he had seen his 
 Master since his resurrection, and he said not a word to him of it. We 
 may suppose Peter full of doubts upon what terms he stood with his 
 Master; sometimes hoping the best, because he had received favour from 
 him in common with the rest; yet not without some fears, lest the 
 chiding would come at last that would pay for all. But now, at length, 
 his Master put him out of his pain, said what he had to say to him, and 
 confirmed him in his place as an apostle. He did not tell him of his 
 fault hastily, but deferred it for some time; did not tell him of it 
 unseasonably, to disturb the company at dinner, but <I>when they had 
 dined</I> together, in token of reconciliation, then discoursed he with 
 him about it, not as with a criminal, but as with a friend. Peter had 
 reproached himself for it, and therefore Christ did not reproach him 
 for it, nor tell him of it directly, but only by a tacit intimation; 
 and, being satisfied in his sincerity, the offence was not only 
 forgiven, but forgotten; and Christ let him know that he was as dear to 
 him as ever. Herein he has given us an encouraging instance of his 
 tenderness towards penitents, and has taught us, in like manner, to 
 restore such as are fallen with a spirit of meekness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What was the discourse itself. Here was the same question three 
 times asked, the same answer three times returned, and the same reply 
 three times given, with very little variation, and yet no <I>vain 
 repetition.</I> The same thing was repeated by our Saviour, in speaking 
 it, the more to affect Peter, and the other disciples that were 
 present; it is repeated by the evangelist, in writing it, the more to 
 affect us, and all that read it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Three times Christ asks Peter whether he loves him or no. The 
 first time the question is, <I>Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more 
 than these?</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] How he calls him: <I>Simon, son of Jonas.</I> He speaks to him by
 name, the more to affect him, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:31">Luke xxii. 31</A>.

 <I>Simon, Simon.</I> He does not call him <I>Cephas,</I> nor 
 <I>Peter,</I> the name he had given him (for he had lost the credit of 
 his strength and stability, which those names signified), but his 
 original name, <I>Simon.</I> Yet he gives him no hard language, does 
 not call him out of his name, though he deserved it; but as he had
 called him when he pronounced him blessed, <I>Simon Bar-jona,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:17">Matt. xvi. 17</A>.

 He calls him <I>son of Jonas</I> (or <I>John</I> or <I>Johanan</I>), to 
 remind him of his extraction, how mean it was, and unworthy the honour 
 to which he was advanced.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] How he catechises him: <I>Lovest thou me more than these?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Lovest thou me? If we would try whether we are Christ's
 disciples indeed, this must be the enquiry, Do we love him? But there 
 was a special reason why Christ put in now to Peter. 

 1. His fall had given occasion to doubt of his love: "Peter, I have
 cause to suspect thy love; for if thou hadst loved me thou wouldst not 
 have been ashamed and afraid to own me in my sufferings. How canst thou 
 say thou lovest me, when thy heart was not with me?" Note, We must not 
 reckon it an affront to have our sincerity questioned, when we 
 ourselves have done that which makes it questionable; after a shaking 
 fall, we must take heed of settling too soon, lest we settle upon a 
 wrong bottom. The question is affecting; he does not ask, "Dost thou 
 fear me? Dost thou honour me? Dost thou admire me?" but, "Dost thou 
 love me? Give but proof of this, and the affront shall be passed by, 
 and no more said of it." Peter had professed himself a penitent, 
 witness his tears, and his return to the society of the disciples; he 
 was now upon his probation as a penitent; but the question is not, 
 "Simon, how much hast thou wept? how often hast thou fasted, and 
 afflicted thy soul?" but, Dost thou love me? It is this that will make 
 the other expressions of repentance acceptable. The great thing Christ 
 eyes in penitents is their eyeing him in their repentance. <I>Much is 
 forgiven her,</I> not because <I>she wept much,</I> but because <I>she 
 loved much.</I> 

 2. His function would give occasion for the exercise of his
 <I>love.</I> Before Christ would commit his <I>sheep</I> to his care, 
 he asked him, <I>Lovest thou me?</I> Christ has such a tender regard to 
 his flock that he will not trust it with any but those that love him, 
 and therefore will love all that are his for his sake. Those that do 
 not truly love Christ will never truly love the souls of men, or will 
 naturally care for their state as they should; nor will that minister 
 love his work that does not love his Master. Nothing but the love of 
 Christ will constrain ministers to go cheerfully through the 
 difficulties and discouragements they meet with in their work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:13,14">2 Cor. v. 13, 14</A>.

 But this love will make their work easy, and them in good earnest in
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly, Lovest thou me more than these?</I> <B><I>pleion 
 touton</I></B>. 

 1. "<I>Lovest thou me more than thou lovest these,</I> more than thou
 lovest these persons?" Dost thou love me more than thou dost James or 
 John, thy intimate friends, or Andrew, thy own brother and companion: 
 Those do not love Christ aright that do not love him better than the 
 best friend they have in the world, and make it to appear whenever they 
 stand in comparison or in competition. Or, "<I>more than thou lovest 
 these things,</I> these boats and nets--more than all the pleasure of 
 fishing, which some make a recreation of--more than the gain of 
 fishing, which others make a calling of." Those only love Christ indeed 
 that love him better than all the delights of sense and all the profits 
 of this world. "<I>Lovest thou me more than thou lovest these</I> 
 occupations thou art now employed in? If so, leave them, to employ 
 thyself wholly in feeding my flock." So Dr. Whitby. 

 2. "<I>Lovest thou me more than these love me,</I> more than any of
 the rest of the disciples love me?" And then the question is intended 
 to upbraid him with his vain-glorious boast, <I>Though all men should 
 deny thee, yet will not I.</I> "Art thou still of the same mind?" Or, 
 to intimate to him that he had now more reason to love him than any of 
 them had, for more had been forgiven to him than to any of them, as 
 much as his sin in denying Christ was greater than theirs in forsaking 
 him. <I>Tell me therefore which of them will love him most?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:42">Luke vii. 42</A>.

 Note, We should all study to excel in our love to Christ. It is no
 breach of the peace to strive which shall love Christ best; nor any 
 breach of good manners to go before others in this love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly, The second and third time</I> that Christ put this 
 question, 

 1. He left out the comparison <I>more than these,</I> because Peter, in
 his answer, modestly left it out, not willing to compare himself with 
 his brethren, much less to prefer himself before them. Though we
 cannot say, <I>We</I> love Christ more than others do, yet we shall be 
 accepted if we can say, We love him indeed. 

 2. In the last he altered the word, as it is in the original. In the
 first two enquiries, the original word is <B><I>Agapas 
 me</I></B>--<I>Dost thou retain a kindness for me?</I> In answer to 
 which Peter uses another word, more emphatic, <B><I>Philo 
 se</I></B>--<I>I love thee dearly.</I> In putting the question the last 
 time, Christ uses that word: And dost thou indeed love me dearly?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Three times Peter returns the same answer to Christ: <I>Yea, Lord, 
 thou knowest that I love thee.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] Peter does not pretend to love Christ more than the rest of the 
 disciples did. He is now ashamed of that rash word of his, <I>Though 
 all men deny thee, yet will not I;</I> and he had reason to be ashamed 
 of it. Note, Though we must aim to be better than others, yet we must, 
 <I>in lowliness of mind, esteem others better than ourselves;</I> for 
 we know more evil of ourselves than we do of any of our brethren. 

 [2.] Yet he professes again and again that he loves Christ: "<I>Yea, 
 Lord,</I> surely <I>I love thee;</I> I were unworthy to live if I did 
 not." He had a high esteem and value for him, a grateful sense of his 
 kindness, and was entirely devoted to his honour and interest; his 
 desire was towards him, as one he was undone without; and his delight 
 in him, as one he should be unspeakably happy in. This amounts to a 
 profession of repentance for his sin, for it grieves us to have 
 affronted one we love; and to a promise of adherence to him for the 
 future <I>Lord, I love thee,</I> and <I>will never leave thee.</I> 
 Christ <I>prayed that his faith might not fail</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:32">Luke xxii. 32</A>),

 and, because his faith did not fail, his love did not; for faith will 
 work by love. Peter had forfeited his claim of relation to Christ. He 
 was now to be re-admitted, upon his repentance. Christ puts his trial 
 upon this issue: <I>Dost thou love me?</I> And Peter joins issue upon 
 it: <I>Lord, I love thee.</I> Note, Those who can truly say, through 
 grace, that they love Jesus Christ, may take the comfort of their 
 interest in him, notwithstanding their daily infirmities. 

 [3.] He appeals to Christ himself for the proof of it: <I>Thou knowest 
 that I love thee;</I> and <I>the third time</I> yet more emphatically: 
 <I>Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee.</I> He does 
 not vouch his fellow-disciples to witness for him--they might be 
 deceived in him; nor does he think his own word might be taken--the 
 credit of that was destroyed already; but he calls Christ himself to 
 witness, <I>First,</I> Peter was sure that Christ knew all things, and 
 particularly that he knew the heart, and was a <I>discerner of the 
 thoughts and intents of it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:30"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 30</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Peter was satisfied of this, that Christ, who knew all
 things, knew the sincerity of his love to him, and would be ready to 
 attest it in his favour. It is a terror to a hypocrite to think that 
 Christ knows all things; for the divine omniscience will be a witness 
 against him. But it is a comfort to a sincere Christian that he has 
 that to appeal to: <I>My witness is in heaven, my record is on 
 high.</I> Christ knows us better than we know ourselves. Though we know 
 not our own uprightness, he knows it.

 [4.] <I>He was grieved</I> when Christ asked him the <I>third time, 
 Lovest thou me?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 <I>First,</I> Because it put him in mind of his threefold denial of 
 Christ, and was plainly designed to do so; <I>and when he thought 
 thereon he wept.</I> Every remembrance of past sins, even pardoned 
 sins, renews the sorrow of a true penitent. <I>Thou shalt be ashamed,
 when I am pacified towards thee. Secondly,</I> Because it put him in
 fear lest his Master foresaw some further miscarriage of his, which 
 would be as great a contradiction to this profession of love to him as 
 the former was. "Surely," thinks Peter, "my Master would not thus put 
 me upon the rack if he did not see some cause for it. What would become 
 of me if I should be again tempted?" Godly sorrow works carefulness and 
 fear,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Three times Christ committed the care of his flock to Peter: 
 <I>Feed my lambs; feed my sheep; feed my sheep.</I> 

 [1.] Those whom Christ committed to Peter's care were his lambs and his 
 sheep. The church of Christ is his flock, <I>which he hath purchased 
 with his own blood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28">Acts xx. 28</A>),

 and he is <I>the chief shepherd</I> of it. In this flock some are 
 lambs, young and tender and weak, others are sheep, grown to some 
 strength and maturity. The Shepherd here takes care of both, and of the 
 lambs first, for upon all occasions he showed a particular tenderness 
 for them. <I>He gathers the lambs in his arms, and carries them in his 
 bosom.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11">Isa. xl. 11</A>.

 [2.] The charge he gives him concerning them is to feed them. The word 
 used in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:15,17"><I>v.</I> 15, 17</A>,

 is <B><I>boske</I></B>, which strictly signifies to <I>give them
 food;</I> but the word used in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>

 is <B><I>poimaine</I></B>, which signifies more largely to do all the 
 offices of a shepherd to them: "<I>Feed the lambs</I> with that which 
 is proper for them, and <I>the sheep</I> likewise with <I>food 
 convenient. The lost sheep of the house of Israel,</I> seek and feed 
 them, and <I>the other sheep</I> also <I>which are not of this 
 fold.</I>" Note, It is the duty of all Christ's ministers to feed his 
 lambs and sheep. <I>Feed them,</I> that is, teach them; for the 
 doctrine of the gospel is spiritual food. <I>Feed them,</I> that is,
 "Lead them to the green pastures, presiding in their religious 
 assemblies, and ministering all the ordinances to them. Feed them by 
 personal application to their respective state and case; not only lay 
 meat before them, but feed those with it that are wilful and will not, 
 or weak and cannot feed themselves." <I>When Christ ascended on high, 
 he gave pastors,</I> left his flock with those that loved him, and 
 would take care of them for his sake. 

 [3.] But why did he give this charge particularly to Peter? Ask the 
 advocates for the pope's supremacy, and they will tell you that Christ 
 hereby designed to give to Peter, and therefore to his successors, and 
 therefore to the bishops of Rome, an absolute dominion and headship 
 over the whole Christian church as if a charge to serve the sheep gave 
 a power to lord it over all the shepherds; whereas, it is plain, Peter 
 himself never claimed such a power, nor did the other disciples ever 
 own it in him. This charge given to Peter to preach the gospel is by a 
 strange artifice made to support the usurpation of his pretended 
 successors, that fleece the sheep, and, instead of feeding them, feed 
 upon them. But the particular application to Peter here was designed, 
 <I>First,</I> To restore him to his apostleship, now that he repented 
 of his abjuration of it, and to renew his commission, both for his own 
 satisfaction, and for the satisfaction of his brethren. A commission 
 given to one convicted of a crime is supposed to amount to a pardon; no 
 doubt, this commission given to Peter was an evidence that Christ was 
 reconciled to him else he would never have reposed such a confidence in 
 him. Of some that have deceived us we say, "Though we forgive them, we 
 will never trust them;" but Christ, when he forgave Peter, trusted him 
 with the most valuable treasure he had on earth. <I>Secondly,</I> It 
 was designed to quicken him to a diligent discharge of his office as an 
 apostle. Peter was a man of a bold and zealous spirit, always forward 
 to speak and act, and, lest he should be tempted to take upon him the 
 directing of the shepherds, he is charged to feed the sheep, as he 
 himself charges all the presbyters to do, and not <I>to lord it over 
 God's heritage,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:2,3">1 Pet. v. 2, 3</A>.

 If he will be doing, let him do this, and pretend no further.
 <I>Thirdly,</I> What Christ said to him he said to all his disciples; 
 he charged them all, not only to be fishers of men (though that was 
 said to Peter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:10">Luke v. 10</A>),

 by the conversion of sinners, but feeders of the flock, by the
 edification of saints.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ, having thus appointed Peter his doing work, next appoints 
 him his suffering work. Having confirmed to him the honour of an 
 apostle, he now tells him of further preferment designed him--the 
 honour of a martyr. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How his martyrdom is foretold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands,</I> being compelled to it, and 
 <I>another shall gird thee</I> (as a prisoner that is pinioned) <I>and 
 carry thee whither</I> naturally <I>thou wouldest not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He prefaces the notice he gives to Peter of his sufferings with a 
 solemn asseveration, <I>Verily, verily, I say unto thee.</I> It was not 
 spoken of as a thing probable, which perhaps might happen, but as a 
 thing certain, <I>I say it to thee.</I> "Others, perhaps, will say to 
 thee, as thou didst to me, <I>This shall not be unto thee;</I> but I 
 say it shall." As Christ foresaw all his own sufferings, so he foresaw 
 the sufferings of all his followers, and foretold them, though not in 
 particular, as to Peter, yet in general, that they must take up their 
 cross. Having charged him to feed his sheep, he bids him not to expect 
 ease and honour in it, but trouble and persecution, and to suffer ill 
 for doing well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He foretels particularly that he should die a violent death, by 
 the hands of an executioner. The stretching out of his hands, some 
 think, points at the manner of his death by crucifying; and the 
 tradition of the ancients, if we may rely upon that, informs us that 
 Peter was crucified at Rome under Nero, A.D. 68, or, as others say, 79. 
 Others think it points at the bonds and imprisonments which those are 
 hampered with that are sentenced to death. The pomp and solemnity of an 
 execution add much to the terror of death, and to any eye of sense make 
 it look doubly formidable. Death, in these horrid shapes, has often 
 been the lot of Christ's faithful ones, who yet have <I>overcome it by 
 the blood of the Lamb.</I> This prediction, though pointing chiefly at 
 his death, was to have its accomplishment in his previous sufferings. 
 It began to be fulfilled presently, when he was imprisoned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:3,Ac+5:18,12:4">Acts vi. 3; v. 18; xii. 4</A>.

 No more is implied here in his being carried whither he would not than
 that it was a violent death that he should be carried to, such a death 
 as even innocent nature could not think of without dread, nor approach 
 without some reluctance. He that puts on the Christian does not put off 
 the man. Christ himself prayed against the bitter cup. A natural 
 aversion to pain and death is well reconcileable with a holy submission 
 to the will of God in both. Blessed Paul, though longing to be 
 unloaded, owns he cannot desire <I>to be unclothed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:4">2 Cor. v. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He compares this with his former liberty. "Time was when thou 
 knewest not any of these hardships, <I>thou girdest thyself, and 
 walkedst whither thou wouldest.</I>" Where trouble comes we are apt to 
 aggravate it with this, that it has been otherwise; and to fret the 
 more at the grievances of restraint, sickness, and poverty, because we
 have known the sweets of liberty, health, and plenty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:2,Ps+42:4">Job xxix. 2; Ps. xlii. 4</A>.

 But we may turn it the other way, and reason thus with ourselves: "How 
 many years of prosperity have I enjoyed more than I deserved and 
 improved? And, having received good, shall I not receive evil also?" 
 See here,

 [1.] What a change may possibly be made with us, as to our condition in
 this world! Those that have <I>girded themselves with strength and 
 honour,</I> and indulged themselves in the greatest liberties, perhaps 
 levities, may be reduced to such circumstances as are the reverse of 
 all this. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:5">1 Sam. ii. 5</A>.

 [2.] What a change is presently made with those that leave all to
 follow Christ! They must no longer gird themselves, but he must gird
 them! and must no longer walk whither they will, but whither he will. 
 
 [3.] What a change will certainly be made with us if we should live to 
 be old! Those who, when they were young, had strength of body and 
 vigour of mind, and could easily go through business and hardship, and 
 take the pleasures they had a mind to, when they shall be old, will 
 find their strength gone, like Samson, when his hair was cut and he 
 could <I>not shake himself as at other times.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Christ tells Peter he should suffer thus in his old age.

 [1.] Though he should be old, and in the course of nature not likely to 
 live long, yet his enemies would hasten him out of the world violently 
 when he was about to retire out of it peaceably, and would put out his 
 candle when it was almost burned down to the socket. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:17">2 Chron. xxxvi. 17</A>.
 
 [2.] God would shelter him from the rage of his enemies till he should 
 come to be old, that he might be made the fitter for sufferings, and 
 the church might the longer enjoy his services.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The explication of this prediction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 <I>This spoke he</I> to Peter, <I>signifying by what death he should 
 glorify God,</I> when he had finished his course. Observe, 

 (1.) That it is not only <I>appointed to all once to die,</I> but it is 
 appointed to each what death he shall die, whether natural or violent, 
 slow or sudden, easy or painful. When Paul speaks of so <I>great a 
 death,</I> he intimates that there are degrees of death; there is one 
 way into the world, but many ways out, and God has determined which way 
 we should go. 

 (2.) That it is the great concern of every good man, whatever death he 
 dies, to glorify God in it; for what is our chief end but this, <I>to 
 die to the Lord, at the word of the Lord?</I> When we die patiently, 
 submitting to the will of God,--die cheerfully, rejoicing in hope of 
 the glory of God,--and die usefully, witnessing to the truth and 
 goodness of religion and encouraging others, we glorify God in dying: 
 and this is <I>the earnest expectation and hope</I> of all good 
 Christians, as it was Paul's, <I>that Christ may be magnified in them 
 living and dying,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:20">Phil. i. 20</A>.

 (3.) That the death of the martyrs was in a special manner for the
 glorifying of God. The truths of God, which they died in the defence 
 of, are hereby confirmed. The grace of God, which carried them with so 
 much constancy through their sufferings, is hereby magnified. And the
 consolations of God, which have abounded towards them in their 
 sufferings, and his promises, the springs of their consolations, have 
 hereby been recommended to the faith and joy of all the saints. The 
 blood of the martyrs has been the seed of the church, and the 
 conversion and establishment of thousands. <I>Precious</I> therefore
 <I>in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints,</I> as that 
 which honours him; and those who thereby at such an expense honour him 
 he will honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The word of command he gives him hereupon: <I>When he had spoken 
 thus,</I> observing Peter perhaps to look blank upon it, <I>he saith 
 unto him, Follow me.</I> Probably he rose from the place where he had 
 sat at dinner, walked off a little, and bade Peter attend him. This 
 word, <I>Follow me,</I> was 

 (1.) A further confirmation of his restoration to his Master's favour, 
 and to his apostleship; for <I>Follow me</I> was the first call. 

 (2.) It was an explication of the prediction of his sufferings, which 
 perhaps Peter at first did not fully understand, till Christ gave him 
 that key to it, <I>Follow me:</I> "Expect to be treated as I have been, 
 and to tread the same bloody path that I have trodden before thee; 
 <I>for the disciple is not greater than his Lord.</I>" 

 (3.) It was to excite him to, and encourage him in, faithfulness and 
 diligence in his work as an apostle. He had told him to <I>feed his 
 sheep,</I> and let him set his Master before him as an example of 
 pastoral care: "Do as I have done." Let the under-shepherds study to 
 imitate the Chief Shepherd. They had followed Christ while he was here 
 upon earth, and now that he was leaving them he till preached the same 
 duty to them though to be performed in another way, <I>Follow me;</I> 
 still they must follow the rules he had given them and the example he 
 had set them. And what greater encouragement could they have than this, 
 both in services and in sufferings? 

 [1.] That herein they did follow him, and it was their present honour; 
 who would be ashamed to follow such a leader? 

 [2.] That hereafter they should follow him, and that would be their 
 future happiness; and so it is a repetition of the promise Christ had 
 given Peter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:36"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 36</A>),

 <I>Thou shalt follow me afterwards.</I> Those that faithfully follow
 Christ in grace shall certainly follow him to glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus
 loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and
 said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
 &nbsp; 21  Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what <I>shall</I> this
 man <I>do?</I>
 &nbsp; 22  Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come,
 what <I>is that</I> to thee? follow thou me.

 disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall
 not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what <I>is that</I>
 to thee?
 &nbsp; 24  This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and
 wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.

 the world itself could not contain the books that should be
 written. Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The conference Christ had with Peter concerning John, the beloved 
 disciple, in which we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The eye Peter cast upon him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 Peter, in obedience to his Master's orders, followed him, and 
 <I>turning about,</I> pleased with the honours his Master now did him, 
 <I>he sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following</I> likewise. 
 Observe here, 

 (1.) How John is described. He does not name himself, as thinking his
 own name not worthy to be preserved in these records; but gives such a 
 description of himself as sufficiently informs us whom he meant, and 
 withal gives us a reason why he followed Christ so closely. <I>He was
 the disciple whom Jesus loved,</I> for whom he had a particular 
 kindness above the rest; and therefore you cannot blame him for 
 coveting to be as much as possible within hearing of Christ's gracious 
 words during those few precious minutes with which Christ favoured his 
 disciples. It is probable that mention in here made of John's having 
 <I>leaned on Jesus's breast</I> and his enquiring concerning the 
 traitor, which he did at the instigation of Peter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:24"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 24</A>),

 as a reason why Peter made the following enquiry concerning him, to
 repay him for the former kindness. Then John was in the favourite's
 place, lying in Christ's bosom, and he improved the opportunity to 
 oblige Peter. And now that Peter was in the favourite's place, called 
 to take a walk with Christ, he thought himself bound in gratitude to 
 put such a question for John as he thought would oblige him, we all 
 being desirous to know things to come. Note, As we have interest at
 the throne of grace, we should improve it for the benefit of one 
 another. Those that help us by their prayers at one time should be 
 helped by us with ours at another time. This is the <I>communion of 
 saints.</I> 

 (2.) What he did: he also followed Jesus, which shows how well he loved 
 his company; where he was there also would this servant of his be. When 
 Christ called Peter to follow him, it looked as if he designed to have 
 some private talk with him; but such an affection John had to his 
 Master that he would rather do a thing that seemed rude than lose the 
 benefit of any of Christ's discourse. What Christ said to Peter he took 
 as said to himself; for that word of command, <I>Follow me,</I> was 
 given to all the disciples. At least he desired to have fellowship
 with those that had fellowship with Christ, and to accompany those that 
 attended him. The bringing of one to follow Christ should engage 
 others. <I>Draw me and we will run after thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:4">Cant. i. 4</A>.

 (3.) The notice Peter took of it: <I>He, turning about, seeth him.</I> 
 This may be looked upon either, 

 [1.] As a culpable diversion from following his Master; he should have 
 been wholly intent upon that, and have waited to hear what Christ had 
 further to say to him, and then was he looking about him to see who 
 followed. Note, The best men find it hard to <I>attend upon the Lord 
 without distraction,</I> hard to keep their minds so closely fixed as 
 they should be in following Christ: and a needless and unseasonable 
 regard to our brethren often diverts us from communion with God. Or, 
 
 [2.] As a laudable concern for his fellow-disciples. He was not so 
 elevated with the honour his Master did him, in singling him out from 
 the rest, as to deny a kind look to one that followed. Acts of love to 
 our brethren must go along with actings of faith in Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The enquiry Peter made concerning him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>Lord, and what shall this man do?</I> Thou hast told me my work-to 
 feed the sheep; and my lot--to be <I>carried whither I would not.</I> 
 What shall be his work, and his lot?" Now this may be taken as the 
 language, 

 (1.) Of concern for John, and kindness to him: "Lord, thou showest me a 
 great deal of favour. Here comes thy beloved disciple, who never 
 forfeited thy favour, as I have done; he expects to be taken notice of; 
 hast thou nothing to say to him? Wilt thou not tell how he must be 
 employed, and how he must be honoured?" 

 (2.) Or of uneasiness at what Christ had said to him concerning his 
 sufferings: "Lord, must I alone be <I>carried whither I would not?</I> 
 Must I be marked out to be run down, and must this man have no share of 
 the cross?" It is hard to reconcile ourselves to distinguishing 
 sufferings, and the troubles in which we think we stand alone. 

 (3.) Or of curiosity, and a fond desire of knowing things to come, 
 concerning others, as well as himself. It seems, by Christ's answer, 
 there was something amiss in the question. When Christ had given him
 the charge of such a treasure, and the notice of such a trial, it had 
 well become him to have said, "Lord, and what shall I do then to 
 approve myself faithful to such a trust, in such a trial? <I>Lord,
 increase my faith.</I> As my day is, let my strength be." But instead 
 of this, 

 [1.] He seems more concerned for another than for himself. So apt are 
 we to be busy in other men's matters, but negligent in the concerns of 
 our own souls-quick-sighted abroad, but dim-sighted at home-judging 
 others, and prognosticating what they will do, when we have enough to 
 do to <I>prove our own work,</I> and <I>understand our own way.</I> 
 
 [2.] He seems more concerned about events than about duty. John was
 younger than Peter, and, in the course of nature, likely to survive 
 him: "Lord," says he, "what times shall he be reserved for?" Whereas, 
 if God by his grace enable us to persevere to the end, and finish well, 
 and get safely to heaven, we need not ask, "What shall be the lot of 
 those that shall come after us?" Is it not well if peace and truth be 
 in my days? Scripture-predictions must be eyed for the directing of
 our consciences, not the satisfying of our curiosity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ's reply to this enquiry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 "<I>If I will that he tarry till I come,</I> and do not suffer as thou 
 must, <I>what is that to thee.</I> Mind thou thy own duty, the present 
 duty, <I>follow thou me.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) There seems to be here an intimation of Christ's purpose 
 concerning John, in two things:--

 [1.] That he should not die a violent death, like Peter, but should 
 tarry till Christ himself came by a natural death to fetch him to 
 himself. The most credible of the ancient historians tell us that John 
 was the only one of all the twelve that did not actually die a martyr. 
 He was often in jeopardy, in bonds and banishments; but at length died 
 in his bed in a good old age. Note, <I>First,</I> At death Christ comes 
 to us to call us to account; and it concerns us to be ready for his 
 coming. <I>Secondly,</I> Though Christ calls out some of his disciples 
 to resist unto blood, yet not all. Though the crown of martyrdom is
 bright and glorious, yet the beloved disciple comes short of it. 

 [2.] That he should not die till after Christ's coming to destroy 
 Jerusalem: so some understand his tarrying till Christ comes. All the 
 other apostles died before that destruction; but John survived it many 
 years. God wisely so ordered it that one of the apostles should live
 so long as to close up the canon of the New Testament, which John did 
 solemnly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:18">Rev. xxii. 18</A>),

 and to obviate the design of the enemy that sowed tares even before the 
 servants fell asleep. John lived to confront Ebion, and Cerinthus, and 
 other heretics, who rose betimes, <I>speaking perverse things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Others think that it is only a rebuke to Peter's curiosity, and 
 that his tarrying till Christ's second coming is only the supposition 
 of an absurdity: "Wherefore askest thou after that which is foreign and 
 secret? Suppose I should design that John should never die, what does 
 that concern thee? It is nothing to thee, when or where, or how, John 
 must die. I have told thee how thou must die for thy part; it is enough 
 for thee to know that, <I>Follow thou me.</I>" Note, It is the will of 
 Christ that his disciples should mind their own present duty, and not 
 be curious in their enquiries about future events, concerning either 
 themselves or others. 

 [1.] There are many things we are apt to be solicitous about that are 
 nothing to us. Other people's characters are nothing to us; it is out 
 of our line to judge them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:4">Rom. xiv. 4</A>.

 Whatsoever they are, saith Paul, it makes no matter to me. Other
 people's affairs are nothing to us to intermeddle in; we must quietly 
 work, and mind our own business. Many nice and curious questions are 
 put by the <I>scribes</I> and <I>disputers of this world</I> concerning 
 the counsels of God, and the state of the invisible world, concerning 
 which we may say, <I>What is this to us?</I> What do you think will 
 become of such and such? is a common question, which may easily be 
 answered with another: <I>What is that to me?</I> To his own Master he 
 stands or falls. What is it to us to <I>know the times and the 
 seasons?</I> Secret things belong not to us.

 [2.] The great thing that is all in all to us is duty, and not event; 
 for duty is ours, events are God's-our own duty, and not another's; for 
 every one shall bear his own burden--our present duty, and not the duty 
 of the time to come; for sufficient to the day shall be the directions 
 thereof: a <I>good man's steps are ordered by the Lord,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:23">Ps. xxxvii. 23</A>);

 he is guided step by step. Now all our duty is summed up in this one of 
 following Christ. We must attend his motions, and accommodate ourselves 
 to them, follow him to do him honour, as the servant his master; we 
 must walk in the way in which he walked, and aim to be where he is. 
 And, if we will closely attend to the duty of following Christ, we 
 shall find neither heart nor time to meddle with at which does not 
 belong to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The mistake which arose from this saying of Christ, that <I>that 
 disciple should not die,</I> but abide with the church to the end of 
 time; together with the suppressing of this motion by a repetition of 
 Christ's words, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The easy rise of a mistake in the church by misconstruing the 
 sayings of Christ, and turning a supposition to a position. Because 
 John must not die a martyr, they conclude he must not die at all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They were inclined to expect it because they could not choose but 
 desire it. <I>Quod volumus facile crediumus--We easily believe what we 
 wish to be true.</I> For John to abide in the flesh when the rest were 
 gone, and to continue in the world till Christ's second coming, they 
 think, will be a great blessing to the church, which in every age might 
 have recourse to him as an oracle. When they must lose Christ's bodily 
 presence, they hope they shall have that of his beloved disciple; as if 
 that must supply the want of his, forgetting that the blessed Spirit, 
 the Comforter, was to do that. Note, We are apt to dote too much on men 
 and means, instruments and external helps, and to think we are happy if 
 we may but have them always with us; whereas God will change his 
 workmen, and yet carry on his work, that the <I>excellency of the power 
 may be of God, and not of men.</I> There is no need of immortal 
 ministers to be the guides of the church, while it is under the conduct 
 of an eternal Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Perhaps they were confirmed in their expectations when they now 
 found that John survived all the rest of the apostles. Because he lived 
 long, they were ready to think he should live always; whereas <I>that 
 which waxeth old is ready to vanish away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:13">Heb. viii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] However, it took rise from a saying of Christ's, misunderstood, 
 and then made a saying of the church. Hence learn, <I>First,</I> The 
 uncertainty of human tradition, and the folly of building our faith 
 upon it. Here was a tradition, an apostolical tradition, a saying that 
 <I>went abroad among the brethren.</I> It was early; it was common; it 
 was public; and yet it was false. How little then are those unwritten 
 traditions to be relied upon which the council of Trent hath decreed to 
 be received with a <I>veneration and pious affection equal to that 
 which is owing to the holy scripture.</I> Here was a traditional 
 exposition of scripture. No new saying of Christ's advanced, but only a 
 construction put by the brethren upon what he did really say, and yet 
 it was a misconstruction. Let the scripture be its own interpreter and 
 explain itself, as it is in a great measure its own evidence and proves 
 itself, for it is light. <I>Secondly,</I> The aptness of men to 
 misinterpret the sayings of Christ. The grossest errors have sometimes 
 shrouded themselves under the umbrage of incontestable truths; and the 
 scriptures themselves have ben wrested by the unlearned and unstable. 
 We must not think it strange if we hear the sayings of Christ 
 misinterpreted, quoted to patronise the errors of antichrist, and the 
 impudent doctrine of transubstantiation--for instance, pretending to 
 build upon that blessed word of Christ, <I>This is my body.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The easy rectifying of such mistakes, by adhering to the word of 
 Christ, and abiding by that. So the evangelist here corrects and 
 controls that saying among the brethren, by repeating the very words of 
 Christ. He did not say that the disciple should not die. Let us not say 
 so then; but he said, <I>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is 
 that to thee?</I> He said so, and no more. <I>Add thou not unto his 
 words.</I> Let the words of Christ speak for themselves, and let no 
 sense be put upon them but what is genuine and natural; and in that let 
 us agree. Note, The best end of men's controversies would be to keep to 
 the express words of scripture, and speak, as well as think, according 
 to that word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:20">Isa. viii. 20</A>.

 Scripture language is the safest and most proper vehicle of scripture 
 truth: the <I>words which the Holy Ghost teacheth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:13">1 Cor. ii. 13</A>.

 As the scripture itself, duly attended to, is the best weapon wherewith 
 to wound all dangerous errors (and therefore deists, Socinians, 
 papists, and enthusiasts do all they can to derogate the authority of 
 scripture), so the scripture itself, humbly subscribed to, is the best 
 weapon-salve to heal the wounds that are made by different modes of 
 expression concerning the same truths. Those that cannot agree in the 
 same logic and metaphysics, and the propriety of the same terms of air, 
 and the application of them, may yet agree in the same scripture terms, 
 and then may agree to love one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have here the conclusion of this gospel, and with it of the 
 evangelical story, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 This evangelist ends not so abruptly as the other three did, but with a 
 sort of cadency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This gospel concludes with an account of the author or penman of it, 
 connected by a decent transition to that which went before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):
 
 <I>This is the disciple which testifies of these things</I> to the 
 present age, and wrote these things for the benefit of posterity, even 
 this same that Peter and his Master had that conference about in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:15-25">foregoing verses</A>

 --John the apostle. Observe here, 

 (1.) Those who wrote the history of Christ were not ashamed to put 
 their names to it. John here does in effect subscribe his name. As we 
 are sure who was the author of the first five books of the Old 
 Testament, which were the foundation of that revelation, so we are sure 
 who were the penmen of the four gospels and the Acts, the pentateuch of 
 the New Testament. The record of Christ's life and death is not the
 report of we know not who, but was drawn up by men of known integrity, 
 who were ready not only to depose it upon oath, but, which was more, to 
 <I>seal it with their blood.</I> 

 (2.) Those who wrote the history of Christ wrote upon their own 
 knowledge, not by hearsay, but what they themselves were eye and ear 
 witnesses of. The penman of this history was a disciple, a beloved 
 disciple, one that had leaned on Christ's breast, that had himself 
 heard his sermons and conferences, had seen his miracles, and the 
 proofs of his resurrection. This is he who testifies what he was well 
 assured of. 

 (3.) Those who wrote the history of Christ, as they testified what they 
 had seen, so they wrote what they had first testified. It was
 published by word of mouth, with the greatest assurance, before it was 
 committed to writing. They testified it in the pulpit, testified it at 
 the bar, solemnly averred it, stedfastly avowed it, not as travellers 
 give an account of their travels, to entertain the company, but as 
 witnesses upon oath give account of what they know in a matter of 
 consequence, with the utmost caution and exactness, to found a verdict 
 upon. What they wrote they wrote as an affidavit, which they would 
 abide by. Their writings are standing testimonies to the world of the 
 truth of Christ's doctrine, and will be testimonies either for us or 
 against us according as we do or do not receive it. 

 (4.) It was graciously appointed, for the support and benefit of the 
 church, that the history of Christ should be put into writing, that it 
 might with the greater fulness and certainty spread to every place, and 
 last through every age.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It concludes with an attestation of the truth of what had been here 
 related: <I>We know that his testimony is true.</I> This may be taken 
 either, 

 (1.) As expressing the common sense of mankind in matters of this 
 nature, which is, that the testimony of one who is an eye-witness, is 
 of unspotted reputation, solemnly deposes what he has seen, and puts it 
 into writing for the greater certainty, is an unexceptionable evidence. 
 <I>We know,</I> that is, All the world knows, that the testimony of 
 such a one is valid, and the common faith of mankind requires us to 
 give credit to it, unless we can disprove it; and in other cases 
 verdict and judgment are given upon such testimonies. The truth of the 
 gospel comes confirmed by all the evidence we can rationally desire or 
 expect in a thing of this nature. The matter of fact, that Jesus did 
 preach such doctrines, and work such miracles, and rise from the dead, 
 is proved, beyond contradiction, by such evidence as is always admitted 
 in other cases, and therefore to the satisfaction of all that are 
 impartial; and then let the doctrine recommend itself, and let the 
 miracles prove it to be of God. Or, 

 (2.) As expressing the satisfaction of the churches <I>at that time</I> 
 concerning the truth of what is here related. Some take it for the
 subscription of the church of Ephesus, others of the angels or 
 ministers of the churches of Asia to this narrative. Not as if an 
 inspired writing needed any attestation from men, or could thence 
 receive any addition to its credibility; but hereby they recommended it 
 to the notice of the churches, as an inspired writing, and declared the 
 satisfaction they received by it. Or,

 (3.) As expressing the evangelist's own assurance of the truth of what 
 he wrote, like that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:35"><I>ch.</I> xix. 35</A>),

 <I>He knows that he saith true.</I> He speaks of himself in the plural
 number, <I>We know,</I> not for majesty-sake, but for modesty-sake, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1">1 John i. 1</A>,

 <I>That which we have seen;</I> and
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:16">2 Pet. i. 16</A>.

 Note, The evangelists themselves were entirely satisfied of the truth
 of what they have testified and transmitted to us. They do not require 
 us to believe what they did not believe themselves; no, they knew that 
 their testimony was true, for they ventured both this life and the 
 other upon it; threw away this life, and depended upon another, on the 
 credit of what they spoke and wrote.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It concludes with an <I>et cetera,</I> with a reference to <I>many 
 other things,</I> very memorable, said and done by our Lord Jesus, 
 which were well known by many then living, but not thought fit to be 
 recorded for posterity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 There were many things very remarkable and improvable, which, if they 
 should be written at large, with the several circumstances of them, 
 even the world itself, that is, all the libraries in it, could not 
 contain the books that might be written. Thus he concludes like an
 orator, as Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:32">Heb. xi. 32</A>),

 <I>What shall I more say? For the time would fail me.</I> If it be 
 asked why the gospels are not larger, why they did not make the New 
 Testament history as copious and as long as the Old, it may be 
 answered,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It was not because they had exhausted their subject, and had 
 nothing more to write that was worth writing; no, there were many of 
 Christ's sayings and doings not recorded by any of the evangelists, 
 which yet were worthy to be written in letter of gold. For, 

 [1.] Every thing that Christ said and did was worth our notice, and 
 capable of being improved. He never spoke an idle word, nor did an idle 
 thing; nay, he never spoke nor did any thing mean, or little, or 
 trifling, which is more than can be said of the wisest or best of men. 
 
 [2.] His miracles were many, very many, of many kinds, and the same 
 often repeated, as occasion offered. Though one true miracle might 
 perhaps suffice to prove a divine commission, yet the repetition of the 
 miracles upon a great variety of persons, in a great variety of cases, 
 and before a great variety of witnesses, helped very much to prove them 
 true miracles. Every new miracle rendered the report of the former the 
 more credible; and the multitude of them renders the whole report 
 incontestable.

 [3.] The evangelists upon several occasions give general accounts of
 Christ's preaching and miracles, inclusive of many particulars, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:23,24,9:35,11:1,14:14,36,15:30,19:2">Matt. iv. 23, 24;
 ix. 35; xi. 1; xiv. 14, 36; xv. 30; xix. 2</A>;

 and many others. When we speak of Christ, we have a copious subject 
 before us; the reality exceeds the report, and, after all, <I>the one 
 half is not told us.</I> St. Paul quotes one of Christ's sayings, which 
 is not recorded by any of the evangelists

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:35">Acts xx. 35</A>),

 and doubtless there were many more. All his sayings were
 apophthegms.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) But it was for these three reasons:--

 [1.] Because it was not needful to write more. This is implied here. 
 There were many other things, which were not written because there was 
 no occasion for writing them. What is written is a sufficient 
 revelation of the doctrine of Christ and the proof of it, and the rest 
 was but to the same purport. Those that argue from this against the 
 sufficiency of the scripture as the rule of our faith and practice, and 
 for the necessity of unwritten traditions, ought to show what there is 
 in the traditions they pretend to be perfective of the written word; we 
 are sure there is that which is contrary to it, and therefore reject 
 them. By these therefore <I>let us be admonished, for of making many 
 books there is no end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:12">Eccl. xii. 12</A>.

 If we do not believe and improve what is written, neither should we if
 there had been much more.

 [2.] It was not possible to write all. It was possible for the Spirit
 to indite all, but morally impossible for the penmen to pen all. <I>The 
 world could not contain the books.</I> It is a hyperbole common enough 
 and justifiable, when no more is intended than this, that it would fill 
 a vast and incredible number of volumes. It would be such a large and 
 overgrown history as never was; such as would jostle out all other 
 writings, and leave us no room for them. What volumes would be filled 
 with Christ's prayers, had we the record of all those he made, when he 
 <I>continued all night in prayer to God,</I> without any vain 
 repetitions? Much more if all his sermons and conferences were 
 particularly related, his miracles, his cures, all his labours, all his 
 sufferings; it would have been an endless thing. 

 [3.] It was not advisable to write much; for <I>the world,</I> in a 
 moral sense, <I>could not contain the books that should be written.</I> 
 Christ said not what he might have said to his disciples, <I>because 
 they were not able to bear it;</I> and for the same reason the 
 evangelists wrote not what they might have written. <I>The world could
 not contain,</I> <B><I>choresai</I></B>. It is the word that is used,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:37"><I>ch.</I> viii. 37</A>,

 "My word <I>has no place</I> in you." They would have been so many that
 they would have found no room. All people's time would have been spent 
 in reading, and other duties would thereby have been crowded out. Much 
 is overlooked of what is written, much forgotten, and much made the 
 matter of doubtful disputation; this would have been the case much more 
 if there had been such a world of books of equal authority and 
 necessity as the whole history would have swelled to; especially since 
 it was requisite that what was written should be meditated upon and 
 expounded, which God wisely thought fit to leave room for. Parents and 
 ministers, in giving instruction, must consider the capacities of those 
 they teach, and, like Jacob, must take heed of over-driving. Let us be 
 thankful for the books that are written, and not prize them the less 
 for their plainness and brevity, but diligently improve what God has 
 thought fit to reveal, and long to be above, where our capacities shall 
 be so elevated and enlarged that there will be no danger of their being 
 over-loaded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The evangelist, concluding with <I>Amen,</I> thereby sets to his seal, 
 and let us set to ours, an <I>Amen</I> of faith, subscribing to the 
 gospel, that it is true, all true; and an <I>Amen</I> of satisfaction 
 in what is written, as able to make us wise to salvation. <I>Amen;</I> 
 so be it.</P>
