 Christ having, in the former chapter, armed his disciples against the 
 corrupt doctrines and opinions of the scribes and Pharisees, especially 
 in their expositions of the law (that was called their leaven, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:12"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 12</A>),

 comes in this chapter to warn them against their corrupt practices, 
 against the two sins which, though in their doctrine they did not 
 justify, yet in their conversation they were notoriously guilty of, and 
 so as even to recommend them to their admirers: these were hypocrisy
 and worldly-mindedness, sins which, of all others, the professors of 
 religion need most to guard against, as sins that most easily beset 
 those who have escaped the grosser pollutions that are in the world 
 through lust, and which are therefore highly dangerous. We are here 
 cautioned, 

 I. Against hypocrisy; we must not be as the hypocrites are, nor do as
 the hypocrites do.

 1. In the giving of alms, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 2. In prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:5-8">ver. 5-8</A>.

 We are here taught what to pray for, and how to pray 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>);

 and to forgive in prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>.
 
 3. In fasting, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>.

 II. Against worldly-mindedness,

 1. In our choice, which is the destroying sin of hypocrites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:19-24">ver. 19-24</A>.
 
 2. In our cares, which is the disquieting sin of many good Christians,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of
 them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in
 heaven.
 &nbsp; 2  Therefore when thou doest <I>thine</I> alms, do not sound a
 trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and
 in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say
 unto you, They have their reward.
 &nbsp; 3  But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
 right hand doeth:
 &nbsp; 4  That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth
 in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As we must do better than the scribes and Pharisees in avoiding 
 heart-sins, heart-adultery, and heart-murder, so likewise in 
 maintaining and keeping up heart-religion, doing what we do from an 
 inward, vital principle, that we may be approved of God, not that we 
 may be applauded of men; that is, we must watch against hypocrisy, 
 which was the leaven of the Pharisees, as well as against their 
 doctrine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:1">Luke xii. 1</A>.

 <I>Almsgiving, prayer,</I> and <I>fasting,</I> are three great
 Christian duties--the three foundations of the law, say the Arabians: 
 by them we do homage and service to God with our three principal 
 interests; by <I>prayer</I> with our <I>souls,</I> by <I>fasting</I> 
 with our <I>bodies,</I> by <I>alms-giving</I> with our <I>estates.</I> 
 Thus we must not only <I>depart from evil,</I> but <I>do good,</I> and 
 do it well, and so <I>dwell for evermore.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now in these verses we area cautioned against hypocrisy in giving alms. 
 <I>Take heed</I> of it. Our being bid to <I>take heed</I> of it 
 intimates that it is sin. 

 1. We are in <I>great danger of;</I> it is a subtle sin; vain-glory
 insinuates itself into what we do ere we are aware. The disciples would 
 be tempted to it by the power they had to do many wondrous works, and 
 their living with some that admired them and others that despised them, 
 both which are temptations to covet to make a fair show in the flesh. 

 2. It is a sin we are <I>in great danger by.</I> Take heed of 
 hypocrisy, for if it reign in you, it will ruin you. It is the dead fly 
 that spoils the whole box of precious ointment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things are here supposed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>giving of alms</I> is a great duty, and a duty which all the 
 disciples of Christ, according to their ability, must abound in. It is 
 prescribed by the law of nature and of Moses, and great stress is laid 
 upon it by the prophets. Divers ancient copies here for <B><I>ten 
 eleemosynen</I></B>--<I>your alms,</I> read <B><I>ten 
 dikaiosynen</I></B>--<I>your righteousness,</I> for <I>alms</I> are 
 <I>righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:9,Pr+10:2">
 Ps. cxii. 9; Prov. x. 2</A>.

 The Jews called the <I>poor's box</I> the <I>box of righteousness.</I>
 That which is given to the poor is said to be their due, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:27">Prov. iii. 27</A>.
 
 The duty is not the less necessary and excellent for its being abused 
 by hypocrites to serve their pride. If superstitious papists have 
 placed a merit in works of charity, that will not be an excuse for 
 covetous protestants that are barren in such good works. It is true, 
 our alms-deeds do not deserve heaven; but it is as true that we cannot 
 go to heaven without them. It is <I>pure religion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:27">Jam. i. 27</A>),

 and will be the test at the great day; Christ here takes it for granted
 that his disciples <I>give alms,</I> nor will he own those that do 
 not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That it is such a duty as has a great reward attending it, which is 
 lost if it be done in hypocrisy. It is sometimes rewarded in temporal 
 things with <I>plenty</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:24,25,19:17">Prov. xi. 24, 25; xix. 17</A>);

 <I>security from want</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:27,Ps+37:21,25">Prov. xxviii. 27; Ps. xxxvii. 21, 25</A>);

 <I>succour in distress</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:1,2">Ps. xli. 1, 2</A>);

 <I>honour and a good</I> name, which follow those most that least covet
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:9">Ps. cxii. 9</A>.

 However, it shall be recompensed in the resurrection of the just

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:14">Luke xiv. 14</A>),
 
 in <I>eternal riches.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This being supposed, observe now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was the <I>practice of the hypocrites</I> about this duty. They 
 did it indeed, but not from any principle of obedience to God, or love 
 to man, but in pride and vain-glory; not in compassion to the poor, but 
 purely for ostentation, that they might be extolled as good men, and so 
 might gain an interest in the esteem of the people, with which they 
 knew how to serve their own turn, and to get a great deal more than 
 they gave. Pursuant to this intention, they chose to give their alms 
 <I>in the synagogues, and in the streets,</I> where there was the 
 greatest concourse of people to observe them, who applauded their 
 liberality because they shared in it, but were so ignorant as not to 
 discern their abominable pride. Probably they had collections for the 
 poor in the synagogues, and the common beggars haunted the streets and 
 highways, and upon these public occasions they chose to give their 
 alms. Not that it is unlawful to give alms <I>when men see us;</I> we 
 may do it; but not <I>that men may see us;</I> we should rather choose 
 those objects of charity that are less observed. The hypocrites, if 
 they gave alms to their own houses, <I>sounded a trumpet,</I> under 
 pretence of calling the poor together to be served, but really to 
 proclaim their charity, and to have that taken notice of and made the 
 subject of discourse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the doom that Christ passes upon this is very observable; <I>Verily 
 I say unto you, they have their reward.</I> At first view this seems a 
 promise--If they have their reward they have enough, but two words in
 it make it a threatening.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is a reward, but it is <I>their</I> reward; not the reward 
 which God promises to them that do good, but the reward which they 
 promise themselves, and a poor reward it is; they did it to be <I>seen 
 of men,</I> and they <I>are</I> seen of men; they <I>chose their own 
 delusions</I> with which they cheated themselves, and they shall have 
 what they chose. Carnal professors stipulate with God for preferment, 
 honour, wealth, and they shall have their bellies filled with those 
 things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>);

 but let them expect no more; these are their consolation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:24">Luke vi. 24</A>),

 their good things
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25">Luke xvi. 25</A>),

 and they shall be put off with these. "<I>Didst thou not agree with me
 for a penny?</I> It is the bargain that thou art likely to abide 
 by."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is a reward, but it is a <I>present reward,</I> they 
 <I>have</I> it; and there is none reserved for them in the future 
 state. They now have all that they are likely to have from God; they 
 have their reward here, and have none to hope for hereafter.
 <B><I>Apechousi ton misthon</I></B>. It signifies a <I>receipt in 
 full.</I> What rewards the godly have in this life are but <I>in part 
 of payment;</I> there is more behind, much more; but hypocrites have 
 their <I>all</I> in this world, so shall their doom be; themselves have 
 decided it. The world is but for <I>provision</I> to the saints, it is 
 their spending-money; but it is <I>pay</I> to hypocrites, it is their 
 portion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What is the <I>precept of our Lord Jesus</I> about it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 He that was himself such an example of humility, pressed it upon his 
 disciples, as absolutely necessary to the acceptance of their 
 performances. "<I>Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand 
 doeth</I> when thou givest alms." Perhaps this alludes to the placing 
 of the Corban, the poor man's box, or the chest into which they cast 
 their free-will offerings, <I>on the right hand</I> of the passage into 
 the temple; so that they put their gifts into it with the 
 <I>right-hand.</I> Or the giving of alms with the <I>right hand,</I> 
 intimates readiness to it and resolution in it; do it dexterously, not 
 awkwardly nor with a sinister intention. The <I>right hand</I> may be 
 used in helping the poor, lifting them up, writing for them, dressing 
 their sores, and other ways besides giving to them; but, "whatever 
 kindness thy right hand doeth to the poor, <I>let not thy left hand 
 know it:</I> conceal it as much as possible; industriously keep it 
 private. Do it because it is a good work, not because it will give thee 
 a good name." <I>In omnibus factis, re, non teste, moveamur--In all our 
 actions, we should be influenced by a regard to the object, not to the 
 observer.</I> Cic. de Fin. It is intimated,

 (1.) That we must not let <I>others</I> know what we do; no, not those 
 that stand <I>at our left hand,</I> that are very near us. Instead of 
 acquainting them with it, keep it from them if possible; however, 
 appear so desirous to keep it from them, as that in civility they may 
 seem not to take notice of it, and keep it to themselves, and let it go 
 no further. 

 (2.) That we must not observe it too much <I>ourselves:</I> the left 
 hand is a part of ourselves; we must not within ourselves take notice 
 too much of the good we do, must not applaud and admire ourselves. 
 Self-conceit and self-complacency, and an adoring of our own shadow, 
 are branches of pride, as dangerous as vain-glory and ostentation 
 before men. We find those had their good works remembered to their 
 honour, who had themselves forgotten them: <I>When saw we thee an 
 hungered, or athirst?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What is the <I>promise to those who are thus sincere and humble</I> 
 in their alms-giving. Let <I>thine alms be in secret,</I> and then 
 <I>thy Father who seeth in secret</I> will observe them. Note, When we 
 take least notice of our good deeds ourselves, God takes most notice of 
 them. As God hears the wrongs done to us when we do not hear them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:14,15">Ps. xxxviii. 14, 15</A>),

 so he sees the good done by us, when we do not see it. As it is a
 terror to hypocrites, so it is a comfort to sincere Christians, that 
 God <I>sees in secret.</I> But this is not all; not only the 
 observation and praise, but the recompence is of God, <I>himself shall 
 reward thee openly.</I> Note, They who in their alms-giving study to 
 approve themselves to God, only turn themselves over to him as their 
 Paymaster. The hypocrite catches at the shadow, but the upright man 
 makes sure of the substance. Observe how emphatically it is expressed; 
 <I>himself shall reward,</I> he will himself be the Rewarder,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:6">Heb. xi. 6</A>.

 Let him alone to make it up in kind or kindness; nay, he will
 <I>himself be the Reward</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:1">Gen. xv. 1</A>),

 thine <I>exceeding great reward.</I> He will reward thee as thy Father,
 not as a master who gives his servant just what he earns and no more, 
 but as a father who gives abundantly more, and without stint, to his 
 son that serves him. Nay, he shall reward thee <I>openly,</I> if not
 in the present day, yet in the great day; <I>then shall every man have 
 praise of God,</I> open praise, thou shall be confessed <I>before 
 men.</I> If the work be not open, the reward shall, and that is 
 better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
 <I>are:</I> for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in
 the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily
 I say unto you, They have their reward.
 &nbsp; 6  But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
 thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret;
 and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
 &nbsp; 7  But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen
 <I>do:</I> for they think that they shall be heard for their much
 speaking.
 &nbsp; 8  Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth
 what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In <I>prayer</I> we have more immediately to do with God than in 
 <I>giving alms,</I> and therefore are yet more concerned to be 
 <I>sincere,</I> which is what we are here directed to. <I>When thou 
 prayest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>).

 It is taken for granted that all the disciples of Christ <I>pray.</I> 
 As soon as ever Paul was converted, <I>behold he prayeth.</I> You may 
 as soon find a living man that does not breathe, as a living Christian 
 that does not pray. <I>For this shall every one that is godly pray.</I> 
 If prayerless, then graceless. "<I>Now, when thou prayest,</I> thou 
 shalt not be <I>as the hypocrites are,</I> nor do as they do,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Note, Those who would not do as the hypocrites do in their ways and 
 actions must not be as the hypocrites are in their frame and temper. He 
 names nobody, but it appears by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:13"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 13</A>,

 that by the hypocrites here he means especially the scribes and
 Pharisees.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now there were two great faults they were guilty of in prayer, against 
 each of which we are here cautioned--vain-glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>);

 and vain repetitions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We must not be <I>proud</I> and <I>vain-glorious</I> in prayer, nor 
 aim at the praise of men. And here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was the <I>way and practice of the hypocrites.</I> In all their 
 exercises of devotion, it was plain, the chief thing they aimed at was 
 to be commended by their neighbours, and thereby to make an interest 
 for themselves. When they seemed to <I>soar upwards</I> in prayer (and 
 if it be right, it is the soul's ascent toward God), yet even then 
 their eye was <I>downwards</I> upon this as their <I>prey.</I> 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What the <I>places</I> were which they chose for their devotions; 
 they prayed in the <I>synagogues,</I> which were indeed proper places 
 for public prayer, but not for personal. They pretended hereby to do 
 honour to the place of their assemblies, but intended to do honour to 
 themselves. They prayed in <I>the corners of the streets,</I> the broad 
 streets (so the word signifies), which were most frequented. They 
 withdrew thither, as if they were under a pious impulse which would not 
 admit delay, but really it was to cause themselves to be taken notice 
 of. There, where two streets met, they were not only within view of 
 both, but every passenger turning close upon them would observe them, 
 and hear what they said.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>posture</I> they used in prayer; they prayed standing; this 
 is a lawful and proper posture for prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+11:25">Mark xi. 25</A>,

 <I>When ye stand praying</I>), but kneeling being the more humble and
 reverent gesture,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:41,Ac+7:60,Eph+3:14">Luke xxii. 41; 
 Acts vii. 60; Eph. iii. 14</A>,

 their standing seemed to savour of pride and confidence in themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:11">Luke xviii. 11</A>),

 <I>The Pharisee stood and prayed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Their <I>pride</I> in choosing these public places, which is 
 expressed in two things: 

 [1.] They <I>love</I> to pray there. They did not love prayer for its 
 own sake, but they loved it when it gave them an opportunity of making 
 themselves noticed. Circumstances may be such, that our good deeds
 must needs be done openly, so as to fall under the observation of 
 others, and be commended by them; but the sin and danger is when we 
 love it, and are pleased with it, because it feeds the proud humour.

 [2.] It is that they may be <I>seen of men;</I> not that God might 
 accept them, but that men might admire and applaud them; and that they 
 might easily get the estates of widows and orphans into their hands 
 (who would not trust such devout, praying men?) and that, when they had 
 them, they might devour them without being suspected

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:14"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 14</A>);

 and effectually carry on their public designs to enslave the
 people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The <I>product</I> of all this, <I>they have their reward;</I> 
 they have all the recompence they must ever expect from God for their 
 service, and a poor recompence it is. What will it avail us to have the 
 good word of our fellow-servants, if our Master do not say, <I>Well 
 done?</I> But if in so great a transaction as is between us and God, 
 when we are at prayer, we can take in so poor a consideration as the
 praise of men is, it is just that that should be all our reward. They 
 did it to be <I>seen of men,</I> and they are so; and much good may it 
 do them. Note, Those that would approve themselves to God by their 
 integrity in their religion, must have to regard to the praise of men; 
 it is not to men that we pray, nor from them that we expect an answer; 
 they are not to be our judges, they are dust and ashes like ourselves, 
 and therefore we must not have our eye to them: what passes between God 
 and our own souls must be out of sight. In our synagogue-worship, we 
 must avoid every thing that tends to make our personal devotion 
 remarkable, as they that caused their <I>voice to be heard on high,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:4">Isa. lviii. 4</A>.

 Public places are not proper for private solemn prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What is the <I>will of Jesus Christ</I> in opposition to this. 
 Humility and sincerity are the two great lessons that Christ teaches 
 us; <I>Thou, when thou prayest,</I> do so and so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 <I>thou</I> in particular by thyself, and for thyself. Personal prayer
 is here supposed to be the duty and practice of all Christ's 
 disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 (1.) The directions here given about it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Instead of praying in <I>the synagogues</I> and in the <I>corners 
 of the streets, enter into thy closet,</I> into some place of privacy 
 and retirement. Isaac went into the field 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:63">Gen. xxiv. 63</A>),

 Christ to a mountain, Peter to a housetop. No place amiss in point of
 ceremony, if it do but answer the end. Note, Secret prayer is to be 
 performed in retirement, that we may be unobserved, and so may avoid 
 ostentation; undisturbed, and so may avoid distraction; unheard, and so 
 may use greater freedom; yet if the circumstances be such that we 
 cannot possibly avoid being taken notice of, we must not therefore 
 neglect the duty, lest the omission be a greater scandal than the 
 observation of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Instead of doing it to be <I>seen of men, pray to thy Father who
 is in secret; to me, even to me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:5,6">Zech. vii. 5, 6</A>.

 The Pharisees prayed rather to men than to God; whatever was the form 
 of their prayer, the scope of it was to beg the applause of men, and 
 court their favours. "Well, do thou pray to God, and let that be
 enough for thee. Pray to him as a Father, as thy Father, ready to hear 
 and answer, graciously inclined to pity, help, and succour thee. Pray 
 to thy Father <I>who is in secret.</I>" Note, In secret prayer we must 
 have an eye to God, as present in all places; he is there in thy closet 
 when no one else is there; there especially nigh to thee in what thou 
 <I>callest upon him for.</I> By <I>secret</I> prayer we give God the 
 glory of his universal presence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:24">Acts xvii. 24</A>),

 and may take to ourselves the comfort of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The encouragements here given us to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Thy Father <I>seeth in secret;</I> his eye is upon thee to accept
 thee, when the eye of no man is upon thee to applaud thee; <I>under the 
 fig-tree, I saw thee,</I> said Christ to Nathaniel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:48">John i. 48</A>.

 He saw Paul at prayer in such a street, at such a house,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:11">Acts ix. 11</A>.

 There is not a secret, sudden breathing after God, but he observes
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He <I>will reward thee openly;</I> they have their reward that do 
 it openly, and thou shalt not lose thine for thy doing it in secret. It 
 is called a <I>reward,</I> but it is <I>of grace,</I> not <I>of 
 debt;</I> what merit can there be in begging? The reward will be open;
 they shall not only have it, but have it honourably: the open reward is 
 that which hypocrites are fond of, but they have not patience to stay 
 for it; it is that which the sincere are dead to, and they shall have 
 it over and above. Sometimes secret prayers are rewarded openly in this 
 world by signal answers to them, which manifests God's praying people 
 in the consciences of their adversaries; however, at the great day 
 there will be an open reward, when all praying people shall <I>appear 
 in glory</I> with the great Intercessor. The Pharisees had their reward
 <I>before all the town,</I> and it was a <I>mere flash and shadow;</I> 
 true Christians shall have theirs <I>before all the world,</I> angels 
 and men, and it shall be a <I>weight of glory.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We must not <I>use vain repetitions</I> in prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Though the life of prayer lies in <I>lifting up the soul and pouring 
 out the heart,</I> yet there is some interest which words have in 
 prayer, especially in joint prayer; for in that, words are necessary, 
 and it should seem that our Saviour speaks here especially of that; for 
 before he said, <I>when thou prayest,</I> he here, when <I>ye pray;</I> 
 and the Lord's prayer which follows is a joint prayer, and in that, he 
 that is the mouth of others is most tempted to an ostentation of 
 language and expression, against which we are here warned; <I>use not 
 vain repetitions,</I> either alone or with others: the Pharisees 
 affected this, <I>they made long prayers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:14"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 14</A>),

 all their care was to make them long. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the <I>fault</I> is that is here reproved and condemned; it is 
 making a mere lip-labour of the duty of prayer, the service of the 
 tongue, when it is not the service of the soul. This is expressed here 
 by two words, <B><I>Battologia, Polylogia</I></B>.

 (1.) <I>Vain repetitions</I>--tautology, battology, idle babbling over
 the same words again and again to no purpose, like <I>Battus, Sub illis
 montibus erant, erant sub montibus illis;</I> like that imitation of
 the wordiness of a fool, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:14">Eccl. x. 14</A>,

 <I>A man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him who can 
 tell?</I> which is indecent and nauseous in any discourse, much more in
 speaking to God. It is not all repetition in prayer that is here 
 condemned, but vain repetitions. Christ himself prayed, saying the
 same words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:44"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 44</A>),

 out of more than ordinary fervour and zeal,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:44">Luke xxii. 44</A>.

 So Daniel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:18,19"><I>ch.</I> ix. 18, 19</A>.

 And there is a very elegant repetition of the same words,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:1-26">Ps. cxxxvi.</A>.

 It may be of use both to express our own affections, and to excite the
 affections of others. But the superstitious rehearsing of a tale of 
 words, without regard to the sense of them, as the papists saying by 
 their beads so many Ave-Marys and Paternosters; or the barren and dry 
 going over of the same things again and again, merely to drill out the 
 prayer to such a length, and to make a show of affection when really 
 there is none; these are the vain repetitions here condemned. When we 
 would fain say much, but cannot say much to the purpose; this is 
 displeasing to God and all wise men.

 (2.) <I>Much speaking,</I> an affectation of prolixity in prayer, 
 either out of pride or superstition, or an opinion that God needs 
 either to be informed or argued with by us, or out of mere folly and 
 impertinence, because men love to <I>hear themselves talk.</I> Not that 
 all long prayers are forbidden; Christ prayed all night, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:12">Luke vi. 12</A>.
 
 Solomon's was a long prayer. There is sometimes need of long prayers
 when our errands and our affections are extraordinary; but merely to 
 prolong the prayer, as if it would make it more pleasing or more 
 prevailing with God, is that which is here condemned; it is not much 
 <I>praying</I> that is condemned; no, we are bid to <I>pray always,</I> 
 but much <I>speaking;</I> the danger of this error is when we only 
 <I>say</I> our prayers, and not when we <I>pray</I> them. This caution 
 is explained by that of Solomon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:2">Eccl. v. 2</A>),

 <I>Let thy words be few,</I> considerate and well weighed; <I>take with
 you words</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:2">Hos. xiv. 2</A>),
 
 <I>choose out words</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:14">Job ix. 14</A>),

 and do not say every thing that comes uppermost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What reasons are given against this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This is the way of the heathen, <I>as the heathen do;</I> and it 
 ill becomes Christians to worship their God as the Gentiles worship 
 theirs. The heathen were taught by the light of nature to worship God; 
 but becoming vain in their imaginations concerning the object of their 
 worship, no wonder they became so concerning the manner of it, and 
 particularly in this instance; thinking God altogether such a one as 
 themselves, they thought he needed many words to make him understand 
 what was said to him, or to bring him to comply with their requests; as 
 if he were weak and ignorant, and hard to be entreated. Thus Baal's 
 priests were hard at it from morning till almost night with their 
 <I>vain repetitions;</I> <I>O Baal, hear us;</I> <I>O Baal, hear 
 us;</I> and vain petitions they were; but Elijah, in a grave, composed 
 frame, with a very concise prayer, prevailed for fire from heaven 
 first, and then water, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:26,36">1 Kings xviii. 26, 36</A>.

 <I>Lip-labour</I> in prayer, though ever so well <I>laboured,</I> if
 that be all, is but <I>lost labour.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) "It need not be your way, <I>for your Father</I> in heaven 
 <I>knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him,</I> and 
 therefore there is no occasion for such abundance of words. It does not 
 follow that therefore ye need not pray; for God requires you by prayer 
 to own your need of him and dependence on him, and to please his 
 promises; but therefore you are to open your case, and pour out your 
 hearts before him, and then leave it with him." Consider, 

 [1.] The God we pray to is our Father by creation, by covenant; and 
 therefore our addresses to him should be easy, natural, and unaffected; 
 children do not use to make long speeches to their parents when they 
 want any thing; it is enough to say, <I>my head, my head.</I> Let us 
 come to him with the disposition of children, with love, reverence, and 
 dependence; and then they need not say many words, that are taught by 
 the Spirit of adoption to say that one aright, <I>Abba, Father.</I>

 [2.] He is a Father that knows our case and knows our wants better than
 we do ourselves. <I>He knows what things we have need of;</I> his eyes
 run to and fro through the earth, to observe the necessities of his
 people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9">2 Chron. xvi. 9</A>),
 
 and he often gives <I>before we call</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:24">Isa. lxv. 24</A>),
 
 and <I>more than we ask for</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:20">Eph. iii. 20</A>),

 and if he do not give his people what they ask, it is because he knows
 they do not need it, and that it is not for their good; and of that he
 is fitter to judge for us than we for ourselves. We need not be long, 
 nor use many words in representing our case; God knows it better than 
 we can tell him, only he will know it <I>from us (what will ye that I 
 should do unto you?</I>); and when we have told him what it is, we must 
 refer ourselves to him, <I>Lord, all my desire is before thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:9">Ps. xxxviii. 9</A>.

 So far is God from being wrought upon by the length or language of our 
 prayers, that the most powerful intercessions are those which are made 
 with <I>groanings that cannot be uttered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:26">Rom. viii. 26</A>.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in

 When Christ had condemned what was amiss, he directs to do better; for 
 his are reproofs of instruction. Because we know not what to pray for 
 as we ought, he here helps our infirmities, by putting words into our 
 mouths; <I>after this manner therefore pray ye,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 So many were the corruptions that had crept into this duty of prayer
 among the Jews, that Christ saw it needful to give a new directory for 
 prayer, to show his disciples what must ordinarily be the matter and 
 method of their prayer, which he gives in words that may very well be 
 used as a form; as the summary or contents of the several particulars 
 of our prayers. Not that we are tied up to the use of this form only,
 or of this always, as if this were necessary to the consecrating of our 
 other prayers; we are here bid to pray after this manner, with these 
 words, or to this effect. That in Luke differs from this; we do not 
 find it used by the apostles; we are not here taught to pray in the 
 name of Christ, as we are afterward; we are here taught to pray that 
 the kingdom might come which did come when the Spirit was poured out: 
 yet, without doubt, it is very good to use it as a form, and it is a 
 pledge of the communion of saints, it having been used by the church in 
 all ages, at least (says Dr. Whitby) from the third century. It is our 
 Lord's prayer, it is of his composing, of his appointing; it is very 
 compendious, yet very comprehensive, in compassion to our infirmities 
 in praying. The matter is choice and necessary, the method instructive, 
 and the expression very concise. It has much in a little, and it is 
 requisite that we acquaint ourselves with the sense and meaning of it, 
 for it is used acceptably no further than it is used with understanding 
 and without vain repetition.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Lord's prayer (as indeed every prayer) is a letter sent from earth 
 to heaven. Here is the inscription of the letter, the person to whom it 
 is directed, <I>our Father;</I> the where, <I>in heaven;</I> the 
 contents of it in several errands of request; the close, <I>for thine 
 is the kingdom;</I> the seal, <I>Amen;</I> and if you will, the date 
 too, <I>this day.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Plainly thus: there are three parts of the prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>The preface, Our Father who art in heaven.</I> Before we come to 
 our business, there must be a solemn address to him with whom our 
 business lies; <I>Our Father.</I> Intimating, that we must pray, not 
 only alone and for ourselves, but with and for others; for we are 
 members one of another, and are called into fellowship with each other. 
 We are here taught <I>to whom to pray,</I> to God only, and not to 
 saints and angels, for they are ignorant of us, are not to have the 
 high honours we give in prayer, nor can give favours we expect. We are 
 taught how to address ourselves to God, and what title to give him, 
 that which speaks him rather beneficent than magnificent, for we are to 
 come boldly to the throne of grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must address ourselves to him as <I>our Father,</I> and must call 
 him so. He is a common Father to all mankind by creation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:10,Ac+17:28">Mal. ii. 10; Acts xvii. 28</A>.

 He is in a special manner a Father to the saints, by adoption and
 regeneration

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:5,Ga+4:6">Eph. i. 5; Gal. iv. 6</A>);

 and an unspeakable privilege it is. Thus we must eye him in prayer,
 keep up good thoughts of him, such as are encouraging and not 
 affrighting; nothing more pleasing to God, nor pleasant to ourselves, 
 than to call God <I>Father.</I> Christ in prayer mostly called God 
 <I>Father.</I> If he be our Father, he will pity us under our 
 weaknesses and infirmities

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:13">Ps. ciii. 13</A>),
 
 will spare us
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:17">Mal. iii. 17</A>),

 will make the best of our performances, though very defective, will
 deny us nothing that is good for us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:11-13">Luke xi. 11-13</A>.

 We have access with boldness to him, as to a father, and have an
 <I>advocate with the Father,</I> and the Spirit of adoption. When we 
 come repenting of our sins, we must eye God as a Father, as the 
 prodigal did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:18,Jer+3:19">Luke xv. 18; Jer. iii. 19</A>);

 when we come begging for grace, and peace, and the inheritance and
 blessing of sons, it is an encouragement that we come to God, not as an 
 unreconciled, avenging Judge, but as a loving, gracious, reconciled 
 Father in Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:4">Jer. iii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As our Father <I>in heaven:</I> so in heaven as to be every where 
 else, for the heaven cannot contain him; yet so in heaven as there to 
 manifest his glory, for it is his throne 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:19">Ps. ciii. 19</A>),

 and it is to believers a throne of grace: thitherward we must direct
 our prayers, for Christ the Mediator is now in heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:1">Heb. viii. 1</A>.

 Heaven is out of sight, and a world of spirits, therefore our converse
 with God in prayer must be spiritual; it is on high, therefore in
 prayer we must be raised above the world, and lift up our hearts, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:1">Ps. v. 1</A>.

 Heaven is a place of perfect purity, and we must therefore lift up pure
 hands, must study to sanctify his name, who is the Holy One, and dwells
 in that holy place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:3">Lev. x. 3</A>.
 
 From heaven God beholds the children of men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:13,14">Ps. xxxiii. 13, 14</A>.

 And we must in prayer see his eye upon us: thence he has a full and
 clear view of all our wants and burdens and desires, and all our 
 infirmities. It is the firmament of his power likewise, as well as of 
 his prospect, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+150:1">Ps. cl. 1</A>.

 He is not only, as a Father, able to help us, able to do great things
 for us, more than we can ask or think; he has wherewith to supply our 
 needs, for every good gift is from above. He is a Father, and
 therefore we may come to him with boldness, but a Father in heaven, and 
 therefore we must come with reverence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:2">Eccl. v. 2</A>.
 
 Thus all our prayers should correspond with that which is our great aim
 as Christians, and that is, to be with God in heaven. God and heaven, 
 the end of our whole conversation, must be particularly eyed in every 
 prayer; there is the centre to which we are all tending. By prayer, we 
 send before us thither, where we profess to be going.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>The petitions,</I> and those are six; the three first relating 
 more immediately to God and his honour, the three last to our own 
 concerns, both temporal and spiritual; as in the ten commandments, the 
 four first teach us our duty toward God, and the last six our duty 
 toward our neighbour. The method of this prayer teaches us to seek 
 first the <I>kingdom of God and his righteousness,</I> and then to hope 
 that <I>other things shall be added.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Hallowed be thy name.</I> It is the same word that in other 
 places is translated <I>sanctified.</I> But here the old word 
 <I>hallowed</I> is retained, only because people were used to it in the 
 Lord's prayer. In these words, 

 (1.) We give glory to God; it may be taken not as a petition, but as an 
 adoration; as that, <I>the Lord be magnified,</I> or <I>glorified,</I> 
 for God's holiness is the greatness and glory of all his perfections. 
 We must begin our prayers with praising God, and it is very fit he 
 should be first served, and that we should give glory to God, before we 
 expect to receive mercy and grace from him. Let him have praise of his 
 perfections, and then let us have the benefit of them. 

 (2.) We fix our end, and it is the right end to be aimed at, and ought
 to be our chief and ultimate end in all our petitions, that God may be 
 glorified; all our other requests must be in subordination to this, and 
 in pursuance of it. "<I>Father, glorify thyself</I> in giving me my 
 daily bread and pardoning my sins," &c. Since all is of him and
 through him, all must be to him and for him. In prayer our thoughts and 
 affections should be carried out most to the glory of God. The 
 Pharisees made their own name the chief end of their prayers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>,

 <I>to be seen of men</I>), in opposition to which we are directed to 
 make the name of God our chief end; let all our petitions centre in 
 this and be regulated by it. "Do so and so for me, <I>for the glory of 
 thy name,</I> and as far as is for the glory of it." 

 (3.) We desire and pray that the name of God, that is, God himself, in 
 all that whereby he has made himself known, may be sanctified and 
 glorified both by us and others, and especially by himself. "Father, 
 let thy name be glorified as a Father, and a Father in heaven; glorify 
 thy goodness and thy highness, thy majesty and mercy. <I>Let thy name 
 be sanctified,</I> for it is a holy name; no matter what becomes of our 
 polluted names, but, Lord, <I>what wilt thou do to thy great name?</I>" 
 When we pray that God's name may be glorified,

 [1.] We make a virtue of necessity; for God will <I>sanctify his own 
 name,</I> whether we desire it or not; <I>I will be exalted among the 
 heathen,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:10">Ps. lxvi. 10</A>.

 [2.] We ask for that which we are sure shall be granted; for when our
 Saviour prayed, <I>Father glorify thy name,</I> it was immediately 
 answered, <I>I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>Thy kingdom come.</I> This petition has plainly a reference to 
 the doctrine which Christ preached at this time, which John Baptist had 
 preached before, and which he afterwards sent his apostles out to 
 preach--<I>the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</I> The kingdom of your 
 Father who is in heaven, the kingdom of the Messiah, this is at hand, 
 pray that it may come. Note, We should turn the word we hear into 
 prayer, our hearts should echo to it; does Christ promise, <I>surely I 
 come quickly?</I> our hearts should answer, <I>Even so, come.</I> 
 Ministers should pray over the word: when they preach, <I>the kingdom 
 of God is at hand,</I> they should pray, <I>Father, thy kingdom 
 come.</I> What God has promised we must pray for; for promises are 
 given, not to supersede, but to quicken and encourage prayer; and when 
 the accomplishment of a promise is near and at the door, when the 
 kingdom of heaven is at hand, we should then pray for it the more 
 earnestly; <I>thy kingdom come;</I> as Daniel set his face to pray for 
 the deliverance of Israel, when he understood that the time of it was 
 at hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2">Dan. ix. 2</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:11">Luke xix. 11</A>.

 It was the Jews' daily prayer to God, <I>Let him make his kingdom
 reign, let his redemption flourish, and let his Messiah come and 
 deliver his people.</I> Dr. Whitby, <I>ex Vitringa.</I> "<I>Let thy 
 kingdom come,</I> let the gospel be preached to all and embraced by 
 all; let all be brought to subscribe to the record God has given in his 
 word concerning his Son, and to embrace him as their Saviour and 
 Sovereign. Let the bounds of the gospel-church be enlarged, the kingdom 
 of the world be made Christ's kingdom, and all men become subjects to 
 it, and live as becomes their character."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.</I> We pray that 
 God's kingdom being come, we and others may be brought into obedience 
 to all the laws and ordinances of it. By this let it appear that 
 Christ's kingdom is come, <I>let God's will be done;</I> and by this 
 let it appear that it is come as a <I>kingdom of heaven,</I> let it
 introduce a <I>heaven upon earth.</I> We make Christ but a titular 
 Prince, if we call him King, and do not do his will: having prayed that 
 he may rule us, we pray that we may in every thing be ruled by him. 
 Observe, 

 (1.) The thing prayed for, <I>thy will be done;</I> "Lord, do what thou
 pleasest with me and mine; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:18">1 Sam. iii. 18</A>.

 I refer myself to thee, and am well satisfied that all thy counsel
 concerning me should be performed." In this sense Christ prayed, <I>not 
 my will, but thine be done.</I> "Enable me to do what is pleasing to 
 thee; give me that grace that is necessary to the right knowledge of 
 thy will, and an acceptable obedience to it. Let thy will be done 
 conscientiously by me and others, not our own will, the will of the 
 flesh, or the mind, not the will of men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:2">1 Pet. iv. 2</A>),

 much less Satan's will

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:44">John viii. 44</A>),

 that we may neither displease God in any thing we do (<I>ut nihil
 nostrum displiceat Deo</I>), nor be displeased at any thing God does" 
 (<I>ut nihil Dei displiceat nobis</I>).

 (2.) The pattern of it, that it might be <I>done on earth,</I> in this
 place of our trial and probation (where our work must be done, or it 
 never will be done), <I>as it is done in heaven,</I> that place of rest 
 and joy. We pray that earth may be made more like heaven by the
 observance of God's will (this earth, which, through the prevalency of 
 Satan's will, has become so near akin to hell), and that saints may be 
 made more like the holy angels in their devotion and obedience. We are 
 <I>on earth,</I> blessed be God, not yet <I>under the earth;</I> we 
 pray for the <I>living</I> only, not for <I>the dead that have gone 
 down into silence.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. <I>Give us this day our daily bread.</I> Because our natural being 
 is necessary to our spiritual well-being in this world, therefore, 
 after the things of God's glory, kingdom, and will, we pray for the 
 necessary supports and comforts of this present life, which are the 
 gifts of God, and must be asked of him, <B><I>Ton arton 
 epiousion</I></B>--<I>Bread for the day approaching,</I> for all the 
 remainder of our lives. <I>Bread for the time to come, or bread for our 
 being and subsistence,</I> that which is agreeable to our condition in 
 the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:8">Prov. xxx. 8</A>),

 <I>food convenient for us</I> and our families, according to our rank
 and station.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Every word here has a lesson in it: 

 (1.) We ask for <I>bread;</I> that teaches us sobriety and temperance; 
 we ask for <I>bread,</I> not dainties, not superfluities; that which is 
 wholesome, though it be not nice. 

 (2.) We ask for <I>our</I> bread; that teaches us honesty and industry: 
 we do not ask for the bread out of other people's mouths, not the 
 <I>bread of deceit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:17">Prov. xx. 17</A>),
 
 not the <I>bread of idleness</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:27">Prov. xxxi. 27</A>),

 but the bread honestly gotten.

 (3.) We ask for our <I>daily</I> bread; which teaches us not to <I>take
 thought for the morrow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 but constantly to depend upon divine Providence, as those that live 
 from hand to mouth.

 (4.) We beg of God to <I>give</I> it us, not sell it us, nor lend it
 us, but <I>give</I> it. The greatest of men must be beholden to the 
 mercy of God for their <I>daily bread,</I> 

 (5.) We pray, "Give it to <I>us;</I> not to me only, but to others in 
 common with me." This teaches us charity, and a compassionate concern 
 for the poor and needy. It intimates also, that we ought to pray with
 our families; we and our households eat together, and therefore ought 
 to pray together.

 (6.) We pray that God would give us <I>this day;</I> which teaches us
 to renew the desire of our souls toward God, as the wants of our bodies 
 are renewed; as duly as the day comes, we must pray to our heavenly 
 Father, and reckon we could as well go a day without meat, as without 
 prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. <I>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,</I> This is 
 connected with the former; and <I>forgive,</I> intimating, that unless 
 our sins be pardoned, we can have no comfort in life, or the supports 
 of it. <I>Our daily bread</I> does but feed us <I>as lambs for the 
 slaughter,</I> if our sins be not pardoned. It intimates, likewise, 
 that we must pray for daily <I>pardon,</I> as duly as we pray for daily 
 <I>bread.</I> <I>He that is washed, needeth to wash his feet.</I> Here 
 we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A petition; <I>Father in heaven forgive us our debts,</I> our 
 debts to thee. Note, 

 [1.] Our sins are our debts; there is a debt of duty, which, as 
 creatures, we owe to our Creator; we do not pray to be discharged from 
 that, but upon the non-payment of that there arises a debt of 
 punishment; in default of obedience to the will of God, we become 
 obnoxious <I>to the wrath of God;</I> and for not observing the precept 
 of the law, we stand obliged to the penalty. A debtor is liable to 
 process, so are we; a malefactor is a debtor to the law, so are we.

 [2.] Our hearts' desire and prayer to our heavenly Father every day 
 should be, that he would <I>forgive us our debts;</I> that the 
 obligation to punishment may be cancelled and vacated, that we may 
 <I>not come into condemnation;</I> that we may be discharged, and have 
 the comfort of it. In suing out the pardon of our sins, the great plea 
 we have to rely upon is the satisfaction that was made to the justice 
 of God for the sin of man, by the dying of the Lord Jesus our Surety, 
 or rather Bail to the action, that undertook our discharge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) An argument to enforce this petition; <I>as we forgive our 
 debtors.</I> This is not a plea of merit, but a plea of grace. Note, 
 Those that come to God for the forgiveness of their sins against him, 
 must make conscience of forgiving those who have offended them, else 
 they curse themselves when they say the Lord's prayer. Our duty is to 
 <I>forgive our debtors;</I> as to debts of money, we must not be 
 rigorous and severe in exacting them from those that cannot pay them 
 without ruining themselves and their families; but this means debt of 
 injury; our debtors are those that <I>trespass against us,</I> that 
 <I>smite us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:39,40"><I>ch.</I> v. 39, 40</A>),

 and in strictness of law, might be prosecuted for it; we must forbear,
 and forgive, and forget the affronts put upon us, and the wrongs done 
 us; and this is a moral qualification for pardon and peace; it 
 encourages to hope, that God will <I>forgive us;</I> for if there be in 
 us this gracious disposition, it is wrought of God, and therefore is a 
 perfection eminently and transcendently in himself; it will be an 
 evidence to us that he has forgiven us, having wrought in us the 
 condition of forgiveness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. <I>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.</I> 
 This petition is expressed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Negatively: <I>Lead us not into temptation.</I> Having prayed that 
 the guilt of sin may be removed, we pray, as it is fit, that we may 
 never return again to folly, that we may not be tempted to it. It is 
 not as if God tempted any to sin; but, "Lord, do not let Satan loose 
 upon us; chain up that <I>roaring lion,</I> for he is subtle and 
 spiteful; Lord, do not leave us to ourselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:13">Ps. xix. 13</A>),

 for we are very weak; Lord, do not <I>lay stumbling-blocks</I> and
 snares before us, nor put us into circumstances that may be <I>an 
 occasion of falling.</I>" Temptations are to be prayed against, both 
 because of the discomfort and trouble of them, and because of the 
 danger we are in of being overcome by them, and the guilt and grief 
 that then follow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Positively: <I>But deliver us from evil;</I> <B><I>apo tou 
 ponerou</I></B>--<I>from the evil one,</I> the devil, the tempter; 
 "keep us, that either we may not be assaulted by him, or we may not be 
 overcome by those assaults:" Or <I>from the evil thing,</I> sin, the 
 worst of evils; an evil, an only evil; that evil thing which God hates, 
 and which Satan tempts men to and destroys them by. "Lord, deliver us 
 from the evil of the world, the corruption that is in the world through 
 lust; from the evil of every condition in the world; from the evil of 
 death; from the <I>sting of death, which is sin:</I> deliver us from 
 ourselves, from our own evil hearts: deliver us from evil men, that 
 they may not be a snare to us, nor we a prey to them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The conclusion: <I>For thine is the kingdom, and the power and the 
 glory, for ever. Amen.</I> Some refer this to David's doxology, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:11">1 Chron. xxix. 11</A>.

 <I>Thine, O Lord, is the greatness.</I> It is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A form of plea to enforce the foregoing petitions. It is our duty to 
 plead with God in prayer, to fill our mouth with arguments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:4">Job xxiii. 4</A>)
 
 not to move God, but to affect ourselves; to encourage the faith, to
 excite our fervency, and to evidence both. Now the best pleas in prayer 
 are those that are taken from God himself, and from that which he has 
 made known of himself. We must wrestle with God in his own strength, 
 both as to the nature of our pleas and the urging of them. The plea 
 here has special reference to the first three petitions; "<I>Father in 
 heaven, thy kingdom come, for thine is the kingdom; thy will be done, 
 for thine is the power; hallowed be thy name, for thine is the 
 glory.</I>" And as to our own particular errands, these are 
 encouraging: "<I>Thine is the kingdom;</I> thou hast the government of 
 the world, and the protection of the saints, thy willing subjects in 
 it;" God gives and saves like a king. "<I>Thine is the power,</I> to 
 maintain and support that kingdom, and to make good all thine 
 engagements to thy people." <I>Thine is the glory,</I> as the end of 
 all that which is given to, and done for, the saints, in answer to 
 their prayers; for their <I>praise waiteth</I> for him. This is matter 
 of comfort and holy confidence in prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is a form of praise and thanksgiving. The best pleading with God 
 is praising of him; it is the way to obtain further mercy, as it 
 qualifies us to receive it. In all our addresses to God, it is fit that 
 praise should have a considerable share, for <I>praise becometh the 
 saints;</I> they are to be our God <I>for a name and for a praise.</I> 
 It is just and equal; we praise God, and give him glory, not because he 
 needs it--he is praised by a world of angels, but because he deserves 
 it; and it is our duty to give him glory, in compliance with his design 
 in revealing himself to us. Praise is the work and happiness of heaven; 
 and all that would go to heaven hereafter, must begin their heaven now. 
 Observe, how full this doxology is, <I>The kingdom, and the power, and 
 the glory,</I> it is all thine. Note, It becomes us to be copious in 
 praising God. A true saint never thinks he can speak honourably enough 
 of God: here there should be a gracious fluency, and this <I>for 
 ever.</I> Ascribing glory to God <I>for ever,</I> intimates an 
 acknowledgement, that it is eternally due, and an earnest desire to be 
 eternally doing it, with angels and saints above, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:14">Ps. lxxi. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> To all this we are taught to affix our <I>Amen,</I> so 
 be it. God's <I>Amen</I> is a grant; his <I>fiat</I> is, it shall be 
 so; our <I>Amen</I> is only a summary desire; our <I>fiat</I> is, let 
 it be so: it is in the token of our desire and assurance to be heard, 
 that we say <I>Amen.</I> <I>Amen</I> refers to every petition going 
 before, and thus, in compassion to our infirmities, we are taught to 
 knit up the whole in one word, and so to gather up, in the general, 
 what we have lost and let slip in the particulars. It is good to 
 conclude religious duties with some warmth and vigour, that we may go 
 from them with a sweet savour upon our spirits. It was of old the 
 practice of good people to say, <I>Amen,</I> audibly at the end of 
 every prayer, and it is a commendable practice, provided it be done 
 with understanding, as the apostle directs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:16">1 Cor. xiv. 16</A>),

 and uprightly, with life and liveliness, and inward expressions,
 answerable to that outward expression of desire and confidence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Most of the petitions in the Lord's prayer had been commonly used by 
 the Jews in their devotions, or words to the same effect: but that 
 clause in the fifth petition, <I>As we forgive our debtors,</I> was 
 perfectly new, and therefore our Saviour here shows for what reason he 
 added it, not with any personal reflection upon the peevishness, 
 litigiousness, and ill nature of the men of that generation, though 
 there was cause enough for it, but only from the necessity and 
 importance of the thing itself. God, in forgiving us, has a peculiar
 respect to our forgiving those that have injured us; and therefore, 
 when we pray for pardon, we must mention our making conscience of that 
 duty, not only to remind ourselves of it, but to bind ourselves to it. 
 See that parable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:23-25"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 23-35</A>.

 Selfish nature is loth to comply with this, and therefore it is here
 inculcated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In a promise. <I>If ye forgive, your heavenly Father will also 
 forgive.</I> Not as if this were the only condition required; there 
 must be repentance and faith, and new obedience; but as where other 
 graces are in truth, there will be this, so this will be a good 
 evidence of the sincerity of our other graces. He that relents toward 
 his brother, thereby shows that he repents toward his God. Those which 
 in the prayer are called <I>debts,</I> are here called <I>trespasses, 
 debts</I> of injury, wrongs done to us in our bodies, goods, or 
 reputation: <I>trespasses</I> is an extenuating term for offences, 
 <B><I>paraptomata</I></B>--<I>stumbles, slips, falls.</I> Note, It is a 
 good evidence, and a good help of our forgiving others, to call the 
 injuries done us by a mollifying, excusing name. Call them not 
 <I>treasons,</I> but <I>trespasses;</I> not wilful injuries, but casual 
 inadvertencies; <I>peradventure it was an oversight</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+43:12">Gen. xliii. 12</A>),
 
 therefore make the best of it. We must forgive, as we hope to be
 forgiven; and therefore must not only bear no malice, nor mediate 
 revenge, but must not upbraid our brother with the injuries he has done 
 us, nor rejoice in any hurt that befals him, but must be ready to help 
 him and do him good, and if he repent and desire to be friends again, 
 we must be free and familiar with him, as before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In a threatening. "<I>But if you forgive not</I> those that have 
 injured you, that is a bad sign you have not the other requisite 
 conditions, but are altogether unqualified for pardon: and therefore 
 <I>your Father,</I> whom you call Father, and who, as a father, offers 
 you his grace upon reasonable terms, will nevertheless <I>not forgive 
 you.</I> And if other grace be sincere, and yet you be defective 
 greatly in forgiving, you cannot expect the comfort of your pardon, but 
 to have your spirit brought down by some affliction or other to comply 
 with this duty." Note, Those who would have found mercy with God must 
 show mercy to their brethren; nor can we expect that he should stretch
 out the hands of his favour to us, unless we lift up to him <I>pure 
 hands, without wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:8">1 Tim. ii. 8</A>.

 If we pray in anger, we have reason to fear God will answer in anger.
 It has been said, Prayers made in wrath are written in gall. What 
 reason is it that God should forgive us the talents we are indebted to 
 him, if we forgive not our brethren the pence they are indebted to us? 
 Christ <I>came into the world</I> as the great Peace-Maker, and not 
 only <I>to reconcile us to God,</I> but one to another, and in this we 
 must comply with him. It is great presumption and of dangerous 
 consequence, for any to make a light matter of that which Christ here 
 lays such a stress upon. Men's passions shall not frustrate God's 
 word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
 countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear
 unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
 &nbsp; 17  But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
 face;
 &nbsp; 18  That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
 which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall
 reward thee openly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here cautioned against hypocrisy in fasting, as before in 
 almsgiving, and in prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is here supposed that religious fasting is a duty required of the 
 disciples of Christ, when God, in his providence, calls to it, and when 
 the case of their own souls upon any account requires it; <I>when the 
 bridegroom is taken away, then shall they fast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:15"><I>ch.</I> ix. 15</A>.

 Fasting is here put last, because it is not so much a duty for its own
 sake, as a means to dispose us for other duties. Prayer comes in
 between almsgiving and fasting, as being the life and soul of both.
 Christ here speaks especially of private fasts, such as particular
 persons prescribe to themselves, as free-will offerings, commonly used
 among the pious Jews; some fasted one day, some two, every week; others
 seldomer, as they saw cause. On those days they did not eat till
 sun-set, and then very sparingly. It was not the Pharisee's fasting
 <I>twice in the week,</I> but his boasting of it, that Christ
 condemned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:12">Luke xviii. 12</A>.

 It is a laudable practice, and we have reason to lament it, that is so 
 generally neglected among Christians. Anna was much in fasting,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:37">Luke ii. 37</A>.

 Cornelius fasted and prayed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:30">Acts x. 30</A>.

 The primitive Christians were much in it, see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:3,14:23">Acts xiii. 3; xiv. 23</A>.

 Private fasting is supposed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:5">1 Cor. vii. 5</A>.

 It is an act of self-denial, and mortification of the flesh, a holy 
 revenge upon ourselves, and humiliation under the hand of God. The most 
 grown Christians must hereby own, they are so far from having any thing 
 to be proud of, that they are unworthy of their daily bread. It is a 
 means to curb the flesh and the desires of it, and to make us more 
 lively in religious exercises, as fulness of bread is apt to make us 
 drowsy. Paul was <I>in fastings often,</I> and so he <I>kept under this 
 body, and brought it into subjection.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are cautioned not to do this <I>as the hypocrites</I> did it, 
 lest we lose the reward of it; and the more difficulty attends the 
 duty, the greater loss it is to lose the reward of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 1. The <I>hypocrites</I> pretended fasting, when there was nothing of 
 that contrition or humiliation of soul in them, which is the life and 
 soul of the duty. Theirs were mock-fasts, the show and shadow without 
 the substance; they took on them to be more humbled than really they 
 were, and so endeavored to put a cheat upon God, than which they could 
 not put a greater affront upon him. The fast that God has chosen, is 
 <I>a day to afflict the soul, not to hang down the head like a 
 bulrush,</I> nor for a man <I>to spread sackcloth and ashes under 
 him;</I> we are quite mistaken if we call this a fast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:5">Isa. lviii. 5</A>.
 
 Bodily exercise, if that be all, profits little, since that is not
 fasting to God, even to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They proclaimed their fasting, and managed it so that all who saw 
 them might take notice that it was a fasting-day with them. Even on 
 these days they appeared in the streets, whereas they should have been 
 in their closets; and the affected a downcast look, a melancholy 
 countenance, a slow and solemn pace; and perfectly disfigured 
 themselves, that men might see how often they fasted, and might extol 
 them as devout, mortified men. Note, It is sad that men, who have, in 
 some measure, mastered their pleasure, which is sensual wickedness, 
 should be ruined by their pride, which is spiritual wickedness, and no 
 less dangerous. Here also <I>they have their reward,</I> that praise 
 and applause of men which they court and covet so much; <I>they 
 have</I> it, and it is their all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are directed how to manage a private fast; we must keep it in 
 private, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 He does not tell us how often we must fast; circumstances vary, and
 wisdom is profitable therein to direct; the Spirit in the word has left 
 that to the Spirit in the heart; but take this for a rule, whenever you 
 undertake this duty, study therein to approve yourselves to God, and 
 not to recommend yourselves to the good opinion of men; humility must 
 evermore attend upon our humiliation. Christ does not direct to abate
 any thing of the reality of the fast; he does not say,"take a little 
 meat, or a little drink, or a little cordial;" no, "let the body 
 suffer, but lay aside the show and appearance of it; appear with thy 
 ordinary countenance, guise, and dress; and while thou deniest thyself 
 thy bodily refreshments, do it so as that it may not be taken notice 
 of, no, not by those that are nearest to thee; look pleasant, <I>anoint 
 thine head and wash thy face,</I> as thou dost on ordinary days, on 
 purpose to conceal thy devotion; and thou shalt be no loser in the 
 praise of it at last; for though it be not of men, it shall be of God." 
 Fasting is the humbling of the soul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:13">Ps. xxxv. 13</A>),

 that is the inside of the duty; let that therefore be thy principal
 care, and as to the outside of it, covet not to let it be seen. If we 
 be sincere in our solemn fasts, and humble, and trust God's omniscience 
 for our witness, and his goodness for our reward, we shall find, both 
 that he did <I>see in secret,</I> and will <I>reward openly.</I> 
 Religious fasts, if rightly kept, will shortly be recompensed with an 
 everlasting feast. Our acceptance with God in our private fasts should
 make us dead, both to the applause of men (we must not do the duty in 
 hopes of this), and to the censures of men too (we must not decline the 
 duty for fear of them). David's fasting was turned to his reproach,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:10">Ps. lxix. 10</A>;
 
 and yet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>,

 <I>As for me,</I> let them say what they will of me, <I>my prayer is
 unto thee in an acceptable time.</I></P>

 darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how
 great <I>is</I> that darkness!
 &nbsp; 24  No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the
 one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
 despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

 Worldly-mindedness is as common and as fatal a symptom of hypocrisy as 
 any other, for by no sin can Satan have a surer and faster hold of the 
 soul, under the cloak of a visible and passable profession of religion, 
 than by this; and therefore Christ, having warned us against coveting 
 <I>the praise of men,</I> proceeds next to warn us against coveting the 
 wealth of the world; in this also we must take heed, lest we be as the 
 hypocrites are, and do as they do: the fundamental error that they are 
 guilty of is, that they choose the world for <I>their reward;</I> we 
 must therefore take heed of hypocrisy and worldly-mindedness, in the 
 choice we make of our treasure, our end, and our masters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In choosing the <I>treasure</I> we <I>lay up.</I> Something or other 
 every man has which he makes his <I>treasure,</I> his portion, which 
 his heart is upon, to which he carries all he can get, and which he 
 depends upon for futurity. It is <I>that good,</I> that chief good, 
 which Solomon speaks of with such an emphasis, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:3">Eccl. ii. 3</A>.

 Something the soul will have, which it looks upon as the best thing,
 which it has a complacency and confidence in above other things. Now 
 Christ designs not to deprive us of our treasure, but to direct us in 
 the choice of it; and here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A <I>good caution</I> against making <I>the things that are 
 seen,</I> that <I>are temporal,</I> our best things, and placing our 
 happiness in them. <I>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon 
 earth.</I> Christ's disciples had left all to follow him, let them 
 still keep in the same good mind. A <I>treasure</I> is an abundance of 
 something that is in itself, at least in our opinion, precious and 
 valuable, and likely to stand us in stead hereafter. Now we must <I>not 
 lay up our treasures on earth,</I> that is, 

 (1.) We must not count these things the best things, nor the most 
 valuable in themselves, nor the most serviceable to us: we must not 
 call them glory, as Laban's sons did, but see and own that they have no 
 glory in comparison with <I>the glory that excelleth.</I> 

 (2.) We must not covet an abundance of these things, nor be still 
 grasping at more and more of them, and adding to them, as men do to 
 that which is their treasure, as never knowing when we have enough. 
 
 (3.) We must not confide in them for futurity, to be our security and 
 supply in time to come; we must not say to the gold, <I>Thou art my 
 hope.</I> 

 (4.) We must not content ourselves with them, as all we need or desire: 
 we must be content with a little for our passage, but not with all for 
 our portion. These things must not be made <I>our consolation</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:24">Luke vi. 24</A>),
 
 our <I>good things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25">Luke xvi. 25</A>.

 Let us consider we are laying up, not for our <I>posterity</I> in this
 world, but for <I>ourselves</I> in the other world. We are put to our 
 choice, and made in a manner our own carvers; that is ours which <I>we 
 lay up for ourselves.</I> It concerns thee to choose wisely, for thou 
 art choosing for thyself, and shalt have as thou choosest. If we know 
 and consider ourselves what we are, what we are made for, how large our 
 capacities are, and how long our continuance, and that our souls are 
 ourselves, we shall see it is foolish thing to <I>lay up</I> our 
 <I>treasures on earth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is a <I>good reason</I> given why we should not look upon any 
 thing <I>on earth</I> as our <I>treasure,</I> because it is liable to 
 loss and decay: 

 (1.) From corruption within. That which is treasure <I>upon earth moth 
 and rust do corrupt.</I> If the <I>treasure</I> be laid up in fine 
 clothes, the <I>moth</I> frets them, and they are gone and spoiled 
 insensibly, when we thought them most securely laid up. If it be in 
 corn or other eatables, as his was who had his barns full 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:16,17">Luke xii. 16, 17</A>),

 <I>rust</I> (so we read it) <I>corrupts</I> that:
 <B><I>Brosis</I></B>--<I>eating,</I> eating by men, for <I>as goods are
 increased they are increased that eat them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:11">Eccl. v. 11</A>);

 eating by mice or other vermin; manna itself bred worms; or it grows
 mouldy and musty, is struck, or smutted, or blasted; fruits soon rot. 
 Or, if we understand it of silver and gold, they tarnish and canker; 
 they grow less with using, and grow worse with keeping

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:2,3">Jam. v. 2, 3</A>);

 the <I>rust and</I> the <I>moth</I> breed in the metal itself and in
 the garment itself. Note, Worldly riches have in themselves a principal 
 of corruption and decay; they wither of themselves, and <I>make 
 themselves wings.</I>

 (2.) From violence without. <I>Thieves break through and steal.</I> 
 Every hand of violence will be aiming at the house where 
 <I>treasure</I> is laid up; nor can any thing be laid up so safe, but 
 we may be spoiled of it. <I>Numquam ego fortun&aelig; credidi, etiam si 
 videretur pacem agere; omnia illa qu&aelig; in me indulgentissime 
 conferebat, pecuniam, honores, gloriam, eo loco posui, unde posset ea, 
 since metu meo, repetere--I never reposed confidence in fortune, even 
 if she seemed propitious: whatever were the favours which her bounty 
 bestowed, whether wealth, honours, or glory, I so disposed of them, 
 that it was in her power to recall them without occasioning me any 
 alarm.</I> Seneca. <I>Consol. ad Helv.</I> It is folly to make that our 
 <I>treasure</I> which we may so easily be robbed of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>Good counsel,</I> to make the joys and glories of the other 
 world, those <I>things not seen</I> that are <I>eternal,</I> our best 
 things, and to place our happiness in them. <I>Lay up for yourselves 
 treasures in heaven.</I> Note, 

 (1.) There are <I>treasures in heaven,</I> as sure as there are on this 
 earth; and those in heaven are the only true <I>treasures,</I> the 
 riches and glories and pleasures that are at God's right hand, which 
 those that are sanctified truly arrive at, when they come to be 
 sanctified perfectly. 

 (2.) It is our wisdom to <I>lay up</I> our <I>treasure in</I> those 
 <I>treasures;</I> to give all diligence to make sure our title to 
 eternal life through Jesus Christ, and to depend upon that as our 
 happiness, and look upon all things here below with a holy contempt, as 
 not worthy to be compared with it. We must firmly believe there is such 
 a happiness, and resolve to be content with that, and to be content 
 with nothing short of it. If we thus make those <I>treasures</I> ours, 
 they are laid up, and we may trust God to keep them safe for us; 
 thither let us then refer all our designs, and extend all our desires; 
 thither let us send before our best efforts and best affections. Let us 
 not burthen ourselves with the cash of this world, which will but load 
 and defile us, and be liable to sink us, but lay up in store good 
 securities. The promises are bills of exchange, by which all true 
 believers return their <I>treasure to heaven,</I> payable in the future 
 state: and thus we make that sure that will be made sure.

 (3.) It is a great encouragement to us to <I>lay up</I> our <I>treasure 
 in heaven,</I> that there it is safe; it will not decay of itself, no 
 <I>moth</I> nor <I>rust</I> will <I>corrupt</I> it; nor can we be by 
 force or fraud deprived of it; <I>thieves do not break through and 
 steal.</I> It is a happiness above and beyond the changes and chances 
 of time, <I>an inheritance incorruptible.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. A <I>good reason</I> why we should thus choose, and an evidence that 
 we have done so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>Where your treasure is,</I> on earth or in heaven, <I>there will your
 heart be.</I> We are therefore concerned to be right and wise in the
 choice of our <I>treasure,</I> because the temper of our minds, and 
 consequently the tenor of our lives, will be accordingly either carnal 
 or spiritual, earthly or heavenly. The <I>heart</I> follows the 
 <I>treasure,</I> as the needle follows the loadstone, or the sunflower 
 the sun. <I>Where the treasure is there</I> the value and esteem are, 
 <I>there</I> the love and affection are 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:2">Col. iii. 2</A>),

 that way the desires and pursuits go, thitherward the aims and intents
 are levelled, and all is done with that in view. <I>Where the treasure
 is, there</I> our cares and fears are, lest we come short of it; about 
 that we are most solicitous; <I>there</I> our hope and trust are

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10,11">Prov. xviii. 10, 11</A>);
 
 <I>there</I> our joys and delights will be
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:111">Ps. cxix. 111</A>);

 and <I>there</I> our thoughts will be, there the <I>inward</I> thought
 will be, the <I>first</I> thought, the <I>free</I> thought, the 
 <I>fixed</I> thought, the <I>frequent,</I> the <I>familiar</I> thought. 
 The <I>heart</I> is God's due

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:26">Prov. xxiii. 26</A>),

 and that he may have it, our <I>treasure</I> must be laid up with him,
 and then our souls will be lifted up to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This direction about laying up our <I>treasure,</I> may very fitly be 
 applied to the foregoing caution, of not doing what we do in religion 
 <I>to be seen of men.</I> Our <I>treasure</I> is our alms, prayers, and 
 fastings, and the reward of them; if we have done these only to gain 
 the applause of men, we have <I>laid up this treasure on earth,</I> 
 have lodged it in the hands of men, and must never expect to hear any 
 further of it. Now it is folly to do this, for <I>the praise of men</I> 
 we covet so much is liable to corruption: it will soon be rusted, and 
 moth-eaten, and tarnished; a little folly, like a dead fly, will spoil 
 it all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:1">Eccl. x. 1</A>.

 Slander and calumny are <I>thieves that break through and steal</I> it
 away, and so we lose all the <I>treasure</I> of our performances; we 
 have run in vain, and laboured in vain, because we misplaced our 
 intentions in doing of them. Hypocritical services lay up nothing in 
 heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:3">Isa. lviii. 3</A>);

 the gain of them is gone, when the soul is called for,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:8">Job xxvii. 8</A>.

 But if we have prayed and fasted and given alms in truth and
 uprightness, with an eye to God and to his acceptance, and have 
 approved ourselves to him therein, we have laid up that treasure <I>in 
 heaven; a book of remembrance is written there</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:16">Mal. iii. 16</A>),

 and being there recorded, they shall be there rewarded, and we shall
 meet them again with comfort on the other side death and the grave. 
 Hypocrites are <I>written in the earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:13">Jer. xvii. 13</A>),

 but God's faithful ones have their names <I>written in heaven,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:20">Luke x. 20</A>.

 Acceptance with God is <I>treasure in heaven,</I> which can neither be
 corrupted nor stolen. His <I>well done</I> shall stand for ever; and if 
 we have thus laid up our <I>treasure</I> with him, with him our 
 <I>hearts</I> will be; and where can they be better?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We must take heed of hypocrisy and worldly-mindedness in choosing 
 the <I>end we look at.</I> Our concern as to this is represented by two 
 sorts of eyes which men have, a <I>single eye</I> and an <I>evil 
 eye,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 The expressions here are somewhat dark because concise; we shall 
 therefore take them in some variety of interpretation. <I>The light of 
 the body is the eye,</I> that is plain; <I>the eye</I> is discovering 
 and directing; the <I>light of the world</I> would avail us little 
 without this <I>light of the body;</I> it is <I>the light of the 
 eye</I> that <I>rejoiceth the heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:30">Prov. xv. 30</A>),

 but what is that which is here compared to <I>the eye</I> in the
 <I>body.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>The eye,</I> that is, <I>the heart</I> (so some) if that <I>be 
 single</I>--<B><I>haplous</I></B>--<I>free and bountiful</I> (so the 
 word is frequently rendered, as 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:8,2Co+8:2,9:11,13,Jam+1:5">Rom. xii. 8;
 2 Cor. viii. 2, ix. 11, 13; Jam. i. 5</A>,

 and we read of a <I>bountiful eye,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:9">Prov. xxii. 9</A>).

 If the heart be liberally affected and stand inclined to goodness and
 charity, it will direct the man to Christian actions, the whole 
 conversation <I>will be full of light,</I> full of evidences and 
 instances of true Christianity, that <I>pure religion and undefiled 
 before God and the Father</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:27">Jam. i. 27</A>),

 <I>full of light,</I> of good works, which are our <I>light shining
 before men;</I> but <I>if the heart be evil,</I> covetous, and hard, 
 and envious, griping and grudging (such a temper of mind is often 
 expressed by an <I>evil eye,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:15,Mk+7:22,Pr+7:22"><I>ch.</I> xx. 15; 
 Mark vii. 22; Prov. xxiii. 6, 7</A>),

 <I>the body will be full of darkness,</I> the whole conversation will
 be heathenish and unchristian. <I>The instruments of the churl are</I>
 and always will be <I>evil,</I> but <I>the liberal deviseth liberal
 things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:5-8">Isa. xxxii. 5-8</A>.

 <I>If the light that is in us,</I> those affections which should guide
 us to that which is good, <I>be darkness,</I> if these be corrupt and
 worldly, if there be not so much as good nature in a man, not so much
 as a kind disposition, <I>how great is</I> the corruption of a man, and
 the <I>darkness</I> in which he sits! This sense seems to agree with
 the context; we must <I>lay up treasure in heaven</I> by liberality in
 giving alms, and that not grudgingly but with cheerfulness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:33,2Co+9:7">Luke xii. 33; 2 Cor. ix. 7</A>.

 But these words in the parallel place do not come in upon any such 
 occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:34">Luke xi. 34</A>,

 and therefore the coherence here does not determine that to be the
 sense of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>The eye,</I> that is, <I>the understanding</I> (so some); the 
 practical judgment, the conscience, which is to the other faculties of 
 the soul, as <I>the eye</I> is to the <I>body,</I> to guide and direct 
 their motions; now <I>if this eye be single,</I> if it make a true and 
 right judgment, and discern things that differ, especially in the great 
 concern of <I>laying up the treasure</I> so as to choose aright in 
 that, it will rightly guide the affections and actions, which will all 
 be <I>full of the light</I> of grace and comfort; <I>but if this be 
 evil</I> and corrupt, and instead of leading the inferior powers, is 
 led, and bribed, and biassed by them, if this be erroneous and 
 misinformed, the heart and life must needs be <I>full of darkness,</I> 
 and the whole conversation corrupt. They that <I>will not 
 understand,</I> are said to <I>walk on in darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:5">Ps. lxxxii. 5</A>.

 It is sad when the spirit of a man, that should be <I>the candle of the
 Lord,</I> is an <I>ignis fatuus:</I> when the <I>leaders of the 
 people,</I> the leaders of the faculties, <I>cause them to err,</I> for 
 then <I>they that are led of them are destroyed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:16">Isa. ix. 16</A>.

 An error in the practical judgment is fatal, it is that which calls
 <I>evil good and good evil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:20">Isa. v. 20</A>);

 therefore it concerns us to understand things aright, to get our eyes
 anointed with eye-salve.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>The eye,</I> that is, <I>the aims</I> and <I>intentions;</I> by 
 <I>the eye</I> we set our end before us, the mark we shoot at, the 
 place we go to, we keep that in view, and direct our motion 
 accordingly; in every thing we do in religion; there is something or 
 other that we have in our <I>eye;</I> now <I>if our eye be single,</I> 
 if we aim honestly, fix right ends, and move rightly towards them, if 
 we aim purely and only at the glory of God, seek his honor and favour, 
 and direct all entirely to him, then <I>the eye is single;</I> Paul's 
 was so when he said, <I>To me to live is Christ;</I> and if we be right 
 here, <I>the whole body will be full of light,</I> all the actions will 
 be regular and gracious, pleasing to God and comfortable to ourselves; 
 <I>but if this eye be evil,</I> if, instead of aiming only at the glory 
 of God, and our acceptance with him, we look aside at the applause of 
 men, and while we profess to honour God, contrive to honour ourselves, 
 and seek our own things under colour of <I>seeking the things of 
 Christ,</I> this spoils all, the whole conversation will be perverse 
 and unsteady, and the foundations being thus out of course, there can 
 be nothing but <I>confusion and every evil work</I> in the 
 superstructure. Draw the lines from the circumference to any other 
 point but the centre, and they will cross. <I>If the light that is in 
 thee be</I> not only dim, but <I>darkness</I> itself, it is a 
 fundamental error, and destructive to all that follows. The end 
 specifies the action. It is of the last importance in religion, that we 
 be right in our aims, and make <I>eternal things,</I> not 
 <I>temporal,</I> our scope, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:18">2 Cor. iv. 18</A>.

 The hypocrite is like the waterman, that looks one way and rows
 another; the true Christian like the traveller, that has his journey's 
 end in his eye. The hypocrite soars like the kite, with his eye upon 
 the prey below, which he is ready to come down to when he has a fair 
 opportunity; the true Christian soars like the lark, higher and higher, 
 forgetting the things that are beneath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We must take heed of hypocrisy and worldly-mindedness in choosing 
 the master we serve, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 <I>No man can serve two masters.</I> Serving <I>two masters</I> is
 contrary to <I>the single eye;</I> for <I>the eye</I> will be to the 
 master's hand,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+123:1,2">Ps. cxxiii. 1, 2</A>.

 Our Lord Jesus here exposes the cheat which those put upon their own 
 souls, who think to divide between God and the world, to have a 
 <I>treasure on earth,</I> and a <I>treasure in heaven</I> too, to 
 please God and please men too. Why not? says the hypocrite; it is good
 to have two strings to one's bow. They hope to make their religion 
 serve their secular interest, and so turn to account both ways. The 
 pretending mother was for dividing the child; the Samaritans will 
 compound between God and idols. No, says Christ, this will not do; it 
 is but a supposition that <I>gain is godliness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:5">1 Tim. vi. 5</A>.

 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A general maxim laid down; it is likely it was a proverb among the 
 Jews, <I>No man can serve two masters,</I> much less two gods; for 
 their commands will some time or other cross or contradict one another, 
 and their occasions interfere. While <I>two masters</I> go together, a 
 servant may follow them both; but when they part, you will see to which 
 he belongs; he cannot love, and observe, and cleave to both as he 
 should. If to the one, not to the other; either this or that must be 
 comparatively hated and despised. This truth is plain enough in common 
 cases.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The application of it to the business in hand. <I>Ye cannot serve 
 God and Mammon.</I> <I>Mammon</I> is a Syriac word, that signifies 
 gain; so that whatever in this world is, or is accounted by us to be, 
 <I>gain</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:7">Phil. iii. 7</A>),

 is <I>mammon. Whatever is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the
 lust of the eye, and the pride of life,</I> is <I>mammon.</I> To some 
 their belly is their <I>mammon,</I> and they serve that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:19">Phil. iii. 19</A>);

 to others their ease, their sleep, their sports and pastimes, are their
 <I>mammon</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:9">Prov. vi. 9</A>);

 to others worldly riches

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:13">James iv. 13</A>);

 to others honours and preferments; the praise and applause of men was
 the Pharisees' <I>mammon;</I> in a word, self, the unity in which the 
 world's trinity centres, sensual, secular self, is the <I>mammon</I> 
 which cannot be served in conjunction with <I>God;</I> for if it be 
 served, it is in competition with him and in contradiction to him. He 
 does not say, We <I>must</I> not or we <I>should</I> not, but we 
 <I>cannot serve God and Mammon;</I> we <I>cannot</I> love both

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:15,Jam+4:4">1 John ii. 15; Jam. iv. 4</A>);

 or hold to both, or hold by both in observance, obedience, attendance,
 trust, and dependence, for they are contrary the one to the other. 
 <I>God</I> says, "<I>My son, give me thy heart.</I>" <I>Mammon</I> 
 says, "No, give it me." <I>God</I> says, "<I>Be content with such 
 things as ye have.</I>" <I>Mammon</I> says, "Grasp at all that ever 
 thou canst. <I>Rem, rem, quocunque modo rem--Money, money; by fair
 means or by foul, money.</I>" <I>God</I> says, "Defraud not, never lie, 
 be honest and just in all thy dealings." <I>Mammon</I> says "Cheat 
 thine own Father, if thou canst gain by it." <I>God</I> says, "Be 
 charitable." <I>Mammon</I> says, "Hold thy own: this giving undoes us 
 all." <I>God</I> says, "<I>Be careful for nothing.</I>" <I>Mammon</I> 
 says, "Be careful for every thing." <I>God</I> says, "<I>Keep holy thy 
 sabbath-day.</I>" <I>Mammon</I> says, "Make use of that day as well as 
 any other for the world." Thus inconsistent are the commands of <I>God 
 and Mammon,</I> so that we <I>cannot serve</I> both. Let us not then

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life,
 what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
 what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the
 body than raiment?
 &nbsp; 26  Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do
 they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father
 feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
 &nbsp; 27  Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his
 stature?
 &nbsp; 28  And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of
 the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
 &nbsp; 29  And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory
 was not arrayed like one of these.
 &nbsp; 30  Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to
 day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, <I>shall he</I> not much
 more <I>clothe</I> you, O ye of little faith?
 &nbsp; 31  Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or,
 What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
 &nbsp; 32  (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
 heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
 &nbsp; 33  But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
 and all these things shall be added unto you.
 &nbsp; 34  Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow
 shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the
 day <I>is</I> the evil thereof.

 There is scarcely any one sin against which our Lord Jesus more largely 
 and earnestly warns his disciples, or against which he arms them with 
 more variety of arguments, than the sin of disquieting, distracting, 
 distrustful cares about the things of life, which are a bad sign that 
 both the <I>treasure</I> and the heart are <I>on the earth;</I> and 
 therefore he thus largely insists upon it. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prohibition laid down. It is the counsel and command of the Lord 
 Jesus, that we <I>take no thought</I> about the things of this world; 
 <I>I say unto you.</I> He says it as our Lawgiver, and the Sovereign of 
 our hearts; he says it as our Comforter, and the Helper of our joy. 
 What is it that he says? It is this, and <I>he that hath ears to hear, 
 let him hear it. Take no thought for your life, nor yet for your 
 body</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>).
 
 <I>Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>)
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 <I>Take no thought,</I> <B><I>me merimnate</I></B>--<I>Be not in 
 care.</I> As against hypocrisy, so against worldly cares, the caution 
 is thrice repeated, and yet no vain repetition: <I>precept</I> must be 
 <I>upon precept, and line upon line,</I> to the same purport, and all 
 little enough; it is a <I>sin which doth so easily beset us.</I> It 
 intimates how pleasing it is to Christ, and of how much concern it is 
 to ourselves, that we should live without carefulness. It is the 
 repeated command of the Lord Jesus to his disciples, that they should 
 not divide and pull in pieces their own minds with care about the 
 world. There is a <I>thought</I> concerning the things of this life, 
 which is not only lawful, but duty, such as is commended in the 
 virtuous woman. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:23">Prov. xxvii. 23</A>.

 The word is used concerning Paul's care of the churches, and Timothy's
 care for the state of souls,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:28,Php+2:20">2 Cor. xi. 28; Phil. ii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But the <I>thought</I> here forbidden is, 

 1. A disquieting, tormenting <I>thought,</I> which hurries the mind
 hither and thither, and hangs it in suspense; which disturbs our joy in 
 God, and is a damp upon our hope in him; which breaks the sleep, and 
 hinders our enjoyment of ourselves, of our friends, and of what God has 
 given us. 

 2. A distrustful, unbelieving <I>thought.</I> God has promised to 
 provide for those that are his all things needful for life as well as 
 godliness, <I>the life that now is,</I> food and a covering: not 
 dainties, but necessaries. He never said, "They shall be feasted," but, 
 "<I>Verily, they shall be fed.</I>" Now an inordinate care for time to 
 come, and fear of wanting those supplies, spring from a disbelief of 
 these promises, and of the wisdom and goodness of Divine Providence; 
 and that is the evil of it. As to present sustenance, we may and must
 use lawful means to get it, else we tempt God; we must be diligent in 
 our callings, and prudent in proportioning our expenses to what we 
 have, and we must pray for <I>daily bread;</I> and if all other means 
 fail, we may and must ask relief of those that are able to give it. He 
 was none of the best of men that said, <I>To beg I am ashamed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:3">Luke xvi. 3</A>);
 
 as he was, who
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 <I>desired to be fed with the crumbs;</I> but for the future, we must 
 <I>cast our care upon God,</I> and <I>take no thought,</I> because it 
 looks like a jealousy of God, who knows how to give what we want when 
 we know not how to get it. Let our souls dwell at ease in him! This
 gracious carelessness is the same with that sleep which God gives to 
 his beloved, in opposition to the worldling's toil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:2">Ps. cxxvii. 2</A>.

 Observe the cautions here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Take no thought for your life.</I> Life is our greatest concern 
 for this world; <I>All that a man has will he give for his life;</I> 
 yet take no thought about it. 

 [1.] Not about the <I>continuance</I> of it; refer it to God to 
 <I>lengthen</I> or <I>shorten</I> it as he pleases; <I>my times are in 
 thy hand,</I> and they are in a good hand.

 [2.] Not about the <I>comforts</I> of this life; refer it to God to 
 embitter or sweeten it as he pleases. We must not be solicitous, no not 
 about the necessary support of this life, <I>food</I> and 
 <I>raiment;</I> these God has promised, and therefore we may more 
 confidently expect; say not, <I>What shall we eat?</I> It is the 
 language of one at a loss, and almost despairing; whereas, though many 
 good people have the prospect of little, yet there are few but have 
 present support.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Take no thought for the morrow,</I> for the time to come. Be 
 not solicitous for the future, how you shall live next year, or when 
 you are old, or what you shall leave behind you. As we must not 
 <I>boast</I> of to-morrow, so we must not <I>care for</I> to-morrow, or 
 the events of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reasons and arguments to enforce this prohibition. One would 
 think the command of Christ was enough to restrain us from this foolish 
 sin of disquieting, distrustful care, independently of the comfort of 
 our own souls, which is so nearly concerned; but to show how much the 
 heart of Christ is upon it, and what <I>pleasures he takes</I> in those 
 that <I>hope in his mercy,</I> the command is backed with the most 
 powerful arguments. If reason may but rule us, surely we shall ease 
 ourselves of these thorns. To free us from anxious thoughts, and to 
 expel them, Christ here suggests to us <I>comforting</I> thoughts, that 
 we may be filled with them. It will be worth while to take pains with 
 our own hearts, to argue them out of their disquieting cares, and to 
 make ourselves ashamed of them. They may be weakened by right reason, 
 but it is by an active faith only that they can be overcome. Consider 
 then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Yes, no doubt it is; so he says who had reason to understand the true
 value of present things, for he made them, he supports them, and 
 supports us by them; and the thing speaks for itself. Note,

 (1.) Our <I>life</I> is a greater blessing than our <I>livelihood.</I> 
 It is true, life cannot subsist without a livelihood; but the meat and 
 raiment which are here represented as inferior to the life and body are 
 such as are for ornament and delight; for about such as are for 
 ornament ad delight; for about such we are apt to be solicitous. Meat 
 and raiment are in order to life, and the <I>end</I> is more noble and 
 excellent than the <I>means.</I> The daintiest food and finest raiment 
 are from the <I>earth,</I> but life from the <I>breath of God.</I> Life 
 is the <I>light of men;</I> meat is but the <I>oil</I> that feeds that 
 light: so that the difference between rich and poor is very 
 inconsiderable, since, in the greatest things, they stand on the same 
 level, and differ only in the less. 

 (2.) This is an encouragement to us to trust God for <I>food</I> and 
 <I>raiment,</I> and so to ease ourselves of all perplexing cares about 
 them. God has given us life, and given us the body; it was an act of 
 power, it was an act of favour, it was done without our care: what 
 cannot he do for us, who did that?--what will he not? If we take care 
 about our souls and eternity, which are more than the body, and its 
 life, we may leave it to God to provide for us food and raiment, which 
 are less. God has maintained our lives hitherto; if sometimes with 
 pulse and water, that has answered the end; he has protected us and 
 kept us alive. He that guards us against the evils we are exposed to, 
 will supply us with the <I>good things</I> we are in need of. If he had 
 been pleased to kill us, to starve us, he would not so often have 
 <I>given his angels a charge concerning us</I> to keep us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>Behold the fowls of the air,</I> and <I>consider the lilies of 
 the field.</I> Here is an argument taken from God's common providence 
 toward the inferior creatures, and their dependence, according to their 
 capacities, upon that providence. A fine pass fallen man has come to, 
 that he must be sent to school to the <I>fowls of the air,</I> and that 
 they must <I>teach him!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:7,8">Job xii. 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Look upon the <I>fowls,</I> and learn to trust God <I>for food</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and disquiet not yourselves with thoughts <I>what you shall 
 eat.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Observe the providence of God concerning them. Look upon them, and 
 receive instruction. There are various sorts of fowls; they are 
 numerous, some of them ravenous, but they are all fed, and fed with 
 food convenient for them; it is rare that any of them perish for want 
 of food, even in winter, and there goes no little to feed them all the 
 year round. The fowls, as they are least serviceable to man, so they 
 are least within his care; men often feed upon them, but seldom feed 
 them; yet they are fed, we know not how, and some of them fed best in 
 the hardest weather; and it is <I>your heavenly Father that feeds 
 them;</I> he <I>knows all the wild fowls of the mountains,</I> better 
 than you know the tame ones at your own barn-door, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:11">Ps. l. 11</A>.

 Not a sparrow lights to the ground, to pick up a grain of corn, but by
 the providence of God, which extends itself to the meanest creatures. 
 But that which is especially observed here is, that they are fed 
 without any care or project of their own; <I>they sow not, neither do 
 they reap, nor gather into barns.</I> The ant indeed does, and the bee, 
 and they are set before us as examples of prudence and industry; but 
 the fowls of the air do not; they make no provision for the future 
 themselves, and yet every day, as duly as the day comes, provision is 
 made for them, and their <I>eyes wait on God,</I> that great and good 
 Housekeeper, who <I>provides food for all flesh.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Improve this for your encouragement to trust in God. <I>Are ye not 
 much better than they?</I> Yes, certainly you are. Note, The 
 <I>heirs</I> of heaven are much better than the <I>fowls</I> of heaven; 
 nobler and more excellent beings, and, by faith, they soar higher; they 
 are of a better nature and nurture, <I>wiser than the fowls of 
 heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:11">Job xxxv. 11</A>):

 though the children of this world, that <I>know not the judgment of the
 Lord,</I> are not so wise as <I>the stork, and the crane, and the 
 swallow</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:7">Jer. viii. 7</A>),

 you are dearer to God, and nearer, though they fly in the open
 firmament of heaven. He is their Master and Lord, their Owner and 
 Master; but besides all this, he is your Father, and in his account 
 <I>ye are of more value than many sparrows;</I> you are his children, 
 his first-born; now he that feeds his birds surely will not starve his 
 babes. They trust your Father's providence, and will not you trust it? 
 In dependence upon that, they are careless for the morrow; and being 
 so, they live the merriest lives of all creatures; they <I>sing among 
 the branches</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:12">Ps. civ. 12</A>),
 
 and, to the best of their power, they praise their Creator. If we were,
 by faith, as unconcerned about the morrow as they are, we should sing 
 as cheerfully as they do; for it is worldly care that mars our mirth 
 and damps our joy, and silences our praise, as much as any thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Look upon the <I>lilies,</I> and learn to trust God for 
 <I>raiment.</I> That is another part of our care, <I>what we shall put 
 on;</I> for decency, to cover us; for defence, to keep us warm; yea, 
 and, with many, for dignity and ornament, to make them look great and 
 fine; and so much concerned are they for gaiety and variety in their 
 clothing, that this care returns almost as often as that for their 
 daily bread. Now to ease us of this care, let us <I>consider the lilies 
 of the field;</I> not only <I>look upon</I> them (every eye does that
 with pleasure), but <I>consider</I> them. Note, There is a great deal 
 of good to be learned from what we see every day, if we would but 
 consider it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:6,24:32">Prov. vi. 6; xxiv. 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Consider how <I>frail</I> the lilies are; they are the <I>grass of 
 the field.</I> Lilies, though distinguished by their colours, are still 
 but <I>grass.</I> Thus <I>all flesh is grass:</I> though some in the 
 endowments of body and mind are as lilies, much admired, still they are 
 grass; the grass of the field in nature and constitution; they stand 
 upon the same level with others. Man's days, at best, are <I>as 
 grass,</I> as the <I>flower of the grass</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:24">1 Pet. i. 24</A>.

 This grass <I>to-day is,</I> and <I>to-morrow is cast into the
 oven;</I> in a little while the place that <I>knows us</I> will <I>know 
 us no more.</I> The grave is the oven into which we shall be cast, and 
 in which we shall be consumed as grass in the fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14">Ps. xlix. 14</A>.

 This intimates a reason why we should not take thought for the morrow,
 what we shall put on, because perhaps, by to-morrow, we may have 
 occasion for our grave-clothes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Consider how <I>free from care</I> the lilies are: they <I>toil 
 not</I> as men do, to earn clothing; as servants, to earn their 
 liveries; <I>neither do they spin,</I> as women do, to make clothing. 
 It does not follow that we must therefore neglect, or do carelessly, 
 the proper business of this life; it is the praise of the virtuous 
 woman, that <I>she lays her hand to the spindle, makes fine linen and 
 sells it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:19,24">Prov. xxxi. 19, 24</A>.

 Idleness <I>tempts</I> God, instead of <I>trusting</I> him; but he that
 provides for inferior creatures, without their labour, will much more 
 provide for us, by blessing our labour, which he has made our duty. And 
 if we should, through sickness, be unable to <I>toil</I> and 
 <I>spin,</I> God can furnish us with what is necessary for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Consider how <I>fair,</I> how <I>fine</I> the lilies are; <I>how 
 they grow;</I> what they <I>grow from.</I> The root of the lily or 
 tulip, as other bulbous roots, is, in winter, lost and buried under 
 ground, yet, when spring returns, it appears, and starts up in a little 
 time; hence it is promised to God's Israel, that they should grow <I>as 
 the lily,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:5">Hos. xiv. 5</A>.

 Consider what they <I>grow to.</I> Out of that obscurity in a few weeks
 they come to be so very gay, that even <I>Solomon, in all his glory, 
 was not arrayed like one of these.</I> The array of Solomon was very 
 splendid and magnificent: he that had the peculiar treasure of kings 
 and provinces, and studiously affected pomp and gallantry, doubtless 
 had the richest clothing, and the best made up, that could be got; 
 especially when he appeared in his glory on high days. And yet, let him 
 dress himself as fine as he could, he comes far short of the beauty of 
 the lilies, and a bed of tulips outshines him. Let us, therefore, be
 ambitious of the <I>wisdom</I> of Solomon, in which he was outdone by 
 none (wisdom to do our duty in our places), rather than the 
 <I>glory</I> of Solomon, in which he was outdone by the lilies. 
 Knowledge and grace are the perfection of man, not beauty, much less 
 fine clothes. Now God is here said thus to <I>clothe the grass of the 
 field.</I> Note, All the excellences of the creature flow from God, the 
 Fountain and spring of them. It was he that gave the horse his 
 strength, and the lily its beauty; every creature is in itself, as well 
 as to us, what he makes it to be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] Consider how instructive all this is to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> As to <I>fine</I> clothing, this teaches us not to care 
 for it at all, not to covet it, nor to be proud of it, not to make the 
 <I>putting on of apparel</I> our <I>adorning,</I> for after all our 
 care in this the lilies will far outdo us; we cannot dress so fine as 
 they do, why then should we attempt to vie with them? Their adorning 
 will soon perish, and so will ours; they fade--<I>are to-day,</I> and 
 <I>to-morrow are cast,</I> as other rubbish, <I>into the oven;</I> and 
 the clothes we are proud of are wearing out, the gloss is soon gone, 
 the color fades, the shape goes out of fashion, or in awhile the 
 garment itself is worn out; such is man in all his pomp 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:6,7">Isa. xl. 6, 7</A>),
 
 especially rich men
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:10">Jam. i. 10</A>);

 they <I>fade away in their ways.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> As to <I>necessary</I> clothing; this teaches us to 
 cast the care of it upon God--Jehovah-jireh; trust him that clothes the 
 lilies, to provide for you what you shall <I>put on.</I> If he give 
 such fine clothes to the grass, much more will he give fitting clothes 
 to his own children; clothes that shall be warm upon them, not only 
 <I>when he quieteth the earth with the south wind,</I> but when he 
 disquiets it with the <I>north wind,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:17">Job xxxvii. 17</A>.

 He shall much more clothe you: for you are nobler creatures, of a more
 excellent being; if so he clothe the short-lived grass, much more will 
 he clothe you that are made for immortality. Even the children of 
 Nineveh are preferred before the gourd

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+4:10,11">Jonah iv. 10, 11</A>),

 much more the sons of Zion, that are in covenant with God. Observe the
 title he gives them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 <I>O ye of little faith.</I> This may be taken,

 1. As an encouragement to truth faith, though it be but weak; it
 entitles us to the divine care, and a promise of suitable supply. Great 
 faith shall be commended, and shall procure great things, but little 
 faith shall not be rejected, even that shall procure food and raiment. 
 <I>Sound</I> believers shall be provided for, though they be not 
 <I>strong</I> believers. The babes in the family are fed and clothed, 
 as well as those that are grown up, and with a special care and 
 tenderness; say not, I am but a child, but a dry tree 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:3,5">Isa. lvi. 3, 5</A>),
 
 for though <I>poor and needy</I> yet <I>the Lord thinketh on thee.</I>
 Or, 
 
 2. It is rather a rebuke to weak faith, though it be true,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:31"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 31</A>.

 It intimates what is at the bottom of all our inordinate care and
 thoughtfulness; it is owing to the weakness of our faith, and the 
 remains of unbelief in us. If we had but more faith, we should have 
 less care.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>Which of you,</I> the wisest, the strongest of you, <I>by taking 
 thought, can add one cubit to his stature?</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>)

 to <I>his age,</I> so some; but the measure of a cubit denotes it to be 
 meant of the stature, and the age at longest is but a span,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:5">Ps. xxxix. 5</A>.

 Let us consider,

 (1.) We did not arrive at the stature we are of by our own care and
 thought, but by the providence of God. An infant of a span long has 
 grown up to be a man of six feet, and how was one cubit after another 
 added to his stature? not by his own forecast or contrivance; he grew 
 he knew not how, by the power and goodness of God. Now he that made our 
 bodies, and made them of such size, surely will take care to provide 
 for them. Note, God is to be acknowledged in the increase of our bodily 
 strength and stature, and to be trusted for all needful supplies, 
 because he has made it to appear, that he is mindful for the body. The 
 growing age is the thoughtless, careless age, yet we grow; and shall 
 not he who reared us to this, provide for us now we are reared? 

 (2.) We cannot alter the stature we are of, if we would: what a foolish 
 and ridiculous thing would it be for a man of low stature to perplex 
 himself, to break his sleep, and beat his brains, about it, and to be 
 continually taking thought how he might be a cubit higher; when, after 
 all, he knows he cannot effect it, and therefore he had better be 
 content and take it as it is! We are not all of a size, yet the 
 difference in stature between one and another is not material, nor of 
 any great account; a little man is ready to wish he were as tall as 
 such a one, but he knows it is to no purpose, and therefore does as 
 well as he can with it. Now as we do in reference to our bodily 
 stature, so we should do in reference to our worldly estate.

 [1.] We should not covet an abundance of the wealth of this world, any 
 more than we would covet the addition of a cubit to one's stature, 
 which is a great deal in a man's height; it is enough to grow by 
 inches; such an addition would but make one unwieldy, and a burden to 
 one's self.

 [2.] We must reconcile ourselves to our state, as we do to our stature; 
 we must set the conveniences against the inconveniences, and so make a 
 virtue of necessity: what cannot be remedied must be made the best of.
 We cannot alter the disposals of Providence, and therefore must 
 acquiesce in them, accommodate ourselves to them, and relieve 
 ourselves, as well as we can, against inconveniences, as Zaccheus 
 against the inconvenience of his stature, by climbing into the 
 tree.</P>

 4. <I>After all these things do the Gentiles seek,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 Thoughtfulness about the world is a <I>heathenish</I> sin, and
 unbecoming <I>Christians.</I> The <I>Gentiles</I> seek <I>these 
 things,</I> because they know not <I>better things;</I> they are eager 
 for this world, because they are strangers to a better; they seek these 
 things with care and anxiety, because they are <I>without God in the 
 world,</I> and understand not his providence. They fear and worship 
 their idols, but know not how to trust them for deliverance and supply, 
 and, therefore, are themselves full of care; but it is a shame for 
 Christians, who build upon nobler principles, and profess a religion 
 which teaches them not only that there is a Providence, but that there 
 are promises made to the good of the life that now is, which teaches 
 them a confidence in God and a contempt of the world, and gives such 
 reasons for both; it is a shame for them to walk as Gentiles walk, and 
 to fill their heads and hearts with these things.</P>

 5. <I>Your heavenly Father knows ye have need of all these things;</I> 
 these necessary things, food and raiment; he knows our wants better 
 than we do ourselves; though he be in heaven, and his children on 
 earth, he observes what the least and poorest of them has occasion for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:9">Rev. ii. 9</A>),

 <I>I know thy poverty.</I> You think, if such a good friend did not but
 know your wants and straits, you would soon have relief: your God knows
 them; and he is your Father that loves you and pities you, and is ready
 to help you; your heavenly Father, who has wherewithal to supply all
 your needs: away, therefore, with all disquieting thoughts and cares;
 go to thy Father; tell him, <I>he knows that thou has need of such and
 such things;</I> he asks you, <I>Children, have you any meat?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:5">John xxi. 5</A>.

 Tell him whether you have or have not. Though he knows our wants, he
 will know them from us; and when we have opened them to him, let us 
 cheerfully refer ourselves to his wisdom, power, and goodness, for our 
 supply. Therefore, we should ease ourselves of the burthen of care, by 
 casting it upon God, because it is he <I>that careth for us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:7">1 Pet. v. 7</A>),

 and what needs all this ado? If he care, why should be care?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. <I>Seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all 
 these things shall be added unto you.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Here is a double argument against the sin of <I>thoughtfulness;</I>
 <I>take no thought</I> for your life, the life of the body; for,

 (1.) You have greater and better things to take thought about, the life
 of your soul, your eternal happiness; that is the <I>one thing
 needful</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:42">Luke x. 42</A>),

 about which you should employ your thoughts, and which is commonly
 neglected in those hearts wherein worldly cares have the ascendant. If 
 we were but more careful to please God, and to work out our own 
 salvation, we should be less solicitous to please ourselves, and work 
 out an estate in the world. Thoughtfulness for our souls is the most
 effectual cure of thoughtfulness for the world. 

 (2.) You have a surer and easier, a safer and more compendious way to 
 obtain the necessaries of this life, than by carking, and caring, and 
 fretting about them; and that is, by <I>seeking first the kingdom of 
 God,</I> and making religion your business: say not that this is the 
 way to starve, no, it is the way to be well provided for, even in this 
 world. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The great duty required: it is the sum and substance of our whole 
 duty: "<I>Seek first the kingdom of God,</I> mind religion as your 
 great and principle concern." Our duty is to seek; to desire, pursue, 
 and aim at these things; it is a word that has in it much of the 
 constitution of the new covenant in favour of us; <I>though we have not 
 attained,</I> but in many things fail and come short, sincere seeking 
 (a careful concern and an earnest endeavor) is accepted. Now observe, 
 <I>First,</I> The object of this seeking; <I>The kingdom of God, and 
 his righteousness;</I> we must mind heaven as our end, and holiness as 
 our way. "Seek the comforts of the kingdom of grace and glory as your 
 felicity. Aim at the <I>kingdom of heaven;</I> press towards it; give 
 diligence to make it sure; resolve not to take up short of it; seek for 
 this glory, honour, and immortality; prefer heaven and heavenly 
 blessings far before earth and earthly delights." We make nothing of 
 our religion, if we do not make heaven of it. And with the
 <I>happiness</I> of this kingdom, seek the <I>righteousness</I> of it; 
 <I>God's righteousness,</I> the righteousness which he requires to be 
 wrought <I>in</I> us, and wrought <I>by</I> us, such as exceeds that of 
 the scribes and Pharisees; we must <I>follow peace and holiness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:14">Heb. xii. 14</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> The order of it. <I>Seek first the kingdom of God.</I>
 Let your care for your souls and another world take the place of all 
 other cares: and let all the concerns of this life be made subordinate 
 to those of the life to come: we must seek the things of Christ more 
 than our own things; and if ever they come in competition, we must
 remember to which we are to give the preference. "Seek these things 
 <I>first;</I> first in thy days: let the morning of thy youth be 
 dedicated to God. Wisdom must be sought early; it is good beginning 
 betimes to be religious. Seek the first every day; let waking thoughts 
 be of God." Let this be our principle, to do that first which is most 
 needful, and let him that is the First, have the first.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The gracious promise annexed; <I>all these things,</I> the 
 necessary supports of life, <I>shall be added unto you;</I> shall be 
 <I>given over and above;</I> so it is in the margin. You shall have 
 what you seek, the <I>kingdom of God and his righteousness,</I> for 
 never any sought <I>in vain,</I> that sought <I>in earnest;</I> and 
 besides that, you shall have food and raiment, by way of overplus; as 
 he that buys goods has paper and packthread given him in the bargain.
 <I>Godliness has the promise of the life that now is,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:8">1 Tim. iv. 8</A>.
 
 Solomon asked wisdom, and had that and other things added to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:11,12">2 Chron. i. 11, 12</A>.

 O what a blessed change would it make in our hearts and lives, did we
 but firmly believe this truth, that the best way to be comfortably 
 provided for in this world, is to be most intent upon another world! We 
 then begin at the right end of our work, when we begin with God. If we 
 give diligence to make sure to ourselves the kingdom of God and the 
 righteousness thereof, as to all the things of this life, 
 Jehovah-jireh--the Lord will provide as much of them as he sees good 
 for us, and more we would not wish for. Have we trusted in him for the 
 <I>portion of our inheritance</I> at our end, and shall we not trust 
 him for the <I>portion of our cup,</I> in the way to it? God's Israel
 were not only brought to Canaan at last, but had their charges borne 
 through the wilderness. O that we were more thoughtful about the things 
 that are not seen, that are eternal, and then the less thoughtful we 
 should be, and the less thoughtful we should need to be, about the 
 things that are seen, that are temporal! <I>Also regard not your 
 stuff,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+45:20,23">Gen. xlv. 20, 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. <I>The morrow shall take thought for the things of itself:</I>
 <I>sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 We must not perplex ourselves inordinately about future events, because
 every day brings along with it its own burthen of cares and grievances, 
 as, if we look about us, and suffer not our fears to betray the 
 succours which grace and reason offer, it brings along with it its own 
 strength and supply too. So that we are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That <I>thoughtfulness</I> for the morrow is <I>needless;</I>
 <I>Let the morrow take thought for the things of itself.</I> If wants
 and troubles be renewed with the day, there are aids and provisions
 renewed likewise; <I>compassions,</I> that are <I>new every
 morning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:22,23">Lam. iii. 22, 23</A>.

 The saints have a Friend that is <I>their arm every morning,</I> and
 gives out fresh supplies daily

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:2">Isa. xxxiii. 2</A>),
 
 according <I>as the business of every day requires</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:4">Ezra iii. 4</A>),

 and so he keeps his people in constant dependence upon him. Let us
 refer it therefore to the morrow's strength, to do the morrow's work, 
 and bear the morrow's burthen. To-morrow, and the things of it, will be 
 provided for without us; why need we anxiously care for that which is 
 so wisely cared for already? This does not forbid a prudent foresight, 
 and preparation accordingly, but a perplexing solicitude, and a 
 prepossession of difficulties and calamities, which may perhaps never 
 come, or if they do, may be easily borne, and the evil of them guarded 
 against. The meaning is, let us <I>mind present duty,</I> and then 
 <I>leave events to God;</I> do the <I>work of the day in its day,</I> 
 and then let <I>to-morrow bring its work along with it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That thoughtfulness for the morrow is one of those <I>foolish and 
 hurtful lusts,</I> which those that will be rich fall into, and one of 
 the <I>many sorrows,</I> wherewith they <I>pierce themselves through. 
 Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</I> This present day has 
 trouble enough attending it, we need not <I>accumulate</I> burthens by 
 <I>anticipating</I> our trouble, nor borrow perplexities from 
 to-morrow's evils to add to those of this day. It is uncertain what 
 to-morrow's evils may be, but whatever they be, it is time enough to 
 take thought about them when they come. What a folly it is to take that 
 trouble upon ourselves this day by care and fear, which belongs to 
 another day, and will be never the lighter when it comes? Let us not 
 pull that upon ourselves all together at once, which Providence has 
 wisely ordered to be borne by parcels. The conclusion of this whole 
 matter then is, that it is the will and command of the Lord Jesus, that 
 his disciples should not be their own tormentors, nor make their 
 passage through this world more dark and unpleasant, by their 
 apprehension of troubles, than God has made it by the troubles 
 themselves. By our daily prayers we may procure strength to bear us up 
 under our daily troubles, and to arm us against the temptations that 
 attend them, and then let none of these things move us.</P>
