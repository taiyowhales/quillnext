 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter continues and concludes our Saviour's discourse, which 
 began in the foregoing chapter, concerning his second coming and the 
 end of the world. This was his farewell sermon of caution, as that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:15,16">John xiv. 15, 16</A>,

 was of comfort to his disciples; and they had need of both in a world
 of so much temptation and trouble as this is. The application of that
 discourse, was, Watch therefore, and be ye also ready. Now, in
 prosecution of these serious awakening cautions, in this chapter we
 have three parables, the scope of which is the same--to quicken us all
 with the utmost care and diligence to get ready for Christ's second
 coming, which, in all his farewells to his church, mention was made of,
 as in that before he died 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:2">John xiv. 2</A>),
 
 in that at his ascension

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:11">Acts i. 11</A>),

 and in that at the shutting up of the canon of the scriptures,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:20">Rev. xxii. 20</A>.

 Now it concerns us to prepare for Christ's coming;

 I. That we may then be ready to attend upon him; and this is shown in
 the parable of the ten virgins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:1-13">ver. 1-13</A>.

 II. That we may then be ready to give u our account to him; and this is
 shown in the parable of the three servants,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:14-30">ver. 14-30</A>.

 III. That we may then be ready to receive from him our final sentence,
 and that it may be to eternal life; and this is shown in a more plain
 description of the process of the last judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:31-46">ver. 31-46</A>.

 These are things of awful consideration, because of everlasting concern
 to every one of us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,
 which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
 &nbsp; 2  And five of them were wise, and five <I>were</I> foolish.
 &nbsp; 3  They that <I>were</I> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil
 with them:
 &nbsp; 4  But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
 &nbsp; 5  While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
 &nbsp; 6  And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
 cometh; go ye out to meet him.
 &nbsp; 7  Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
 &nbsp; 8  And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for
 our lamps are gone out.
 &nbsp; 9  But the wise answered, saying, <I>Not so;</I> lest there be not
 enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and
 buy for yourselves.
 &nbsp; 10  And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they
 that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door
 was shut.
 &nbsp; 11  Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
 open to us.
 &nbsp; 12  But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you
 not.
 &nbsp; 13  Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
 wherein the Son of man cometh.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That in general which is to be illustrated is, <I>the kingdom of
 heaven,</I> the state of things under the gospel, the external kingdom
 of Christ, and the administration and success of it. Some of Christ's
 parables had shown us what it is like now in the present reception of
 it, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:1-52"><I>ch.</I> xiii.</A>

 This tells us what it shall be like, when the mystery of God shall be 
 finished, and that kingdom delivered up to the Father. The 
 administration of Christ's government, towards the ready and the 
 unready in the great day, may be illustrated by this similitude; or the 
 kingdom is put for the subjects of the kingdom. The professors of 
 Christianity shall then be likened to these ten virgins, and shall be 
 thus distinguished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That by which it is illustrated, is, a marriage solemnity. It was a 
 custom sometimes used among the Jews on that occasion, that the 
 bridegroom came, attended with his friends, late in the night, to the 
 house of the bride, where she expected him, attended with her 
 bride-maids; who, upon notice given of the bridegrooms' approach, were 
 to go out with lamps in their hands, to light him into the house with 
 ceremony and formality, in order to the celebrating of the nuptials 
 with great mirth. And some think that on these occasions they had 
 usually <I>ten virgins;</I> for the Jews never held a synagogue, 
 circumcised, kept the passover, or contracted marriage, but ten persons 
 at least were present. Boaz, when he married Ruth, had <I>ten 
 witnesses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:2">Ruth iv. 2</A>.
 
 Now in this parable,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The <I>Bridegroom</I> is our Lord Jesus Christ; he is so represented 
 in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1-17">45th Psalm</A>,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:1-8:14">Solomon's Song</A>,

 and often in the New Testament. It bespeaks his singular and
 superlative love to, and his faithful and inviolable covenant with, his 
 spouse the church. Believers are now betrothed to Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:19">Hos. ii. 19</A>);

 but the solemnizing of the marriage is reserved for the great day, when
 the bride, the Lamb's wife, will have made herself completely ready,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:7,9">Rev. xix. 7, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The virgins are the professors of religion, members of the church; 
 but here represented as <I>her companions</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:14">Ps. xlv. 14</A>),

 as elsewhere her <I>children</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1">Isa. liv. 1</A>),
 
 her <I>ornaments,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:18">Isa. xlix. 18</A>.

 They that follow the Lamb, are said to be <I>virgins</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:4">Rev. xiv. 4</A>);

 this denotes their beauty and purity; they are to be presented as
 chaste <I>virgins to Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:2">2 Cor. xi. 2</A>.

 The bridegroom is a king; so these virgins are <I>maids of honour,</I>
 virgins <I>without number</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:8">Cant. vi. 8</A>),

 yet here said to be <I>ten.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The office of these virgins is to meet the bridegroom, which is as 
 much their happiness as their duty. They come to wait <I>upon</I> the 
 bridegroom when he appears, and in the mean time to wait <I>for</I> 
 him. See here the nature of Christianity. As Christians, we profess
 ourselves to be, 

 (1.) Attendants upon Christ, to do him honour, as the glorious 
 Bridegroom, to be to him for a name and a praise, especially then when 
 he shall come to be glorified in his saints. We must follow him as 
 honorary servants do their masters, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:26">John xii. 26</A>.

 Hold up the name, and hold forth the praise of the exalted Jesus; this
 is our business.

 (2.) Expectants of Christ, and of his second coming. As Christians, we
 profess, not only to believe and look for, but to love and long for, 
 the appearing of Christ, and to act in our whole conversation with a 
 regard to it. The second coming of Christ is the centre in which all 
 the lines of our religion meet, and to which the whole of the divine 
 life hath a constant reference and tendency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Their chief concern is to have lights in their hands, when they 
 attend the bridegroom, thus to do him honour and do him service. Note, 
 Christians are children of light. The gospel is light, and they who 
 receive it must not only be enlightened by it themselves, but must 
 <I>shine as lights,</I> must <I>hold it forth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:15,16">Phil. ii. 15, 16</A>.

 This in general.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now concerning these ten virgins, we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Their different character, with the proof and evidence of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Their character was that <I>five were wise, and five foolish</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 and <I>wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness;</I>
 so saith Solomon, a competent judge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:13">Eccl. ii. 13</A>.

 Note, Those of the same profession and denomination among men, may yet
 be of characters vastly different in the sight of God. Sincere 
 Christians are the <I>wise</I> virgins, and hypocrites the <I>foolish 
 ones,</I> as in another parable they are represented by wise and 
 foolish builders. Note, Those are wise or foolish indeed, that are so
 in the affairs of their souls. True religion is true wisdom; sin is 
 folly, but especially the sin of hypocrisy, for those are the greatest 
 fools, that are <I>wise in their own conceit,</I> and those the worst 
 of sinners, that <I>feign themselves just men.</I> Some observe from 
 the equal number of the wise and foolish, what a charitable decorum (it 
 is Archbishop Tillotson's expression) Christ observes, as if he would 
 hope that the number of true believers was nearly equal to that of 
 hypocrites, or, at least, would teach us to hope the best concerning 
 those that profess religion, and to think of them with a bias to the 
 charitable side. Though, in judging of ourselves, we ought to remember
 that the gate is strait, and few find it; yet, in judging of others, we 
 ought to remember that the Captain of our salvation brings many sons to 
 glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The evidence of this character was in the very thing which they 
 were to attend to; by that they are judged of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> It was the folly of the foolish virgins, that they 
 <I>took their lamps, and took no oil with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They had just the oil enough to make their lamps burn for the present, 
 to make a show with, as if they intended to meet the bridegroom; but no 
 cruse or bottle of oil with them for a recruit if the bridegroom 
 tarried; thus hypocrites,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They have no principle within. They have a lamp of profession in 
 their hands, but have not in their hearts that stock of sound 
 knowledge, rooted dispositions, and settled resolutions, which is 
 necessary to carry them through the services and trials of the present 
 state. They act under the influence of external inducements, but are 
 void of spiritual life; like a tradesman, that sets up without a stock, 
 or the seed on the stony ground, that wanted root.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They have no prospect of, nor make provision for, what is to come. 
 They took lamps for a present show, but not oil for after use. This 
 incogitancy is the ruin of many professors; all their care is to 
 recommend themselves to their neighbours, whom they now converse with, 
 not to approve themselves to Christ, whom they must hereafter appear 
 before; as if any thing will serve, provide it will but serve for the 
 present. Tell them of things not seen as yet, and you are like Lot to 
 his sons-in-law, as one that mocked. They do not provide for hereafter, 
 as the ant does, nor <I>lay up for the time to come,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:19">1 Tim. vi. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> It was the wisdom of the wise virgins, that <I>they 
 took oil in their vessels with their lamps,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They had a good principle within, which would maintain and keep up
 their profession. 

 1. The heart is the vessel, which it is our wisdom to get furnished;
 for, out of a good treasure there, good things must be brought; but if 
 that root be rottenness, the blossom will be dust.

 2. Grace is the <I>oil</I> which we must have in this <I>vessel;</I> in
 the tabernacle there was constant provision made of <I>oil for the 
 light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:14">Exod. xxxv. 14</A>.

 Our light must shine before men in good works, but this cannot be, or
 not long, unless there be a fixed active principle in the heart, of 
 faith in Christ, and love to God and our brethren, from which we must 
 act in every thing we do in religion, with an eye to what is before us. 
 They that took oil in their vessels, did it upon supposition that 
 perhaps the bridegroom might tarry. Note, In looking forward it is good 
 to prepare for the worst, to lay in for a long siege. But remember that 
 this oil which keeps the lamps burning, is derived to the candlestick 
 from Jesus Christ, the great and good <I>Olive,</I> by the <I>golden 
 pipes</I> of the ordinances, as it is represented in that vision

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:2,3,12">Zech. iv. 2, 3, 12</A>),
 
 which is explained 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16">John i. 16</A>,

 <I>Of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their common fault, during the bridegroom's delay; <I>They all 
 slumbered and slept,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The bridegroom tarried, that is, he did not come out so soon as 
 they expected. What we look for as certain, we are apt to think is very 
 near; many in the apostles' times imagined that the <I>day of the Lord 
 was at hand,</I> but it is not so. Christ, as to us, <I>seems</I> to
 tarry, and yet really <I>does not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:3">Hab. ii. 3</A>.

 There is good reason for the Bridegroom's tarrying; there are many
 intermediate counsels and purposes to be accomplished, the elect must 
 all be called in, God's patience must be manifested, and the saints' 
 patience tried, the harvest of the earth must be ripened, and so must 
 the harvest of heaven too. But though Christ tarry past <I>our</I> 
 time, he will not tarry past the <I>due</I> time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] While he tarried, those that waited for him, grew careless, and 
 forgot what they were attending; <I>They all slumbered and slept;</I> 
 as if they had given over looking for him; for <I>when the Son of man 
 cometh,</I> he will <I>not find faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:8">Luke xviii. 8</A>.

 Those that inferred the suddenness of it from its certainty, when that
 answered not their expectation, were apt from the delay to infer its 
 uncertainty. The wise virgins slumbered, and the foolish slept; so some 
 distinguish it; however, they were both faulty. The wise virgins kept 
 their lamps burning, but did not keep themselves awake. Note, Too many 
 good Christians, when they have been long in profession, grow remiss in 
 their preparations for Christ's second coming; they intermit their 
 care, abate their zeal, their graces are not lively, nor their works 
 found perfect before God; and though all <I>love</I> be not lost, yet 
 the <I>first</I> love is left. If it was hard to the disciples to watch 
 with Christ <I>an hour,</I> much more to watch with him <I>an age. I 
 sleep,</I> saith the spouse, <I>but my heart wakes,</I> Observe, 
 <I>First,</I> They slumbered, and then they slept. Note, One degree of 
 carelessness and remissness makes way for another. Those that allow 
 themselves in slumbering, will scarcely keep themselves from sleeping; 
 therefore dread the beginning of spiritual decays; <I>Venienti 
 occurrite morbo--Attend to the first symptoms of disease.</I> The 
 ancients generally understood the virgins' slumbering and sleeping of 
 their dying; they all died, wise and foolish

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:10">Ps. xlix. 10</A>),

 before judgment-day. So Ferus, <I>Antequam veniat sponsus omnibus
 obdormiscendum est, hoc est, moriendum--Before the Bridegroom come, all 
 must sleep, that is, die.</I> So Calvin. But I think it is rather to be 
 taken as we have opened it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The surprising summons given them, to attend the bridegroom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 <I>At midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh.</I>
 Note,

 [1.] Though Christ tarry long, he will come at last; though he seem 
 slow, he is sure. In his first coming, he was thought long by those 
 that waited for the consolation of Israel; yet in the <I>fulness of 
 time</I> he came; so his second coming, though long deferred, is not 
 forgotten; his enemies shall find, to their cost, that forbearance is 
 no acquittance; and his friends shall find, to their comfort, that 
 <I>the vision is for an appointed time, and at the end it shall speak, 
 and not lie.</I> The year of the redeemed is fixed, and it will come. 
 
 [2.] Christ's coming will be at our midnight, when we least look for 
 him, and are most disposed to take our rest. His coming for the relief 
 and comfort of his people, often is when the good intended seems to be 
 at the greatest distance; and his coming to reckon with his enemies, is 
 when they put the evil day furthest from them. It was at midnight that 
 the first-born of Egypt were destroyed, and Israel delivered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:29">Exod. xii. 29</A>.

 Death often comes when it is least expected; the soul is <I>required
 this night,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:20">Luke xii. 20</A>.

 Christ will come when he pleases, to show his sovereignty, and will not
 let us know when, to teach us our duty.

 [3.] When Christ comes, we must <I>go forth to meet him.</I> As 
 Christians we are bound to attend all the motions of the Lord Jesus, 
 and meet him in all his out-goings. When he comes to us at death, we 
 must go forth out of the body, out of the world, to meet him with 
 affections and workings of soul suitable to the discoveries we then 
 expect him to make of himself. <I>Go ye forth to meet him,</I> is a 
 call to those who are habitually prepared, to be actually ready. 

 [4.] The notice given of Christ's approach, and the call to meet him, 
 will be awakening; <I>There was a cry made.</I> His first coming was 
 not with any observation at all, nor did they say, <I>Lo, here is 
 Christ,</I> or <I>Lo, he is there; he was in the world, and the world 
 knew him not;</I> but his second coming will be with the observation of 
 all the world; <I>Every eye shall see him.</I> There will be a cry from 
 heaven, for he shall <I>descend with a shout, Arise, ye dead, and come 
 to judgment;</I> and a cry from the earth too, a <I>cry to rocks and 
 mountains,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:16">Rev. vi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The address they all made to answer this summons 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 <I>They all arose, and trimmed their lamps,</I> snuffed them and
 supplied them with oil and went about with all expedition to put 
 themselves in a posture to receive the bridegroom. Now,

 [1.] This, in the wise virgins, bespeaks an actual preparation for the 
 Bridegroom's coming. Note, even those that are best prepared for death, 
 have, upon the immediate arrests of it, work to do, to get themselves 
 actually ready, that they may be <I>found in peace</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:14">2 Pet. iii. 14</A>),
 
 <I>found doing</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:46"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 46</A>),

 and not <I>found naked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:3">2 Cor. v. 3</A>.

 It will be a day of search and enquiry; and it concerns us to think how
 we shall then be found. When we see the day approaching, we must 
 address ourselves to our dying work with all seriousness, renewing our 
 repentance for sin, our consent to the covenant, our farewells to the 
 world; and our souls must be carried out toward God in suitable 
 breathings.

 [2.] In the foolish virgins, it denotes a vain confidence, and conceit 
 of the goodness of their state, and their readiness for another world. 
 Note, Even counterfeit graces will serve a man to make a show of when 
 he comes to die, as well as they have done all his life long; the 
 hypocrite's hopes blaze when they are just expiring, like a lightening 
 before death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The distress which the foolish virgins were in, for want of 
 <I>oil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.
 
 This bespeaks,

 [1.] The apprehensions which some hypocrites have of the misery of 
 their state, even on this side death, when God opens their eyes to see 
 their folly, and themselves perishing <I>with a lie in their right 
 hand.</I> Or, however, 

 [2.] The real misery of their state on the other side death, and in the 
 judgment; how far their fair, but false, profession of religion will be 
 from availing them any thing in the great day; see what comes of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Their lamps are gone out. The lamps of hypocrites often 
 go out in this life; when they who have begun in the spirit, end in the 
 flesh, and the hypocrisy breaks out in an open apostasy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:20">2 Pet. ii. 20</A>.
 
 The profession withers, and the credit of it is lost; the hopes fail,
 and the comfort of them is gone; how often is <I>the candle of the 
 wicked</I> thus <I>put out?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:17">Job xxi. 17</A>.

 Yet many a hypocrite keeps up his credit, and the comfort of his
 profession, such as it is, to the last; but what is it when <I>God
 taketh away his soul?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:8">Job xxvii. 8</A>.

 If his candle be not put out <I>before</I> him, it is put out <I>with
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:5,6">Job xviii. 5, 6</A>.
 
 He shall <I>lie down in sorrow,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:11">Isa. l. 11</A>.

 The gains of a hypocritical profession will not follow a man to
 judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:22,23"><I>ch.</I> vii. 22, 23</A>.

 The lamps are gone out, when the hypocrite's hope proves <I>like the 
 spider's web</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:11">Job viii. 11</A>,

 &c.), and like the <I>giving up of the ghost</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:20">Job xi. 20</A>),

 like Absalom's mule that left him in the oak.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> They wanted oil to supply them when they were going 
 out. Note, Those that take up short of true grace, will certainly find 
 the want of it one time or other. An external profession well humoured 
 may carry a man far, but it will not carry him through; it may light 
 him along this world, but the damps of the valley of the shadow of 
 death will put it out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> They would gladly be beholden to the wise virgins for a 
 supply out of their vessels; <I>Give us of your oil.</I> Note, The day 
 is coming, when carnal hypocrites would gladly be found in the 
 condition of true Christians. Those who now hate the strictness of 
 religion, will, at death and judgment, wish for the solid comforts of 
 it. Those who care not to live the life, yet would die the death, of 
 the righteous. The day is coming when those who now look with contempt 
 upon humble contrite saints, would gladly get an interest in them, and 
 would value those as their best friends and benefactors, whom now they 
 <I>set with the dogs of their flock. Give us of your oil;</I> that is, 
 "Speak a good word for us;" so some; but there is no occasion for 
 vouchers in the great day, the Judge knows what is every man's true 
 character. But is it not well that they are brought to say, <I>Give us 
 of your oil?</I> It is so; but, 

 1. This request was extorted by sensible necessity. Note, Those will
 see their need of grace hereafter, when it should save them, who will 
 not see their need of grace now, when it should sanctify and rule them.

 (2.) It comes too late. God would have given them oil, had they asked
 in time; but there is no buying when the market is over, no bidding 
 when the inch of candle is dropped.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> They were denied a share in their companions' oil. It 
 is a sad presage of a repulse with God, when they were thus repulsed by 
 good people. <I>The wise answered, Not so;</I> that peremptory denial 
 is not in the original, but supplied by the translators: these wise 
 virgins would rather give a reason without a positive refusal, than (as 
 many do) give a positive refusal without a reason. They were well 
 inclined to help their neighbours in distress; but, We must not, we 
 cannot, we dare not, do it, <I>lest there be not enough for us and 
 you;</I> charity begins at home; but <I>go, and buy for yourselves.</I> 
 Note, 

 1. Those that would be saved, must have grace of their own. Though we
 have benefit by the communion of saints, and the faith and prayers of 
 others may now redound to our advantage, yet our own sanctification is 
 indispensably necessary to our own salvation. The just shall live by 
 his faith. Every man shall give account of himself, and therefore let 
 every man <I>prove his own work;</I> for he cannot get another to 
 muster for him in that day. 

 2. Those that have most grace, have none to spare; all we have, is
 little enough for ourselves to appear before God in. The best have need 
 to borrow from Christ, but they have none to lend to any of their 
 neighbours. The church of Rome, which dreams of works of supererogation 
 and the imputation of the righteousness of saints, forgets that it was 
 the wisdom of the wise virgins to understand that they had but oil 
 enough for themselves, and none for others. But observe, These wise 
 virgins do not upbraid the foolish with their neglect, nor boast of 
 their own forecast, nor torment them with suggestions tending to 
 despair, but give them the best advice the case will bear, <I>Go ye 
 rather to them that sell.</I> Note, Those that deal foolishly in the 
 affairs of their souls, are to be pitied, and not insulted over; for 
 who made thee to differ? When ministers attend such as have been 
 mindless of God and their souls all their days, but are under death-bed 
 convictions; and, because true repentance is never too late, direct 
 them to repent, and turn to God, and close with Christ; yet, because 
 late repentance is seldom true, they do but as these wise virgins did 
 by the foolish, even made the best of bad. They can but tell them what 
 is to be done, if it be not too late, but whether the door may not be 
 shut before it is done, is an unspeakable hazard. It is good advice 
 now, if it be taken in time, <I>Go to them that sell, and buy for 
 yourselves.</I> Note, Those that would have grace, must have recourse 
 to, and attend upon, the means of grace. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1">Isa. lv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) The coming of the bridegroom, and the issue of all this different 
 character of the wise and foolish virgins. See what came of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>While they went out to buy, the bridegroom came.</I> Note, With 
 regard to those that put off their great work to the last, it is a 
 thousand to one, that they have not time to do it then. Getting grace 
 is a work of time, and cannot be done in a hurry. While the poor 
 awakened soul addresses itself, upon a sick bed, to repentance and 
 prayer, in awful confusion, it scarcely knows which end to begin at, or 
 what to do first; and presently death comes, judgment comes, and the 
 work is undone, and the poor sinner undone for ever. This comes of 
 having oil to buy when we should burn it, and grace to get when we 
 should use it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>The bridegroom came.</I> Note, Our Lord Jesus will come to his 
 people, at the great day, as a Bridegroom; will come in pomp and rich 
 attire, attended with his friends: now that the Bridegroom is taken 
 away from us, <I>we fast</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:15"><I>ch.</I> ix. 15</A>),

 but then will be an everlasting feast. Then the Bridegroom will fetch 
 home his bride, to be <I>where he is</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24">John xvii. 24</A>),

 and will <I>rejoice over his bride,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:5">Isa. lii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>They that were ready, went in with him to the marriage.</I> 
 Note, <I>First,</I> To be eternally glorified is to go in with Christ 
 to the marriage, to be in his immediate presence, and in the most 
 intimate fellowship and communion with him in a state of eternal rest, 
 joy, and plenty. <I>Secondly,</I> Those, and those only, shall go to 
 heaven hereafter, that are made ready for heaven here, that are 
 <I>wrought to the self-same thing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:5">2 Cor. v. 5</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> The suddenness of death, and of Christ's coming to us
 then, will be no obstruction to our happiness, if we have been 
 habitually prepared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] <I>The door was shut,</I> as is usual when all the company is 
 come, that are to be admitted. The door was shut, <I>First,</I> To 
 secure those that were within; that, being now made <I>pillars in the 
 house of our God, they may go no more out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:12">Rev. iii. 12</A>.

 Adam was put into paradise, but the door was left open and so he went 
 out again; but when glorified saints are put into the heavenly 
 paradise, they are shut in. <I>Secondly,</I> To exclude those that were 
 out. The state of saints and sinners will then be unalterably fixed, 
 and those that are shut out then, will be shut out for ever. Now the 
 gate is strait, yet it is open; but then it will be shut and bolted, 
 and <I>a great gulf fixed.</I> This was like the shutting of the door 
 of the ark when Noah was in; as he was thereby preserved, so all the 
 rest were finally abandoned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] The foolish virgins came when it was <I>too late</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);
 
 <I>Afterward came also the other virgins.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> There
 are many that will seek admission into heaven when it is too late; as 
 profane Esau, who <I>afterward would have inherited the blessing.</I> 
 God and religion will be glorified by those late solicitations, though 
 sinners will not be saved by them; it is for the honour of <I>Lord, 
 Lord,</I> that, of fervent and importunate prayer, that those who 
 slight it now, will flee to it shortly, and it will not be called 
 whining and canting then. <I>Secondly,</I> The vain confidence of 
 hypocrites will carry them very far in their expectations of happiness. 
 They go to heaven-gate, and demand entrance, and yet are shut out; 
 lifted up to heaven in a fond conceit of the goodness of their state, 
 and yet thrust down to hell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [5.] They were <I>rejected,</I> as Esau was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 <I>I know you not.</I> Note, We are all concerned to <I>seek the Lord
 while he may be found;</I> for there is a time coming when he will not 
 be found. Time was, when, <I>Lord, Lord, open to us,</I> would have 
 sped well, by virtue of that promise, <I>Knock, and it shall be opened 
 to you;</I> but now it comes too late. The sentence is solemnly bound 
 on with, <I>Verily I say unto you,</I> which amounts to no less than 
 <I>swearing in his wrath, that they shall never enter into his 
 rest.</I> It bespeaks him resolved, and them silenced by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is a practical inference drawn from this parable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);
 
 <I>Watch therefore,</I> We had it before
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:42"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 42</A>),

 and here it is repeated as the most needful caution. Note, 

 1. Our great duty is to watch, to attend to the business of our souls 
 with the utmost diligence and circumspection. Be awake, and be wakeful. 
 
 2. It is a good reason for our watching, that the time of our Lord's
 coming is very uncertain; <I>we know neither the day nor the hour.</I> 
 Therefore every day and every hour we must be ready, and not off our 
 watch any day in the year, or any hour in the day. Be thou <I>in the 
 fear of the Lord</I> every day and <I>all the day long.</I></P>

 <TR><TD><FONT SIZE=+1><I>The Parable of the Talents.</I></FONT></TD>
 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  For <I>the kingdom of heaven is</I> as a man travelling into a
 far country, <I>who</I> called his own servants, and delivered unto
 them his goods.
 &nbsp; 15  And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
 another one; to every man according to his several ability; and
 straightway took his journey.
 &nbsp; 16  Then he that had received the five talents went and traded
 with the same, and made <I>them</I> other five talents.
 &nbsp; 17  And likewise he that <I>had received</I> two, he also gained
 other two.
 &nbsp; 18  But he that had received one went and digged in the earth,
 and hid his lord's money.
 &nbsp; 19  After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
 reckoneth with them.
 &nbsp; 20  And so he that had received five talents came and brought
 other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five
 talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
 &nbsp; 21  His lord said unto him, Well done, <I>thou</I> good and faithful
 servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
 thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
 &nbsp; 22  He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord,
 thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two
 other talents beside them.
 &nbsp; 23  His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful
 servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
 thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
 &nbsp; 24  Then he which had received the one talent came and said,
 Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou
 hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
 &nbsp; 25  And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth:
 lo, <I>there</I> thou hast <I>that is</I> thine.
 &nbsp; 26  His lord answered and said unto him, <I>Thou</I> wicked and
 slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and
 gather where I have not strawed:
 &nbsp; 27  Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the
 exchangers, and <I>then</I> at my coming I should have received mine
 own with usury.
 &nbsp; 28  Take therefore the talent from him, and give <I>it</I> unto him
 which hath ten talents.
 &nbsp; 29  For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall
 have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away
 even that which he hath.
 &nbsp; 30  And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness:
 there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the parable of the <I>talents</I> committed to three 
 servants; this implies that we are in a state of work and business, as 
 the former implies that we are in a state of expectancy. <I>That</I> 
 showed the necessity of habitual preparation, <I>this</I> of actual 
 diligence in our present work and service. In <I>that</I> we were 
 stirred up to do well for our own souls; in <I>this</I> to lay out 
 ourselves for the glory of God and the good of others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this parable, 

 1. The <I>Master</I> is Christ, who is the absolute Owner and 
 Proprietor of all persons and things, and in a special manner of his 
 church; into his hands all things are delivered. 

 2. The <I>servants</I> are Christians, his own servants, so they are
 called; born in his house, bought with his money, devoted to his 
 praise, and employed in his work. It is probable that <I>ministers</I> 
 are specially intended here, who are more immediately attending on him, 
 and sent by him. St. Paul often calls himself a <I>servant of Jesus
 Christ.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:24">2 Tim. ii. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have three things, in general, in this parable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The trust committed to these servants; Their master <I>delivered to 
 them his goods:</I> having appointed them to work (for Christ keeps no 
 servants to be idle), he left them something to work upon. Note, 

 1. Christ's servants have and receive their all from him; for they are
 of themselves worth nothing, nor have any thing they can call their own
 but sin. 

 2. Our receiving from Christ is in order to our working for him. Our
 privileges are intended to find us with business. The <I>manifestation
 of the Spirit</I> is given to every man to <I>profit withal.</I> 

 3. Whatever we receive to be made use of for Christ, still the
 property is vested in him; we are but tenants upon his land, 
 <I>stewards of his manifold grace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:10">1 Pet. iv. 10</A>.

 Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) On what occasion this trust was committed to these servants: The 
 master was <I>travelling into a far country.</I> This is explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8">Eph. iv. 8</A>.
 
 <I>When he ascended on high, he gave gifts to men.</I> Note,
 
 [1.] When Christ went to heaven, he was as a man <I>travelling into a 
 far country;</I> that is, he went with a purpose to be away a great 
 while. 

 [2.] When he went, he took care to furnish his church with all things 
 necessary for it during his personal absence. For, and in consideration 
 of, his departure, he committed to his church truths, laws, promises 
 and powers; these were the <B><I>parakatatheke</I></B>--<I>the great 
 depositum</I> (as it is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:20,2Ti+1:14">1 Tim. vi. 20; 2 Tim. i. 14</A>),

 the <I>good thing</I> that is committed to us; and he sent his Spirit
 to enable his servants to teach and profess those truths, to press and 
 observe those laws, to improve and apply those promises, and to 
 exercise and employ those powers, ordinary or extraordinary. Thus 
 Christ, at his ascension, left his goods to his church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In what proportion this trust was committed. 

 [1.] He gave <I>talents;</I> a talent of silver is computed to be in 
 our money three hundred and fifty-three pounds eleven shillings and ten 
 pence halfpenny; so the learned Bishop Cumberland. Note, Christ's gifts 
 are rich and valuable, the purchases of his blood inestimable, and none 
 of them mean. 

 [2.] He gave to some more, to others less; to one <I>five</I> talents, 
 to another <I>two,</I> to another <I>one;</I> to every one according to 
 his several ability. When Divine Providence has made a difference in 
 men's ability, as to mind, body, estate, relation, and interest, divine 
 grace dispenses spiritual gifts accordingly, but still the ability 
 itself is from him. Observe, <I>First,</I> Every one had some one 
 talent at least, and that is not a despicable stock for a poor servant 
 to begin with. A <I>soul</I> of our own is the <I>one</I> talent we are 
 every one of us entrusted with, and it will find us with work. <I>Hoc 
 nempe ab homine exigiture, ut prosit hominibus; si fieri potest, 
 multis; si minus, paucis; si minus, proximis, si minus, sibi: nam cum 
 se utilem c&aelig;teris efficit, commune agit negotium. Et si quis bene 
 de se meretur, hoc ipso aliis prodest quod aliis profuturum parat--It 
 is the duty of a man to render himself beneficial to those around him; 
 to a great number if possible; but if this is denied him, to a few; to 
 his intimate connections; or, at least, to himself. He that is useful 
 to others, may be reckoned a common good. And whoever entitles himself 
 to his own approbation, is serviceable to others, as forming himself to 
 those habits which will result in their favour.</I> Seneca de Otio 
 Sapient. <I>Secondly,</I> All had not alike, for they had not all alike 
 abilities and opportunities. God is a free Agent, <I>dividing to every 
 man severally as he will;</I> some are cut out for service in one kind, 
 others in another, as the members of the natural body. When the 
 householder had thus settled his affairs, he <I>straightway took his 
 journey.</I> Our Lord Jesus, when he had given commandments to his 
 apostles, as one in haste to be gone, went to heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The different management and improvement of this trust, which we 
 have an account of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Two of the servants did well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They were diligent and faithful; <I>They went, and traded;</I> 
 they put the money they were entrusted with, to the use for which it 
 was intended--laid it out in goods, and made returns of it; as soon as
 ever their master was gone, they immediately applied themselves to 
 their business. Those that have so much work to do, as every Christian 
 has, need to set about it quickly, and lose not time. <I>They went, and 
 traded.</I> Note, A true Christian is a spiritual tradesman. Trades are 
 called <I>mysteries,</I> and <I>without controversy great is the 
 mystery of godliness;</I> it is a manufacture trade; there is something 
 to be done by upon our own hearts, and for the good of others. It is a 
 merchant-trade; things of less value to us are parted with for things 
 of greater value; <I>wisdom's merchandize,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:15,Mt+13:45">Prov. iii. 15; Matt. xiii. 45</A>.

 A tradesman is one who, having made his trade his choice, and taken 
 pains to learn it, makes it his business to follow it, lays out all he 
 has for the advancement of it, makes all other affairs bend to it, and 
 lives upon the gain of it. Thus does a true Christian act in the work 
 of religion; we have no stock of our <I>own</I> to trade with, but 
 trade as factors with our master's stock. The endowments of the 
 mind--reason, wit, learning, must be used in subserviency to religion; 
 the enjoyments of the world--estate, credit, interest, power, 
 preferment, must be improved for the honour of Christ. The ordinances 
 of the gospel, and our opportunities of attending them, bibles, 
 ministers, sabbaths, sacraments, must be improved for the end for which 
 they were instituted, and communion with God kept up by them, and the 
 gifts and graces of the Spirit must be exercised; and this is trading 
 with our talents.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They were successful; they doubled their stock, and in a little
 time made <I>cent. per cent.</I> of it: he that had <I>five
 talents,</I> soon made them <I>other five.</I> Trading with our talents
 is not alway successful with others, but, however, it shall be so to
 ourselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:4">Isa. xlix. 4</A>.

 Note, The hand of the diligent makes rich in graces, and comforts, and
 treasures of good works. There is a great deal to be got by industry in 
 religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, The returns were in proportion to the receivings. 

 [1.] From those to whom God hath given five talents, he expects the 
 improvement of five, and to reap plentifully where he sows plentifully. 
 The greater gifts any have, the more pains they ought to take, as those 
 must that have a large stock to manage. 

 [2.] From those to whom he has given but two talents, he expects only 
 the improvement of two, which may encourage those who are placed in a 
 lower and narrower sphere of usefulness; if they lay out themselves to 
 do good according to the best of their capacity and opportunity, they 
 shall be accepted, though they do not so much good as others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The third did ill 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 <I>He that had received one talent, went, and hid his lord's money.</I>
 Though the parable represents but one in three unfaithful, yet in a
 history that answers this <I>parable,</I> we find the disproportion
 quite the other way, when <I>ten lepers were cleansed, nine</I> of
 <I>ten</I> hid the talent, and <I>only one returned to give thanks,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:17,18">Luke xvii. 17, 18</A>.

 The unfaithful servant was he that had but <I>one</I> talent: doubtless
 there are many that have five talents, and bury them all; great 
 abilities, great advantages, and yet do no good with them: but Christ 
 would hint to us,

 (1.) That if he that had but one talent, be reckoned with thus for
 burying that one, much more will they be accounted offenders, that have 
 more, that have many, and bury them. If he that was but of small 
 capacity, was cast into utter darkness because he did not improve what 
 he had as he might have done, <I>of how much sorer punishment, suppose 
 ye, shall he be thought worthy, that tramples underfoot the greatest 
 advantages?</I>

 (2.) That those who have least to do for God, frequently do least of
 what they have to do. Some make it an excuse for their laziness, that 
 they have not the opportunities of serving God that others have; and 
 because they have not wherewithal to do what they say they would, they 
 will not do what we are sure they can, and so sit down and do nothing; 
 it is really an aggravation of their sloth, that when they have but one 
 talent to take care about, they neglect that one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>He digged in the earth, and hid the talent,</I> for fear it should 
 be stolen; he did not misspend or misemploy it, did not embezzle it or 
 squander it away, but he <I>hid it.</I> Money is like manure (so my 
 Lord Bacon used to say,) good for nothing in the heap, but it must be 
 spread; yet it is an evil which we have often seen under the sun, 
 <I>treasure heaped together</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:3,Ec+6:1,2">Jam. v. 3; Eccl. vi. 1, 2</A>),

 which does good to nobody; and so it is in spiritual gifts; many have
 them, and make no use of them for the end for which they were given 
 them. Those that have estates, and do not lay them out in works of 
 piety and charity; that have power and interest, and do not with it 
 promote religion in the places where they live; ministers that have 
 capacities and opportunities of doing good, but do not stir up the gift 
 that is in them, are those slothful servants that seek their own things 
 more than Christ's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He hid his <I>lord's</I> money; had it been his <I>own,</I> he might 
 have done as he pleased; but, whatever abilities and advantages we 
 have, they are not our <I>own,</I> we are but stewards of them, and 
 must give account to our Lord, whose goods they are. It was an 
 aggravation of his slothfulness, that his fellow-servants were busy and 
 successful in trading, and their zeal should have provoked his. Are 
 others active, and shall we be idle?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The account of this improvement, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 1. The account is deferred; it is not <I>till after a long time</I> 
 that they are reckoned with; not that the master neglects his affairs, 
 or that God is <I>slack concerning his promise</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:9">2 Pet. iii. 9</A>);

 no, he is <I>ready to judge</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:5">1 Pet. iv. 5</A>);

 but every thing must be done in its time and
 order.

 2. Yet the day of account comes at last; <I>The lord of those servants
 reckoneth with them.</I> Note, The stewards of the manifold grace of
 God must shortly <I>give account of their stewardship.</I> We must all
 be reckoned with--what good we have got to our own souls, and what good
 we have done to others by the advantages we have enjoyed. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:10,11">Rom. xiv. 10, 11</A>.

 Now here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The good account of the faithful servants; and here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The servants <I>giving up the account</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:20,22"><I>v.</I> 20, 22</A>);

 "<I>Lord, thou deliveredst to me five talents,</I> and to me
 <I>two;</I> behold, <I>I have gained five talents,</I> and I <I>two</I> 
 talents <I>more.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Christ's faithful servants acknowledge with thankfulness
 his vouchsafements to them; <I>Lord, thou deliveredst to me</I> such 
 and such things. Note,

 1. It is good to keep a particular account of our receivings from God,
 to remember what we have received, that we may know what is expected 
 from us, and may render according to the benefit.

 2. We must never look upon our improvements but with a general mention
 of God's favour to us, of the honour he has put upon us, in entrusting 
 us with his goods, and of that grace which is the spring and fountain 
 of all the good that is in us or is done by us. For the truth is, the 
 more we do for God, the more we are indebted to him for making use of 
 us, and enabling us, for his service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> They produce, as an evidence of their faithfulness, 
 what they have gained. Note, God's good stewards have something to show 
 for their diligence; <I>Show me thy faith by thy works.</I> He that is 
 a good man, <I>let him show it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:13">Jam. iii. 13</A>.

 If we be careful in our spiritual trade, it will soon be seen by us,
 and <I>our works will follow us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:13">Rev. xiv. 13</A>.

 Not that the saints will in the great day make mention of their own 
 good deeds; no, Christ will do that for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 but it intimates that they who faithfully improve their talents,
 <I>shall have boldness in the day of Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:28-4:17">1 John ii. 28-iv. 17</A>.

 And it is observable that he who had but <I>two</I> talents, gave up
 his account as cheerfully as he who had <I>five;</I> for our comfort, 
 in the day of account, will be according to our faithfulness, not 
 according to our usefulness; our sincerity, not our success; according 
 to the uprightness of our hearts, not according to the degree of our 
 opportunities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The master's acceptance and approbation of their account, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:21,23"><I>v.</I> 21, 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He commended them; <I>Well done, good and faithful 
 servant.</I> Note, The diligence and integrity of those who approve 
 themselves the good and faithful servants of Jesus Christ, will 
 certainly be <I>found to praise, and honour, and glory, at his 
 appearing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:7">1 Pet. i. 7</A>.

 Those that own and honour God now, he will own and honour shortly.

 1. Their persons will be accepted; <I>Thou good and faithful
 servant.</I> He that knows the integrity of his servants now, will 
 witness to it in the great day; and they that are found faithful, shall 
 be called so. Perhaps they were censured by men, as <I>righteous 
 overmuch;</I> but Christ will give them their just characters, of 
 <I>good and faithful.</I> 

 2. Their performances will be accepted; <I>Well done.</I> Christ will
 call those, and those only, <I>good servants,</I> that have done well; 
 for it is <I>by patient continuance in well-doing</I> that we seek for 
 this glory and honour; and if we seek, we shall find; if we do that 
 which is good, and do it well, we shall have <I>praise of the same.</I> 
 Some masters are so morose, that they will not commend their servants, 
 though they do their work ever so well; it is thought enough not to 
 chide: but Christ will commend his servants that do well; whether their 
 praise be of men or not, it is of him; and if we have the good word of 
 our Master, the matter is not great what our fellow-servants say of us; 
 if he saith, <I>Well done,</I> we are happy, and it should then be a 
 small thing to us to be judged of men's judgment; as, on the contrary, 
 not he who commendeth himself, or whom his neighbours commend, is 
 approved, but whom the Lord commends.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He rewards them. The faithful servants of Christ shall 
 not be put off with bare commendation; no, all their work and labour of 
 love shall be rewarded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this reward is here expressed two ways.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In one expression agreeable to the parable; <I>Thou hast been 
 faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many 
 things.</I> It is usual in the courts of princes, and families of great 
 men, to advance those to higher offices, that have been faithful in 
 lower. Note, Christ is a master that will prefer his servants who 
 acquit themselves well. Christ has honour in store for those that 
 honour him--<I>a crown</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:8">2 Tim. iv. 8</A>),
 
 <I>a throne</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:21">Rev. iii. 21</A>),
 
 <I>a kingdom,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:34"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 34</A>.

 Here they are beggars; in heaven they shall be rulers. The upright 
 shall have dominion: Christ's servants are all princes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe the disproportion between the work and the reward; there are 
 but few things in which the saints are serviceable to the glory of God, 
 but there are many things wherein they shall be glorified with God. 
 What charge we receive from God, what work we do for God in this world, 
 is but little, very little, compared with <I>the joy set before us.</I> 
 Put together all our service, all our sufferings, all our improvements, 
 all the good we do to others, all we get to ourselves, and they are but 
 a few things, next to nothing, not worthy to be compared, not fit to be 
 named the same day with the glory to be revealed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In another expression, which slips out of the parable into the thing 
 signified by it; <I>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</I> Note, 

 (1.) The state of the blessed is a state of joy, not only because all
 tears shall then be wiped away, but all the springs of comfort shall be 
 opened to them, and the fountains of joy broken up. Where there are the 
 vision and fruition of God, a perfection of holiness, and the society 
 of the blessed, there cannot but be a fulness of joy.

 (2.) This joy is the <I>joy of their Lord;</I> the joy which he himself
 has purchased and provided for them; the joy of the redeemed, bought
 with the sorrow of the Redeemer. It is the joy which he himself is in
 the possession of, and which he had his eye upon when he <I>endured the
 cross, and despised the shame,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:2">Heb. xii. 2</A>.

 It is the joy of which he himself is the fountain and centre. It is the
 joy of our Lord, for it is <I>joy in the Lord,</I> who is our exceeding 
 joy. Abraham was not willing that the <I>steward of his house,</I> 
 though <I>faithful,</I> should be <I>his heir</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:3">Gen. xv. 3</A>);

 but Christ admits his faithful stewards into his own joy, to be
 joint-heirs with him.

 (3.) Glorified saints shall enter into this joy, shall have a full and
 complete possession of it, as the heir when he comes of age enters upon 
 his estate, or as they that were ready, <I>went</I> in to the marriage 
 feast. Here the joy of our Lord enters into the saints, in the earnest 
 of the Spirit; shortly they shall enter into it, shall be in it to 
 eternity, as in their element.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The bad account of the slothful servant. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] His apology for himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 Though he had received but <I>one</I> talent, for that one he is called 
 to account. The smallness of our receiving will not excuse us from a 
 reckoning. None shall be called to an account for more than they have 
 received; but for what we have, we must all account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, <I>First,</I> What he confides in. He comes to the account 
 with a deal of assurance, relying on the plea he had to put in, that he 
 was able to say, "<I>Lo, there thou hast that is thine;</I> if I have 
 not made it more, as the others have done, yet this I can say, I have 
 not made it less." This, he thinks, may serve to bring him off, if not 
 with praise, yet with safety.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, Many a one goes very securely to judgment, presuming upon the 
 validity of a plea that will be overruled as vain and frivolous. 
 Slothful professors, that are afraid of doing too much for God, yet 
 hope to come off as well as those that take so much pains in religion. 
 Thus <I>the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that 
 can render a reason,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:16">Prov. xxvi. 16</A>.

 This servant thought that his account would pass well enough, because 
 he could say, <I>There thou hast that is thine.</I> "Lord, I was no 
 spendthrift of my estate, no prodigal of my time, no profaner of my 
 sabbaths, no opposer of good ministers and good preaching; Lord, I 
 never ridiculed my bible, nor set my wits to work to banter religion, 
 nor abused my power to persecute any good man; I never drowned my 
 parts, nor wasted God's good creatures in drunkenness and gluttony, nor 
 ever to my knowledge did I injury to any body." Many that are called 
 Christians, build great hopes for heaven upon their being able to make 
 such an account; yet all this amounts to no more than <I>there thou 
 hast that is thine;</I> as if no more were required, or could be 
 expected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> What he confesses. He owns the burying of his talent; 
 <I>I hid thy talent in the earth.</I> He speaks as if that were no 
 great fault; nay, as if he deserved praise for his prudence in putting 
 it in a safe place, and running no hazards with it. Note, It is common 
 for people to make a very light matter of that which will be their 
 condemnation in the great day. Or, if he was conscious to himself that 
 it was his fault, it intimates how easily slothful servants will be 
 convicted in the judgment; there will need no great search for proof, 
 for <I>their own tongues shall fall upon them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> What he makes his excuse; <I>I knew that thou were a
 hard man, and I was afraid.</I> Good thought of God would beget love, 
 and that love would make us diligent and faithful; but hard thoughts of 
 God beget fear, and that fear makes us slothful and unfaithful. His 
 excuse bespeaks,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sentiments of an enemy; <I>I knew thee, that thou art a hard 
 man.</I> This was like that wicked saying of the house of Israel, 
 <I>The way of the Lord is not equal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:25">Ezek. xviii. 25</A>.

 Thus his <I>de</I>fence is his <I>of</I>fence. <I>The foolishness of
 man perverteth his way,</I> and then, as if that would mend the matter, 
 <I>his heart fretteth against the Lord.</I> This is covering the 
 transgression, as Adam, who implicitly laid the fault on God himself; 
 <I>The woman which thou gavest me.</I> Note, Carnal hearts are apt to 
 conceive false and wicked opinions concerning God, and with them to 
 harden themselves in their evil ways. Observe how confidently he 
 speaks; <I>I knew thee to be so.</I> How could he know him to be so?
 <I>What iniquity have we or our fathers found in him?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:5">Jer. ii. 5</A>.
 
 Wherein has he wearied us with his work, or deceived us in his wages?
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:3">Mic. vi. 3</A>.

 Has he <I>been a wilderness to us, or a land of darkness?</I> Thus long
 God has governed the world, and may ask with more reason than Samuel 
 himself could, <I>Whom have I defrauded? or whom have I oppressed?</I> 
 Does not all the world know the contrary, that he is so far from being 
 a hard master, that <I>the earth is full of his goodness,</I> so far 
 from reaping where he sowed not, that he sows a great deal where he 
 reaps nothing? For he <I>causes the sun to shine, and his rain to fall, 
 upon the evil and unthankful, and fills their hearts with food and 
 gladness</I> who say to the Almighty, <I>Depart from us.</I> This 
 suggestion bespeaks the common reproach which wicked people cast upon 
 God, as if all the blame of their sin and ruin lay at his door, for 
 denying them his grace; whereas it is certain that never any who 
 faithfully improved the common grace they had, perished for want of 
 special grace; nor can any show what could in reason have been done 
 more for an unfruitful vineyard than God has done in it. God does not 
 demand brick, and deny straw; no, whatever is required in the covenant, 
 is promised in the covenant; so that if we perish, it is owing to 
 ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The spirit of a slave; <I>I was afraid,</I> This ill affection 
 toward God arose from his false notions of him; and nothing is more 
 unworthy of God, nor more hinders our duty to him, than slavish fear. 
 This has bondage and torment, and is directly opposite to that entire 
 love which the great commandment requires. Note, Hard thoughts of God 
 drive us from, and cramp us in his service. Those who think it 
 impossible to please him, and in vain to serve him, will do nothing to 
 purpose in religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] His Lord's answer to this apology. His plea will stand him in no 
 stead, it is overruled, nay, it is made to turn against him, and he is 
 struck speechless with it; for here we have his conviction and his 
 condemnation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> His conviction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 Two things he is convicted of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Slothfulness; <I>Thou wicked and slothful servant.</I> Note, 
 Slothful servants are wicked servants, and will be reckoned with as 
 such by their master, for he that is <I>slothful in his work,</I> and 
 neglects the good that God has commanded, <I>is brother to him that is 
 a great waster,</I> by doing the evil that God has forbidden, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:9">Prov. xviii. 9</A>.

 He that is careless in God's work, is near akin to him that is busy in 
 the devil's work. <I>Satis est mali nihil fecisse boni--To do no good 
 is to incur very serious blame.</I> Omissions are sins, and must come 
 into judgment; slothfulness makes way for wickedness; all become 
 <I>filthy,</I> for <I>there is none that doeth good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:3">Ps. xiv. 3</A>.

 When the house is empty, the unclean spirit takes possession. Those
 that are idle in the affairs of their souls, are not only idle, but 
 something worse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:13">1 Tim. v. 13</A>.

 When men sleep, the enemy sows tares.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Self-contradiction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>);

 <I>Thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not: thou oughtest therefore
 to have put my money to the exchangers.</I> Note, The hard thoughts 
 which sinners have of God, though false and unjust, will be so far from 
 justifying their wickedness and slothfulness, that they will rather 
 aggravate and add to their guilt. Three ways this may be taken;

 (1.) "Suppose I had been so hard a master, shouldest not thou therefore
 have been the more diligent and careful to please me, if not for 
 <I>love,</I> yet for <I>fear,</I> and for that reason oughtest not thou 
 to have minded thy work?" If our God is a consuming fire, in 
 consideration of that let us study how to serve him. Or thus,

 (2.) "If thou didst think me to be a hard master, and therefore durst
 not trade with the money thyself, for fear of losing by it, and being 
 made to stand to the loss, yet thou mightest have put it into the hands 
 of the exchangers, or goldsmith, mightest have brought it into the 
 bank, and then at my coming, if I could not have had the greater 
 improvement, by trade and merchandize (as of the other talents), yet I 
 might have had the less improvement, of bare interest, and should have 
 received <I>my own with usury;</I>" which, it seems, was a common 
 practice at that time, and not disallowed by our Saviour. Note, If we 
 could not, or durst not, do what we would, yet that excuse will not 
 serve, when it will be made to appear that we did not do what we could 
 and durst. If we could not find in our hearts to venture upon more 
 difficult and hazardous services, yet will that justify us in shrinking 
 from those that were more safe and easy? Something is better than
 nothing; if we fail of showing our courage in bold enterprises, yet we 
 must not fail to testify our good will in honest endeavours; and our 
 Master <I>will not despise the day of small things.</I> Or thus,

 (3.) "Suppose I did reap <I>where I sowed not,</I> yet that is nothing
 to thee, for I had sowed upon thee, and the talent was my money which 
 thou wast entrusted with, not only to keep, but to improve." Note, In 
 the day of account, wicked and slothful servants will be left quite 
 without excuse; frivolous pleas will be overruled, and every mouth will 
 be stopped; and those who now stand so much upon their own 
 justification will not have one word to say for themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> His condemnation. The slothful servant is 
 sentenced,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To be deprived of his talent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>);

 <I>Take therefore the talent from him.</I> The talents were first
 disposed of by the Master, as an absolute Owner, but this was now 
 disposed of by him as a Judge; he takes it from the unfaithful servant, 
 to punish him, and gives it to him that was eminently faithful, to 
 reward him. And the meaning of this part of the parable we have in the 
 reason of the sentence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),
 
 <I>To every one that hath shall be given.</I> This may be applied,

 (1.) To the blessings of this life--worldly wealth and possessions.
 These we are entrusted with, to be used for the glory of God, and the 
 good of those about us. Now <I>he that hath</I> these things, and useth 
 them for these ends, he <I>shall have abundance;</I> perhaps abundance 
 of the things themselves, at least, abundance of comfort in them, and 
 of better things; but <I>from him that hath not,</I> that is, that hath 
 these things as if he had them not, had not power to eat of them, or to 
 do good with (<I>Avaro deest, tam quod habet, quam quod non habet--The 
 miser may be considered as destitute of what he has, as well as of what 
 he has not</I>), they <I>shall be taken away.</I> Solomon explains 
 this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:24">Prov. xi. 24</A>.

 <I>There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that
 withholdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to poverty.</I> Giving to
 the poor is trading with what we have, and the returns will be rich; it
 will multiply the meal in the barrel, and the oil in the cruse: but
 those that are sordid, and niggardly, and uncharitable, will find that
 those riches which are so got, <I>perish by evil travail,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:13,14">Eccl. v. 13, 14</A>.

 Sometimes Providence strangely transfers estates from those that do no
 good with them to those that do; they are <I>gathered for him that will 
 pity the poor,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:8">Prov. xxviii. 8</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:22,Job+27:16,17,Ec+2:26">Prov. xiii. 22;
 Job xxvii. 16, 17; Eccl. ii. 26</A>.

 (2.) We may apply it to the means of grace. They who are diligent in
 improving the opportunities they have, God will enlarge them, will 
 <I>set before them an open door</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:8">Rev. iii. 8</A>);

 but they who know not the day of their visitation, shall have the
 things that belong to their peace hid from their eyes. For proof of 
 this, <I>go see what God did to Shiloh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:12">Jer. vii. 12</A>.

 (3.) We may apply it to the common gifts of the Spirit. He that hath
 these, and doeth good with them, shall have abundance; these gifts 
 improve by exercise, and brighten by being used; the more we do, the 
 more we may do, in religion; but those who stir not up the gift that is 
 in them, who do not exert themselves according to their capacity, their 
 gifts rust, and decay, and go out like a neglected fire. From his that 
 hath not a living principle of grace in his soul, shall be taken away 
 the common gifts which he hath, as the lamps of the foolish virgins 
 went out for want of oil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Thus the arm of the <I>idle shepherd,</I> which he had sluggishly 
 folded up in his bosom, comes to be dried up, and his right eye, which 
 he had carelessly or wilfully shut, becomes utterly darkened, as it is 
 threatened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:17">Zech. xi. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is sentenced to be <I>cast into outer darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 
 Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His character is that of an <I>unprofitable servant.</I> Note, 
 Slothful servants will be reckoned with as unprofitable servants, who 
 do nothing to the purpose of their coming into the world, nothing to 
 answer the end of their birth or baptism, who are no way serviceable to 
 the glory of God, the good of others, or the salvation of their own 
 souls. A slothful servant is a withered member in the body, a barren 
 tree in the vineyard, an idle drone in the hive, he is good for 
 nothing. In one sense, we are all <I>unprofitable servants</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:10">Luke xvii. 10</A>);

 we cannot <I>profit God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:2">Job xxii. 2</A>.

 But to others, and to ourselves, it is required that we be profitable;
 if we be not, Christ will not own us as his servants: it is not enough
 not to do hurt, but we must do good, must bring forth fruit, and though
 thereby God is not profited, yet he is glorified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:8">John xv. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His doom is, to be <I>cast into outer darkness.</I> Here, as in
 what was said to the faithful servants, our Saviour slides insensibly 
 out of the parable into the thing intended by it, and it serves as a 
 key to the whole; for, <I>outer darkness, where there is weeping and 
 gnashing of teeth,</I> is, in Christ's discourses, the common 
 periphrasis of the miseries of the damned in hell. Their state is, 

 [1.] Very dismal; it is outer darkness. Darkness is uncomfortable and 
 frightful: it was one of the plagues of Egypt. In hell there are 
 <I>chains of darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:4">2 Pet. ii. 4</A>.

 In the dark <I>no man can work,</I> a fit punishment for a slothful
 servant. It is <I>outer</I> darkness, <I>out</I> from the light of 
 heaven, <I>out</I> from the joy of their Lord, into which the faithful 
 servants were admitted; <I>out</I> from the feast. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:12,22:13"><I>ch.</I> viii. 12; xxii. 13</A>.

 [2.] Very doleful; there is weeping, which bespeaks great sorrow, and 
 gnashing of teeth, which bespeaks great vexation and indignation. This 
 will be the portion of the slothful servant.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the
 holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his
 glory:
 &nbsp; 32  And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
 separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <I>his</I>
 sheep from the goats:
 &nbsp; 33  And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats
 on the left.
 &nbsp; 34  Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come,
 ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
 from the foundation of the world:
 &nbsp; 35  For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty,
 and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
 &nbsp; 36  Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I
 was in prison, and ye came unto me.
 &nbsp; 37  Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw
 we thee an hungred, and fed <I>thee?</I> or thirsty, and gave <I>thee</I>
 drink?
 &nbsp; 38  When saw we thee a stranger, and took <I>thee</I> in? or naked,
 and clothed <I>thee?</I>
 &nbsp; 39  Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
 &nbsp; 40  And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say
 unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done <I>it</I> unto one of the least of
 these my brethren, ye have done <I>it</I> unto me.
 &nbsp; 41  Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart
 from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
 and his angels:
 &nbsp; 42  For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty,
 and ye gave me no drink:
 &nbsp; 43  I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye
 clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
 &nbsp; 44  Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
 thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or
 in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
 &nbsp; 45  Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you,
 Inasmuch as ye did <I>it</I> not to one of the least of these, ye did
 <I>it</I> not to me.
 &nbsp; 46  And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
 righteous into life eternal.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a description of the process of the last judgment in the 
 great day. There are some passages in it that are parabolical; as the 
 separating between the sheep and the goats, and the dialogues between 
 the judge and the persons judged: but there is no thread of similitude 
 carried through the discourse, and therefore it is rather to be called 
 a draught or delineation of the final judgment, than a parable; it is, 
 as it were, the explanation of the former parables. And here we 
 have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The placing of the judge upon the judgment-seat 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>);

 <I>When the Son of man shall come.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That there is a judgment to come, in which every man shall be 
 sentenced to a state of everlasting happiness, or misery, in the world 
 of recompence or retribution, according to what he did in this world of 
 trial and probation, which is to be judged of by the rule of the 
 everlasting gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The administration of the judgment of the great day is committed to 
 the Son of man; for by him God will judge the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:31">Acts xvii. 31</A>),

 and to him all judgment is committed, and therefore the judgment of
 that day, which is the centre of all. Here, as elsewhere, when the last 
 judgment is spoken of, Christ is called <I>the son of man,</I> because 
 he is to judge the sons of men (and, being himself of the same nature, 
 he is the more unexceptionable); and because his wonderful 
 condescension to take upon him our nature, and to become the son of 
 man, will be recompensed by this exaltation in that day, and an honour 
 put upon the human nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ's appearing to judge the world will be splendid and glorious. 
 Agrippa and Bernice came to the judgment-seat with <I>great pomp</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:23">Acts xxv. 23</A>);

 but that was (as the original word is) <I>great fancy.</I> Christ will
 come to the judgment-seat in real glory: the Sun of righteousness shall 
 then shine in his meridian lustre, and the Prince of the kings of the 
 earth shall show the riches of his glorious kingdom, and the honours of 
 his excellent majesty; and all the world shall see what the saints only 
 do now believe--that he is the brightness of his Father's glory. He 
 shall come not only in the glory of his Father, but in his own glory, 
 as mediator: his first coming was under a black cloud of obscurity; his 
 second will be in a bright cloud of glory. The assurance Christ gave 
 his disciples of his future glory, might help to take off the offence 
 of the cross, and his approaching disgrace and suffering.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. When Christ comes in his glory to judge the world, he will bring all 
 his holy angels with him. This glorious person will have a glorious 
 retinue, his holy myriads, who will be not only his attendants, but 
 ministers of his justice; they shall come with him both for state and 
 service. They must come to call the court 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:16">1 Thess. iv. 16</A>),

 to gather the elect

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:31"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 31</A>),
 
 to bundle the tares 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:40"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 40</A>),

 to be witnesses of the saints' glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:8">Luke xii. 8</A>),

 and of sinners' misery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:10">Rev. xiv. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He will then sit upon the throne of his glory. He is <I>now</I> set 
 down with the Father upon his throne; and it is a throne of grace, to 
 which we may come boldly; it is a throne of government, the throne of 
 his father David; he is a priest upon that throne: but <I>then</I> he 
 will sit upon the throne of glory, the throne of judgment. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:9,10">Dan. vii. 9, 10</A>.

 Solomon's throne, though there was not its like in any
 kingdom, was but a dunghill to it. Christ, in the days of his flesh, 
 was arraigned as a prisoner at the bar; but at his second coming, he 
 will sit as a judge upon the bench.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The appearing of all the children of men before him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);
 
 <I>Before him shall be gathered all nations.</I> Note, The judgment of
 the great day will be a general judgment. All must be summoned before 
 Christ's tribunal; all of every age of the world, from the beginning to 
 the end of time; all of every place on earth, even from the remotest 
 corners of the world, most obscure, and distant from each other; all 
 nations, all those nations of men that are made of one blood, to dwell 
 on all the face of the earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The distinction that will then be made between the precious and 
 the vile; <I>He shall separate them one from another,</I> as the tares 
 and wheat are separated at the harvest, the good fish and the bad at 
 the shore, the corn and chaff in the floor. Wicked and godly here
 dwell together in the same kingdoms, cities, churches, families, and 
 are not certainly distinguishable one from another; such are the 
 infirmities of saints, such the hypocrisies of sinners, and one event 
 to both: but in that day they will be separated, and parted for ever; 
 <I>Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the 
 wicked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:18">Mal. iii. 18</A>.

 They cannot separate themselves one from another in this world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:10">1 Cor. v. 10</A>),

 nor can any one else separate them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:29"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 29</A>);

 but the Lord knows them that are his, and he can separate them. This
 separation will be so exact, that the most inconsiderable saints shall 
 not be lost in the crowd of sinners, nor the most plausible sinner hid 
 in the crowd of saints 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:5">Ps. i. 5</A>),

 but every one shall go to his own place. This is compared to a
 shepherd's dividing between the sheep and the goats; it is taken from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:17">Ezek. xxxiv. 17</A>,
 
 <I>Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle.</I> Note, 

 1. Jesus Christ is the great Shepherd; he now feeds his flock like a
 shepherd, and will shortly distinguish between those that are his, and
 those that are not, as Laban divided his sheep from Jacob's, and set
 three days' journey between them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:35,36">Gen. xxx. 35, 36</A>.

 2. The godly are like sheep--innocent, mild, patient, useful: the
 wicked are like goats, a baser kind of animal, unsavoury and unruly.
 The sheep and goats are here feeding all day in the same pasture, but
 will be coted at night in different folds. Being thus divided, he will
 set the <I>sheep on his right hand,</I> and the <I>goats on his 
 left,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Christ puts honour upon the godly, as we show respect to those we set 
 on our right hand; but the wicked shall rise to everlasting shame, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:2">Dan. xii. 2</A>.

 It is not said that he shall put the rich on his right hand, and the
 poor on his left; the learned and noble on his right hand, and 
 unlearned and despised on his left; but the godly on his right hand, 
 and the wicked on his left. All other divisions and subdivisions will 
 then be abolished; but the great distinction of men into saints and 
 sinners, sanctified and unsanctified, will remain for ever, and men's 
 eternal state will be determined by it. The wicked took up with 
 left-handed blessings, riches and honour, and so shall their doom 
 be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The process of the judgement concerning each of these.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning the godly, on the right hand. Their cause must be first 
 despatched, that they may be assessors with Christ in the judgement of 
 the wicked, whose misery will be aggravated by their seeing Abraham, 
 and Isaac, and Jacob, admitted into the kingdom of heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:28">Luke xiii. 28</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>glory</I> conferred upon them; the sentence by which they 
 shall be not only acquitted, but preferred and rewarded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 <I>The king shall say unto them.</I> He that was the Shepherd (which
 bespeaks the care and tenderness wherewith he will make this 
 disquisition), is here the King, which bespeaks the authority wherewith 
 he will then pronounce the sentence: where the word of this King is, 
 there is power. Here are two things in this sentence:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The acknowledging of the saints to be the blessed of the Lord; 
 <I>Come, ye blessed of my Father. First,</I> He pronounces them 
 <I>blessed;</I> and his saying they are blessed, makes them so. The law 
 curses them for their many discontinuances; but Christ having redeemed 
 them from the curse of the law, and purchased a blessing for them, 
 commands a blessing on them. <I>Secondly, Blessed of his Father;</I> 
 reproached and cursed by the world, but blessed of God. As the Spirit 
 glorifies the Son 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:14">John xvi. 14</A>),

 so the Son glorifies the Father by referring the salvation of the
 saints to him as the First Cause; all our blessings in heavenly things
 flow to us from God, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:3">Eph. i. 3</A>.
 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> He calls them <I>to come:</I> this <I>come</I> is, in
 effect, "<I>Welcome,</I> ten thousand welcomes, to the blessings of my 
 father; come to me, come to be for ever with me; you that followed me 
 bearing the cross, now come along with me wearing the crown. The 
 blessed of my Father are the beloved of my soul, that have been too 
 long at a distance from me; come, now, come into my bosom, come into my 
 arms, come into my dearest embraces!" O with what joy will this fill 
 the hearts of the saints in that day! We now come boldly to the throne 
 of grace, but we shall then come boldly to the throne of glory; and 
 this word holds out the golden sceptre, with an assurance that our 
 requests shall be granted to more than the half of the kingdom. Now the 
 Spirit saith, <I>Come,</I> in the word; and the bride saith, 
 <I>Come,</I> in prayer; and the result hereof is a sweet communion: but 
 the perfection of bliss will be, when <I>the King shall say, 
 Come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The admission of the saints into the blessedness and kingdom of 
 the Father; <I>Inherit the kingdom prepared for you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> the happiness they shall be possessed of is very rich; we
 are told what it is by him who had reason to know it, having purchased 
 it for them, and possessed it himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is a <I>kingdom;</I> which is reckoned the most valuable 
 possession on earth, and includes the greatest wealth and honour. Those 
 that inherit kingdoms, wear all the glories of the crown, enjoy all the 
 pleasures of the court, and command the peculiar treasures of the 
 provinces; yet this is but a faint resemblance of the felicities of the 
 saints in heaven. They that here are beggars, prisoners, accounted as 
 the off-scouring of all things, shall then inherit a kingdom, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:7,Re+2:26,27">Ps. cxiii. 7; Rev. ii. 26, 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is a kingdom <I>prepared:</I> the happiness must needs be great,
 for it is the product of the divine counsels. Note, There is great 
 preparation made for the entertainment of the saints in the kingdom of 
 glory. The Father designed it for them in his thoughts of love, and 
 provided it for them in the greatness of his wisdom and power. The Son 
 purchased it for them, and is entered as the fore-runner to prepare a 
 place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:2">John xiv. 2</A>.

 And the blessed Spirit, in preparing them for the kingdom, in effect,
 is preparing it for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is prepared <I>for them.</I> This bespeaks, 

 (1.) The suitableness of this happiness; it is in all points adapted to
 the nature of a soul, and to the new nature of a a sanctified soul.

 (2.) Their property and interest in it. It is prepared on purpose for
 them; not only for such as you, but for you, you by name, you 
 personally and particularly, who were chosen to salvation through 
 sanctification.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. It is prepared <I>from the foundation of the world.</I> This 
 happiness was designed for the saints, and they for it, before time 
 began, from all eternity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:4">Eph. i. 4</A>.

 The end, which is last in execution, is first in intention. Infinite
 Wisdom had an eye to the eternal glorification of the saints, from the 
 first founding of the creation: <I>All things are for your sakes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:15">2 Cor. iv. 15</A>.

 Or, it denotes the preparation of the place of this happiness, which is
 to be the seat and habitation of the blessed, in the very beginning of 
 the work of creation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:1">Gen. i. 1</A>.

 There in the heaven of heavens the morning stars were singing together,
 when the foundations of the earth were fastened,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:4-7">Job xxxviii. 4-7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The tenure by which they shall hold and possess it is 
 very good, they shall come and <I>inherit it.</I> What we come to by 
 inheritance, is not got by any procurement of our own, but purely, as 
 the lawyers express it, <I>by the act of God.</I> It is God that makes 
 heirs, heirs of heaven. We come to an inheritance by virtue of our 
 sonship, our adoption; <I>if children, then heirs.</I> A title by 
 inheritance is the sweetest and surest title; it alludes to possessions 
 in the land of Canaan, which passed by inheritance, and would not be 
 alienated longer than to the year of Jubilee. Thus is the heavenly 
 inheritance indefeasible, and unalienable. Saints, in this world, are 
 as heirs under age, tutored and governed till the time appointed of the
 Father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:1,2">Gal. iv. 1, 2</A>);

 and then they shall be put in full possession of that which now through
 grace they have a title to; <I>Come,</I> and inherit it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The ground of this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:35,36"><I>v.</I> 35, 36</A>),

 <I>For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat.</I> We cannot hence
 infer that any good words of ours merit the happiness of heaven, by any 
 intrinsic worth or excellency in them: our goodness extends not unto 
 God; but it is plain that Jesus Christ will judge the world by the same 
 rule by which he governs it, and therefore will reward those that have 
 been obedient to that law; and mention will be made of their obedience, 
 not as their title, but as their evidence of an interest in Christ, and 
 his purchase. This happiness will be adjudged to obedient believers, 
 not upon a <I>quantum meruit--an estimate of merit,</I> which supposes 
 a proportion between the work and the reward, but upon the promise of 
 God purchased by Jesus Christ, and the benefit of it secured under 
 certain provisos and limitations; and it is the purchase and promise 
 that give the title, the obedience is only the qualification of the 
 person designed. An estate made by deed or will upon condition, when 
 the condition is performed according to the true intent of the donor or 
 testator, becomes absolute; and then, though the title be built purely 
 upon the deed or will, yet the performing of the condition must be 
 given in evidence: and so it comes in here; for Christ is the Author of 
 eternal salvation to those only that obey him, and who patiently 
 continue in well doing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the good works here mentioned are such as we commonly call works of 
 charity to the poor: not but that many will be found on the right hand 
 who never were in a capacity to feed the hungry, or clothe the naked, 
 but were themselves fed and clothed by the charity of others; but one 
 instance of sincere obedience is put for all the rest, and it teaches 
 us this in general, that faith working by love is all in all in 
 Christianity; <I>Show me thy faith by thy works;</I> and nothing will 
 abound to a good account hereafter, but the fruits of righteousness in 
 a good conversation now. The good works here described imply three 
 things, which must be found in all that are saved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Self-denial, and contempt of the world; reckoning the things of 
 the world no further good things, than as we are enabled to do good 
 with them: and those who have not wherewithal to do good, must show the 
 same disposition, by being contentedly and cheerfully poor. Those are 
 fit for heaven that are mortified to the earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Love to our brethren; which is the second great commandment, the 
 fulfilling of the law, and an excellent preparative for the world of 
 everlasting love. We must give proof of this love by our readiness to 
 do good, and to communicate; good wishes are but mockeries without good 
 works, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:15,16,1Jo+3:17">Jam. ii. 15, 16; 1 John iii. 17</A>.

 Those that have not to give, must show the same disposition some other
 way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] A believing regard to Jesus Christ. That which is here rewarded is 
 the relieving of the poor for Christ's sake, out of love to him, and 
 with an eye to him. <I>This</I> puts an excellency upon the good work, 
 when in it we serve the Lord Christ, which those may do that work for 
 their own living, as well as those that help to keep others alive. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:5-7">Eph. vi. 5-7</A>.

 Those good works shall then be accepted which are done in the name of
 the Lord Jesus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:17">Col. iii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>I was hungry,</I> that is, my disciples and followers were so, 
 either by the persecutions of enemies for well-doing, or by the common 
 dispensations of Providence; for in these things there is one event to 
 the righteous and wicked: and <I>you gave them meat.</I> Note, 
 <I>First,</I> Providence so variously orders and disposes of the 
 circumstances of his people in this world, as that while some are in a 
 condition to give relief, others need it. It is no new thing for those 
 that are feasted with the dainties of heaven to be hungry and thirsty, 
 and to want daily food; for those that are at home in God, to be 
 strangers in a strange land; for those that have put on Christ, to want 
 clothes to keep them warm; for those that have healthful souls, to have 
 sickly bodies; and for those to be in prison, that Christ has made 
 free. <I>Secondly,</I> Works of charity and beneficence, according as 
 our ability is, are necessary to salvation; and there will be more 
 stress laid upon them in the judgment of the great day, than is 
 commonly imagined; these must be the proofs of our love, and of our 
 professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:13">2 Cor. ix. 13</A>.

 But they that show no mercy, shall have judgment without mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this reason is modestly excepted against by the righteous, but is 
 explained by the Judge himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is questioned by the righteous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:37-39"><I>v.</I> 37-39</A>.

 Not as if they were loth to inherit the kingdom, or were ashamed of 
 their good deeds, or had not the testimony of their own consciences 
 concerning them: but,

 (1.) The expressions are parabolical, designed to introduce and impress
 these great truths, that Christ has a mighty regard to works of 
 charity, and is especially pleased with kindnesses done to his people 
 for his sake. Or, 

 (2.) They bespeak the humble admiration which glorified saints will be
 filled with, to find such poor and worthless services, as theirs are,
 so highly celebrated, and richly rewarded: <I>Lord, when saw we thee an
 hungered, and fed thee?</I> Note, Gracious souls are apt to think
 meanly of their own good deeds; especially as unworthy to be compared
 with the glory that shall be revealed. Far from this is the temper of
 those who said, <I>Wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest not?</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:3">Isa. lviii. 3</A>.

 Saints in heaven will wonder what brought them thither, and that God
 should so regard them and their services. It even put Nathanael to the
 blush, to hear Christ's encomium of him: <I>Whence knowest thou me?</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:47,48">John i. 47, 48</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:20">Eph. iii. 20</A>.

 "<I>When saw we thee an hungered?</I> We have seen the poor in distress
 many a time; but when saw we thee?" Note, Christ is more among us than 
 we think he is; surely the Lord is in this place, by his word, his 
 ordinances, his ministers, his Spirit, yea, and his poor, and we know 
 it not: <I>When thou wert under the fig-tree, I saw thee,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:48">John i. 48</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is explained by the Judge himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>);

 <I>Inasmuch as ye have done it to these my brethren,</I> to the least,
 to one of the least of them, <I>ye have done it unto me.</I> The good 
 works of the saints, when they are produced in the great day,

 (1.) Shall all be remembered; and not the least, not one of the least,
 overlooked, no not a cup of cold water.

 (2.) They shall be interpreted most to their advantage, and the best
 construction that can be put upon them. As Christ makes the best of 
 their infirmities, so he makes the most of their services.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We see what recompences Christ has for those that feed the hungry, and 
 clothe the naked; but what will become of the godly poor, that had not 
 wherewithal to do so? Must they be shut out? No, 

 [1.] Christ will own them, even the least of them, as his brethren; he 
 will not be ashamed, nor think it any disparagement to him, <I>to call 
 them brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:11">Heb. ii. 11</A>.

 In the height of his glory, he will not disown his poor relations;
 Lazarus is there laid in his bosom, as a friend, as a brother. Thus he 
 will confess them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:32"><I>ch.</I> x. 32</A>.

 [2.] He will take the kindness done to them, as done to himself; <I>Ye 
 have done it unto me;</I> which shows a respect to the poor that were 
 relieved, as well as to the rich that did relieve them. Note, Christ 
 espouses his people's cause, and interests himself in their interests, 
 and reckons himself received, and love, and owned in them. If Christ 
 himself were among us in poverty, how readily would we relieve him? In 
 prison, how frequently would we visit him? We are ready to envy the 
 honour they had, who ministered to him of their substance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:3">Luke viii. 3</A>.
 
 Wherever poor saints and poor ministers are, there Christ is ready to
 receive our kindnesses in them, and they shall be put to his 
 account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is the process concerning the wicked, those on the left hand.
 And in that we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The sentence passed upon them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:41">v. 41</A>.

 It was a disgrace to be set on the left hand; but that is not the worst
 of it, he shall say to them, <I>Depart from me, ye cursed.</I> Every 
 word has terror in it, like that of the trumpet at mount Sinai, waxing 
 louder and louder, every accent more and more doleful, and exclusive of 
 comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] To be so near to Christ was some satisfaction, though under his 
 frowns; but that will not be allowed, <I>Depart from me.</I> In this 
 world they were often called to come to Christ, to come for life and 
 rest, but they turned a deaf ear to his calls; justly therefore are 
 they bid to depart from Christ, that would not come to him. "Depart 
 from me the Fountain of all good, from me the Saviour, and therefore 
 from all hope of salvation; I will never have any thing more to say to 
 you, or do with you." Here they said to the Almighty, <I>Depart from 
 us;</I> then he will <I>choose their delusions,</I> and say to them, 
 <I>Depart from me.</I> Note, It is the hell of hell to depart from 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] If they must depart, and depart from Christ, might they not be 
 dismissed with a blessing, with one kind and compassionate word at 
 least? No, <I>Depart, ye cursed,</I> They that would not come to 
 Christ, to inherit a blessing, must depart from him under the burthen 
 of a curse, that curse of the law on every one that breaks it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Gal+3:10">Gal. iii. 10</A>.

 <I>As they loved cursing, so it shall come unto them.</I> But observe,
 The righteous are called <I>the blessed of my Father;</I> for their 
 blessedness is owing purely to the grace of God and his blessing, but 
 the wicked are called only <I>ye cursed,</I> for their damnation is of 
 themselves. Hath God sold them? No, they have sold themselves, have 
 laid themselves under the curse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:1">Isa. l. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] If they must depart, and depart with a curse, may they not go into 
 some place of ease and rest? Will it not be misery enough for them to 
 bewail their loss? No, there is a punishment of sense as well as loss; 
 they must depart into <I>fire,</I> into torment as grievous as that of 
 fire is to the body, and much more. This fire is the wrath of the 
 eternal God fastening upon the guilty souls and consciences of sinners 
 that have made themselves fuel for it. Our God is a consuming fire, and 
 sinners fall immediately into his hands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:31,Ro+2:8,9">Heb. x. 31; Rom. ii. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] If into fire, may it not be some light or gentle fire? No, it is 
 <I>prepared</I> fire; it is a torment <I>ordained of old,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:33">Isa. xxx. 33</A>.

 The damnation of sinners is often spoken of as an act of the divine
 power; <I>he is able to cast into hell.</I> In the vessels of wrath he 
 makes his power known; it is a <I>destruction from the presence of the 
 Lord, and from the glory of his power.</I> In it shall be seen what a 
 provoked God can do to make a provoking creature miserable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [5.] If into fire, prepared fire, O let it be but of short continuance, 
 let them but pass <I>through</I> fire; no, the fire of God's wrath will 
 be an <I>everlasting</I> fire; a fire, that, fastening and preying upon 
 immortal souls, can never go out for want of fuel; and, being kindled 
 and kept burning by the wrath of an immortal God, can never go out for 
 want of being blown and stirred up; and, the streams of mercy and grace 
 being for ever excluded, there is nothing to extinguish it. If a drop 
 of water be denied to cool the tongue, buckets of water will never be 
 granted to quench this flame.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [6.] If they must be doomed to such a state of endless misery, yet may 
 they not have some good company there? No, none but <I>the devil and 
 his angels,</I> their sworn enemies, that helped to bring them to this 
 misery, and will triumph over them in it. They served the devil while
 they lived, and therefore are justly sentenced to be where he is, as 
 those that served Christ, are taken to be with him where he is. It is 
 terrible to lie in a house haunted with devils; what will it be then to 
 be companions with them for ever? Observe here, <I>First,</I> Christ 
 intimates that there is one that is the prince of the devils, the 
 ring-leader of the rebellion, and that the rest are his angels, his 
 messengers, by whose agency he supports his kingdom. Christ and his 
 angels will in that day triumph over the dragon and his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:7,8">Rev. xii. 7, 8</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> The fire is said to be prepared, not primarily for the 
 wicked, as the kingdom is prepared for the righteous; but it was 
 originally intended for <I>the devil and his angels.</I> If sinners 
 make themselves associates with Satan by indulging their lusts, they 
 may thank themselves if they become sharers in that misery which was 
 prepared for him and his associates. Calvin notes upon this, that 
 <I>therefore</I> the torment of the damned is said to be <I>prepared 
 for the devil and his angels,</I> to cut off all hope of escaping it; 
 the devil and his angels are already made prisoners in the pit, and can 
 worms of the earth think to escape?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The reason of this sentence assigned. God's judgments are all 
 just, and he will be justified in them. He is Judge himself, and 
 therefore <I>the heavens shall declare his righteousness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 [1.] All that is charged upon them, on which the sentence is grounded, 
 is, omission; as, before, the servant was condemned, not for wasting 
 his talent, but for burying it; so here, he doth not say, "I was hungry 
 and thirsty, for you took my meat and drink from me; I was a stranger, 
 for you banished me; naked, for you stripped me; in prison, for you 
 laid me there:" but, "When I was in these distresses, you were so 
 selfish, so taken up with your own ease and pleasure, made so much of 
 your labour, and were so loth to part with your money, that you did not 
 <I>minister</I> as you might have done to my relief and succour. You
 were like those epicures that were at ease in Zion, and were not 
 <I>grieved for the affliction of Joseph,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:4-6">Amos vi. 4-6</A>.

 Note, Omissions are the ruin of thousands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It is the omission of works of charity to the poor. They are not
 sentenced for omitting their sacrifices and burnt-offerings (they 
 abounded in these, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:8">Ps. l. 8</A>),

 but for omitting the weightier matter of the law, <I>judgment, mercy,
 and faith.</I> The Ammonites and Moabites were excluded the sanctuary,
 because they <I>met not Israel with bread and water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:3,4">Deut. xxiii. 3, 4</A>.
 
 Note, Uncharitableness to the poor is a damning sin. If we will not be
 brought to works of charity by the hope of reward, let us be influenced 
 by fear of punishment; for <I>they shall have judgment without mercy, 
 that have showed no mercy.</I> Observe, He doth not say, "I was sick, 
 and you did not cure me; in prison, and you did not release me" 
 (perhaps that was more than they could do); but, "You <I>visited me 
 not,</I> which you might have done." Note, Sinners will be condemned, 
 at the great day, for the omission of that good which it was in the 
 power of their hand to do. But if the doom of the uncharitable be so 
 dreadful, how much more intolerable will the doom of the cruel be, the 
 doom of persecutors! Now this reason of the sentence is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Objected against by the prisoners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>);

 <I>Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, or athirst?</I> Condemned
 sinners, though they have no plea that will bear them out, will yet in 
 vain offer at excuses. Now. 

 1. The manner of their pleading bespeaks their present precipitation.
 They cut it short, as men in haste; <I>when saw we thee hungry, or 
 thirsty, or naked?</I> They care not to repeat the charge, as conscious 
 to themselves of their own guilt, and unable to bear the terrors of the 
 judgment. Nor will they have time allowed them to insist upon such 
 frivolous pleas; for it is all (as we say) but "trifling with the 
 court." 

 2. The matter of their plea bespeaks their former inconsideration of
 that which they might have known, but would not till now that it was 
 too late. They that had slighted and persecuted poor Christians, would 
 not own that they had slighted and persecuted Christ: no, they never 
 intended any affront to him, nor expected that so great a matter would 
 have been made of it. They imagined it was only a company of poor,
 weak, silly, and contemptible people, who made more ado than needed 
 about religion, that they put those slights upon; but they who do so, 
 will be made to know, either in the day of their conversion, as Paul, 
 or of their condemnation, as these here, that it was <I>Jesus whom they 
 persecuted.</I> And, if they say, <I>Behold, we knew it not: doth not 
 he that pondereth the heart consider it?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:11,12">Prov. xxiv. 11, 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Justified by the Judge, who will convince all the 
 ungodly of the hard speeches spoken against him in those that are his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:15">Jude 15</A>.

 He goes by this rule 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>);

 <I>Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it
 not to me.</I> Note, What is done against the faithful disciples and 
 followers of Christ, even the least of them, he takes as done against 
 himself. He is reproached and persecuted in them, for they are 
 reproached and persecuted for his sake, and <I>in all their afflictions 
 he is afflicted.</I> He that touches them, touches him in a part no 
 less tender than the apple of his eye.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is the execution of both these sentences, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.
 
 Execution is the life of the law, and Christ will take care that that 
 be done according to the sentence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>The wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment.</I> 
 Sentence will then be executed speedily, and no reprieve granted, nor 
 any time allowed to move in arrest of judgment. The execution of the 
 wicked is first mentioned; for first the tares are gathered and burned. 
 Note, 

 (1.) The punishment of the wicked in the future state will be an
 everlasting punishment, for that state is an unalterable state. It can 
 neither be thought that sinners should change their own natures, nor 
 that God should give his grace to change them, when in this world the 
 day of grace was misspent, the Spirit of grace resisted, and the means 
 of grace abused and baffled.

 (2.) The wicked shall be made to <I>go</I> away into that punishment;
 not that they will go voluntarily, no, they are <I>driven</I> from 
 light into darkness; but it bespeaks an irresistible conviction of 
 guilt, and a final despair of mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>The righteous shall go away into life eternal;</I> that is, they 
 shall <I>inherit the kingdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Note,

 (1.) Heaven is life, it is all happiness. The life of the soul results
 from its union with God by the mediation of Jesus Christ, as that of 
 the body from its union with the soul by the animal spirits. The 
 heavenly life consists in the vision and fruition of God, in a perfect 
 conformity to him, and an immediate uninterrupted communion with him.

 (2.) It is <I>eternal</I> life. There is no death to put a period to
 the life itself, nor old age to put a period to the comfort of it, or 
 any sorrow to embitter it. Thus life and death, good and evil, the
 blessing and the curse, are set before us, that we may choose our way; 
 and so shall our end be. Even the heathen had some notion of these 
 different states of good and bad in the other world. Cicero in his 
 <I>Tusculan Questions,</I> lib. 1, brings in Socrates thus speaking, 
 <I>Du&aelig; sunt vi&aelig;, duplicesque cursus &egrave; corpore 
 exeuntium: nam qui se vitiis humanis contaminarunt, et libidinibus se 
 tradiderunt, iis devium quoddam iter est, seclusum &agrave; consilio 
 deorum; qui autem se integros castosque servarunt, quibusque fuerit 
 minima cum corporibus contagio, suntque in corporibus humanis vitam 
 imitati deorum, iis ad illos a quibus sunt profecti facile patet 
 reditus--Two paths open before those who depart out of the body. Such 
 as have contaminated themselves with human vices, and yielded to their 
 lusts, occupy a path that conducts them far from the assembly and 
 council of the gods; but the upright and chaste, such as have been 
 least defiled by the flesh, and have imitated, while in the body, the 
 gods, these find it easy to return to the sublime beings from whom they 
 came.</I></P>
