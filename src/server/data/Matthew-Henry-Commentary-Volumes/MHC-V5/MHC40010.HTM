 This chapter is an ordination sermon, which our Lord Jesus preached, 
 when he advanced his twelve disciples to the degree and dignity of 
 apostles. In the close of the foregoing chapter, he had stirred up them 
 and others to pray that God would send forth labourers, and here we 
 have an immediate answer to that prayer: while they are yet speaking he
 hears and performs. What we pray for, according to Christ's direction, 
 shall be given, Now here we have, 

 I. The general commission that was given them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. The names of the persons to whom this commission was given, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 III. The instructions that were given them, which are very full and
 particular; 

 1. Concerning the services they were to do; their preaching; their
 working miracles; to whom they must apply themselves; how they must
 behave themselves; and in what method they must proceed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:5-15">ver. 5-15</A>.

 2. Concerning the sufferings they were to undergo. They are told what
 they should suffer, and from whom; counsels are given them what course 
 to take when persecuted, and encouragements to bear up cheerfully under 
 their sufferings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:16-42">ver. 16-42</A>.

 These things, though primarily intended for direction to the apostles, 
 are of use to all Christ's ministers, with whom, by his word, Christ, 
 and will be always to end the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And when he had called unto <I>him</I> his twelve disciples, he
 gave them power <I>against</I> unclean spirits, to cast them out, and
 to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.
 &nbsp; 2  Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first,
 Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James <I>the
 son</I> of Zebedee, and John his brother;
 &nbsp; 3  Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican;
 James <I>the son</I> of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, whose surname was
 Thaddeus;
 &nbsp; 4  Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
 him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we are told, 

 I. Who they were that Christ ordained to be his apostles or 
 ambassadors; they were his disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He had called them some time before to be disciples, his immediate 
 followers and constant attendants, and he then told them that they 
 should be made fishers of men, which promise he now performed. Note, 
 Christ commonly confers honours and graces by degrees; the light of 
 both, like that of the morning, <I>shines more and more.</I> All this 
 while Christ had kept these twelve,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In a state of probation. Though he knows what is in man, though he 
 knew from the first what was in them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:7">John vi. 70</A>),

 yet he took this method to give an example to his church. Note, The
 ministry being a great trust, it is fit that men should be tried for a
 time, before they are entrusted with it. Let them <I>first be
 proved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:10">1 Tim. iii. 10</A>.

 Therefore, hands must not be laid suddenly on any man, but let him
 first be observed as a candidate and probationer, a proposant (that is
 the term the French churches use), because some men's sins go before,
 others follow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:22">1 Tim. v. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In a state of preparation. All this while he had been fitting them 
 for this great work. Note, Those whom Christ intends for, and calls to, 
 any work, he first prepares and qualifies, in some measure, for it. He 
 prepared them, 

 (1.) By <I>taking them to be with him.</I> Note, The best preparative 
 for the work of the ministry, is an acquaintance and communion with 
 Jesus Christ. They that would <I>serve Christ,</I> must first be 
 <I>with him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:26">John xii. 26</A>).

 Paul had Christ revealed, not only <I>to him,</I> but <I>in him,</I> 
 before he went to preach him among the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:16">Gal. i. 16</A>.

 By the lively acts of faith, and the frequent exercise of prayer and
 meditation, that fellowship with Christ must be maintained and kept up, 
 which is a requisite qualification for the work of the ministry.

 (2.) By <I>teaching them;</I> they were with him as scholars or pupils, 
 and he taught them privately, besides the benefit they derived from his 
 public preaching; he opened the scriptures to them, and opened their 
 understandings to understand the scriptures: to them it was given to 
 <I>know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,</I> and to them they 
 were <I>made plain.</I> Note, They that design to be teachers must 
 first be learners; they must receive, that they may give; they must be 
 <I>able to teach others,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:2">2 Tim. ii. 2</A>.

 Gospel truths must be first committed to them, before they be
 commissioned to be gospel ministers. To give men <I>authority</I> to
 teach others, that have not an <I>ability,</I> is but a mockery to God 
 and the church; it is <I>sending a message by the hand of a fool,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:6">Prov. xxvi. 6</A>.

 Christ <I>taught his disciples</I> before he sent them forth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:2"><I>ch.</I> v. 2</A>),

 and afterwards, when he enlarged their commission, he gave them more
 ample instructions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:3">Acts i. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the commission was that he gave them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He <I>called them to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He had called them to come <I>after</I> him before; now he calls them 
 to come <I>to</I> him, admits them to a greater familiarity, and will 
 not have them to keep at such a distance as they had hitherto observed.
 They that <I>humble themselves</I> shall thus be <I>exalted.</I> The 
 priests under the law were said to <I>draw near</I> and <I>approach</I> 
 unto God, nearer than the people; the same may be said of gospel 
 ministers; they are called to draw near to Christ, which, as it is an 
 honour, so should strike an awe upon them, remembering that Christ will 
 be sanctified in those that <I>come nigh unto him.</I> It is 
 observable, that when the disciples were to be <I>instructed,</I> they 
 <I>came unto</I> him of their own accord,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:1"><I>ch.</I> v. 1</A>.

 But now they were to be <I>ordained,</I> he <I>called them.</I> Note,
 It well becomes the disciples of Christ to be more forward to learn 
 than to teach. In the sense of our own ignorance, we must seek 
 opportunities to be taught; and in the same sense we must <I>wait for a 
 call,</I> a clear call, ere we take upon us to <I>teach others;</I> for 
 <I>no man ought to take this honour to himself.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He <I>gave them power,</I> <B><I>exousian</I></B>, <I>authority</I> 
 in his name, to command men to obedience, and for the confirmation of 
 that authority, to command devils too into a subjection. Note, All 
 rightful authority is derived from Jesus Christ. All power is given to 
 him without limitation, and the subordinate powers that be are ordained 
 of him. Some of his honour he put on his ministers, as Moses put some 
 of his on Joshua. Note, It is an undeniable proof of the fulness of 
 power which Christ used as Mediator, that he could impart his power to 
 those he employed, and enable them to work the same miracles that he 
 wrought in his name. He gave them <I>power over unclean spirits,</I> 
 and over <I>all manner of sickness.</I> Note, The design of the gospel 
 was to <I>conquer the devil</I> and to <I>cure the world.</I> These 
 preachers were sent out destitute of all external advantages to 
 recommend them; they had no wealth, nor learning, nor titles of honour, 
 and they made a very mean figure; it was therefore requisite that they 
 should have some extraordinary power to advance them above the 
 scribes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He gave them power <I>against unclean spirits, to cast them 
 out.</I> Note, The power that is committed to the ministers of Christ, 
 is directly levelled against the devil and his kingdom. The devil, as 
 an <I>unclean spirit,</I> is working both in doctrinal errors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:13">Rev. xvi. 13</A>),
 
 and in practical debauchery 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:10">2 Pet. ii. 10</A>);

 and in both these, ministers have a charge against him. Christ gave 
 them power to cast him out of the bodies of people; but that was to 
 signify the destruction of his <I>spiritual kingdom,</I> and all the 
 works of the devil; for which purpose the <I>Son of God</I> was 
 <I>manifested.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He gave them power to <I>heal all manner of sickness.</I> He 
 authorized them to work miracles for the confirmation of their 
 doctrine, to prove that it was of God; and they were to work useful 
 miracles for the illustration of it, to prove that it is not only 
 faithful, but well <I>worthy of all acceptation;</I> that the design of 
 the gospel is to heal and save. Moses's miracles were many of them for 
 destruction; those Mahomet pretended to, were for ostentation; but the 
 miracles Christ wrought, and appointed his apostles to work, were all 
 for edification, and evince him to be, not only the great Teacher and 
 Ruler, but the great Redeemer, of the world. Observe what an emphasis 
 is laid upon the extent of their power to <I>all manner of 
 sickness,</I> and <I>all manner of disease,</I> without the exception 
 even of those that are reckoned incurable, and the reproach of 
 physicians. Note, In the grace of the gospel there is a salve for every 
 sore, a remedy for every malady. There is no spiritual disease so 
 malignant, so inveterate, but there is a sufficiency of power in 
 Christ, for the cure of it. Let none therefore say there is no hope, or 
 that the breach is wide as the sea, that cannot be healed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The number and names of those that were commissioned; they are 
 made apostles, that is, messengers. An angel, and an apostle, both 
 signify the same thing--one <I>sent on an errand,</I> an ambassador. All
 faithful ministers are sent of Christ, but they that were first, and 
 immediately, sent by him, are eminently called <I>apostles,</I> the 
 prime ministers of state in his kingdom. Yet this was but the infancy 
 of their office; it was when Christ <I>ascended on high</I> that he 
 <I>gave some apostles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:11">Eph. iv. 11</A>.

 Christ himself is called an apostle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:1">Heb. iii. 1</A>),

 for he was <I>sent by the Father,</I> and so sent them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:21">John xx. 21</A>.

 The prophets were called God's messengers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their number was twelve, referring to the number of the tribes of 
 Israel, and the sons of Jacob that were the patriarchs of those tribes. 
 The gospel church must be the Israel of God; the Jews must be first 
 invited into it; the apostles must be spiritual fathers, to beget a 
 seed to Christ. Israel after the flesh is to be rejected for their 
 infidelity; these twelve, therefore, are appointed to be the fathers of 
 another Israel. These twelve, by their doctrine, were to judge the 
 twelve tribes of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:30">Luke xxii. 30</A>.

 These were the twelve stars that made up the church's crown 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:1">Rev. xii. 1</A>):
 
 the twelve foundations of the new Jerusalem 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:12,14">Rev. xxi. 12, 14</A>),

 typified by the twelve precious stones in Aaron's breast-plate, the 
 twelve loaves on the table of show-bread, the twelve wells of water at 
 Elim. This was that famous jury (and to make it a grand jury, Paul was 
 added to it) that was impanelled to enquire between the King of kings, 
 and the body of mankind; and, in this chapter, they have their charge 
 given them, by him to whom <I>all judgment was committed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their names are here left upon record, and it is their honour; yet 
 in this they had more reason to rejoice, that their names were 
 <I>written in heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:20">Luke x. 20</A>),

 while the high and mighty names of the great ones of the earth are
 <I>buried in the dust.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) There are some of these twelve apostles, of whom we know no more, 
 from the scripture, than their names; as Bartholomew, and Simon the 
 Canaanite; and yet they were faithful servants to Christ and his 
 church. Note, all the good ministers of Christ are not alike famous, 
 nor their actions alike celebrated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They are names by couples; for at first they were sent forth 
 <I>two and two,</I> because <I>two are better than one;</I> they would 
 be serviceable to each other, and the more serviceable jointly to 
 Christ and souls; what one forgot the other would remember, and <I>out 
 of the mouth of two witnesses every word would be established.</I> 
 Three couple of them were brethren; Peter and Andrew, James and John, 
 and the other James and Lebbeus. Note, Friendship and fellowship ought 
 to be kept up among relations, and to be made serviceable to religion. 
 It is an excellent thing, when brethren by nature are brethren by 
 grace, and those two bonds strengthen each other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Peter is named first, because he was first called; or because he 
 was the most forward among them, and upon all occasions made himself 
 the mouth of the rest, and because he was to be the apostle of the 
 circumcision; but that gave him no power over the rest of the apostles, 
 nor is there the least mark of any supremacy that was given to him, or 
 ever claimed by him, in this sacred college.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Matthew, the penman of this gospel, is here joined with Thomas 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 but in two things there is a variation from the accounts of Mark and
 Luke,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:18,Lu+6:15">Mark iii. 18; Luke vi. 15</A>.

 There, Matthew is put first; in that order it appears he was ordained 
 before Thomas; but here, in his own catalogue, Thomas is put first. 
 Note, It well becomes the disciples of Christ in honour to prefer one 
 another. There, he is only called Matthew, here Matthew the publican, 
 the toll-gatherer or collector of the customs, who was called from that 
 infamous employment to be an apostle. Note, It is good for those who 
 are advanced to honour with Christ, to look <I>unto the rock whence 
 they were hewn;</I> often to remember what they were before Christ 
 called them, that thereby they may be kept humble, and divine grace may 
 be the more glorified. Matthew the apostle was Matthew the 
 publican.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Simon is called the Canaanite, or rather the Canite, from Cana of 
 Galilee, where probably he was born; or Simon the Zealot, which some 
 make to be the signification of <B><I>Kananites</I></B>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Judas Iscariot is always named last, and with that black brand 
 upon his name, <I>who also betrayed him;</I> which intimates that from 
 the first, Christ knew what a wretch he was, that he had a devil, and 
 would prove a traitor; yet Christ took him among the apostles, that it 
 might not be a surprise and discouragement to his church, if, at any 
 time, the vilest scandals should break out in the best societies. Such 
 spots there have been in our feasts of charity; tares among the wheat, 
 wolves among the sheep; but there is a day of discovery and separation 
 coming, where hypocrites shall be unmasked and discarded. Neither the 
 apostleship, nor the rest of the apostles, were ever the worse for 
 Judas's being one of the twelve, while his wickedness was concealed and 
 did not break out.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go
 not into the way of the Gentiles, and into <I>any</I> city of the
 Samaritans enter ye not:
 &nbsp; 6  But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
 &nbsp; 7  And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at
 hand.
 &nbsp; 8  Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
 devils: freely ye have received, freely give.
 &nbsp; 9  Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,
 &nbsp; 10  Nor scrip for <I>your</I> journey, neither two coats, neither
 shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.
 &nbsp; 11  And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who
 in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.
 &nbsp; 12  And when ye come into a house, salute it.
 &nbsp; 13  And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but
 if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
 &nbsp; 14  And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words,
 when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of
 your feet.
 &nbsp; 15  Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the
 land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that
 city.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the instructions that Christ gave to his disciples, when 
 he gave them their commission. Whether this charge was given them in a 
 continued discourse, or the several articles of it hinted to them at 
 several times, is not material; in this he <I>commanded them.</I> 
 Jacob's blessing his sons, is called his <I>commanding</I> them, and 
 with these commands Christ commanded a blessing. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The people to whom he sent them. These ambassadors are directed what 
 places to go to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Not to the Gentiles nor the Samaritans. They must not <I>go into the 
 way of the Gentiles,</I> nor into any road out of the land of Israel, 
 whatever temptations they might have. The Gentiles must not have the 
 gospel brought them, till the Jews have first refused it. As to the 
 Samaritans, who were the posterity of the mongrel people that the king 
 of Assyria planted about Samaria, their country lay between Judea and 
 Galilee, so that they could not avoid <I>going into the way</I> of the 
 Samaritans, but they must <I>not enter into any of their cities.</I> 
 Christ had declined manifesting himself to the Gentiles or Samaritans, 
 and therefore the apostles must not preach to them. If the gospel be 
 hid from any place, Christ thereby hides himself from that place. This 
 restraint was upon them only in their first mission, afterwards they 
 were appointed to go <I>into all the world,</I> and teach <I>all 
 nations.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But <I>to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</I> To them Christ 
 appropriated his own ministry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:24"><I>ch.</I> xv. 24</A>),

 for he was a <I>minister of the circumcision</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:8">Rom. xv. 8</A>):

 and, therefore, to them the apostles, who were but his attendants and
 agents, must be confined. The first offer of salvation must be made to
 the Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:26">Acts iii. 26</A>.

 Note, Christ had a particular and very tender concern for the <I>house
 of Israel;</I> they were <I>beloved for the fathers' sakes,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:28">Rom. xi. 28</A>.

 He looked with compassion upon them as <I>lost sheep,</I> whom he, as a 
 shepherd, was to gather out of the by-paths of sin and error, into 
 which they were gone astray, and in which, if not brought back, they 
 would wander endlessly; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:6">Jer. ii. 6</A>.

 The Gentiles also had been as lost sheep, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:25">1 Pet. ii. 25</A>.

 Christ gives this description of those to whom they were sent, to 
 quicken them to diligence in their work, they were sent to the house of 
 Israel (of which number they themselves lately were), whom they could 
 not but pity, and be desirous to help.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The preaching work which he appointed them. He did not send them 
 forth without an errand; no, <I>As ye go, preach,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They were to be itinerant preachers: wherever they come they must 
 proclaim the beginning of the gospel, saying, <I>The kingdom of heaven 
 is at hand.</I> Not that they must say nothing else, but this must be 
 their text; on this subject they must enlarge: let people know, that 
 the kingdom of the Messiah, who is the Lord from heaven, is now to be 
 set up according to the scriptures; from whence it follows, that men 
 must <I>repent</I> of their sins and forsake them, that they might be 
 admitted to the privileges of that kingdom. It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:12">Mark vi. 12</A>),
 
 <I>they went out, and preached that men should repent;</I> which was
 the proper use and application of this doctrine, concerning the 
 approach of the <I>kingdom of heaven.</I> They must, therefore, expect 
 to hear more of this long-looked-for Messiah shortly, and must be ready 
 to receive his doctrine, to believe in him, and to submit to his yoke.
 The preaching of this was like the morning light, to give notice of the 
 approach of the rising sun. How unlike was this to the preaching of 
 Jonah, which proclaimed ruin at hand! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+3:4">Jonah iii. 4</A>.

 This proclaims salvation at hand, <I>nigh them that fear God; mercy and
 truth meet together</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:9,10">Ps. lxxxv. 9, 10</A>),

 that is, <I>the kingdom of heaven at hand:</I> not so much the personal
 presence of the king; that must not be doated upon; but a spiritual 
 kingdom which is to be set up, when his bodily presence is removed, in 
 the hearts of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this was the same that John the Baptist and Christ had preached 
 before. Note, People need to have good truths pressed again and again 
 upon them, and if they be preached and heard with new affections, they 
 are as if they were fresh to us. Christ, in the gospel, is <I>the same 
 yesterday, to-day, and for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:8">Heb. xiii. 8</A>.

 Afterwards, indeed, when the Spirit was poured out, and the Christian
 church was formed, this <I>kingdom of heaven came,</I> which was now 
 spoken of as <I>at hand;</I> but the <I>kingdom of heaven</I> must 
 still be the subject of our preaching: now it is come, we must tell 
 people it is come to them, and must lay before them the precepts and 
 privileges of it; and there is a kingdom of glory yet to come, which we 
 must speak of as at hand, and quicken people to diligence from the 
 consideration of that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The power he gave them to work miracles for the confirmation of 
 their doctrine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 When he sent them to preach the same doctrine that he had preached, he 
 empowered them to confirm it, by the same divine seals, which could 
 never be set to a lie. This is not necessary now the kingdom of God is
 come; to call for miracles now is to lay again the foundation when the 
 building is reared. The point being settled, and the doctrine of Christ 
 sufficiently attested, by the miracles which Christ and his apostles 
 wrought, it is tempting God to ask for more signs. They are directed 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To use their power in doing good: not "Go and remove mountains," or 
 "fetch fire from heaven," but, <I>Heal the sick, cleanse the 
 lepers.</I> They are sent abroad as public blessings, to intimate to 
 the world, that love and goodness were the spirit and genius of that 
 gospel which they came to preach, and of that kingdom which they were 
 employed to set up. By this it would appear, that they were the 
 servants of that God who is good and does good, and whose mercy is 
 <I>over all his works;</I> and that the intention of the doctrine they 
 preached, was to heal sick souls, and to <I>raise</I> those that were 
 <I>dead in sin;</I> and therefore, perhaps, that of <I>raising the 
 dead</I> is mentioned; for though we read not of their raising any to 
 life before the <I>resurrection of Christ,</I> yet they were 
 instrumental to raise many to <I>spiritual life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In <I>doing good freely; Freely ye heave received, freely give.</I> 
 Those that had power to heal all diseases, had an opportunity to enrich 
 themselves; who would not purchase such easy certain cures at any rate? 
 Therefore they are cautioned not to make a gain of the power they had 
 to work miracles: they must cure <I>gratis,</I> further to exemplify 
 the nature and complexion of the gospel kingdom, which is made up, not 
 only of grace, but of free grace. <I>Gratia gratis data</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:24">Rom. iii. 24</A>),

 <I>freely by his grace,</I> Buy medicines <I>without money, and without
 price,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1">Isa. lv. 1</A>.

 And the reason is, because <I>freely you have received.</I> Their power
 to heal the sick cost them nothing, and, therefore, they must not make
 any secular advantage to themselves of it. Simon Magus would not have
 offered money for the gifts of the Holy Ghost, if he had not hoped to
 get money by them; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:18">Acts viii. 18</A>.

 Note, The consideration of Christ's freeness in doing good to us,
 should make us free in doing good to others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The provision that must be made for them in this expedition; it is 
 a thing to be considered in sending an ambassador, who must bear the 
 charge of the embassy. As to that,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must make no provision for it themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 <I>Provide neither gold nor silver.</I> As, on the one hand, they shall 
 not raise estates by their work, so, on the other hand, they shall not 
 spend what little they have of their own upon it. This was confined to
 the present mission, and Christ would teach them, 

 (1.) To act <I>under the conduct of human prudence.</I> They were now 
 to make but a short excursion, and were soon to return to their Master, 
 and to their head-quarters again, and, therefore, why should they 
 burthen themselves with that which they would have no occasion for? 
 
 (2.) To act in <I>dependence upon Divine Providence.</I> They must be 
 taught to live, without <I>taking thought for life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25"><I>ch.</I> vi. 25</A>,

 &c. Note, They who go upon Christ's errand, have, of all people, most
 reason to trust him for <I>food convenient.</I> Doubtless he will not 
 be wanting to those that are working for him. Those whom he employs, as 
 they are taken under special protection, so they are entitled to 
 special provisions. Christ's hired servants shall have <I>bread enough
 and to spare;</I> while we abide faithful to God and our duty, and are 
 in care to do our work well, we may cast all our other care upon God; 
 Jehovah-jireh, let the Lord provide for us and ours as he thinks 
 fit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They might expect that those to whom they were sent would <I>provide 
 for them</I> what was necessary, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The <I>workman is worthy of his meat.</I> They must not expect to be 
 fed by miracles, as Elijah was: but they might depend upon God to 
 incline the hearts of those they went among, to be kind to them, and 
 provide for them. Though they who <I>serve at the altar</I> may not 
 expect to grow rich by the altar, yet they may expect to live, and to 
 live comfortably upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:13,14">1 Cor. ix. 13, 14</A>.

 It is fit they should have
 their maintenance from their work. Ministers are, and must be,
 workmen, labourers, and they that are so are <I>worthy of their 
 meat,</I> so as not to be forced to any other labour for the earning of 
 it. Christ would have his disciples, as not to distrust their God, so 
 not to distrust their countrymen, so far as to doubt of a comfortable 
 subsistence among them. If you preach to them, and endeavour to do good 
 among them, surely they will give you meat and drink enough for your 
 necessities: and if they do, never desire dainties; God will pay you 
 your wages hereafter, and it will be running on in the mean time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The proceedings they were to observe in dealing with any place, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:11-15"><I>v.</I> 11-15</A>.

 They went abroad they knew not whither, uninvited, unexpected, knowing 
 none, and known of none; the land of their nativity was to them a 
 strange land; what rule must they go by? what course must they take?
 Christ would not send them out without full instructions, and here they 
 are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are here directed how to conduct themselves toward those that 
 were <I>strangers to them;</I> How to do,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In <I>strange towns and cities:</I> when you come to a town, 
 <I>enquire who</I> in it <I>is worthy.</I> 

 [1.] It is supposed that there were some such in every place, as were 
 better disposed than others to receive the gospel, and the preachers of 
 it; though it was a time of general corruption and apostasy. Note, In 
 the worst of times and places, we may charitably hope that there are 
 some who distinguish themselves, and are better than their neighbours; 
 some who swim against the stream, and are as wheat among the chaff. 
 There were saints in Nero's household. Enquire who is worthy, who there 
 are that have some fear of God before their eyes, and have made a good 
 improvement of the light and knowledge they have. The best are far from 
 meriting the favour of a gospel offer; but some would be more likely 
 than others to give the apostles and their message a favourable 
 entertainment, and would not trample these pearls under their feet. 
 Note, Previous dispositions to that which is good, are both directions 
 and encouragements to ministers, in dealing with people. There is most 
 hope of the word being profitable to those who are already so well 
 inclined, as that it is acceptable to them; and there is here and there 
 one such.

 [2.] They must enquire out such; not enquire for the best inns; public 
 houses were no proper places for them that neither took money with them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 nor expected to receive any 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 but they must look out for accommodations in private houses, with those 
 that would entertain them well, and expect no other recompence for it 
 but a prophet's reward, an apostle's reward, their praying and 
 preaching. Note, They that entertain the gospel, must neither grudge 
 the expense of it, nor promise themselves to get by it in this world. 
 They must enquire, not who is rich, but who is worthy; not who is the 
 best gentleman, but who is the best man. Note, Christ's disciples, 
 wherever they come, should ask for the good people of the place, and be 
 acquainted with them; when we took God for our God, we took his people 
 for our people, and like will rejoice in its like. Paul in all his 
 travels found out the brethren, if there were any, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:14">Acts xxviii. 14</A>.

 It is implied, that if they did enquire who was worthy, they might
 discover them. They that were better than their neighbours would be 
 taken notice of, and any one could tell them, there lives an honest, 
 sober, good man; for this is a character which, like the ointment of 
 the right hand, betrays itself and fills the house with its odours. 
 Every body knew where the seer's house was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:18">1 Sam. ix. 18</A>.

 [3.] In the house of those they found worthy, they must continue; which
 intimates that they were to make so short a stay at each town, that 
 they needed not change their lodging, but whatever house providence 
 brought them to at first, there they must continue till they left that 
 town. They are justly suspected, as having no good design, that are 
 often changing their quarters. Note, It becomes the disciples of Christ 
 to make the best of that which is, to abide by it, and not be for 
 shifting upon every dislike or inconvenience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In strange houses. When they had found the house of one they 
 thought worthy, they must at their entrance salute it. "In those common 
 civilities, be beforehand with people, in token of your humility. Think 
 it not a disparagement, to invite yourselves into a house, nor stand 
 upon the <I>punctilio</I> of being invited. Salute the family, 

 [1.] To draw on further discourse, and so to introduce your message." 
 (From matters of common conversation, we may insensibly pass into that 
 communication which is good to the use of edifying.)

 [2.] "To try whether you are welcome or not; you will take notice
 whether the salutation be received with shyness and coldness, or with a 
 ready return. He that will not receive your salutation kindly, will not 
 receive your message kindly; for he that is unskilful and unfaithful in 
 a little, will also be in much,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:10">Luke xvi. 10</A>.

 [3.] To insinuate yourselves into their good opinion. <I>Salute the
 family,</I> that they may see that though you are serious, you are not 
 morose." Note, Religion teaches us to be courteous and civil, and 
 obliging to all with whom we have to do. Though the apostles went out 
 backed with the authority of the Son of God himself, yet their 
 instructions were, when they came into a house, not to <I>command 
 it,</I> but to <I>salute</I> it; for <I>love's sake rather to 
 beseech,</I> is the evangelical way,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:8,9">Philemon 8, 9</A>.

 Souls are first drawn to Christ with the <I>cords of a man,</I> and
 kept to him by the <I>bands of love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:4">Hos. xi. 4</A>.

 When Peter made the first offer of the gospel to Cornelius, a Gentile,
 Peter was first saluted; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:25">Acts x. 25</A>,

 for the Gentiles courted that which the Jews were courted to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When they had saluted the family after a godly sort, they must by the 
 return, judge concerning the family, and proceed accordingly. Note, The 
 eye of God is upon us, to observe what entertainment we give to good 
 people and good ministers; if <I>the house be worthy, let your peace 
 come</I> and rest <I>upon it; if not, let it return to you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 It seems then, that after they had enquired for the <I>most worthy</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 it was possible they might light upon those that were unworthy. Note, 
 Though it is wisdom to hearken to, yet it is folly to rely upon, common 
 report and opinion; we ought to use a judgment of discretion, and to 
 see with our own eyes. <I>The wisdom of the prudent is</I> himself to 
 <I>understand his</I> own <I>way.</I> Now this rule is intended,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> For satisfaction to the apostles. The common salutation
 was, <I>Peace be unto you;</I> this, as they used it, was turned into 
 gospel; it was the <I>peace of God,</I> the peace of the kingdom of 
 heaven, that they wished. Now lest they should make a scruple of 
 pronouncing this blessing upon all promiscuously, because many were 
 utterly unworthy of it, this is to clear them of that scruple; Christ 
 tells them that this gospel prayer (for so it was now become) should be 
 put up for all, as the gospel proffer was made to all indefinitely, and 
 that they should leave it to God who knows the heart, and every man's 
 true character, to determine the issue of it. If the house be worthy, 
 it will reap the benefit of your blessing; if now, there is no harm 
 done, you will not lose the benefit of it; <I>it shall return to 
 you,</I> as David's prayers for his ungrateful enemies did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:13">Ps. xxxv. 13</A>.
 
 Note, It becomes us to judge charitably <I>of all,</I> to pray heartily
 <I>for all,</I> and to conduct ourselves courteously <I>to all,</I> for 
 that is our part, and then to leave it with God to determine what 
 effect it shall have upon them, for that is his part.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> For direction to them. "If, upon your salutation, it
 appear that they are indeed worthy, let them have more of your company, 
 and so <I>let your peace come upon them;</I> preach the gospel to them, 
 peace by Jesus Christ; but if otherwise, if they carry it rudely to 
 you, and shut their doors against you, <I>let your peace,</I> as much 
 as in you lies, <I>return to you.</I> Retract what you have said, and 
 turn your backs upon them; by slighting this, they have made themselves 
 unworthy of the rest of your favours, and cut themselves short of 
 them." Note, Great blessings are often lost by a neglect seemingly 
 small and inconsiderable, when men are in their probation and upon 
 their behaviour. Thus Esau lost his birthright

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:34">Gen. xxv. 34</A>),

 and Saul his kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:13,14">1 Sam. xiii. 13, 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are here directed how to carry it towards those that were 
 refusers of them. The case is put 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 of those that <I>would not receive them, nor hear their words.</I> The 
 apostles might think, that now they had such a doctrine to preach, and 
 such a power to work miracles for the confirmation of it, no doubt but 
 they should be universally entertained and made welcome: they are, 
 therefore, told before, that there would be those that would slight 
 them, and put contempt on them and their message. Note, The best and
 most powerful preachers of the gospel must expect to meet with some, 
 that will not so much as give them the hearing, nor show them any token 
 of respect. Many turn <I>a deaf ear,</I> even to the <I>joyful 
 sound,</I> and will not <I>hearken to the voice of the charmers, charm 
 they never so wisely.</I> Observe, "They will not <I>receive you,</I> 
 and they will not <I>hear your words.</I>" Note, Contempt of the 
 gospel, and contempt of gospel ministers, commonly go together, and 
 they will either of them be construed into a contempt of Christ, and 
 will be reckoned for accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now in this case we have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The directions given to the apostles what to do. They must 
 <I>depart out of that house or city.</I> Note, The gospel will not 
 tarry long with those that put it away from them. At their departure 
 they must <I>shake off the dust of their feet,</I> 

 [1.] In detestation of their wickedness; it was so abominable, that it 
 did even pollute the ground they went upon, which must therefore be 
 <I>shaken off</I> as a filthy thing. The apostles must have no 
 fellowship nor communion with them; must not so much as carry away the 
 dust of their city with them. <I>The work of them that turn aside</I>
 shall <I>not cleave to me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:3">Ps. ci. 3</A>.

 The prophet was not to <I>eat or drink</I> in Bethel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:9">1 Kings xiii. 9</A>.

 [2.] As a denunciation of wrath against them. It was to signify, that
 they were base and vile as dust, and that God would <I>shake them 
 off.</I> The dust of the apostles' feet, which they left behind them, 
 would witness against them, and be brought in as evidence, that the 
 gospel had been preached to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:11,Jam+5:3">Mark vi. 11.
 Compare Jam. v. 3</A>.

 See this practised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:51,18:6">Acts xiii. 51, xviii. 6</A>.

 Note, They who <I>despise</I> God
 and his gospel shall be <I>lightly esteemed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>doom passed</I> upon such <I>wilful recusants,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 It shall be <I>more tolerable, in the day of judgment, for the land 
 of</I> Sodom, as wicked a place as it was. Note, 

 [1.] There is a day of judgment coming, when all those that refused the 
 gospel will certainly be called to account for it; however they now 
 make a jest of it. They that would not hear the doctrine that would 
 save them, shall be made to hear the sentence that will ruin them. 
 Their judgment is respited till <I>that day.</I>

 [2.] There are different degrees of punishment in that day. All the 
 pains of hell will be <I>intolerable;</I> but some will be more so than 
 others. Some sinners sink deeper into hell than others, and are beaten 
 with more stripes.

 [3.] The condemnation of those that reject the gospel, will in that day 
 be severer and heavier than that of Sodom and Gomorrah. Sodom is said 
 to suffer the vengeance of eternal fire,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:7">Jude 7</A>.

 But that <I>vengeance</I> will come with an aggravation upon those that
 despise the great salvation. Sodom and Gomorrah were exceedingly wicked
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:13">Gen. xiii. 13</A>),

 and that which filled up the measure of their iniquity was, that they
 <I>received not</I> the angels that were sent to them, but abused them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:4,5">Gen. xix. 4, 5</A>),
 
 and <I>hearkened not to their words,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 And yet it will be more tolerable for them than for those who receive 
 not Christ's ministers and hearken not to their words. God's wrath 
 against them will be more flaming, and their own reflections upon 
 themselves more cutting. <I>Son, remember I</I> will sound most
 dreadfully in the ears of such as had a fair offer made them of 
 <I>eternal life,</I> and chose death rather. The iniquity of Israel, 
 when God sent them his servants the prophets, is represented as, upon 
 that account, more heinous than the iniquity of Sodom 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:48,49">Ezek. xvi. 48, 49</A>),

 much more now he sent them his Son, the great Prophet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be
 ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
 &nbsp; 17  But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the
 councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;
 &nbsp; 18  And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my
 sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.
 &nbsp; 19  But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
 shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye
 shall speak.
 &nbsp; 20  For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father
 which speaketh in you.
 &nbsp; 21  And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and
 the father the child: and the children shall rise up against
 <I>their</I> parents, and cause them to be put to death.
 &nbsp; 22  And ye shall be hated of all <I>men</I> for my name's sake: but
 he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
 &nbsp; 23  But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into
 another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over
 the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.
 &nbsp; 24  The disciple is not above <I>his</I> master, nor the servant
 above his lord.
 &nbsp; 25  It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and
 the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the
 house Beelzebub, how much more <I>shall they call</I> them of his
 household?
 &nbsp; 26  Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that
 shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
 &nbsp; 27  What I tell you in darkness, <I>that</I> speak ye in light: and
 what ye hear in the ear, <I>that</I> preach ye upon the housetops.
 &nbsp; 28  And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to
 kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both
 soul and body in hell.
 &nbsp; 29  Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them
 shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
 &nbsp; 30  But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
 &nbsp; 31  Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many
 sparrows.
 &nbsp; 32  Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
 confess also before my Father which is in heaven.
 &nbsp; 33  But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
 before my Father which is in heaven.
 &nbsp; 34  Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not
 to send peace, but a sword.
 &nbsp; 35  For I am come to set a man at variance against his father,
 and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law
 against her mother in law.
 &nbsp; 36  And a man's foes <I>shall be</I> they of his own household.
 &nbsp; 37  He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy
 of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not
 worthy of me.
 &nbsp; 38  And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is
 not worthy of me.
 &nbsp; 39  He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth
 his life for my sake shall find it.
 &nbsp; 40  He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
 receiveth him that sent me.
 &nbsp; 41  He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
 receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man
 in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's
 reward.
 &nbsp; 42  And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little
 ones a cup of cold <I>water</I> only in the name of a disciple, verily
 I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All these verses relate to the sufferings of Christ's ministers in 
 their work, which they are here taught to expect, and prepare for; they 
 are directed also how to bear them, and how to go on with their work in 
 the midst of them. This part of the sermon looks further than to their 
 present mission; for we find not that they met with any great hardships 
 or persecutions while Christ was with them, nor were they well able to 
 bear them; but they are here forewarned of the troubles they should 
 meet with, when after Christ's resurrection, their commission should be 
 <I>enlarged,</I> and the kingdom of heaven, which was not <I>at 
 hand,</I> should be actually set up; they dreamed of nothing then, but 
 outward pomp and power; but Christ tells them, they must expect greater 
 sufferings than they were yet called to; that they should then be made 
 prisoners, when they expected to be made princes. It is good to be told 
 what troubles we may hereafter meet with, that we may provide 
 accordingly, and may not boast, as if we had put off the harness, when 
 we are yet but girding it on.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here intermixed, 
 
 I. Predictions of trouble: and, 

 II. Prescriptions of counsel and comfort, with reference to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here predictions of trouble; which the disciples should meet 
 with in their work: Christ foresaw <I>their</I> sufferings as well as 
 his own, and yet will have them go on, as he went on himself; and he 
 foretold them, not only that the troubles might not be a surprise to 
 them, and so a shock to their faith, but that, being the accomplishment 
 of a prediction, they might be a confirmation to their faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He tells them what they should suffer, and from whom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>What they should suffer:</I> hard things to be sure; for, 
 <I>Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 And what may a flock of poor, helpless, unguarded sheep expect, in the 
 midst of a herd of ravenous wolves, but to be worried and torn? Note, 
 Wicked men are like wolves, in whose nature it is to devour and 
 destroy. God's people, and especially his ministers, are like sheep 
 among them, of a contrary nature and disposition, exposed to them, and 
 commonly an easy prey to them. It looked unkind in Christ to expose 
 them to so much danger, who had left all to follow him; but he knew 
 that the glory reserved for his sheep, when in the great day they shall 
 be set on his right hand, would be a recompence sufficient for 
 sufferings as well as services. They are as <I>sheep among wolves,</I> 
 that is frightful; but Christ sends them forth, that is comfortable; 
 for he that sends them forth will protect them, and bear them out. But 
 that they might know the worst, he tells them particularly what they 
 must expect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They must expect to be hated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 <I>Ye shall be hated for my name's sake:</I> that is the root of all 
 the rest, and a bitter root it is. Note, Those whom Christ loves, the 
 world hates; as whom the court blesses the country curses. <I>If the
 world hated Christ without a cause</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:25">John xv. 25</A>),

 no marvel if it hated those that bore his image and served his 
 interests. We hate what is nauseous, and they <I>are counted as the 
 offscouring of all things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:13">1 Cor. iv. 13</A>.

 We hate what is noxious, and they are counted <I>the troublers of the
 land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:17">1 Kings xviii. 17</A>),

 and the tormentors of their neighbours,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>.

 It is grievous to be <I>hated,</I> and to be the object of so much 
 ill-will, but it is <I>for thy name's sake;</I> which, as it speaks the 
 true reason of the hatred, whatever is pretended, so it speaks comfort 
 to them who are thus hated; it is for a good cause, and they have a 
 good friend that shares with them in it, and takes it to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They must expect to be apprehended and arraigned as malefactors. 
 Their restless malice is resistless malice, and they will not only 
 attempt, but will prevail, to <I>deliver you up to the councils</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>),

 to the bench of aldermen or justices, that take care of the public 
 peace. Note, A deal of mischief is often done to good men, under colour 
 of law and justice. In <I>the place of judgment there is 
 wickedness,</I> persecuting wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16">Eccl. iii. 16</A>.

 They must look for trouble, not only from inferior magistrates in the
 councils, but from governors and kings, the supreme magistrates. To be 
 brought before them, under such black representations as were commonly 
 made of Christ's disciples, was dreadful and dangerous; for <I>the 
 wrath of a king is as the roaring of a lion.</I> We find this often 
 fulfilled in the <I>acts of the apostles.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They must expect to be put to death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 <I>They shall deliver them to death,</I> to death in state, with pomp 
 and solemnity, when it shows itself most as <I>the king of terrors.</I> 
 The malice of the enemies rages so high as to inflict this; it is 
 <I>the blood of the saints</I> that they thirst after: the faith and 
 patience of the saints stand so firm as to expect this; <I>Neither 
 count I my life dear to myself:</I> the wisdom of Christ permits it, 
 knowing how to make the blood of the martyrs <I>the seal of the 
 truth,</I> and <I>the seed of the church.</I> By this noble army's not 
 loving <I>their lives to the death,</I> Satan has been vanquished, and 
 the kingdom of Christ and its interests greatly advanced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:11">Rev. xi. 11</A>.
 
 They were put to death as criminals, so the enemies meant it, but 
 really as sacrifices 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:17,2Ti+4:6">Phil. ii. 17; 2 Tim. iv. 6</A>);

 as burnt offerings, sacrifices of acknowledgement to the honour of God, 
 and in his truth and cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) They must expect, in the midst of these sufferings, to be branded 
 with the most odious and ignominious names and characters that could 
 be. Persecutors would be ashamed in this world, if they did not first 
 dress up those in bear-skins whom they thus bait, and represent them in 
 such colours as may serve to justify such cruelties. The blackest of 
 all the ill characters they give them is here stated; they call them 
 Beelzebub, the name of the prince of the devils, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 They represent them as ringleaders of the interest of the kingdom of 
 darkness, and since every one thinks he hates the devil, thus they 
 endeavour to make them odious to all mankind. See, and be amazed to 
 see, how this world is imposed upon: 

 [1.] Satan's sworn enemies are represented as his friends; the 
 apostles, who pulled down the devil's kingdom, were called devils. Thus 
 <I>men laid to their charge,</I> not only <I>things which they knew 
 not,</I> but <I>things which they</I> abhorred, and were directly 
 contrary to, and the reverse of.

 [2.] Satan's sworn servants would be thought to be his enemies, and 
 they never more effectually do his work, than when they pretend to be 
 fighting against him. Many times they who themselves are nearest akin 
 to the devil, are most apt to father others upon him; and those that 
 paint him on others' clothes have him reigning in their own hearts. It 
 is well there is a day coming, when (as it follows here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)

 that which is hid will be brought to light.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) These sufferings are here represented by a sword and division, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>.

 <I>Think not that I am come to send peace,</I> temporal peace and 
 outward prosperity; they thought Christ came to give all his followers 
 wealth and power in the world; "no," says Christ, "I did not come with 
 a view to give them <I>peace; peace</I> in heaven they may be sure of, 
 but not <I>peace</I> on earth." Christ came to give us <I>peace</I> 
 with God, <I>peace</I> in our consciences, <I>peace</I> with our 
 brethren, but <I>in the world ye shall have tribulation.</I> Note, They 
 mistake the design of the gospel, who think their profession of it will 
 secure them from, for it will certainly expose them to, trouble in this 
 world. If all the world would receive Christ, there would then follow a 
 universal <I>peace,</I> but while there are and will be so many that 
 reject him (and those not only <I>the children of this world,</I> but 
 <I>the seed of the serpent</I>), the children of God, that are called 
 out of the world, must expect to feel the fruits of their enmity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Look not for <I>peace, but a sword,</I> Christ came to give <I>the 
 sword of the word,</I> with which his disciples fight against the 
 world, and <I>conquering</I> work this sword has made 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:4,19:21">Rev. vi. 4; xix. 21</A>),

 and <I>the sword of persecution,</I> with which the world fights 
 against the disciples, being <I>cut to the heart</I> with <I>the sword 
 of the word</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:54">Acts vii. 54</A>),

 and tormented by the testimony of Christ's witnesses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>),

 and <I>cruel</I> work this sword made. Christ sent that gospel, which
 gives occasion for the drawing of this sword, and so may be said to 
 send this sword; he orders his church into a suffering state for the 
 trial and praise of his people's graces, and <I>the filling up of the 
 measure of their</I> enemies' sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Look not for <I>peace,</I> but division 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 <I>I am come to set men at variance.</I> This effect of the preaching 
 of the gospel is not the fault of the gospel, but of those who do not 
 receive it. When some <I>believe the things that are spoken, and others 
 believe them not,</I> the faith of those that believe condemns those 
 that believe not, and, therefore, they have an enmity against them that 
 believe. Note, the most violent and implacable feuds have ever been
 those that have arisen from difference in religion; no enmity like that 
 of the persecutors, no resolution like that of the persecuted. Thus 
 Christ tells his disciples what they should suffer, and these were hard 
 sayings; if they could bear these, they could bear any thing. Note, 
 Christ has dealt fairly and faithfully with us, in telling us the worst 
 we can meet with in his service; and he would have us deal so with 
 ourselves, in sitting down and counting the cost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are here told from whom, and by whom, they should suffer these 
 hard things. Surely hell itself must be let loose, and devils, those 
 desperate and despairing spirits, that <I>have no part nor lot in</I> 
 the great salvation, must become incarnate, ere such spiteful enemies 
 could be found to a doctrine, the substance of which was <I>good will 
 toward men,</I> and <I>the reconciling of the world to God;</I> no, 
 would you think it? all this mischief arises to the preachers of the 
 gospel, from those to whom they came to preach salvation. Thus <I>the 
 blood-thirsty hate the upright, but the just seek his soul</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:10">Prov. xxix. 10</A>),

 and therefore heaven is so much opposed on earth, because earth is so 
 much under the power of hell, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:2">Eph. ii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These hard things Christ's disciples must suffer,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) From men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>).

 "<I>Beware of men;</I> you will have need to stand upon your guard, 
 even against those who are of the same nature with you"--such is the
 depravity and degeneracy of that nature (<I>homo homini lupus,--man is 
 a wolf to man</I>), crafty and politic as men, but cruel and barbarous 
 as beasts, and wholly divested of the thing called humanity. Note, 
 Persecuting rage and enmity turn men into brutes, into devils. Paul at 
 Ephesus fought with beasts in the shape of men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:32">1 Cor. xv. 32</A>.

 It is a sad pass that the world is come to, when the best friends it
 has, have need to <I>beware of men.</I> It aggravates the troubles of 
 Christ's suffering servants, that they arise from those who <I>are bone 
 of their bone,</I> made of the same blood. Persecutors are, in this
 respect, worse than beasts, that they prey upon those of their own 
 kind: <I>S&aelig;vis inter se convenit ursis--Even savage bears agree 
 among themselves.</I> It is very grievous to have <I>men rise up 
 against us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+124:1-8">Ps. cxxiv.</A>),

 from whom we might expect protection and sympathy; <I>men,</I> and no
 more: mere <I>men; men,</I> and not saints; <I>natural men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:14">1 Cor. ii. 14</A>);
 
 <I>men of this world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>.
 
 Saints are more than <I>men,</I> and are <I>redeemed from among
 men,</I> and therefore are <I>hated by them.</I> The nature of man, if 
 it be not sanctified, is the worst nature in the world next to that of 
 devils. <I>They are men,</I> and therefore subordinate, dependent, 
 dying creatures; <I>they are men,</I> but <I>they are but men</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:20">Ps. ix. 20</A>),

 and <I>who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a man that shall
 die?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12">Isa. li. 12</A>.

 <I>Beware of the men,</I> so Dr. Hammond; those you are acquainted
 with, the men of the Jewish sanhedrim, which disallowed Christ, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:4">1 Pet. ii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) From professing men, men that <I>have a form of godliness,</I> and 
 make a show of religion. <I>They will scourge you in their 
 synagogues,</I> their places of meeting for the worship of God, and for 
 the exercise of their church-discipline: so that they looked upon the 
 scourging of Christ's ministers to be a branch of their religion. Paul 
 was <I>five times scourged in the synagogues,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:24">2 Cor. xi. 24</A>.

 The Jews, under colour of zeal for Moses, were the most bitter
 persecutors of Christ and Christianity, and placed those outrages to 
 the score of their religion. Note, Christ's disciples have suffered 
 much from conscientious persecutors, that <I>scourge them in their 
 synagogues,</I> cast them out and kill them, and <I>think they do God 
 good service</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:2">John xvi. 2</A>),
 
 and say, <I>Let the Lord be glorified,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5,Zec+11:4,5">Isa. lxvi. 5; Zech. xi. 4, 5</A>.

 But the synagogue will be so far from consecrating the persecution,
 that the persecution, doubtless, profanes and desecrates the 
 synagogue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) From great men, and men in authority. The Jews did not only 
 scourge them, which was the utmost their remaining power extended to, 
 but when they could go no further themselves, they delivered them up to 
 the Roman powers, as they did Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:30">John xviii. 30</A>.

 <I>Ye shall be brought before governors and kings</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 who, having more power, are in a capacity of doing the more mischief.
 <I>Governors and kings</I> receive their power from Christ 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:15">Prov. viii. 15</A>),

 and should be his servants, and his church's protectors and 
 nursing-fathers, but they often use their power against him, and are 
 rebels to Christ, and oppressors of his church. <I>The kings of the 
 earth</I> set themselves against his kingdom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1,2,Ac+4:25,26">Ps. ii. 1, 2; Acts iv. 25, 26</A>.

 Note, It has often been the lot of good men to have great men for their
 enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) From all men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>).

 <I>Ye shall be hated of all men,</I> of all wicked men, and these are 
 the generality of men, <I>for the whole world lies in wickedness.</I> 
 So few are there that love, and own, and countenance Christ's righteous 
 cause, that we may say, the friends of it are <I>hated of all men;</I> 
 they <I>are all gone astray,</I> and, therefore, <I>eat up my 
 people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:3">Ps. xiv. 3</A>.

 As far as the apostasy from God goes, so far the enmity against the 
 saints goes; sometimes it appears more general than at other times, but 
 there is something of this poison lurking in the hearts of all <I>the 
 children of disobedience. The world hates you,</I> for it <I>wonders 
 after the beast,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:3">Rev. xiii. 3</A>.

 <I>Every man is a liar,</I> and therefore a hater of truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) From those of their own kindred. <I>The brother shall deliver up 
 the brother to death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 <I>A man shall be,</I> upon this account, <I>at variance with his own 
 father;</I> nay, and those of the weaker and tenderer sex too shall 
 become persecutors and persecuted; <I>the persecuting daughter will be 
 against the believing mother,</I> where natural affection and filial 
 duty, one would think, should prevent or soon extinguish the quarrel; 
 and then, no marvel <I>if the daughter-in-law be against the 
 mother-in-law;</I> where, too often, the coldness of love seeks 
 occasion of contention,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 In general, <I>a man's foes shall be they of his own household</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>).

 They who should be his friends will be incensed against him for 
 embracing Christianity, and especially for adhering to it when it comes 
 to be persecuted, and will join with his persecutors against him. Note, 
 The strongest bonds of relative love and duty have often been broken 
 through, by an enmity against Christ and his doctrine. Such has been
 the power of prejudice against the true religion, and zeal for a false 
 one, that all other regards, the most natural and sacred, the most 
 engaging and endearing, have been sacrificed to these Molochs. They who 
 <I>rage against the Lord, and his anointed ones, break</I> even 
 <I>these bonds in sunder, and cast away</I> even <I>these cords from 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:2,3">Ps. ii. 2, 3</A>.

 Christ's spouse suffers hard things from the anger of <I>her own
 mother's children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:6">Cant. i. 6</A>.

 Sufferings from such are more grievous; nothing cuts more than this, 
 <I>It was thou, a man, mine equal</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:12,13">Ps. lv. 12, 13</A>);

 and the enmity of such is commonly most implacable; <I>a brother
 offended is harder to be won than a strong city,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:19">Prov. xviii. 19</A>.

 The martyrologies, both ancient and modern, are full of instances of
 this. Upon the whole matter, it appears, that <I>all that will live 
 godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer persecution; and through</I> many 
 <I>tribulations we must</I> expect to <I>enter into the kingdom of 
 God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. With these predictions of trouble, we have here prescriptions of 
 counsels and comforts for a time of trial. He sends them out exposed to 
 danger indeed, and expecting it, but well armed with instructions and 
 encouragements, sufficient to bear them up, and bear them out, in all 
 these trials. Let us gather up what he says,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By way of counsel and direction in several things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Be ye wise as serpents,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 "You may be so" (so some take it, only as a permission); "you may be as 
 wary as you please, provided you be harmless as doves." But it is 
 rather to be taken as a precept, recommending to us that wisdom of the 
 prudent, which is to understand his way, as useful at all times, but 
 especially in suffering times. "<I>Therefore,</I> because you are 
 exposed, as sheep among wolves; <I>be ye wise as serpents;</I> not wise 
 as foxes, whose cunning is to deceive others; but as <I>serpents,</I> 
 whose policy is only to defend themselves, and to shift for their own 
 safety." The disciples of Christ are hated and persecuted as 
 <I>serpents,</I> and their ruin is sought, and, therefore, they need 
 the <I>serpent's</I> wisdom. Note, It is the will of Christ that his
 people and ministers, being so much exposed to troubles in this world, 
 as they usually are, should not needlessly expose themselves, but use 
 all fair and lawful means for their own preservation. Christ gave us an 
 example of this wisdom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:24,25,22:17,18,19,Joh+7:6,7"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 24, 25; 
 xxii. 17, 18, 19; John vii. 6, 7</A>;

 besides the many escapes he made out of the hands of his enemies, till 
 his hour was come. See an instance of Paul's wisdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:6,7">Acts xxiii. 6, 7</A>.

 In the cause of Christ we must sit loose to life and all its comforts,
 but must not be prodigal of them. It is the wisdom of the
 <I>serpent</I> to secure his head, that it may not be broken, to
 <I>stop his ear to the voice of the charmer</I>

 and <I>to take shelter in the clefts of the rocks;</I> and herein we
 may <I>be wise as serpents.</I> We must <I>be wise,</I> not to pull 
 trouble upon our own heads; <I>wise</I> to keep silence in an evil 
 time, and not to give offence, if we can help it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Be ye harmless as doves.</I> "Be mild, and meek, and 
 dispassionate; not only do nobody any hurt, but bear nobody any ill 
 will; be without gall, <I>as doves</I> are; this must always go along 
 with the former." They are <I>sent forth among wolves,</I> therefore 
 must <I>be as wise as serpents,</I> but they are <I>sent forth as 
 sheep,</I> therefore must <I>be harmless as doves.</I> We must <I>be 
 wise,</I> not to wrong ourselves, but rather so than wrong any one 
 else; must use the harmlessness of the <I>dove</I> to bear twenty 
 injuries, rather than the subtlety of the <I>serpent</I> to offer or to 
 return one. Note, It must be the continual care of all Christ's 
 disciples, to be innocent and inoffensive in word and deed, especially 
 in consideration of the enemies they are in the midst of. We have need 
 of a <I>dove-like</I> spirit, when we are beset with birds of prey, 
 that we may neither provoke them nor be provoked by them: David coveted 
 <I>the wings of a dove,</I> on which to fly away and be at rest, rather 
 than the wings of a hawk. <I>The Spirit descended on Christ as a 
 dove,</I> and all believers partake of <I>the Spirit of Christ, a 
 dove-like</I> spirit, made for love, not for war.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) <I>Beware of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 "Be always upon your guard, and avoid dangerous company; take heed what 
 you say and do, and presume not too far upon any man's fidelity; be 
 jealous of the most plausible pretensions; <I>trust not in a 
 friend,</I> no, not <I>in the wife of thy bosom,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:5">Micah vii. 5</A>.

 Note, It becomes those who are gracious to be cautious, for we are
 taught to <I>cease from man.</I> Such a wretched world do we live in, 
 that we know not whom to trust. Ever since our Master was betrayed with 
 a kiss, by one of his own disciples, we have need to <I>beware of men, 
 of false brethren.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) <I>Take no thought how or what ye shall speak,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 "When you are brought before magistrates, conduct yourselves decently, 
 but afflict not yourselves with care how you shall come off. A prudent 
 thought there must be, but not an anxious, perplexing, disquieting 
 thought; let this <I>care be cast upon God,</I> as well as 
 that--<I>what you shall eat and what you shall drink.</I> Do not study 
 to make fine speeches, <I>ad captandam benevolentiam--to ingratiate 
 yourselves;</I> affect not quaint expressions, flourishes of wit, and 
 laboured periods, which only serve to gild a bad cause; the gold of a 
 good one needs it not. It argues a diffidence of your cause, to be 
 solicitous in this matter, as if it were not sufficient to speak for 
 itself. You know upon what grounds you go, and then <I>verbaque 
 pr&aelig;visam rem non invita sequentur--suitable expressions will 
 readily occur.</I>" Never any spoke better before governors and kings 
 than those three champions, who took <I>no thought before, what they 
 should speak: O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in 
 this matter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+3:16">Dan. iii. 16</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:46">Ps. cxix. 46</A>.

 Note, The disciples of Christ must be more thoughtful how to <I>do</I>
 well than how to <I>speak</I> well; how to <I>keep</I> their integrity 
 than how to <I>vindicate</I> it. <I>Non magna loquimur, sed 
 vivimus--Our lives, not boasting words,</I> form the best apology.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) <I>When they persecute you in this city, flee to another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 "Thus reject them who reject you and your doctrine, and try whether 
 others will not receive you and it. Thus shift for your own safety." 
 Note, In case of imminent peril, the disciples of Christ may and must 
 secure themselves by flight, when God, in his providence, opens to 
 <I>them a door of escape.</I> He that flies may fight again. It is no 
 inglorious thing for Christ's soldiers to quit their ground, provided 
 they do not quit their colours: they may go out of the way of 
 <I>danger,</I> though they must not go out of the way of <I>duty.</I> 
 Observe Christ's care of his disciples, in providing places of retreat 
 and shelter for them; ordering it so, that persecution rages not in all 
 places at the same time; but <I>when one city</I> is made too hot for 
 them, <I>another</I> is reserved for a cooler shade, and <I>a little 
 sanctuary;</I> a favour to be used and not to be slighted; yet always 
 with this proviso, that no sinful, unlawful means be used to make the 
 escape; for then it is not a door of God's opening. We have many 
 examples to this rule in the history both of Christ and his apostles, 
 in the application of all which to particular cases <I>wisdom</I> and 
 integrity are <I>profitable to direct.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) <I>Fear them not</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 because <I>they can but kill the body</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>).

 Note, it is the duty and interest of Christ's disciples, not to fear 
 the greatest of their adversaries. They who truly fear God, need not 
 fear man; and they who are afraid of the least sin, need not be afraid 
 of the greatest trouble. <I>The fear of man brings a snare,</I> a 
 perplexing snare, that disturbs our peace; an entangling snare, by 
 which we are drawn into sin; and, therefore, it must be carefully 
 watched, and striven, and prayed against. Be the times never so 
 difficult, enemies never so outrageous, and events never so 
 threatening, yet need we not fear, <I>yet will we not fear, though the 
 earth be removed,</I> while we have so good a God, so good a cause, and 
 so <I>good a hope through grace.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Yes, this is soon said; but when it comes to the trial, racks and 
 tortures, dungeons and galleys, axes and gibbets, fire and faggot, are 
 terrible things, enough to make the stoutest heart to tremble, and to 
 start back, especially when it is plain, that they may be avoided by a 
 few declining steps; and therefore, to fortify us against this 
 temptation, we have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] A good reason against this fear, taken from the limited power of 
 the enemies; they <I>kill the body,</I> that is the utmost their rage 
 can extend to; hitherto they can go, if God permit them, but no 
 further; <I>they are not able to kill the soul,</I> nor to do it any 
 hurt, and the soul is the man. By this it appears, that the soul does 
 not (as some dream) fall asleep at death, nor is deprived of thought 
 and perception; for then the killing of the body would be the killing 
 of the soul too. The soul is killed when it is separated from God and 
 his love, which is its life, and is made a vessel of his wrath; now 
 this is out of the reach of their power. <I>Tribulation, distress, and 
 persecution</I> may separate us from all the world, but cannot part 
 between us and God, cannot make us either not to love him, or not to be 
 loved by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:35,37">Rom. viii. 35, 37</A>.

 If, therefore, we were more concerned about our souls, as our jewels,
 we should be less afraid of men, whose power cannot rob us of them; 
 they can but <I>kill the body,</I> which would quickly die of itself, 
 <I>not the soul,</I> which will enjoy itself and its God in spite of 
 them. They can but crush the cabinet: a heathen set the tyrant at 
 defiance with this, <I>Tunde capsam Anaxarchi, Anaxarchum nom 
 l&aelig;dis--you may abuse the case of Anaxarchus, you cannot injure 
 Anaxarchus himself.</I> The pearl of price is untouched. Seneca 
 undertakes to make it out, that you cannot hurt a wise and good man, 
 because death itself is no real evil to him. <I>Si maximum illud ultra 
 quod nihil habent irat&aelig; leges, aut s&aelig;vissimi domini 
 minantur, in quo imperium suum fortuna consumit, &aelig;quo placidoque 
 animo accipimus, et scimus mortem malum non esse ob hoc, ne injuriam 
 quidem--If with calmness and composure we meet that last extremity, 
 beyond which injured laws and merciless tyrants have nothing to 
 inflict, and in which fortune terminates her dominion, we know that 
 death is not an evil, because it does not occasion the slightest 
 injury.</I> Seneca <I>De Constantid.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] A good remedy against it, and that is, to fear God. <I>Fear him 
 who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</I> Note, <I>First, 
 Hell</I> is the destruction both of <I>soul and body;</I> not of the 
 <I>being</I> of either, but the <I>well</I>--being of both; it is the 
 ruin of the whole man; if the soul be lost, the body is lost too. They 
 sinned together; the body was the soul's tempter to sin, and its tool 
 in sin, and they must eternally suffer together. <I>Secondly,</I> This
 destruction comes from the power of God: he <I>is able to destroy;</I>
 it is a destruction from his <I>glorious power</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:9">2 Thess. i. 9</A>);

 <I>he will</I> in it <I>make his power known;</I> not only his
 authority to sentence, but his ability to execute the sentence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:22">Rom. ix. 22</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> God <I>is therefore to be feared,</I> even by the best
 saints in this world. <I>Knowing the terrors of the Lord, we persuade 
 men</I> to <I>stand in awe of him. If according to his fear so is his 
 wrath,</I> then <I>according to his wrath so</I> should <I>his fear</I> 
 be, especially because <I>none knows the power of his anger,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:11">Ps. xc. 11</A>.

 When Adam, in innocency, was awed by a threatening, let none of
 Christ's disciples think that they need not the restraint of a holy
 fear. <I>Happy is the man that fears always.</I> The <I>God of 
 Abraham,</I> who was then dead, is called the <I>Fear of Isaac,</I> who 
 was yet alive, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:42,53">Gen. xxxi. 42, 53</A>.

 <I>Fourthly,</I> The fear of God, and of his power reigning in the
 soul, will be a sovereign antidote against the fear of man. It is 
 better to fall under the frowns of all the world, than under God's 
 frowns, and therefore, as it is most right in itself, so it is most 
 safe for us, <I>to obey God rather than men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:19">Acts iv. 19</A>.

 They who <I>are afraid of a man that shall die, forget the Lord their 
 Maker,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12,13,Ne+4:14">Isa. li. 12, 13; Neh. iv. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) <I>What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 "whatever hazards you run, go on with your work, publishing and 
 proclaiming the everlasting gospel to all the world; that is your 
 business, mind that. The design of the enemies is not merely to destroy 
 <I>you,</I> but to suppress <I>that,</I> and, therefore, whatever be 
 the consequence, publish <I>that." What I tell you, that speak ye.</I> 
 Note, That which the apostles have delivered to us is the same that
 <I>they received from Jesus Christ,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:3">Heb. ii. 3</A>.

 They spake what he told them--<I>that, all that,</I> and <I>nothing but 
 that.</I> Those ambassadors received their instructions in private, 
 <I>in darkness,</I> in the ear, in corners, in parables. <I>Many
 things Christ spake openly, and nothing in secret</I> varying from what 
 he preached in public,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:20">John xviii. 20</A>.

 But the particular instructions which he gave his disciples after his
 resurrection, concerning <I>the things pertaining to the kingdom of
 God,</I> were whispered in the ear

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:3">Acts i. 3</A>),

 for then <I>he never showed himself openly.</I> But they must deliver
 their embassy publicly, <I>in the light,</I> and <I>upon the 
 house-tops;</I> for the doctrine of the gospel is what all are 
 concerned in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:20,21,8:2,3">Prov. i. 20, 21; viii. 2, 3</A>),

 therefore <I>he that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</I> The first
 indication of the reception of the Gentiles into the church, was 
 <I>upon a house-top,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:9">Acts x. 9</A>.

 Note, There is no part of Christ's gospel that needs, upon any account,
 to be concealed; <I>the whole counsel of God must be revealed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:27">Acts xx. 27</A>.

 In never so mixed a multitude let it be plainly and fully
 delivered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By way of comfort and encouragement. Here is very much said to that 
 purpose, and all little enough, considering the many hardships they 
 were to grapple with, throughout the course of their ministry, and 
 their present weakness, which was such, as that, without some powerful 
 support, they could scarcely bear even the prospect of such usage; 
 Christ therefore shows them why they should be of good cheer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is one word peculiar to their present mission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 <I>Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of 
 man be come.</I> They were to preach that <I>the kingdom of the Son of 
 man,</I> the Messiah, was <I>at hand;</I> they were to pray, <I>Thy 
 kingdom come:</I> now they should <I>not have gone over all the cities 
 of Israel,</I> thus praying and thus preaching, before that kingdom 
 should come, in the exaltation of Christ, and the pouring out of the 
 Spirit. It was a comfort, 

 [1.] That what they said should be made good: they said <I>the Son of 
 man</I> is coming, and <I>behold, he comes.</I> Christ <I>will confirm 
 the word of his messengers,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xlvi. 26</A>.

 [2.] That it should be made good quickly. Note, It is matter of comfort
 to Christ's labourers, that their working time will be short, and soon 
 over; the hireling has his day; the work and warfare will in a little 
 time be accomplished.

 [3.] That then they should be advanced to a higher station. <I>When the 
 Son of man comes, they shall be endued with greater power from on 
 high;</I> now they were sent forth as agents and envoys, but in a 
 little time their commission should be enlarged, and they should be 
 sent forth as plenipotentiaries into all the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here are many words that relate to their work in general, and the 
 troubles they were to meet with in it; and <I>they are good words and 
 comfortable words.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That their sufferings were <I>for a testimony against them and the 
 Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 When the Jewish consistories transfer you to the Roman governors, that 
 they may have you put to death, your being hurried thus from one 
 judgment-seat to another, will help to make your testimony the more 
 public, and will give you an opportunity of bringing the gospel to the 
 Gentiles, as well as to the Jews; nay, you will testify to them, and 
 against them, by the very troubles you undergo. Note, God's people,
 and especially God's ministers, are his witnesses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:10">Isa. xliii. 10</A>),

 not only in their <I>doing</I> work, but in their <I>suffering</I>
 work. Hence they are called martyrs--<I>witnesses</I> for Christ, that
 his truths are of undoubted certainty and value; and, being witnesses 
 for him, they are witnesses against those who oppose him and his 
 gospel. The sufferings of the martyrs, as they witness to the truth of
 the gospel they profess, so they are testimonies of the enmity of their 
 persecutors, and both ways they are a testimony against them, and will 
 be produced in evidence in the great day, when <I>the saints shall 
 judge the world;</I> and the reason of the sentence will be, 
 <I>Inasmuch as ye did it unto these, ye did it unto me.</I> Now if 
 their sufferings be a testimony, how cheerfully should they be borne!
 for the testimony is not finished till those come,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:7">Rev. xi. 7</A>.

 If they be Christ's witnesses, they shall be sure to have their charges 
 borne.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That upon all occasions they should have God's special presence 
 with them, and the immediate assistance of his Holy Spirit, 
 particularly when they should be called out to bear their testimony 
 <I>before governors and kings; it shall be given you</I> (said Christ) 
 <I>in that same hour what ye shall speak.</I> Christ's disciples were 
 chosen <I>from among the foolish of the world,</I> unlearned and 
 ignorant men, and, therefore, might justly distrust their own 
 abilities, especially when they were called before great men. When 
 Moses was sent to Pharaoh, he complained, <I>I am not eloquent,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:10">Exod. iv. 10</A>.

 When Jeremiah was set over the kingdoms, he objected, <I>I am but a
 child,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:6,10">Jer. i. 6, 10</A>.

 Now, in answer to this suggestion, <I>First,</I> they are here promised 
 that <I>it should be given them,</I> nor some time before, but <I>in 
 that same hour, what they should speak.</I> They shall speak 
 <I>extempore,</I> and yet shall speak as much to the purpose, as if it 
 had been never so well studied. Note, When God calls us out to speak 
 for him, we may depend upon him to teach us what to say; even then, 
 when we labour under the greatest disadvantages and discouragements.  
 <I>Secondly,</I> They are here assured, that the blessed Spirit should
 draw up their plea for them. <I>It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit 
 of your Father, which speaketh in you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 They were not left to themselves upon such an occasion, but God
 undertook for them; his Spirit of wisdom spoke <I>in</I> them, as 
 sometimes his providence wonderfully spoke <I>for</I> them, and by both 
 together they were manifested in the consciences even of their 
 persecutors. God gave them an ability, not only to speak to the 
 purpose, but what they did say, to say it with holy zeal. The same 
 Spirit that assisted them in the pulpit, assisted them at the bar. They 
 cannot but come off well, who have such an advocate; to whom God says, 
 as he did to Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:12">Exod. iv. 12</A>),

 <I>Go, and I will be with thy mouth, and with thy heart.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] That <I>he that endures to the end shall be saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Here it is very comfortable to consider, <I>First,</I> that there will
 be an <I>end</I> of these troubles; they may last long, but will not 
 last always. Christ comforted himself with this, and so may his 
 followers; <I>The things concerning me have an end,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:37">Luke xxii. 37</A>.

 <I>Dabit Deus his quoque finem--These also will God bring to a
 termination.</I> Note, A believing prospect of the period of our 
 troubles, will be of great use to support us under them. <I>The weary 
 will be at rest, when the wicked cease from troubling,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:17">Job iii. 17</A>.

 God will give an expected <I>end,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:11">Jer. xxix. 11</A>.

 The troubles may seem tedious, <I>like the days of a hireling,</I> but, 
 blessed be God, they are not everlasting. <I>Secondly,</I> That while
 they continue, they may be <I>endured;</I> as they are not 
 <I>eternal,</I> so they are not <I>intolerable;</I> they may be borne, 
 and borne <I>to the end,</I> because the sufferers shall be borne up 
 under them, in everlasting arms: <I>The strength shall be according to 
 the day,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:13">1 Cor. x. 13</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> Salvation will be the eternal recompence of all those
 <I>that endure to the end.</I> The weather stormy, and the way foul, 
 but the pleasure of home will make amends for all. A believing regard 
 to the crown of glory has been in all ages the cordial and support of 
 suffering saints,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:16,17,18,Heb+10:34">2 Cor. iv. 16; 17, 18; Heb. x. 34</A>.

 This is not only an encouragement to us to <I>endure,</I> but an
 engagement to <I>endure to the end.</I> They who <I>endure but awhile, 
 and in time of temptation fall away,</I> have run in vain, and lose all 
 that they have attained; but they who persevere, are sure of the prize, 
 and they only. <I>Be faithful unto death,</I> and then thou shalt have
 <I>the crown of life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] That whatever hard usage the disciples of Christ meet with, it is 
 no more than what their Master met with before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>).

 <I>The disciple is not above his master.</I> We find this given them as 
 a reason, why they should not hesitate to perform the meanest duties, 
 no, not washing one another's feet. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:16">John xiii. 16</A>.

 Here it is given as a reason, why they should not stumble at the
 hardest sufferings. They are reminded of this saying, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:20">John xv. 20</A>.

 It is a proverbial expression, <I>The servant is not better than his 
 master,</I> and, therefore, let him not expect to fare <I>better.</I> 
 Note, <I>First,</I> Jesus Christ is our <I>Master,</I> our teaching 
 <I>Master,</I> and we are his disciples, to learn of him; our ruling 
 <I>master,</I> and we are his servants to obey him: He is <I>Master</I> 
 of the house, <B><I>oikodespotes</I></B>, has a despotic power in the 
 church, which is his family. <I>Secondly,</I> Jesus Christ our Lord and 
 Master met with very hard usage from the world; they called him 
 Beelzebub, the god of flies, the name of the chief of the devils, with 
 whom they said he was in league. It is hard to say which is here more 
 to be wondered at, the wickedness of men who thus abused Christ, or the 
 patience of Christ, who suffered himself to be thus abused; that he who 
 was the God of glory should be stigmatized as the god of flies; the 
 King of Israel, as the god of Ekron; the Prince of light and life, as 
 the prince of the powers of death and darkness; that Satan's greatest 
 Enemy and Destroyer should be run down as his confederate, and yet 
 <I>endure such contradiction of sinners. Thirdly,</I> The consideration
 of the ill treatment which Christ met with in the world, should engage 
 us to expect and prepare for the like, and to bear it patiently. Let us 
 not think it strange, if they who hated him hate his followers, for his 
 sake; nor think it hard if they who are shortly to be made <I>like him 
 in glory,</I> be now made <I>like him in sufferings.</I> Christ began 
 in the <I>bitter cup,</I> let us be willing to pledge him; his bearing 
 the cross made it easy for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [5.] That <I>there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 We understand this, <I>First,</I> Of the revealing of the gospel to all
 the world. "Do you <I>publish</I> it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 for it shall be published. The truths which are now, as mysteries, hid
 from the children of men, shall all be made known, to all nations, in
 their own language," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:11">Acts ii. 11</A>.

 The <I>ends of the earth must see this salvation.</I> Note, It is a 
 great encouragement to those who are doing Christ's work, that it is a 
 work which shall certainly be done. It is a plough which God will 
 speed. Or, <I>Secondly,</I> Of the clearing up of the innocency of
 Christ's suffering servants, that are called Beelzebub; their true 
 character is now invidiously disguised with false colours, but however 
 their innocency and excellency are now <I>covered,</I> they <I>shall be 
 revealed;</I> sometimes it is in a great measure done in this world, 
 when the righteousness of the saints is made, by subsequent events, to 
 <I>shine forth as the light:</I> however it will be done at the great 
 day, when their glory shall be manifested to all the world, angels and 
 men, to whom they are now <I>made spectacles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:9">1 Cor. iv. 9</A>.
 
 All their reproach shall be rolled away, and their graces and services,
 that are now <I>covered, shall be revealed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:5">1 Cor. iv. 5</A>.

 Note, It is matter of comfort to the people of God, under all the 
 calumnies and censures of men, that there will be a resurrection of 
 <I>names</I> as well as of <I>bodies,</I> at the last day, when <I>the 
 righteous shall shine forth as the sun.</I> Let Christ's ministers 
 faithfully reveal his truths, and then leave it to him, in due time, to 
 reveal their integrity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [6.] That the providence of God is in a special manner conversant about
 the saints, in their suffering,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:29-31"><I>v.</I> 29-31</A>.

 It is good to have recourse to our first principles, and particularly
 to the doctrine of God's universal providence, extending itself to all 
 the creatures, and all their actions, even the smallest and most 
 minute. The light of nature teaches us this, and it is comfortable to 
 all men, but especially to all good men, who can in faith call this God 
 their Father, and for whom he has a tender concern. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The general extent of providence to all the creatures,
 even the least, and least considerable, to the <I>sparrows,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 These little animals are of so small account, that one of them is not 
 valued; there must go two to be worth <I>a farthing</I> (nay, you shall 
 have five for a halfpenny, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:6">Luke xii. 6</A>),

 and yet they are not shut out of the divine care; <I>One of them shall
 not fall to the ground without your Father:</I> That is,

 1. They do not light on <I>the ground</I> for food, to pick up a grain
 of corn, but <I>your</I> heavenly <I>Father,</I> by his providence,
 laid it ready for them. In the parallel place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:6">Luke xii. 6</A>,

 it is thus expressed, <I>Not one of them is forgotten before God,</I>
 forgotten to be provided for; <I>he feedeth them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:26"><I>ch.</I> vi. 26</A>.

 Now he that feeds the sparrows, will not starve the saints.

 2. They do <I>not fall to the ground</I> by death, either a natural or
 a violent death, without the notice of God: though they are so small a 
 part of the creation, yet even their death comes within the notice of 
 the divine providence; much more does the death of his disciples. 
 Observe, The birds that soar above, when they die, <I>fall to the 
 ground;</I> death brings the highest to the earth. Some think that 
 Christ here alludes to the <I>two sparrows</I> that were used in 
 cleansing the leper 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:4-6">Lev. xiv. 4-6</A>);

 the two birds in the margin are called <I>sparrows;</I> of these one 
 was killed, and so <I>fell to the ground,</I> the other was let go. Now 
 it seemed a casual thing which of the two was killed; the persons
 employed took which they pleased, but God's providence designed, and
 determined which. Now this God, who has such an eye to the sparrows,
 because they are his creatures, much more will have an eye to you, who
 are his children. If a sparrow die not <I>without your Father,</I>
 surely a man does not,--a Christian,--a minister,--my friend, my child.
 A bird falls not into the fowler's net, nor by the fowler's shot, and
 so comes not to be sold in the market, but according to the direction
 of providence; your enemies, like subtle fowlers, <I>lay snares for</I>
 you, and <I>privily shoot at</I> you, but they cannot take you, they
 cannot hit you, unless God give them leave. Therefore be not afraid of
 death, for your enemies have no power against you, but what is <I>given
 them from above.</I> God can break their bows and snares

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:12-15,64:4,7">Ps. xxxviii. 12-15; lxiv. 4, 7</A>),

 and make our souls to <I>escape as a bird</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+124:7">Ps. cxxiv. 7</A>);

 <I>Fear ye not, therefore,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Note, There is enough in the doctrine of God's providence to silence
 all the fears of God's people: <I>Ye are of more value than many 
 sparrows.</I> All men are so, for the other creatures were made for 
 man, and <I>put under his feet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:6-8">Ps. viii. 6-8</A>);

 much more the disciples of Jesus Christ, who are the excellent ones of
 the earth, however contemned, as if not worth one sparrow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The particular cognizance which providence takes of
 the disciples of Christ, especially in their sufferings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 <I>But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</I> This is a 
 proverbial expression, denoting the account which God takes and keeps 
 of all the concernments of his people, even of those that are most 
 minute, and least regarded. This is not to be made a matter of curious 
 enquiry, but of encouragement to live in a continual dependence upon 
 God's providential care, which extends itself to all occurrences, yet 
 without disparagement to the infinite glory, or disturbance to the 
 infinite rest, of the Eternal Mind. If God numbers their hairs, much 
 more does he number their heads, and take care of their lives, their 
 comforts, their souls. It intimates, that God takes more care of them, 
 than they do of themselves. They who are solicitous to number their 
 money, and goods, and cattle, yet were never careful to number their 
 hairs, which fall and are lost, and they never miss them: but God 
 <I>numbers the hairs of</I> his people, and <I>not a hair of their head 
 shall perish</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:18">Luke xxi. 18</A>);

 not the least hurt shall be done them, but upon a valuable
 consideration: so precious to God are his saints, and their lives and 
 deaths!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [7.] That he will shortly, in the day of triumph, own those who now own 
 him, in the day of trial, when those who deny him shall be for ever 
 disowned and rejected by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 Note, <I>First,</I> It is our duty, and if we do it, it will hereafter
 be our unspeakable honour and happiness, to <I>confess Christ before 
 men.</I>

 1. It is our duty, not only to believe in Christ, but to profess that 
 faith, in suffering for him, when we are called to it, as well as in 
 serving him. We must never be ashamed of our relation to Christ, our 
 attendance on him, and our expectations from him: hereby the sincerity 
 of our faith, is evidenced, his name glorified, and others edified. 

 2. However this may expose us to reproach and trouble now, we shall be 
 abundantly recompensed for that, <I>in the resurrection of the 
 just,</I> when it will be our unspeakable honour and happiness to hear 
 Christ say (what would we more?) "<I>Him will I confess,</I> though a 
 poor worthless worm of the earth; this is one of mine, one of my 
 friends and favourites, who loved me and was beloved by me; the 
 purchase of my blood, the workmanship of my Spirit; <I>I will confess 
 him before my Father,</I> when it will do him the most service; I will 
 speak a good word for him, when he appears before <I>my Father</I> to 
 receive his doom; I will present him, will represent him to <I>my 
 Father.</I>" Those who honour Christ he will thus honour. They honour 
 him <I>before men;</I> that is a <I>poor</I> thing: he will honour them 
 <I>before</I> his <I>Father;</I> that is a <I>great</I> thing.  
 <I>Secondly,</I> It is a dangerous thing for any to deny and disown
 <I>Christ before men;</I> for they who so do will be disowned by him 
 <I>in the great day,</I> when they have most need of him: he will not 
 own them for his servants who would not own him for their master: <I>I 
 tell you, I know you not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:23"><I>ch.</I> vii. 23</A>.

 In the first ages of Christianity, when for a man to <I>confess
 Christ</I> was to venture all that was dear to him in this world, it 
 was more a trial of sincerity, than it was afterwards, when it had 
 secular advantages attending it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [8.] That the foundation of their discipleship was laid in such a 
 temper and disposition, as would make sufferings very light and easy to 
 them; and it was upon the condition of a preparedness for suffering, 
 that Christ took them to be his followers,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:37-39"><I>v.</I> 37-39</A>.

 He told them at first, that they were <I>not worthy of</I> him, if they 
 were not willing to part with all for him. Men hesitate not at those 
 difficulties which necessarily attend their profession, and which they 
 counted upon, when they undertook that profession; and they will either 
 cheerfully submit to those fatigues and troubles, or disclaim the 
 privileges and advantages of their profession. Now, in the Christian 
 profession, they are reckoned unworthy the dignity and felicity of it, 
 that put not such a value upon their interest in Christ, as to prefer 
 that before any other interests. They cannot expect the gains of a 
 bargain, who will not come up to the terms of it. Now thus the terms 
 are settled; if religion be worth <I>any</I> thing, it is worth 
 <I>every</I> thing: and, therefore, all who believe the truth of it, 
 will soon come up to the price of it; and they who make it their 
 business and bliss, will make every thing else to yield to it. They who 
 like not Christ on these terms, may leave him at their peril. Note, It 
 is very encouraging to think, that whatever we leave, or lose, or 
 suffer for Christ, we do not make a hard bargain for ourselves.
 Whatever we part with for this pearl of price, we may comfort ourselves 
 with this persuasion, that it is well worth what we give for it. The 
 terms are, that we must prefer Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Before our nearest and dearest relations; <I>father or
 mother, son or daughter.</I> Between these relations, because there is 
 little room left for envy, there is commonly more room for love, and, 
 therefore, these are instanced, as relations which are most likely to 
 affect us. Children must love their parents, and parents must love 
 their children; but if they love them better than Christ, they are 
 unworthy of him. As we must not be <I>deterred</I> from Christ by the 
 hatred of our relations which he spoke of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:21,35,36"><I>v.</I> 21, 35, 36</A>),

 so we must not be <I>drawn</I> from him, by their love. Christians must 
 be as Levi, who <I>said to his father, I have not seen him,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">Deut. xxxiii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Before our ease and safety. We must <I>take up our cross</I>
 and <I>follow him,</I> else we are <I>not worthy</I> of him. Here 
 observe, 

 1. They who would <I>follow Christ,</I> must expect <I>their cross</I>
 and <I>take it up.</I> 

 2. In taking <I>up the cross,</I> we must <I>follow Christ's</I>
 example, and bear it as he did. 

 3. It is a great encouragement to us, when we meet with crosses, that
 in bearing them we <I>follow Christ,</I> who has showed us the way; and 
 that if we follow him faithfully, he will lead us through sufferings 
 like him, to glory with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> Before life itself,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 <I>He that findeth his life shall lose it;</I> he that thinks he had 
 found it when he has saved it, and kept it, by denying Christ, <I>shall 
 lose it</I> in an eternal death; but <I>he that loseth his life for 
 Christ's sake,</I> that will part with it rather than deny Christ, 
 <I>shall find it,</I> to his unspeakable advantage, an eternal life. 
 They are best prepared for the life to come, that sit most loose to 
 this present life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [9.] That Christ himself would so heartily espouse their cause, as to
 show himself a friend to all their friends, and to repay all the 
 kindnesses that should at any time be bestowed upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:40-42"><I>v.</I> 40-42</A>.
 
 <I>He that receiveth you, receiveth me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> It is here implied, that though the generality would
 reject them, yet they should meet with some who would receive and 
 entertain them, would bid the message welcome to their hearts, and the 
 messengers to their houses, for the sake of it. Why was the gospel 
 market made, but that if some will not, others will. In the worst of 
 times there is a remnant according to the election of grace. Christ's 
 ministers shall not <I>labour in vain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Jesus Christ takes what is done to his faithful ministers,
 whether in kindness or in unkindness, as done to himself, and reckons 
 himself <I>treated</I> as they are <I>treated. He that receiveth you, 
 receiveth me.</I> Honour or contempt put upon an ambassador reflects 
 honour or contempt upon the prince that sends him, and ministers are 
 <I>ambassadors for Christ.</I> See how Christ may still be entertained 
 by those who would testify their respects to him; his people and 
 ministers we have always with us; and he is <I>with them always,</I> 
 even to the end of the world. Nay, the honour rises higher, <I>He that 
 receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.</I> Not only Christ takes it 
 as done to himself, but through Christ God does so too. By entertaining 
 Christ's ministers, they entertain not <I>angels unawares,</I> but 
 Christ, nay, and God himself, and <I>unawares</I> too, as appears, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:37"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 37</A>.

 <I>When saw we thee an hungered?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> That though the kindness done to Christ's disciples be
 never so small, yet if there be occasion for it, and ability to do no 
 more, it shall be accepted, though it be <I>but a cup of cold water 
 given to one of these little ones,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 They are <I>little ones,</I> poor and weak, and often stand in need of 
 refreshment, and glad of the least. The extremity may be such, that a 
 <I>cup of cold water</I> may be a great favour. Note, Kindnesses shown 
 to Christ's disciples are valued in Christ's books, not according to 
 the cost of the gift, but according to the love and affection of the 
 giver. On that score the widow's mite not only passed current, but was 
 stamped high, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:3,4">Luke xxi. 3, 4</A>.

 Thus they who are truly rich in graces may be rich in good works, 
 though poor in the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> That kindness to Christ's disciples which he will
 accept, must b done with an eye to Christ, and for his sake. A prophet 
 must be received <I>in the name of a prophet,</I> and a <I>righteous 
 man</I> in the name of a <I>righteous man,</I> and one of those 
 <I>little ones</I> in <I>the name of a disciple;</I> not because they 
 are learned, or witty, nor because they are our relations or 
 neighbours, but because they are righteous, and so bear Christ's image; 
 because they are prophets and disciples, and so are sent on Christ's 
 errand. It is a believing regard to Christ that puts an acceptable 
 value upon the kindnesses done to his ministers. Christ does not 
 interest himself in the matter, unless we first interest him in it. 
 <I>Ut tibi debeam aliquid pro eo quod pr&aelig;stas, debes non tantum 
 mihi pr&aelig;stare, sed tanquam mihi--If you wish me to feel an 
 obligation to you for any service you render, you must not only perform 
 the service, but you must convince me that you do it for my sake.</I> 
 Seneca.</P>
