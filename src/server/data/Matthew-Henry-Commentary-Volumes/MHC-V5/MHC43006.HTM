 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which
 is <I>the sea</I> of Tiberias.
 &nbsp; 2  And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his
 miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
 &nbsp; 3  And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his
 disciples.
 &nbsp; 4  And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
 &nbsp; 5  When Jesus then lifted up <I>his</I> eyes, and saw a great company
 come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread,
 that these may eat?
 &nbsp; 6  And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he
 would do.
 &nbsp; 7  Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
 sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
 &nbsp; 8  One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith
 unto him,
 &nbsp; 9  There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two
 small fishes: but what are they among so many?
 &nbsp; 10  And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much
 grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five
 thousand.
 &nbsp; 11  And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
 distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were
 set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
 &nbsp; 12  When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up
 the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
 &nbsp; 13  Therefore they gathered <I>them</I> together, and filled twelve
 baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which
 remained over and above unto them that had eaten.
 &nbsp; 14  Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus
 did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into
 the world.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of Christ's feeding five thousand men with five 
 loaves and two fishes, which miracle is in <I>this</I> respect 
 remarkable, that it is the only passage of the actions of <I>Christ's 
 life</I> that is recorded by all the four evangelists. John, who does 
 not usually relate what had been recorded by those who wrote before 
 him, yet relates this, because of the reference the following discourse 
 has to it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>place</I> and <I>time</I> where and when this miracle was 
 wrought, which are noted for the greater evidence of the truth of the 
 story; it is not said that it was done once upon a time, nobody knows 
 where, but the circumstances are specified, that the fact might be 
 enquired into.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The country that Christ was in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>He went over the sea of Galilee,</I> called elsewhere <I>the lake of 
 Gennesareth,</I> here <I>the sea of Tiberias,</I> from a city 
 adjoining, which Herod had lately enlarged and beautified, and called 
 so in honour of Tiberius the emperor, and probably had made his 
 metropolis. Christ did not go directly over cross this inland sea, but 
 made a <I>coasting</I> voyage to another place on the same side. It is 
 not tempting God to choose to go <I>by water,</I> when there is 
 convenience for it, even to those places whither we might go <I>by 
 land;</I> for Christ never <I>tempted the Lord his God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:7">Matt. iv. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The company that he was attended with: <I>A great multitude followed 
 him, because they saw his miracles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) Our Lord Jesus, while he went about <I>doing good,</I> lived 
 continually in <I>a crowd,</I> which gave him more trouble than honour. 
 Good and useful men must not complain of a <I>hurry</I> of business, 
 when they are serving God and their generation; it will be time enough 
 to <I>enjoy ourselves</I> when we come to that world where we shall 
 <I>enjoy God.</I> 

 (2.) Christ's miracles drew many <I>after him</I> that were not 
 effectually drawn <I>to him.</I> They had their curiosity gratified by 
 the strangeness of them, who had not their consciences convinced by the 
 power of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ's posting himself advantageously to entertain them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>He went up into a mountain,</I> and there he <I>sat with his 
 disciples,</I> that he might the more conveniently be seen and heard by 
 the multitude that crowded after him; this was a <I>natural</I> pulpit, 
 and not, like Ezra's, made <I>for the purpose.</I> Christ was now 
 driven to be a <I>field preacher;</I> but his word was never the worse, 
 nor the less acceptable, for that, to those who knew how to value it, 
 who followed him still, not only when he <I>went out</I> to a desert 
 place, but when he <I>went up</I> to a mountain, though <I>up-hill</I> 
 be <I>against heart.</I> He <I>sat</I> there, as teachers do <I>in 
 cathedra--in the chair of instruction.</I> He did not sit at ease, not
 sit in state, yet he sat as one having authority, sat ready to receive 
 addresses that were made to him; whoever would might come, and find him 
 there. He sat <I>with his disciples;</I> he condescended to take them 
 to <I>sit with him,</I> to put a reputation upon them before the 
 people, and give them an earnest of the glory in which they should 
 shortly sit with him. We are said to <I>sit with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:6">Eph. ii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The time when it was. The first words, <I>After those things,</I> do 
 not signify that this immediately followed what was related in the 
 foregoing chapter, for it was a considerable time after, and they 
 signify no more than in process of time; but we are told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 that it was <I>when the passover was nigh,</I> which is here noted, 
 
 (1.) Because, perhaps, that had brought in all the apostles from their
 respective expeditions, whither they were sent as itinerant preachers, 
 that they might attend their Master to Jerusalem, to keep the feast.
 
 (2.) Because it was a custom with the Jews religiously to observe the 
 approach of the passover <I>thirty days</I> before, with some sort of 
 solemnity; so long before they had it in their eye, repaired the roads, 
 mended bridges, if there was occasion, and discoursed of the passover 
 and the institution of it. 

 (3.) Because, perhaps, the approach of the passover, when every one 
 knew Christ would go up to Jerusalem, and be absent for some time, made 
 the multitude flock the more after him and attend the more diligently 
 on him. Note, The prospect of losing our opportunities should quicken 
 us to improve them with double diligence; and, when solemn ordinances 
 are approaching, it is good to prepare for them by conversing with the 
 word of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The miracle itself. And here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The notice Christ took of the crowd that attended him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 He <I>lifted up his eyes,</I> and <I>saw a great company come to 
 him,</I> poor, mean, ordinary people, no doubt, for such make up the 
 multitudes, especially in such remote corners of the country; yet 
 Christ showed himself pleased with their attendance, and concerned for 
 their welfare, to teach us to <I>condescend to those of low estate,</I> 
 and not to <I>set</I> those <I>with the dogs of our flock</I> whom 
 Christ hath set with the lambs of his. The souls of the poor are as 
 precious to Christ, and should be so to us, as those of the rich.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The enquiry he made concerning the way of providing for them. He 
 directed himself to Philip, who had been his disciple from the first, 
 and had seen all his miracles, and particularly that of his turning 
 water into wine, and therefore it might be expected that he should have 
 said, "Lord, if thou wilt, it is easy to thee to feed them all." Those 
 that, like Israel, have been witnesses of Christ's works, and have 
 shared in the benefit of them, are inexcusable if they say, <I>Can he 
 furnish a table in the wilderness?</I> Philip was of Bethsaida, in the 
 neighbourhood of which town Christ now was, and therefore he was most 
 likely to help them to provision at the best hand; and probably much of 
 the company was known to him, and he was concerned for them. Now
 Christ asked, <I>Whence shall we buy bread, that these</I> may eat? 
 
 (1.) He takes it for granted that they must all <I>eat with him.</I> 
 One would think that when he had taught and healed them he had done his 
 part; and that now they should rather have been contriving how to treat 
 him and his disciples, for some of the people were probably 
 <I>rich,</I> and we are sure that Christ and his disciples were 
 <I>poor;</I> yet he is solicitous to entertain them. Those that will 
 accept Christ's spiritual gifts, instead of <I>paying</I> for them, 
 shall be <I>paid</I> for their acceptance of them. Christ, having fed 
 their souls with the bread of life, feeds their bodies also with 
 <I>food convenient,</I> to show that the Lord is for the body, and to 
 encourage us to pray for our daily bread, and to set us an example of 
 compassion to the poor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:15,16">James ii. 15, 16</A>.

 (2.) His enquiry is, <I>Whence shall we buy bread?</I> One would think,
 considering his poverty, that he should rather have asked, <I>Where 
 shall we have money to buy for them?</I> But he will rather lay out all 
 he has than they shall want. He will buy to give, and we must
 <I>labour,</I> that we may give, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:28">Eph. iv. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The design of this enquiry; it was only to try the faith of Philip, 
 <I>for he himself knew what he would do,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) Our Lord Jesus is never at a loss in his counsels; but, how 
 difficult soever the case is, he knows what he has to do and what 
 course he will take, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:18">Acts xv. 18</A>.

 <I>He knows the thoughts he has towards his people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:11">Jer. xxix. 11</A>)

 and is never at uncertainty; when we know not, he <I>himself knows what
 he will do.</I> 

 (2.) When Christ is pleased to <I>puzzle</I> his people, it is only
 with a design to <I>prove</I> them. The question put Philip to a 
 nonplus, yet Christ proposed it, to try whether he would say, "Lord, if 
 thou wilt exert thy power for them, we need not buy bread."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Philip's answer to this question: "<I>Two hundred pennyworth of 
 bread is not sufficient,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Master, it is to no purpose to talk of buying bread for them, for 
 neither will the country afford so much bread, nor can we afford to lay 
 out so much money; ask Judas, who carries the bag." Two hundred pence 
 of <I>their</I> money amount to about six pounds of <I>ours,</I> and, 
 if they lay out all that at once, it will exhaust their fund, and break 
 them, and they must starve themselves. Grotius computes that <I>two 
 hundred pennyworth of bread</I> would scarcely reach to <I>two 
 thousand,</I> but Philip would go as near hand as he could, would have 
 <I>every one to take a little;</I> and nature, we say, is content with 
 a little. See the weakness of Philip's faith, that in this strait, as 
 if the Master of the family had been an <I>ordinary person,</I> he 
 looked for supply only in an <I>ordinary way.</I> Christ might now have 
 said to him, as he did afterwards, Have I <I>been so long time with 
 you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?</I> Or, as God to Moses in 
 a like case, <I>Is the Lord's hand waxen short?</I> We are apt thus to 
 distrust God's power when visible and ordinary means fail, that is, to 
 trust him no further than we can see him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The information which Christ received from another of his disciples 
 concerning the provision they had. It was Andrew, here said to be 
 <I>Simon Peter's brother;</I> though he was senior to Peter in 
 discipleship, and instrumental to bring Peter to Christ, yet Peter 
 afterwards so far outshone him that he is described by his relation to 
 Peter: he acquainted Christ with what they had at hand; and in this we 
 may see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>strength</I> of his <I>love</I> to those for whom he saw 
 his Master concerned, in that he was willing to bring out all they had, 
 though he knew not but they might want themselves, and any one would 
 have said, <I>Charity begins at home.</I> He did not go about to 
 conceal it, under pretence of being a better husband of their provision 
 than the master was, but honestly gives in an account of all they had. 
 There is a lad here, <B><I>paidarion</I></B>--<I>a little lad,</I>
 probably one that used to follow this company, as settlers do the camp, 
 with provisions to sell, and the disciples had bespoken what he had for 
 themselves; and it was <I>five barley-loaves,</I> and two small fishes. 
 Here, 

 [1.] The provision was <I>coarse</I> and <I>ordinary;</I> they were 
 <I>barley loaves.</I> Canaan was a <I>land of wheat</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:8">Deut. viii. 8</A>);

 its inhabitants were commonly fed with the finest wheat 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:16">Ps. lxxxi. 16</A>),
 
 the kidneys of wheat 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:14">Deut. xxxii. 14</A>);

 yet Christ and his disciples were glad of <I>barley-bread.</I> It does
 not follow hence that we should tie ourselves to such coarse fare, and 
 place religion in it (when God brings that which is finer to our hands, 
 let us receive it, and be thankful); but it does follow that therefore 
 we must not be <I>desirous of dainties</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:3">Ps. xxiii. 3</A>);

 nor murmur if we be reduced to coarse fare, but be content and
 thankful, and well reconciled to it; barley-bread is what Christ 
 <I>had,</I> and better than we <I>deserve.</I> Nor let us despise the 
 mean provision of the poor, nor look upon it with contempt, remembering 
 how Christ was provided for.

 [2.] It was but <I>short</I> and <I>scanty;</I> there were but <I>five 
 loaves,</I> and those so small that one little lad carried them all; 
 and we find

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:42,43">2 Kings iv. 42, 43</A>)

 that <I>twenty barley-loaves,</I> with some other provision to help
 out, would not dine a hundred men without a miracle. There were but two 
 fishes, and those <I>small</I> ones (<B><I>dyo opsaria</I></B>), so 
 small that one of them was but a morsel, <I>pisciculi assati.</I> I 
 take the fish to have been <I>pickled,</I> or <I>soused,</I> for they 
 had not fire to dress them with. The provision of <I>bread</I> was 
 <I>little,</I> but that of <I>fish</I> was <I>less</I> in proportion to 
 it, so that many a bit of dry bread they must eat before they could 
 make a meal of this provision; but they were content with it.
 <I>Bread</I> is meat for our hunger; but of those that murmured for 
 flesh it is said, <I>They asked meat for their lust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:18">Ps. lxxviii. 18</A>.
 
 Well, Andrew was willing that the people should have this, as far as it
 would go. Note, A distrustful fear of wanting ourselves should not 
 hinder us from needful charity to others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) See here the <I>weakness</I> of his <I>faith</I> in that word, 
 "<I>But what are they among so many?</I> To offer this to such a 
 multitude is but to mock them." Philip and he had not that actual 
 consideration of the power of Christ (of which they had had such large
 experience) which they should have had. Who fed the camp of Israel in 
 the wilderness? He that could make <I>one man chase a thousand</I> 
 could make one loaf feed a thousand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The directions Christ gave the disciples to seat the guests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 "<I>Make the men sit down,</I> though you have nothing to set before 
 them, and trust me for that." This was like <I>sending providence</I> 
 to <I>market,</I> and going to buy without money: Christ would thus try 
 their obedience. Observe, 

 (1.) The furniture of the dining-room: <I>there was much grass in that 
 place,</I> though a desert place; see how bountiful nature is, it 
 <I>makes grass to grow upon the mountains,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:8">Ps. cxlvii. 8</A>.

 This grass was uneaten; God gives not only enough, but more then
 enough. Here was this plenty of grass where Christ was preaching; the 
 gospel brings other blessings along with it: <I>Then shall the earth 
 yield her increase,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:6">Ps. lxvii. 6</A>.

 This plenty of grass made the place the more commodious for those that
 must sit on the ground, and served them for cushions, or <I>beds</I> 
 (as they called what they sat on at meat,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:6">Esth. i. 6</A>),
 
 and, considering what Christ says of the grass of the field

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:29,30">Matt. vi. 29, 30</A>),

 these beds excelled those of Ahasuerus: nature's pomp is the most
 glorious. 

 (2.) The number of the guests: <I>About five thousand:</I> a great
 entertainment, representing that of the gospel, which is a <I>feast for 
 all nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:6">Isa. xxv. 6</A>),
 
 a feast for all <I>comers.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. The distribution of the provision, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It was done with thanksgiving: <I>He gave thanks.</I> Note, 

 [1.] We ought to give thanks to God for our food, for it is a mercy to 
 have it, and we have it from the hand of God, and must <I>receive it 
 with thanksgiving,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:4,5">1 Tim. iv. 4, 5</A>.

 And this is the sweetness of our creature-comforts, that they will
 furnish us with <I>matter,</I> and give us occasion, for that excellent 
 duty of thanksgiving.

 [2.] Though our provision be coarse and scanty, though we have neither 
 plenty nor dainty, yet we must give thanks to God for what we have.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was distributed from the hand of Christ by the hands of his 
 disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Note, 

 [1.] All our comforts come to us <I>originally</I> from the hand of 
 Christ; whoever <I>brings</I> them, it is he that <I>sends</I> them, he 
 distributes to those who distribute to us. 

 [2.] In distributing the bread of life to those that follow him, he is 
 pleased to make use of the ministration of his disciples; they are the 
 servitors at Christ's table, or rather rulers in his household, to give 
 to <I>every one his portion of meat in due season.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It was done to universal satisfaction. They did not every one take 
 a little, but all had <I>as much as they would;</I> not a short 
 allowance, but a full meal; and considering how long they had fasted, 
 with what an appetite they sat down, how agreeable this miraculous food 
 may be supposed to have been, above common food, it was not a little 
 that served them when they ate as much as they would and on free cost. 
 Those whom Christ feeds with the bread of life he does not stint, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:10">Ps. lxxxi. 10</A>.

 There were but <I>two small fishes,</I> and yet they had <I>of them</I>
 too <I>as much as they would.</I> He did not reserve them for the 
 better sort of the guests, and put off the poor with dry bread, but 
 treated them all alike, for they were all alike welcome. Those who call 
 feeding upon fish <I>fasting</I> reproach the entertainment Christ here 
 made, which was a <I>full feast.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. The care that was taken of the broken meat. 

 (1.) The orders Christ gave concerning it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>When they were filled,</I> and every man had within him a sensible 
 witness to the truth of the miracle, Christ <I>said to the 
 disciples,</I> the servants he employed, <I>Gather up the 
 fragments.</I> Note, We must always take care that we make no waste of 
 any of God's good creatures; for the grant we have of them, though 
 large and full, is with this proviso, <I>wilful waste only 
 excepted.</I> It is just with God to bring us to the want of that which 
 we make waste of. The Jews were very careful not to lose any bread, nor 
 let it fall to the ground, to be trodden upon. <I>Qui panem contemnit
 in gravem incidit paupertatem--He who despises bread falls into the 
 depths of poverty,</I> was a saying among them. Though Christ could
 command supplies whenever he pleased, yet he would have the fragments 
 gathered up. When we are filled we must remember that others want, and 
 we may want. Those that would have wherewith to be <I>charitable</I> 
 must be <I>provident.</I> Had this broken meat been left upon the 
 grass, the beasts and fowls would have gathered it up; but that which 
 is fit to be meat for men is wasted and lost if it be thrown to the 
 brute-creatures. Christ did not order the broken meat to be gathered up 
 till all were filled; we must not begin to hoard and lay up till all is 
 laid out that ought to be, for that is withholding more than is meet.
 Mr. Baxter notes here, "How much less should we lose God's word, or 
 helps, or our time, or such greater mercies!" 

 (2.) The observance of these orders 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>They filled twelve baskets with the fragments,</I> which was an 
 evidence not only of the <I>truth</I> of the miracle, that they were 
 fed, not with fancy, but with real food (witness those remains), but of 
 the <I>greatness</I> of it; they were not only filled, but there was 
 all this over and above. See how large the divine bounty is; it not
 only <I>fills</I> the cup, but makes it <I>run over;</I> bread enough, 
 and to spare, in our Father's house. The fragments filled twelve 
 baskets, one for each disciple; they were thus repaid with interest for
 their willingness to part with what they had for public service; see 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+31:10">2 Chron. xxxi. 10</A>.

 The Jews lay it as a law upon themselves, when they have eaten a meal,
 to be sure to leave a piece of bread upon the table, upon which the 
 blessing after meat may rest; for it is a curse upon the wicked man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:21">Job xx. 21</A>)

 that <I>there shall none of his meat be left.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the influence which this miracle had upon the people who 
 tasted of the benefit of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>They said, This is of a truth that prophet.</I> Note, 

 1. Even the vulgar Jews with great assurance expected the Messiah to
 come into the world, and to be a <I>great prophet,</I> They speak here 
 with assurance of his coming. The Pharisees despised them as <I>not 
 knowing the law;</I> but, it should seem, they knew more of him that is 
 the <I>end of the law</I> than the Pharisees did. 

 2. The miracles which Christ wrought did clearly demonstrate that he
 was the Messiah promised, a teacher come from God, the great prophet, 
 and could not but convince the amazed spectators that this was he that 
 should come. There were many who were convinced he was that prophet 
 that should come into the world who yet did not cordially receive his 
 doctrine, for they did not continue in it. Such a wretched incoherence 
 and inconsistency there is between the faculties of the corrupt 
 unsanctified soul, that it is possible for men to acknowledge that 
 Christ is that prophet, and yet to turn a deaf ear to him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take
 him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a
 mountain himself alone.
 &nbsp; 16  And when even was <I>now</I> come, his disciples went down unto
 the sea,
 &nbsp; 17  And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward
 Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.
 &nbsp; 18  And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
 &nbsp; 19  So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty
 furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh
 unto the ship: and they were afraid.
 &nbsp; 20  But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
 &nbsp; 21  Then they willingly received him into the ship: and
 immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. Christ's retirement from the multitude.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Observe what induced him to retire; because he perceived that those 
 who acknowledged him to be that prophet that should come into the world 
 would come, and <I>take him by force, to make him a king,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Now here we have an instance,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Of the irregular zeal of some of Christ's followers; nothing would 
 serve but they would make him <I>a king.</I> Now, 

 [1.] This was <I>an act of zeal</I> for the honour of Christ, and 
 against the contempt which the ruling part of the Jewish church put 
 upon him. They were concerned to see so great a benefactor to the world 
 so little esteemed in it; and therefore, since royal titles are counted 
 the most illustrious, they would make him a king, knowing that the 
 Messiah was to be a king; and if a prophet, like Moses, then a 
 sovereign prince and lawgiver, like him; and, if they cannot set him up 
 <I>upon the holy hill of Zion,</I> a <I>mountain</I> in Galilee shall 
 serve for the present. Those whom Christ has feasted with the royal 
 dainties of heaven should, in return for his favour, make him 
 <I>their</I> king, and set him upon the throne in their souls: let him 
 that has <I>fed</I> us <I>rule us.</I> But, 

 [2.] It was an <I>irregular</I> zeal; for <I>First,</I> It was grounded 
 upon a mistake concerning the nature of Christ's kingdom, as if it were 
 to be <I>of this world,</I> and he must appear with outward pomp, a 
 crown on his head, and an army at his foot; such a king as this they 
 would make him, which was as great a disparagement to his glory as it 
 would be to lacquer gold or paint a ruby. Right notions of Christ's 
 kingdom would keep us to right methods for advancing it. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> It was excited by the love of the flesh; they would 
 make <I>him</I> their king who could feed them so plentifully without 
 their toil, and save them from the curse of <I>eating their bread in 
 the sweat of their face. Thirdly,</I> It was intended to carry on a
 <I>secular</I> design; they hoped this might be a fair opportunity of 
 shaking off the Roman yoke, of which they were weary. If they had one 
 to head them who could victual an army cheaper than another could 
 provide for a family, they were sure of the sinews of the war, and 
 could not fail of success, and the recovery of their ancient liberties. 
 Thus is religion often prostituted to a secular interest, and Christ is 
 served only to <I>serve a turn,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:18">Rom. xvi. 18</A>.

 <I>Vix qu&aelig;ritur</I> Jesus <I>propter</I> Jesum, <I>sed propter
 aliud--Jesus is usually sought after for something else, not for his 
 own sake.</I>--Augustine. Nay, <I>Fourthly,</I> It was a tumultuous,
 seditious attempt, and a disturbance of the public peace; it would make 
 the country a seat of war, and expose it to the resentments of the 
 Roman power. <I>Fifthly,</I> It was contrary to the mind of our Lord
 Jesus himself; for they would take him <I>by force,</I> whether he 
 would or no. Note, Those who force honours upon Christ which he has not 
 required at their hands displease him, and do him the greatest 
 dishonour. Those that say <I>I am of Christ,</I> in opposition to those 
 that are of Apollos and Cephas (so making Christ the head of a party), 
 take him by force, to make him a king, contrary to his own mind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is an instance of the humility and self-denial of the Lord 
 Jesus, that, when they would have made him a king, he <I>departed;</I> 
 so far was he from countenancing the design that he effectually quashed 
 it. Herein he has left a testimony, 

 [1.] Against ambition and affectation of worldly honour, to which he 
 was perfectly mortified, and has taught us to be so. Had they come to 
 take him by force and make him a prisoner, he could not have been more 
 industrious to abscond than he was when they would make him a king. Let 
 us not then covet to be the <I>idols of the crowd,</I> nor be 
 <I>desirous of vainglory.</I> 

 [2.] Against faction and sedition, treason and rebellion, and whatever 
 tends to disturb the peace of kings and provinces. By this it appears 
 that he was no enemy to C&aelig;sar, nor would have his followers be 
 so, but the <I>quiet in the land;</I> that he would have his ministers 
 decline every thing that looks <I>like</I> sedition, or looks 
 <I>towards</I> it, and improve their interest only for their work's 
 sake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Observe <I>whither</I> he retired: <I>He departed again into a 
 mountain,</I> <B><I>eis to oros</I></B>--<I>into the</I> mountain, the
 mountain where he had preached 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 whence he came down into the plain, to feed the people, and then 
 returned to it alone, to be private. Christ, though so useful in the 
 places of concourse, yet chose sometimes to be alone, to teach us to 
 sequester ourselves from the world now and then, for the more free 
 converse with God and our own souls; and <I>never less alone,</I> says 
 the serious Christian, <I>than when alone.</I> Public services must not 
 jostle out private devotions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the disciples' distress at sea. <I>They that go down to the 
 sea in ships, these see the works of the Lord, for he raiseth the 
 stormy wind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:23,24">Ps. xvii. 23, 24</A>.

 Apply this to these disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is their <I>going down to the sea</I> in a ship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>):
 
 <I>When even was come,</I> and they had done their day's work, it was 
 time to look homeward, and therefore they went aboard, and set sail for 
 Capernaum. This they did by particular direction from their Master, 
 with design (as it should seem) to get them out of the way of the 
 temptation of countenancing those that would have made him a king.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is the <I>stormy wind</I> arising and <I>fulfilling the word of 
 God.</I> They were Christ's disciples, and were now in the way of their 
 duty, and Christ was now in the mount praying for them; and yet they 
 were in this distress. The perils and afflictions of this present time 
 may very well consist with our interest in Christ and his intercession. 
 They had lately been feasted at Christ's table; but after the sun-shine 
 of comfort expect a storm. 

 (1.) <I>It was now dark;</I> this made the storm the more dangerous and 
 uncomfortable. Sometimes the people of God are in trouble, and cannot 
 see their way out; in the dark concerning the cause of their trouble, 
 concerning the design and tendency of it, and what the issue will be. 
 
 (2.) Jesus <I>was not come to them.</I> When they were in that storm

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:23">Matt. viii. 23</A>,

 &c.) <I>Jesus was with them;</I> but now their beloved had withdrawn
 himself, and was gone. The absence of Christ is the great aggravation
 of the troubles of Christians. 

 (3.) The <I>sea arose by reason of a great wind.</I> It was calm and 
 fair when they put to sea (they were not so presumptuous as to launch 
 out in a storm), but it arose when they were <I>at sea.</I> In times of 
 tranquillity we must prepare for trouble, for it may arise when we 
 little think of it. Let it comfort good people, when they happen to be 
 in storms at sea, that the disciples of Christ were so; and let the 
 promises of a gracious God balance the threats of an angry sea. Though 
 in a storm, and <I>in the dark,</I> they are no worse off than Christ's 
 disciples were. Clouds and darkness sometimes surround the children of 
 the light, and of the day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here is Christ's seasonable approach to them when they were in this 
 peril, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 <I>They had rowed</I> (being forced by the contrary winds to betake 
 themselves to their oars) <I>about twenty-five or thirty furlongs.</I> 
 The Holy Spirit that indicted this could have ascertained the number of 
 furlongs precisely, but this, being only circumstantial, is left to be 
 expressed according to the conjecture of the penman. And, when they 
 were got off a good way at sea, they <I>see Jesus walking on the 
 sea.</I> See here,

 (1.) The power Christ has over the laws and customs of nature, to 
 control and dispense with them at his pleasure. It is natural for
 heavy bodies to sink in water, but Christ walked <I>upon</I> the water 
 as upon dry land, which was more than Moses's dividing the water and 
 walking <I>through</I> the water. 

 (2.) The concern Christ has for his disciples in distress: <I>He drew 
 nigh to the ship;</I> for <I>therefore</I> he walked upon the water, as 
 he <I>rides upon the heavens, for the help of his people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:26">Deut. xxxiii. 26</A>.

 He will not leave them comfortless when they seem to be <I>tossed with
 tempests</I> and <I>not comforted.</I> When they are banished (as John) 
 into remote places, or shut up (as Paul and Silas) in close places, he 
 will find access to them, and will be nigh them.

 (3.) The relief Christ gives to his disciples in their fears. They 
 <I>were afraid,</I> more afraid of an apparition (for so they supposed 
 him to be) than of the winds and waves. It is more terrible to wrestle 
 with the rulers of the darkness of this world than with a tempestuous 
 sea. When they thought a demon haunted them, and perhaps was 
 instrumental to raise the storm, they were more terrified than they had 
 been while they saw nothing in it but what was natural. Note, 

 [1.] Our real distresses are often much increased by our imaginary 
 ones, the creatures of our own fancy. 

 [2.] Even the approaches of comfort and deliverance are often so 
 misconstrued as to become the occasions of fear and perplexity. We are 
 often not only <I>worse frightened than hurt,</I> but <I>then</I> most 
 <I>frightened</I> when we are ready to be <I>helped.</I> But, when they 
 were in this fright, how affectionately did Christ silence their fears 
 with that compassionate word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>It is I, be not afraid!</I> Nothing is more powerful to convince 
 sinners than that word, <I>I am Jesus whom thou persecutest;</I> 
 nothing more powerful to comfort saints than this, "<I>I am Jesus whom 
 thou lovest;</I> it is I that love thee, and seek thy good; be not 
 afraid of me, nor of the storm." When trouble is nigh Christ is 
 nigh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Here is their speedy arrival at the port they were bound for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 (1.) They <I>welcomed</I> Christ into the ship; they <I>willingly 
 received him.</I> Note, Christ's absenting himself for a time is but so 
 much the more to <I>endear himself,</I> at his return, to his 
 disciples, who value his presence above any thing; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:4">Cant. iii. 4</A>.

 (2.) Christ brought them safely to the shore: <I>Immediately the ship 
 was at the land whither they went.</I> Note, 

 [1.] The ship of the church, in which the disciples of Christ have 
 <I>embarked</I> themselves and their all, may be much shattered and 
 distressed, yet it shall come safe to the harbour at last; 
 <I>tossed</I> at sea, but not <I>lost;</I> cast down, but not 
 destroyed; the bush burning, but not consumed. 

 [2.] The power and presence of the church's King shall expedite and 
 facilitate her deliverance, and conquer the difficulties which have 
 baffled the skill and industry of all her other friends. The disciples 
 had rowed hard, but could not make their point till they had got Christ 
 in the ship, and then the work was <I>done suddenly.</I> If we have 
 received Christ Jesus the Lord, have received him willingly, though the 
 night be dark and the wind high, yet we may comfort ourselves with 
 this, that we shall be at shore shortly, and are nearer to it than we 
 think we are. Many a doubting soul is fetched to heaven by a pleasing
 surprise, or ever it is aware.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  The day following, when the people which stood on the other
 side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save
 that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus
 went not with his disciples into the boat, but <I>that</I> his
 disciples were gone away alone;
 &nbsp; 23  (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the
 place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given
 thanks:)
 &nbsp; 24  When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there,
 neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to
 Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
 &nbsp; 25  And when they had found him on the other side of the sea,
 they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
 &nbsp; 26  Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto
 you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye
 did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
 &nbsp; 27  Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat
 which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall
 give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The careful enquiry which the people made after Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.
 
 They saw the disciples go to sea; they saw Christ retire to the 
 mountain, probably with an intimation that he desired to be private for 
 some time; but, their hearts being set upon <I>making him a king,</I> 
 they way-laid his return, and <I>the day following,</I> the hot fit of 
 their zeal still continuing,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were <I>much at a loss</I> for him. He was gone, and they knew 
 not what was become of him. They saw there was <I>no boat there</I> but 
 that in which the disciples went off, Providence so ordering it for the 
 confirming of the miracle of his walking on the sea, for there was no 
 boat for him to go in. They observed also that <I>Jesus did not go with 
 his disciples,</I> but that they went off alone, and left him among 
 <I>them</I> on <I>their</I> side of the water. Note, Those that would 
 find Christ must diligently observe all his motions, and learn to 
 understand the tokens of his presence and absence, that they may steer 
 accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They were very <I>industrious in seeking</I> him. They searched the 
 places thereabouts, and when <I>they saw that Jesus was not there, nor 
 his disciples</I> (neither he nor any one that could give tidings of 
 him), they resolved to search elsewhere. Note, Those that would find
 Christ must accomplish a diligent search, must seek till they find, 
 must go from sea to sea, to seek the word of God, rather than live 
 without it; and those whom Christ has feasted with the bread of life 
 should have their souls carried out in earnest desires towards him. 
 Much would have more, in communion with Christ. Now, 

 (1.) They resolved to go to Capernaum in quest of him. There were his 
 head-quarters, where he usually resided. Thither his disciples were 
 gone; and they knew he would not be long absent from <I>them.</I> Those 
 that would find Christ must go forth by the footsteps of the flock. 
 
 (2.) Providence favoured them with an opportunity of going thither by 
 sea, which was the speediest way; for there <I>came other boats from 
 Tiberias,</I> which lay further off upon the same shore, <I>nigh,</I> 
 though not so nigh to the place where they did <I>eat bread,</I> in 
 which they might soon make a trip to Capernaum, and probably the boats 
 were bound for that port. Note, Those that in sincerity seek Christ, 
 and seek opportunities of converse with him, are commonly owned and 
 assisted by Providence in those pursuits. The evangelist, having 
 occasion to mention their eating the <I>multiplied</I> bread, adds, 
 <I>After that the Lord had given thanks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 So much were the disciples affected with their Master's giving thanks 
 that they could never forget the impressions made upon them by it, but 
 took a pleasure in remembering the gracious words that then proceeded 
 out of his mouth. This was the grace and beauty of that meal, and made
 it remarkable; their hearts burned within them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They laid hold of the opportunity that offered itself, and <I>they 
 also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</I> They 
 did not defer, in hopes to see him again <I>on this side the water;</I> 
 but their convictions being strong, and their desires warm, they 
 followed him presently. Good motions are often crushed, and come to 
 nothing, for want of being <I>prosecuted</I> in <I>time.</I> They came 
 to Capernaum, and, for aught that appears, these unsound hypocritical 
 followers of Christ had a <I>calm</I> and <I>pleasant</I> passage, 
 while his sincere disciples had a <I>rough</I> and <I>stormy</I> one. 
 It is not strange if it fare worst with the best men in this evil 
 world. They <I>came, seeking Jesus.</I> Note, Those that would find 
 Christ, and find comfort in him, must be willing to take pains, and, as 
 here, to <I>compass</I> sea and land to seek and serve him who came 
 from heaven to earth to seek and save us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The success of this enquiry: <I>They found him on the other side of 
 the sea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Note, Christ will be found of those that seek him, first or last; and 
 it is worth while to cross a sea, nay, to go <I>from sea to sea, and 
 from the river to the ends of the earth,</I> to seek Christ, if we may 
 but find him at last. These people appeared afterwards to be unsound, 
 and not actuated by any good principle, and yet were thus zealous. 
 Note, Hypocrites may be very forward in their attendance on God's 
 ordinances. If men have <I>no more</I> to show for their love to Christ 
 than their running after sermons and prayers, and their pangs of 
 affection to good preaching, they have reason to suspect themselves no 
 better than this <I>eager crowd.</I> But though these people were no 
 better principled, and Christ knew it, yet he was willing to be found 
 of them, and admitted them into fellowship with him. If we could know 
 the hearts of hypocrites, yet, while their profession is plausible, we 
 must not exclude them from our communion, much less when we do not know 
 their hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The question they put to him when they found him: <I>Rabbi, when 
 camest thou hither?</I> It should seem by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>

 that they found him <I>in the synagogue.</I> They knew this was the 
 likeliest place to seek Christ in, for it was <I>his custom</I> to 
 attend public assemblies for religious worship, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:16">Luke iv. 16</A>.

 Note, Christ must be sought, and will be found, in the congregations of
 his people and in the administration of his ordinances; public worship 
 is what Christ chooses to own and grace with his presence and the 
 manifestations of himself. There they found him, and all they had to 
 say to him was, <I>Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</I> They saw he 
 would not be made a king, and therefore say no more of this, but call 
 him Rabbi, their teacher. Their enquiry refers not only to the 
 <I>time,</I> but to the <I>manner,</I> of his conveying himself 
 thither; not only <I>When,</I> but, "<I>How,</I> camest thou thither?" 
 for there was no boat for him to come in. They were curious in asking 
 concerning Christ's motions, but not solicitous to observe their 
 own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The answer Christ gave them, not direct to their question (what was 
 it to them <I>when</I> and <I>how</I> he came thither?) but such an 
 answer as their case required.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He discovers the <I>corrupt principle</I> they <I>acted from</I> in 
 following him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>Verily, verily, I say unto you,</I> I that search the heart, and 
 know what is in man, I the Amen, the faithful witness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:14,15">Rev. iii. 14, 15</A>.
 
 <I>You seek me;</I> that is well, but it is not from a good principle."
 Christ knows not only <I>what</I> we do, but <I>why</I> we do it. These
 followed Christ, 

 (1.) Not for his doctrine's sake: <I>Not because you saw the 
 miracles.</I> The miracles were the great confirmation of his doctrine; 
 Nicodemus sought for him for the sake of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:2"><I>ch.</I> iii. 2</A>),

 and argued from the power of his works to the truth of his word; but
 these were so stupid and mindless that they never considered this. But, 
 
 (2.) It was for their own bellies' sake: <I>Because you did eat of the 
 loaves, and were filled;</I> not because he taught them, but because he 
 fed them. He had given them, 

 [1.] A <I>full</I> meal's meat: <I>They did eat, and were filled;</I> 
 and some of them perhaps were so poor that they had not known of a long 
 time before now what it was to have enough, to eat and leave. 

 [2.] A <I>dainty</I> meal's meat; it is probable that, as the 
 miraculous wine was the best wine, so was the miraculous food more than 
 usually pleasant. 

 [3.] A <I>cheap</I> meal's meat, that cost them nothing; no reckoning 
 was brought in. Note, Many follow Christ for <I>loaves,</I> and not for 
 <I>love.</I> Thus those do who aim at secular advantage in their 
 profession of religion, and follow it because by this craft they get 
 their preferments. <I>Quantis profuit nobis h&aelig;c fabula de 
 Christo--This fable respecting Christ, what a gainful concern we have 
 made of it!</I> said one of the popes. These people <I>complimented</I> 
 Christ with Rabbi, and showed him great respect, yet he told them thus 
 faithfully of their hypocrisy; his ministers must hence learn not to 
 flatter those that flatter them, nor to be <I>bribed</I> by fair words 
 to cry <I>peace</I> to all that cry <I>rabbi</I> to them, but to give 
 faithful reproofs where there is cause for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He directs them to better principles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>Labour for that meat which endures to everlasting life.</I> With the 
 woman of Samaria he had discoursed of spiritual things under the 
 similitude of <I>water;</I> here he speaks of them under the similitude 
 of <I>meat,</I> taking occasion from the loaves they had eaten. His 
 design is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To moderate our worldly pursuits: <I>Labour not for the meat that 
 perishes.</I> This does not forbid honest labour for food convenient, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:12">2 Thess. iii. 12</A>.

 But we must not make the things of this world our chief care and
 concern. Note,

 [1.] The things of the world are <I>meat that perishes.</I> Worldly 
 wealth, honour, and pleasure, are <I>meat;</I> they <I>feed the 
 fancy</I> (and many times this is all) and <I>fill the belly.</I> These 
 are things which mean <I>hunger</I> after as <I>meat,</I> and glut 
 themselves with, and which a carnal heart, as long as they last, may 
 make a shift to live upon; but they <I>perish,</I> are of a perishing 
 nature, wither of themselves, and are exposed to a thousand accidents; 
 those that have the largest share of them are not sure to have them 
 while they live, but are sure to leave them and lose them when they 
 die. 

 [2.] It is therefore folly for us inordinately to labour after them. 
 <I>First,</I> We must not labour in religion, nor work the works 
 thereof, <I>for this perishing meat,</I> with an eye to this; we must 
 not make our religion subservient to a worldly interest, nor aim at 
 <I>secular advantages</I> in <I>sacred exercises. Secondly,</I> We must 
 not at all <I>labour</I> for this meat; that is, we must not make these 
 perishing things our <I>chief good,</I> nor make our care and pains 
 about them our <I>chief business;</I> not seek those things 
 <I>first</I> and <I>most,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:4,5">Prov. xxiii. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To quicken and excite our gracious pursuits: "Bestow your pains to 
 better purpose, and <I>labour for that meat</I> which belongs to the 
 soul," of which he shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That it is <I>unspeakably desirable:</I> It is meat which 
 <I>endures to everlasting life;</I> it is a happiness which will last 
 as long as we must, which not only itself endures eternally, but will 
 nourish us up to everlasting life. The blessings of the new covenant 
 are our preparative for eternal life, our preservative to it, and the 
 pledge and earnest of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It is <I>undoubtedly attainable.</I> Shall all the treasures of 
 the world be ransacked, and all the fruits of the earth gathered 
 together, to furnish us with provisions that will last to eternity? No, 
 <I>The sea saith, It is not in me,</I> among all the treasures hidden 
 in the sand. <I>It cannot be gotten for gold;</I> but it is that 
 <I>which the Son of man shall give;</I> <B><I>hen dosei</I></B>, either 
 which <I>meat,</I> or which <I>life,</I> the Son of man shall give. 
 Observe here, <I>First,</I> Who gives this meat: the <I>Son of man,</I> 
 the great householder and master of the stores, who is entrusted with 
 the administration of the kingdom of God among men, and the 
 dispensation of the gifts, graces, and comforts of that kingdom, and 
 has power to give eternal life, with all the means of it and 
 preparatives for it. We are told to <I>labour for it,</I> as if it were 
 to be got by our own industry, and sold upon that valuable 
 consideration, as the heathen said, <I>Dii laboribus omnia vendunt--The
 gods sell all advantages to the industrious.</I> But when we have 
 laboured ever so much for it, we have not merited it as our 
 <I>hire,</I> but the Son of man <I>gives it.</I> And what more free 
 than gift? It is an encouragement that he who has the giving of it is 
 the <I>Son of man,</I> for then we may hope the <I>sons of men</I> that 
 seek it, and labour for it, shall not fail to have it. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 What authority he has to give it; for <I>him has God the Father 
 sealed,</I> <B><I>touton gar ho Pater esphragisen, ho 
 Theos</I></B>--<I>for him the Father has sealed</I> (proved and
 evidenced) <I>to be God;</I> so some read it; he has declared him to be 
 the Son of God with power. He has <I>sealed him,</I> that is, has given 
 him full authority to deal between God and man, as God's 
 <I>ambassador</I> to man and man's <I>intercessor</I> with God, and has 
 proved his commission by miracles. Having given him <I>authority,</I> 
 he has given us <I>assurance</I> of it; having entrusted him with 
 <I>unlimited powers,</I> he has satisfied us with <I>undoubted 
 proofs</I> of them; so that as he might go on with confidence in his 
 undertaking for us, so may we in our resignations to him. <I>God the 
 Father</I> scaled him with the Spirit that rested on him, by the voice 
 from heaven, by the testimony he bore to him in signs and wonders. 
 Divine revelation is perfected in him, in him the <I>vision</I> and 
 <I>prophecy</I> is <I>sealed up</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24">Dan. ix. 24</A>),

 to him all believers <I>seal</I> that he is true

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:33"><I>ch.</I> iii. 33</A>),
 
 and in him they are all <I>sealed,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might
 work the works of God?
 &nbsp; 29  Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God,
 that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
 &nbsp; 30  They said therefore unto him, What sign showest thou then,
 that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?
 &nbsp; 31  Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written,
 He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
 &nbsp; 32  Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
 Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth
 you the true bread from heaven.
 &nbsp; 33  For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven,
 and giveth life unto the world.
 &nbsp; 34  Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
 &nbsp; 35  And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that
 cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me
 shall never thirst.
 &nbsp; 36  But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe
 not.
 &nbsp; 37  All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
 cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
 &nbsp; 38  For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but
 the will of him that sent me.
 &nbsp; 39  And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of
 all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should
 raise it up again at the last day.
 &nbsp; 40  And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one
 which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting
 life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
 &nbsp; 41  The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the
 bread which came down from heaven.
 &nbsp; 42  And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose
 father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came
 down from heaven?
 &nbsp; 43  Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not
 among yourselves.
 &nbsp; 44  No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me
 draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
 &nbsp; 45  It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught
 of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of
 the Father, cometh unto me.
 &nbsp; 46  Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of
 God, he hath seen the Father.
 &nbsp; 47  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
 everlasting life.
 &nbsp; 48  I am that bread of life.
 &nbsp; 49  Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
 &nbsp; 50  This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man
 may eat thereof, and not die.
 &nbsp; 51  I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any
 man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that
 I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the
 world.
 &nbsp; 52  The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can
 this man give us <I>his</I> flesh to eat?
 &nbsp; 53  Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
 Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood,
 ye have no life in you.
 &nbsp; 54  Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal
 life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
 &nbsp; 55  For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
 &nbsp; 56  He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in
 me, and I in him.
 &nbsp; 57  As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father:
 so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.
 &nbsp; 58  This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your
 fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread
 shall live for ever.
 &nbsp; 59  These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in
 Capernaum.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Whether this conference was with the Capernaites, in whose synagogue 
 Christ now was, or with those who came from the other side of the sea, 
 is not certain nor material; however, it is an instance of Christ's 
 condescension that he gave them leave to ask him questions, and did not 
 resent the interruption as an affront, no, not from his common hearers, 
 though not his immediate followers. Those that would be apt to teach 
 must be swift to hear, and study to answer. It is the wisdom of 
 teachers, when they are asked even impertinent unprofitable questions, 
 thence to take occasion to answer in that which is profitable, that the 
 question may be rejected, but not the request. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ having told them that <I>they</I> must <I>work for the 
 meat</I> he spoke of, must <I>labour</I> for it, they enquire what work 
 they must do, and he answers them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.

 1. Their <I>enquiry</I> was <I>pertinent</I> enough

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?</I> Some 
 understand it as a pert question: "What works of God can we do more and 
 better than those we do in obedience to the law of Moses?" But I rather 
 take it as a humble serious question, showing them to be, at least for 
 the present, in a good mind, and willing to know and do their duty; and 
 I imagine that those who asked this question, How and What 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 and made the request 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 were not the same persons with those that murmured 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:41,42"><I>v.</I> 41, 42</A>),

 and strove 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>),

 for those are expressly called <I>the Jews,</I> who came out of Judea 
 (for those were strictly called Jews) to cavil, whereas these were of 
 Galilee, and came to be taught. This question here intimates that they 
 were convinced that those who would obtain this everlasting meat, 

 (1.) Must aim to do something great. Those who <I>look high</I> in 
 their expectations, and hope to enjoy the <I>glory of God,</I> must 
 <I>aim high</I> in those endeavours, and study to <I>do the works of 
 God,</I> works which he requires and will accept, <I>works of God,</I> 
 distinguished from the works of worldly men in their worldly pursuits.
 It is not enough to speak the words of God, but we must do the works of 
 God. 

 (2.) Must be willing to do any thing: <I>What shall we do?</I> Lord, I 
 am ready to do whatever thou shalt appoint, though ever so displeasing 
 to flesh and blood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:6">Acts ix. 6</A>.
 
 2. Christ's answer was plain enough

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>This is the work of God that ye believe.</I> Note, 

 (1.) The work of faith is the work of God. They enquire after the
 <I>works</I> of God (in the plural number), being careful about <I>many 
 things;</I> but Christ directs them to one work, which includes all, 
 the one thing needful: that <I>you believe,</I> which supersedes all 
 the works of the ceremonial law; the work which is necessary to the 
 acceptance of all the other works, and which produces them, for without 
 faith you cannot please God. It is <I>God's work,</I> for it is of his 
 <I>working in us,</I> it subjects the soul to his working on us, and 
 quickens the soul in working <I>for him,</I> 

 (2.) That faith is the work of God which closes with Christ, and relies 
 upon him. It is to <I>believe on him</I> as one whom God <I>hath 
 sent,</I> as God's commissioner in the great affair of peace between 
 God and man, and as such to <I>rest</I> upon him, and <I>resign 
 ourselves</I> to him. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:1"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ having told them that the <I>Son of man</I> would <I>give 
 them this meat,</I> they enquire concerning him, and he answers their 
 enquiry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their enquiry is after <I>a sign</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>What sign showest thou?</I> Thus far they were right, that, since he 
 required them to give him <I>credit,</I> he should produce his 
 <I>credentials,</I> and make it out by miracle that he was <I>sent of 
 God.</I> Moses having confirmed his mission by <I>signs,</I> it was 
 requisite that Christ, who came to set aside the ceremonial law, should 
 in like manner confirm his: "<I>What dost thou work?</I> What doest 
 thou drive at? What lasting characters of a divine power does thou 
 design to leave upon thy doctrine?" But <I>herein</I> they missed 
 it,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That they overlooked the many miracles which they had seen wrought 
 by him, and which amounted to an abundant proof of his divine mission. 
 Is this a time of day to ask, "What sign showest thou?" especially at 
 Capernaum, the <I>staple</I> of miracles, where he had done so <I>many 
 mighty works, signs</I> so significant of his office and undertaking? 
 Were not these very persons but the other day miraculously fed by him? 
 None so blind as they that will not see; for they may be so blind as to 
 question whether it be day or no, when the sun shines in their 
 faces.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That they preferred the miraculous feeding of Israel in the 
 wilderness before all the miracles Christ wrought 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>Our fathers did eat manna in the desert;</I> and, to strengthen the 
 objection, they quote a scripture for it: <I>He gave them bread from 
 heaven</I> (taken from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:24">Ps. lxxviii. 24</A>),

 <I>he gave them of the corn of heaven.</I> What a good use might be 
 made of this story to which they here refer! It was a memorable 
 instance of God's power and goodness, often mentioned to the glory of 
 God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+19:20,21">Neh. xix. 20, 21</A>),

 yet see how these people perverted it, and made an ill use of it. 

 [1.] Christ reproved them for their fondness of the miraculous bread, 
 and bade them not set their hearts upon <I>meat which perisheth;</I> 
 "Why," say they, "<I>meat for the belly</I> was the great good thing 
 that God gave to our fathers in the desert; and why should not we then 
 labour for that meat? If God made much of them, why should not we be 
 for those that will make much of us?" 

 [2.] Christ had fed five thousand men with five loaves, and had given 
 them that as one sign to prove him <I>sent of God;</I> but, under 
 colour of <I>magnifying</I> the miracles of Moses, they tacitly 
 <I>undervalue</I> this miracle of Christ, and <I>evade</I> the evidence 
 of it. "Christ fed his thousands; but Moses his hundreds of thousands; 
 Christ fed them but once, and then reproved those who followed him in 
 hope to be still fed, and put them off with a discourse of spiritual 
 food; but Moses fed his followers forty years, and miracles were not 
 their rarities, but their daily bread: Christ fed them with bread out 
 of <I>the earth,</I> barley-bread, and fishes out of <I>the sea;</I> 
 but Moses fed Israel with bread <I>from heaven,</I> angel's food." Thus 
 big did these Jews talk of the <I>manna</I> which <I>their fathers did 
 eat;</I> but their fathers had slighted it as much as they did now the 
 barley-loaves, and called <I>light bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:5">Num. xxi. 5</A>.

 Thus apt are we to slight and overlook the appearances of God's power
 and grace in our own times, while we pretend to admire the wonders of 
 which <I>our fathers told us.</I> Suppose <I>this</I> miracle of Christ 
 was outdone by that of Moses, yet there were other instances in which 
 Christ's miracles outshone his; and, besides, all true miracles prove a 
 divine doctrine, though not equally illustrious in the circumstances, 
 which were ever <I>diversified</I> according as the occasion did 
 require. As much as the manna excelled the barley-loaves, so much, and 
 much more, did the doctrine of Christ excel the law of Moses, and his 
 heavenly institutions the carnal ordinances of that dispensation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is Christ's reply to this enquiry, wherein,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He <I>rectifies</I> their <I>mistake</I> concerning the 
 <I>typical</I> manna. It was true that their fathers did eat 
 <I>manna</I> in the desert. But, 

 [1.] It was not Moses that gave it to them, nor were they obliged to 
 him for it; he was but the instrument, and therefore they must look 
 beyond him to God. We do not find that Moses did so much as pray to God 
 for the <I>manna;</I> and he spoke unadvisedly when he said, <I>Must we 
 fetch water out of the rock?</I> Moses gave them not either <I>that</I> 
 bread or <I>that water.</I> 

 [2.] It was not given them, as they imagined, <I>from heaven,</I> from 
 the highest heavens, but only from <I>the clouds,</I> and therefore not 
 so much superior to that which had its rise from the earth as they 
 thought. Because the scripture saith, <I>He gave them bread from 
 heaven,</I> it does not follow that it was <I>heavenly bread,</I> or 
 was intended to be the nourishment of souls. Misunderstanding
 scripture language occasions many mistakes in the things of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He <I>informs</I> them concerning the <I>true</I> manna, of which 
 that was a type: <I>But my Father giveth you the true bread from 
 heaven;</I> that which is truly and properly the <I>bread from 
 heaven,</I> of which the manna was but a shadow and figure, is <I>now 
 given,</I> not to <I>your fathers,</I> who are dead and gone, but <I>to 
 you</I> of this present age, for whom the <I>better things were 
 reserved:</I> he is <I>now giving</I> you that <I>bread from 
 heaven,</I> which is <I>truly</I> so called. As much as the throne of 
 God's glory is above the clouds of the air, so much does the 
 <I>spiritual bread</I> of the everlasting gospel excel the 
 <I>manna.</I> In calling God <I>his Father,</I> he proclaims himself 
 greater than Moses; for Moses was faithful but as a servant, Christ as 
 a <I>Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:5,6">Heb. iii. 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ, having replied to their enquiries, takes further occasion 
 from their objection concerning the <I>manna</I> to discourse of 
 <I>himself</I> under the similitude of <I>bread,</I> and of 
 <I>believing</I> under the similitude of <I>eating and drinking;</I> to 
 which, together with his putting both together in the <I>eating</I> of 
 <I>his flesh</I> and <I>drinking</I> of his <I>blood,</I> and with the 
 remarks made upon it by the hearers, the rest of this conference may be 
 reduced.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ having spoken of <I>himself</I> as the great <I>gift of 
 God,</I> and the <I>true bread</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 largely <I>explains</I> and <I>confirms</I> this, that we may rightly 
 know him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He here shows that he is the <I>true bread;</I> this he repeats
 again and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:33,35,48-51"><I>v.</I> 33, 35, 48-51</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 [1.] That Christ is <I>bread</I> is that to the soul which bread is to 
 the body, nourishes and supports the spiritual life (is the staff of 
 it) as bread does the bodily life; <I>it is the staff of life.</I> The 
 doctrines of the gospel concerning Christ--that he is the mediator 
 between God and man, that he is our peace, our righteousness, our 
 Redeemer; <I>by these things do men live.</I> Our bodies could better 
 live without food than our souls without Christ. <I>Bread-corn</I> is 
 <I>bruised</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:28">Isa. xxviii. 28</A>),

 so was Christ; he was born at Bethlehem, the <I>house of bread,</I> and 
 typified by the <I>show-bread.</I> 

 [2.] That he is the <I>bread of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 divine bread; it is he that is <I>of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>),

 bread which my Father gives 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 which he has made to be the food of our souls; the bread of God's 
 family, his <I>children's bread.</I> The Levitical sacrifices are 
 called the <I>bread of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:21,22">Lev. xxi. 21, 22</A>),

 and Christ is the great sacrifice; Christ, in his word and ordinances, 
 the <I>feast</I> upon the sacrifice. 

 [3.] That he is the <I>bread of life</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:35,48"><I>v.</I> 35, and again, <I>v.</I> 48</A>),

 <I>that</I> bread of life, alluding to the tree of life in the midst of 
 the garden of Eden, which was to Adam the seal of that part of the 
 covenant, <I>Do this and live,</I> of which he might <I>eat and 
 live.</I> Christ is the bread of life, for he is the fruit of the 
 <I>tree of life. First,</I> He is the <I>living bread</I> (so he
 explains himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>):

 <I>I am the living bread.</I> Bread is itself a dead thing, and 
 nourishes not but by the help of the faculties of a living body; but 
 Christ is himself <I>living bread,</I> and nourishes by his own power. 
 Manna was a dead thing; if kept but one night, it putrefied and bred 
 worms; but Christ is ever living, everlasting bread, that never moulds, 
 nor waxes old. The doctrine of Christ crucified is now as strengthening 
 and comforting to a believer as ever it was, and his mediation still of 
 as much value and efficacy as ever. <I>Secondly, He gives life unto the 
 world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 spiritual and eternal life; the life of the soul in union and communion 
 with God here, and in the vision and fruition of him hereafter; a life 
 that includes in it all happiness. The <I>manna</I> did only reserve 
 and support life, did not preserve and perpetuate life, much less 
 restore it; but Christ <I>gives</I> life to those that were dead in 
 sin. The manna was ordained only for the life of the Israelites, but 
 Christ is given for the <I>life of the world;</I> none are excluded 
 from the benefit of this bread, but such as exclude themselves. Christ 
 came to <I>put life</I> into the minds of men, principles productive of 
 acceptable performances. 

 [4.] That he is the <I>bread which came down from heaven;</I> this is 
 often repeated here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:33,50,51,58"><I>v.</I> 33, 50, 51, 58</A>.

 This denotes, <I>First,</I> The divinity of Christ's person. As God, he 
 had a being in heaven, whence he came to take our nature upon him: <I>I 
 came down from heaven,</I> whence we may infer his <I>antiquity,</I> he 
 was in the beginning with God; his <I>ability,</I> for heaven is the 
 firmament of power; and his <I>authority,</I> he came with a divine 
 commission. <I>Secondly,</I> The divine original of all that good which 
 flows to us through him. He <I>comes,</I> not only 
 <B><I>katabas</I></B>--<I>that came down</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 but <B><I>katabainoi</I></B>--<I>that comes down;</I> he is descending, 
 denoting a constant communication of light, life, and love, from God to 
 believers through Christ, as the <I>manna</I> descended daily; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:3">Eph. i. 3</A>.
 
 <I>Omnia desuper--All things from above.</I>

 [5.] That he is <I>that bread</I> of which the <I>manna</I> was a type
 and figure

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>),

 <I>that</I> bread, the true bread, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 As the rock that they drank of was Christ, so was the manna they ate of 
 <I>spiritual bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:3,4">1 Cor. x. 3, 4</A>.

 <I>Manna</I> was given to Israel; so Christ to the spiritual Israel. 
 There was <I>manna</I> enough for them all; so in Christ a fulness of 
 grace for all believers; he that <I>gathers much</I> of this 
 <I>manna</I> will have none to spare when he comes to use it; and he 
 that gathers little, when his grace comes to be perfected in glory, 
 shall find that <I>he has no lack. Manna</I> was to be gathered in the 
 morning; and those that would find Christ must <I>seek him early.</I> 
 Manna was sweet, and, as the author of the <I>Wisdom of Solomon</I> 
 tells us

 (<U>Wisd. xvi. 20</U>),

 was agreeable to every palate; and to those that believe Christ is 
 <I>precious.</I> Israel lived upon <I>manna</I> till they came to 
 Canaan; and Christ is our life. There was a memorial of the 
 <I>manna</I> preserved in the ark; so of Christ in the Lord's supper, 
 as the food of souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He here shows what his undertaking was, and what his errand into 
 the world. Laying aside the metaphor, he speaks plainly, and speaks no 
 proverb, giving us an account of his business among men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:38-40"><I>v.</I> 38-40</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He assures us, in general, that he came from heaven upon his 
 Father's business 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 not <I>do his own will, but the will of him that sent him.</I> He 
 <I>came from heaven,</I> which bespeaks him an intelligent active 
 being, who voluntarily descended to this lower world, a long journey, 
 and a great step downward, considering the glories of the world he came 
 from and the calamities of the world he came to; we may well ask with 
 wonder, "What moved him to such an expedition?" Here he tells that he 
 came to do, not <I>his own will,</I> but the will of his Father; not 
 that he had any will that stood in competition with the will of his 
 Father, but those to whom he spoke suspected he might. "No," saith he, 
 "my own will is not the spring I act from, nor the rule I go by, but I 
 am come to <I>do the will of him that sent me.</I>" That is, 
 <I>First,</I> Christ did not come into the world as a <I>private</I> 
 person, that acts for himself only, but under a <I>public 
 character,</I> to act for others as an ambassador, or plenipotentiary, 
 authorized by a public commission; he came into the world as God's 
 great agent and the world's great physician. It was not any private 
 business that brought him hither, but he came to settle affairs between 
 parties no less considerable than the great Creator and the whole 
 creation. <I>Secondly,</I> Christ, when he was in the world, did not 
 carry on any <I>private</I> design, nor had any <I>separate 
 interest</I> at all, distinct from theirs for whom he acted. The scope 
 of his whole life was to glorify God and do good to men. He therefore 
 never consulted his own ease, safety, or quiet; but, when he was to lay 
 down his life, though he had a human nature which startled at it, he 
 set aside the consideration of that, and resolved his will as man into 
 the will of God: <I>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He acquaints us, in particular, with that will of the Father which 
 he came to do; he here <I>declares the decree,</I> the instructions he 
 was to pursue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The <I>private instructions</I> given to Christ, that he 
 should be sure to save all the chosen remnant; and this is the 
 <I>covenant of redemption</I> between the Father and the Son 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):
 
 "<I>This is the Father's will, who hath sent me;</I> this is the charge 
 I am entrusted with, that <I>of all whom he hath given me I should lose 
 none.</I>" Note, 

 1. There is a certain number of the children of men <I>given</I> by the
 Father to Jesus Christ, to be his care, and so to be to him for a name 
 and a praise; given him for <I>an inheritance,</I> for a possession. 
 Let him do all that for them which their case requires; teach them, and 
 heal them, pay their debt, and plead their cause, prepare them for, and 
 preserve them to, eternal life, and then let him make his best of them. 
 The Father might dispose of them as he pleased: as creatures, their 
 lives and beings were <I>derived from</I> him; as sinners, their lives 
 and beings were <I>forfeited to him.</I> He might have sold them for 
 the satisfaction of his justice, and delivered them <I>to the 
 tormentors;</I> but he pitched upon them to be the monuments of his 
 mercy, and delivered them to the Saviour. Those whom God chose to be 
 the objects of his special love he lodged as a trust in the hands of 
 Christ. 

 2. Jesus Christ has undertaken that he will <I>lose none</I> of those
 that were thus <I>given him</I> of the Father. The <I>many sons</I> 
 whom he was to <I>bring to glory</I> shall all be forth-coming, and 
 none of them missing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:14">Matt. xviii. 14</A>.

 None of them shall be lost, for want of a sufficient grace to sanctify
 them. <I>If I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then 
 let me bear the blame for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+43:9">Gen. xliii. 9</A>.

 3. Christ's undertaking for those that are given him extends to the
 resurrection of their bodies. <I>I will raise it up again at the last 
 day,</I> which supposes all that goes before, but this is to crown and 
 complete the undertaking. The body is a part of the man, and therefore 
 a part of Christ's purchase and charge; it pertains to the promises, 
 and therefore it shall not be <I>lost.</I> The undertaking is not only 
 that he shall <I>lose none,</I> no <I>person,</I> but that he shall 
 <I>lose nothing,</I> no part of the person, and therefore not the body. 
 Christ's undertaking will never be accomplished till the resurrection, 
 when the souls and bodies of the saints shall be re-united and gathered 
 to Christ, that he may present them to the Father: <I>Behold I, and the 
 children that thou has given me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:13,2Ti+1:12">Heb. ii. 13; 2 Tim. i. 12</A>.

 4. The spring and original of all this is the <I>sovereign will of
 God,</I> the counsels of his will, according to which he works all 
 this. This was the commandment he gave to his Son, when he sent him 
 into the world, and to which the Son always had an eye.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The <I>public instructions</I> which were to be given 
 to the children of men, in what way, and upon what terms, they might 
 obtain salvation by Christ; and this is the <I>covenant of grace</I> 
 between God and man. Who the particular persons were that were given to 
 Christ is a <I>secret: The Lord knows them that are his,</I> we do not, 
 nor is it fit we should; but, though their names are concealed, their 
 characters are published. An offer is made of life and happiness upon 
 gospel terms, that by it those that were given to Christ might be 
 brought to him, and others left inexcusable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 "<I>This is the will,</I> the revealed will, <I>of him that sent 
 me,</I> the method agreed upon, upon which to proceed with the children 
 of men, that <I>every one,</I> Jew or Gentile, that <I>sees the Son, 
 and believes on him,</I> may have <I>everlasting life,</I> and <I>I 
 will raise him up.</I>" This is <I>gospel</I> indeed, good news. Is it 
 now reviving to hear this? 

 1. That <I>eternal life</I> may be had, if it be not our own fault;
 that whereas, upon the sin of the first Adam, the <I>way of the tree of 
 life</I> was blocked up, by the grace of the second Adam it is laid 
 upon again. The crown of glory is set before us as the prize of our 
 high calling, which we may run for and obtain. 

 2. Every one may have it. This gospel is to be preached, this offer
 made, to all, and none can say, "It belongs not to me,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:17">Rev. xxii. 17</A>.

 3. This everlasting life is sure to all those who believe in Christ, 
 and to them only. He that <I>sees the Son,</I> and <I>believes on 
 him,</I> shall be saved. Some understand this <I>seeing</I> as a
 <I>limitation</I> of this condition of salvation to those only that 
 have the revelation of Christ and his grace made to them. Every one 
 that has the opportunity of being acquainted with Christ, and improves 
 this so well as to <I>believe</I> in him, shall have everlasting life, 
 so that none shall be condemned for unbelief (however they maybe for 
 other sins) but those who have had the gospel preached to them, who,
 like these Jews here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 have <I>seen,</I> and yet have <I>not</I> believed; have known Christ, 
 and yet not trusted in him. But I rather understand <I>seeing</I> here 
 to mean the same thing with <I>believing,</I> for it is 
 <B><I>theoron</I></B>, which signifies not so much the sight of the eye 
 (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>,

 <B><I>heorakate me</I></B>--<I>ye have seen me</I>) as the 
 <I>contemplation of the mind.</I> Every one that <I>sees the Son,</I> 
 that is, <I>believes on him,</I> sees him with an eye of faith, by 
 which we come to be duly acquainted and affected with the doctrine of 
 the gospel concerning him. It is to look upon him, as the stung
 Israelites upon the brazen serpent. It is not a <I>blind</I> faith that 
 Christ requires, that we should be willing to have our <I>eyes put 
 out,</I> and then follow him, but that we should <I>see him,</I> and 
 see what ground we go upon in our faith. It is <I>then</I> right when 
 it is not taken up upon <I>hearsay</I> (believing as the church 
 believes), but is the result of a due consideration of, and insight 
 into, the motives of credibility: <I>Now mine eye sees thee. We have 
 heard him ourselves.</I> 

 4. Those who believe in Jesus Christ, in order to their having
 everlasting life, shall be raised up by his power at the last day. He 
 had it in charge as his Father's will

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 and here he solemnly makes it his own undertaking: I <I>will raise him 
 up,</I> which signifies not only the return of the body to life, but 
 the putting of the <I>whole man</I> into a full possession of the 
 eternal life promised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Now Christ discoursing thus concerning himself, as the <I>bread of 
 life</I> that came down from heaven, let us see what remarks his 
 hearers made upon it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) When they heard of such a thing as the <I>bread of God,</I> which 
 <I>gives life,</I> they heartily prayed for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>Lord, evermore give us this bread.</I> I cannot think that this is 
 spoken scoffingly, and in a way of derision, as most interpreters 
 understand it: "Give us such bread as this, if thou canst; let us be 
 fed with it, not for one meal, as with the five loaves, but 
 <I>evermore;</I>" as if this were no better a prayer than that of the 
 impenitent thief: <I>If thou be the Christ, save thyself and us.</I> 
 But I take this request to be made, though ignorantly, yet honestly, 
 and to be well meant; for they call him <I>Lord,</I> and desire a share 
 in what he <I>gives,</I> whatever he means by it. General and confused 
 notions of divine things produce in carnal hearts some kind of desires 
 towards them, and wishes of them; like Balaam's wish, to die the 
 <I>death of the righteous.</I> Those who have an indistinct knowledge 
 of the things of God, who see men as trees walking, make, as I may call 
 them, <I>inarticulate</I> prayers for spiritual blessings. They think 
 the favour of God a <I>good thing,</I> and heaven a <I>fine place,</I> 
 and cannot but wish them their own, while they have no value nor desire 
 at all for that holiness which is necessary both to the one and to the 
 other. Let this be the desire of our souls; have we tasted that the 
 Lord is gracious, been feasted with the word of God, and Christ in the 
 word? Let us say, "<I>Lord, evermore give us this bread;</I> let the 
 bread of life be our daily bread, the heavenly manna our continual 
 feast, and let us never know the want of it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) But, when they understood that by this <I>bread of life</I> Jesus 
 meant <I>himself,</I> then they <I>despised</I> it. Whether they were 
 the same persons that had prayed for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 or some others of the company, does not appear; it seems to be some 
 others, for they are called <I>Jews.</I> Now it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),
 
 <I>They murmured at him.</I> This comes in immediately after that 
 solemn declaration which Christ had made of God's will and his own 
 undertaking concerning man's salvation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:39,40"><I>v.</I> 39, 40</A>),

 which certainly were some of the most weighty and gracious words that 
 ever proceeded out of the mouth of our Lord Jesus, the most faithful, 
 and best worthy of all acceptation. One would think that, like Israel 
 in Egypt, when they heard that God had thus <I>visited</I> them, they 
 should have <I>bowed their heads and worshipped;</I> but on the 
 contrary, instead of closing with the offer made them, they 
 <I>murmured,</I> quarrelled with what Christ said, and, though they did 
 not openly oppose and contradict it, yet they privately whispered among 
 themselves in contempt of it, and instilled into one another's minds 
 prejudices against it. Many that will not professedly contradict the 
 doctrine of Christ (their cavils are so weak and groundless that they 
 are either ashamed to own them or afraid to have them silenced), yet 
 say in their hearts that they <I>do not like it.</I> Now, 

 [1.] That which offended them was Christ's asserting his origin to be 
 <I>from heaven,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:41,42"><I>v.</I> 41, 42</A>.

 How is it that he saith, <I>I came down from heaven?</I> They had heard 
 of angels coming down <I>from heaven,</I> but never of a man, 
 overlooking the proofs he had given them of his being more than a man.
 
 [2.] That which they thought justified them herein was that they knew 
 his extraction on earth: <I>Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose 
 father and mother we know?</I> They took it amiss that he should say 
 that he came down from heaven, when he was <I>one of them.</I> They 
 speak slightly of his blessed name, <I>Jesus: Is not this Jesus.</I> 
 They take it for granted that Joseph was really his father, though he 
 was only <I>reputed</I> to be so. Note, Mistakes concerning the person 
 of Christ, as if he were a mere man, conceived and born by ordinary 
 generation, occasion the offence that is taken at his doctrine and 
 offices. Those who set him on a level with the other sons of men, whose 
 father and mother we know, no wonder if they derogate from the honour 
 of his satisfaction and the mysteries of his undertaking, and, like the 
 Jews here, murmur at his promise to <I>raise us up at the last 
 day.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ, having spoken of faith as the great <I>work of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 discourses largely concerning this work, instructing and encouraging us 
 in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He shows what it is to <I>believe in Christ.</I> 

 [1.] To believe in Christ is to <I>come to Christ.</I> He that <I>comes 
 to</I> me is the same with him that <I>believes in me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>He that comes unto me;</I> so 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:44,45"><I>v.</I> 44, 45</A>.

 Repentance towards God is <I>coming to him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:22">Jer. iii. 22</A>)

 as our chief good and highest end; and so faith towards our Lord Jesus 
 Christ is coming to him as our prince and Saviour, and our way to the 
 Father. It denotes the out-goings of our affection towards him, for 
 these are the motions of the soul, and actions agreeable; it is to 
 <I>come off</I> from all those things that stand in opposition to him 
 or competition with him, and to <I>come up</I> to those terms upon 
 which life and salvation are offered to us through him. When he was 
 here on earth it was more that barely coming where he was; so it is now 
 more than coming to his word and ordinances.

 [2.] It is to <I>feed upon Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>):

 <I>If any man eat of this bread.</I> The former denotes applying 
 ourselves to Christ; this denotes applying Christ to ourselves, with 
 appetite and delight, that we may receive life, and strength, and 
 comfort from him. To feed on him as the Israelites on the manna,
 having quitted the <I>fleshpots</I> of Egypt, and not depending on the 
 <I>labour of their hands</I> (to eat of that), but living purely on the 
 bread given them from heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He shows what is to be got by believing in Christ. What will he 
 give us if we <I>come to him?</I> What shall we be the better of we 
 <I>feed upon him? Want</I> and <I>death</I> are the chief things we 
 dread; may we but be assured of the comforts of our being, and the 
 continuance of it in the midst of these comforts, we have enough; now 
 these two are here secured to true believers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They shall never want, <I>never hunger, never thirst,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.
 
 Desires they have, earnest desires, but these so suitably, so 
 seasonably, so abundantly satisfied, that they cannot be called hunger 
 and thirst, which are uneasy and painful. Those that did eat manna, and 
 drink of the rock, hungered and thirsted afterwards. Manna surfeited 
 them; water out of the rock failed them. But there is such an 
 <I>over-flowing fulness</I> in Christ as can never be <I>exhausted,</I> 
 and there are such <I>ever-flowing communications</I> from him as can 
 never be interrupted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] They shall <I>never die,</I> not die eternally; for, <I>First,</I> 
 He that believes on Christ <I>has everlasting life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>);

 he has the assurance of it, the grant of it, the earnest of it; he has 
 it in the promise and first-fruits. Union with Christ and communion 
 with God in Christ are <I>everlasting life</I> begun. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 Whereas they that did <I>eat manna</I> died, Christ is such bread as a 
 man may eat of and never die, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:49,50"><I>v.</I> 49, 50</A>.
 
 Observe here, 

 1. The insufficiency of the typical manna: <I>Your fathers did eat 
 manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</I> There may be much good use 
 made of the death of our fathers; their graves speak to us, and their 
 monuments are our memorials, particularly of this, that the greatest 
 <I>plenty</I> of the most <I>dainty</I> food will neither prolong the 
 thread of life nor avert the stroke of death. Those that did eat manna, 
 angel's food, died like other men. There could be nothing amiss in 
 their diet, to shorten their days, nor could their deaths be hastened 
 by the toils and fatigues of life (for they neither sowed nor reaped), 
 and <I>yet they died.</I>

 (1.) Many of them died by the immediate strokes of God's vengeance for 
 their unbelief and murmurings; for, <I>though they did eat that 
 spiritual meat,</I> yet with many of them God <I>was not well-pleased, 
 but they were overthrown in the wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:3-5">1 Cor. x. 3-5</A>.

 Their eating manna was no security to <I>them</I> from the <I>wrath of
 God,</I> as believing in Christ is to <I>us.</I>

 (2.) The rest of them died in a course of nature, and their carcases 
 fell, under a divine sentence, in that wilderness where they did <I>eat 
 manna.</I> In that very age when miracles were <I>daily bread</I> was 
 the life of man reduced to the stint it now stands at, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:10">Ps. xc. 10</A>.

 Let them not then boast so much of <I>manna.</I> 

 2. The all-sufficiency of the true <I>manna,</I> of which the other
 was a type: <I>This is the bread that cometh down from heaven,</I> that 
 truly divine and heavenly food, <I>that a man may eat thereof and not 
 die;</I> that is, not fall under the wrath of God, which is killing to 
 the soul; <I>not die</I> the second death; no, nor the first death 
 finally and irrecoverably. <I>Not die,</I> that is, not perish, not
 come short of the heavenly Canaan, as the Israelites did of the 
 earthly, for want of <I>faith,</I> though they had <I>manna.</I> This 
 is further explained by that promise in the next words: <I>If any man 
 eat of this bread, he shall live for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>.

 This is the meaning of this <I>never dying:</I> though he go down <I>to 
 death,</I> he shall pass through it to that world where there shall be 
 <I>no more death.</I> To <I>live for ever</I> is not to <I>be</I> for 
 ever (the damned in hell shall <I>be</I> for ever, the soul of man was 
 made for an endless state), but to be <I>happy</I> for ever. And 
 because the body must needs die, and be as water spilt upon the ground, 
 Christ here undertakes for the gathering of that up too (as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>,

 <I>I will raise him up at the last day</I>); and even that shall live 
 for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He shows what encouragements we have to believe in Christ. Christ 
 here speaks of some who <I>had seen him and yet believed not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 They saw his person and miracles, and heard him preach, and yet were 
 not wrought upon to believe in him. Faith is not always the effect of 
 sight; the soldiers were eye-witnesses of his resurrection, and yet, 
 instead of <I>believing</I> in him, they <I>belied</I> him; so that it 
 is a difficult thing to bring people to believe in Christ: and, by the 
 operation of the Spirit of grace, those that <I>have not seen have yet 
 believed.</I> Two things we are here assured of, to encourage our 
 faith:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That the Son will bid all those welcome that come to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):
 
 <I>Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</I> How welcome 
 should this word be to our souls which bids us welcome to Christ! 
 <I>Him</I> that cometh; it is in the singular number, denoting favour, 
 not only to the body of believers in general, but to every particular 
 soul that applies itself to Christ. Here, <I>First,</I> The duty 
 required is a pure gospel duty: to <I>come to Christ,</I> that we may 
 come to God by him. His beauty and love, those great attractives, must 
 <I>draw</I> us to him; sense of need and fear of danger must 
 <I>drive</I> us to him; any thing to bring us to Christ. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> The promise is a pure gospel promise: <I>I will in no 
 wise cast out</I>--<B><I>ou me ekbago exo</I></B>. There are two
 negatives: <I>I will not, no, I will not.</I> 

 1. Much favour is expressed here. We have reason to fear that he should
 <I>cast us out.</I> Considering our meanness, our vileness, our 
 unworthiness to come, our weakness in coming, we may justly expect that 
 he should frown upon us, and shut his doors against us; but he obviates 
 these fears with this assurance, he <I>will not</I> do it; will not 
 disdain us though we are mean, will not reject us though we are sinful. 
 Do poor scholars come to him to be taught? Though they be dull and 
 slow, he will not <I>cast them out.</I> Do poor <I>patients</I> come to 
 him to be <I>cured,</I> poor <I>clients</I> come to him to be 
 <I>advised?</I> Though their case be bad, and though they come 
 empty-handed, he will <I>in no wise cast them out.</I> But, 

 2. More favour is implied than is expressed; when it is said that he
 will no cast them out the meaning is, He will receive them, and 
 entertain them, and give them all that which they come to him for. As 
 he will not refuse them at their first coming, so he will not 
 afterwards, upon every displeasure, cast them out. <I>His gifts and 
 callings are without repentance.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That the Father will, without fail, bring all those to him in due 
 time that were given him. In the federal transactions between the 
 Father and the Son, relating to man's redemption, as the Son undertook 
 for the justification, sanctification, and salvation, of all that 
 should come to him ("Let me have them put into my hands, and then leave 
 the management of them to me"), so the Father, the fountain and
 original of being, life, and grace, undertook to put into his hand all 
 that were given him, and bring them to him. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He here <I>assures</I> us <I>that</I> this shall be done: 
 <I>All that the Father giveth me shall come to me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Christ had complained

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>)

 of those who, though they had <I>seen</I> him, yet would not believe on 
 him; and then he adds this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> For <I>their</I> conviction and awakening, plainly intimating 
 that their not coming to him, and believing on him, if they persisted 
 in it, would be a certain sign that they did not belong to the election 
 of grace; for how can we think that God gave us to Christ if we give 
 ourselves to the world and the flesh? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:10">2 Pet. i. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> For <I>his own</I> comfort and encouragement: <I>Though 
 Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious.</I> The election 
 <I>has obtained,</I> and shall though multitudes be <I>blinded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:7">Rom. xi. 7</A>.

 Though he lose many of his <I>creatures,</I> yet none of his <I>charge:
 All that the Father gives him shall come to him</I> notwithstanding. 
 Here we have,

 (<I>a.</I>) The election described: <I>All that the father giveth 
 me,</I> <B><I>pan ho didosi</I></B>--<I>every thing</I> which the 
 Father <I>giveth to me;</I> the persons of the elect, and all that 
 belongs to them; all their services, all their interests. As all that 
 he has is <I>theirs,</I> so all that they have is <I>his,</I> and he 
 speaks of them as his all: they were given him in full recompense of 
 his undertaking. Not only all persons, but all things, are gathered 
 together in Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:10">Eph. i. 10</A>)
 
 and reconciled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:20">Col. i. 20</A>.

 The giving of the chosen remnant to Christ is spoken of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>)

 as a thing <I>done;</I> he <I>hath given</I> them. Here it is spoken
 of as a thing <I>in the doing;</I> he <I>giveth them;</I> because, 
 <I>when the first begotten was brought into the world,</I> it should 
 seem, there was a renewal of the grant; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:5">Heb. x. 5</A>,

 &c. God was now about to <I>give him the heathen for his
 inheritance</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8">Ps. ii. 8</A>),

 to put him in possession of <I>the desolate heritages</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:8">Isa. xlix. 8</A>),
 
 to <I>divide him a portion with the great,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=isa+53:12">Isa. liii. 12</A>.

 And though the Jews, who <I>saw</I> him, <I>believed not</I> on him, 
 yet these (saith he) shall <I>come to me;</I> the other sheep, which 
 are not of this fold, shall be <I>brought,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:15,16"><I>ch.</I> x. 15, 16</A>.

 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:45-48">Acts xiii. 45-48</A>.

 (<I>b.</I>) The effect of it secured: <I>They shall come to me.</I>
 This is not in the nature of a <I>promise,</I> but a <I>prediction,</I> 
 that as many as were in the counsel of God ordained to life shall be 
 brought to life by being brought to Christ. They are <I>scattered,</I> 
 are mingled among the nations, yet none of them shall be forgotten; not 
 a grain of God's corn shall be lost, as is promised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:9">Amos ix. 9</A>.

 They are by nature <I>alienated</I> from Christ, and averse to him, and
 yet <I>they shall come.</I> As God's omniscience is engaged for the 
 finding of them all out, so is his omnipotence for the bringing of them 
 all in. Not, They shall be <I>driven,</I> to me, but, They shall come
 freely, shall be made <I>willing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He here <I>acquaints</I> us <I>how</I> it shall be
 done. How shall those who are given to Christ be brought to him? Two 
 things are to be done in order to it:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> Their <I>understandings</I> shall be <I>enlightened;</I> this 
 is promised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:45,46"><I>v.</I> 45, 46</A>.

 It is written in the prophets, who spoke of these things before, <I>And
 they shall be all taught of God;</I> this we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:13,Jer+31:34">Isa. liv. 13, and Jer. xxxi. 34</A>.
 
 <I>They shall all know me.</I> Note,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) In order to our <I>believing in Jesus Christ,</I> it is 
 necessary that we be <I>taught of God;</I> that is, 

 [<I>a.</I>] That there be a <I>divine revelation made to us,</I> 
 discovering to us both what we are to believe concerning Christ and why 
 we are to believe it. There are some things which <I>even nature
 teaches,</I> but to bring us to Christ there is need of a higher light. 
 
 [<I>b.</I>] That there be a <I>divine work wrought in us,</I> enabling 
 us to understand and receive these revealed truths and the evidence of 
 them. God, in giving us reason, teaches us more than the <I>beasts of 
 the earth;</I> but in giving us faith he teaches more than the 
 <I>natural man.</I> Thus all the church's children, all that are 
 <I>genuine,</I> are <I>taught of God;</I> he hath undertaken their 
 education.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) It follows then, by way of inference from this, that 
 <I>every man</I> that has <I>heard and learned of the Father comes to 
 Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 [<I>a.</I>] It is here implied that none will come to Christ but those 
 that have <I>heard</I> and <I>learned of the Father.</I> We shall never 
 be brought to Christ but under a divine conduct; except God by his 
 grace enlighten our minds, inform our judgments, and rectify our 
 mistakes, and not only <I>tell</I> us that we may <I>hear,</I> but 
 teach us, that we may <I>learn</I> the truth as it is in Jesus, we 
 shall never be brought to believe in Christ.

 [<I>b.</I>] That this <I>divine teaching</I> does so necessarily 
 produce the <I>faith of God's elect</I> that we may conclude that those 
 who do not <I>come to Christ</I> have never <I>heard</I> nor 
 <I>learned</I> of the Father; for, if they had, doubtless they would 
 have come to Christ. In vain do men pretend to be <I>taught of God</I> 
 if they believe not in Christ, for he teaches no other lesson, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:8,9">Gal. i. 8, 9</A>.

 See how God deals with men as reasonable creatures, draws them with the
 <I>cords of a man,</I> opens the understanding first, and then by that, 
 in a regular way, influences the inferior faculties; thus he comes in 
 by the door, but Satan, as a robber, climbs up another way. But lest
 any should dream of a visible appearance of God the Father to the 
 children of men (to teach them these things), and entertain any gross 
 conceptions about hearing and learning of the Father, he adds

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>):

 <I>Not that any man hath seen the Father;</I> it is implied, nor 
 <I>can</I> see him, with bodily eyes, or may expect to learn of him as 
 Moses did, to whom he spoke <I>face to face;</I> but God, in 
 enlightening men's eyes and teaching them, works in a spiritual way.
 The Father of spirits hath access to, and influence upon, men's 
 spirits, undiscerned. The Father of spirits hath access to, and 
 influence upon, men's spirits, undiscerned. Those that have not seen 
 his face have felt his power. And yet there is one intimately 
 acquainted with the Father, he <I>who is of God,</I> Christ himself, he 
 hath <I>seen the Father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18"><I>ch.</I> i. 18</A>.

 Note, <I>First,</I> Jesus Christ is of God in a peculiar manner, God of
 God, light of light; not only sent of God, but begotten of God before 
 all worlds. <I>Secondly,</I> It is the prerogative of Christ to have 
 <I>seen the Father,</I> perfectly to know him and his counsels. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> Even that illumination which is preparative to faith is 
 conveyed to us through Christ. Those that <I>learn of the Father,</I> 
 forasmuch as they cannot see him themselves, must learn of Christ, who 
 alone hath seen him. As all divine discoveries are made through Christ, 
 so through him all divine powers are exerted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> Their <I>wills</I> shall be <I>bowed.</I> If the soul of man 
 had now its original rectitude there needed no more to influence the 
 will than the illumination of the understanding; but in the depraved 
 soul of fallen man there is a rebellion of the will against the right 
 dictates of the understanding; a <I>carnal mind,</I> which is 
 <I>enmity</I> itself to the divine light and law. It is therefore 
 requisite that there be a work of grace wrought upon the will, which is 
 here called <I>drawing,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):

 <I>No man can come to me except the Father, who hath sent me, draw 
 him.</I> The Jews murmured at the doctrine of Christ; not only would 
 not receive it themselves, but were angry that others did. Christ 
 overheard their secret whisperings, and said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>),

 "<I>Murmur not among yourselves;</I> lay not the fault of your dislike 
 of my doctrine one upon another, as if it were because you find it 
 generally distasted; no, it is owing to yourselves, and your own 
 corrupt dispositions, which are such as amount to a <I>moral 
 impotency;</I> your antipathies to the truths of God, and prejudices 
 against them, are so strong that nothing less than a divine power can 
 conquer them." And this is the case of all mankind: "<I>No man can come 
 to me,</I> can persuade himself to come up to the terms of the gospel, 
 <I>except the Father, who hath sent me, draw him,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.
 
 Observe,
 
 (<I>a.</I>) The nature of the work: It is <I>drawing,</I> which denotes 
 not a <I>force</I> put upon the will, whereby of unwilling we are made 
 willing, and a new bias is given to the soul, by which it inclines to 
 God. This seems to be more than a <I>moral suasion,</I> for by that it 
 is in the power to <I>draw;</I> yet it is not to be called a 
 <I>physical impulse,</I> for it lies out of the road of <I>nature;</I> 
 but he that <I>formed the spirit of man within him</I> by his creating 
 power, and <I>fashions the hearts of men</I> by his providential 
 influence, knows how to new-mould the soul, and to alter its bent and 
 temper, and make it conformable to himself and his own will, without 
 doing any wrong to its natural liberty. It is such a drawing as works 
 not only a <I>compliance,</I> but a cheerful compliance, a complacency: 
 <I>Draw us, and we will run after thee.</I> 

 (<I>b.</I>) The necessity of it: <I>No man,</I> in this weak and 
 helpless state, can come to Christ without it. As we <I>cannot</I> do 
 any natural action without the concurrence of <I>common providence,</I> 
 so we cannot do any action morally good without the influence of 
 <I>special grace,</I> in which the <I>new man</I> lives, and moves, and 
 has its being, as much as the <I>mere man</I> has in the divine 
 providence. 

 (<I>c.</I>) The author of it: The <I>Father who hath sent me.</I> The 
 Father, having sent Christ, will succeed him, for he would not send him 
 on a fruitless errand. Christ having undertaken to bring souls to
 glory, God promised him, in order thereunto, to bring them to him, and 
 so to give him possession of those to whom he had given him a right. 
 God, having by promise given the kingdom of Israel to David, did at 
 length <I>draw the hearts</I> of the people to him; so, having sent 
 Christ to save souls, he sends souls to him to be saved by him.
 
 (<I>d.</I>) The crown and perfection of this work: And <I>I will raise 
 him up at the last day.</I> This is four times mentioned in this 
 discourse, and doubtless it includes all the intermediate and 
 preparatory workings of divine grace. When he <I>raises them up at the 
 last day,</I> he will put the <I>last hand</I> to his undertaking, will 
 <I>bring forth the topstone.</I> If he undertakes this, surely he 
 <I>can</I> do any thing, and will do every thing that is necessary in 
 order to do it. Let our expectations be carried out towards a happiness 
 reserved for the <I>last day,</I> when all the years of time shall be 
 fully complete and ended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Christ, having thus spoken of himself as the <I>bread of life,</I> 
 and of faith as <I>the work of God,</I> comes more particularly to show 
 <I>what of himself</I> is this bread, namely, his flesh, and that to 
 believe is to eat of that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:51-58"><I>v.</I> 51-58</A>,

 where he still prosecutes the metaphor of food. Observe, here, the 
 <I>preparation</I> of this food: <I>The bread that I will give is my 
 flesh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 <I>the flesh of the Son of man and his blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>.

 <I>His flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>.

 Observe, also, the <I>participation</I> of this food: We must <I>eat
 the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>);
 
 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>),
 
 <I>Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood;</I> and the same words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:56,57"><I>v.</I> 56, 57</A>),

 he that <I>eateth me.</I> This is certainly a parable or figurative 
 discourse, wherein the actings of the soul upon things spiritual and 
 divine are represented by bodily actions about things sensible, which 
 made the truths of Christ more intelligible to some, and less so to 
 others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:11-12">Mark iv. 11-12</A>.
 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Let us see how this discourse of Christ was liable to mistake and 
 misconstruction, that <I>men might see, and not perceive.</I> 

 [1.] It was misconstrued by the carnal <I>Jews,</I> to whom it was 
 first delivered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>):

 <I>They strove among themselves;</I> they whispered in each other's 
 ears their dissatisfaction: <I>How can this man give us his flesh to 
 eat?</I> Christ spoke 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>)

 of giving his flesh <I>for us,</I> to suffer and die; but they, without 
 due consideration, understood it of his giving it <I>to us,</I> to be 
 eaten, which gave occasion to Christ to tell them that, however what he 
 said was otherwise intended, yet even that also of <I>eating of his 
 flesh</I> was no such absurd thing (if rightly understood) as <I>prima 
 facie--in the first instance,</I> they took it to be. 

 [2.] It has been wretchedly misconstrued by the church of Rome for the 
 support of their monstrous doctrine of transubstantiation, which gives 
 the lie to our senses, contradicts the nature of a sacrament, and 
 overthrows all convincing evidence. They, like these Jews here, 
 understand it of a corporal and carnal eating of Christ's body, like 
 Nicodemus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:4:"><I>ch.</I> iii. 4</A>.

 The Lord's supper was not yet instituted, and therefore it could have
 no reference to that; it is a <I>spiritual</I> eating and drinking that 
 is here spoken of, not a <I>sacramental.</I> 

 [3.] It is misunderstood by many ignorant carnal people, who hence 
 infer that, if they take the sacrament when they die, they shall 
 certainly go to heaven, which, as it makes many that are weak 
 causelessly uneasy if they want it, so it makes many that are wicked 
 causelessly easy if they have it. Therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Let us see how this discourse of Christ is to be understood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What is meant by the <I>flesh and blood of Christ.</I> It is 
 called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>),

 <I>The flesh of the Son of man, and his blood, his</I> as Messiah and 
 Mediator: the <I>flesh and blood</I> which he <I>assumed</I> in his 
 incarnation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14">Heb. ii. 14</A>),

 and which he <I>gave up</I> in his <I>death</I> and <I>suffering: my 
 flesh which I will give</I> to be crucified and slain. It is said to be 
 <I>given for the life of the world,</I> that is, <I>First, Instead</I> 
 of the <I>life of the world,</I> which was <I>forfeited</I> by sin, 
 Christ gives his own flesh as a ransom or counterprice. Christ was our 
 bail, bound <I>body for body</I> (as we say), and therefore <I>his</I> 
 life must go for <I>ours,</I> that ours may be spared. <I>Here am I, 
 let these go their way. Secondly, In order to</I> the <I>life of the 
 world,</I> to purchase a <I>general</I> offer of eternal life to all 
 the world, and the <I>special</I> assurances of it to all believers. So 
 that the <I>flesh and blood</I> of the Son of man denote the Redeemer 
 <I>incarnate</I> and <I>dying;</I> Christ and <I>him crucified,</I> and 
 the redemption wrought out by him, with all the precious benefits of 
 redemption: pardon of sin, acceptance with God, the adoption of sons, 
 access to the throne of grace, the promises of the covenant, and 
 eternal life; these are called <I>the flesh and blood</I> of Christ, 

 1. Because they are purchased by his flesh and blood, by the breaking
 of his body, and shedding of his blood. Well may the purchased 
 privileges be denominated from the price that was paid for them, for it 
 puts a value upon them; write upon them <I>pretium sanguinis--the price 
 of blood.</I> 

 2. Because they are meat and drink to our souls. <I>Flesh with the
 blood</I> was prohibited

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:4">Gen. ix. 4</A>),

 but the privileges of the gospel are as flesh and blood to us, prepared 
 for the nourishment of our souls. He had before compared himself to 
 <I>bread,</I> which is necessary food; here to <I>flesh,</I> which is 
 delicious. It is a <I>feast of fat things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:6">Isa. xxv. 6</A>.

 The soul is satisfied with Christ as <I>with marrow and fatness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:5">Ps. lxiii. 5</A>.

 It is <I>meat indeed,</I> and <I>drink indeed; truly so,</I> that is
 spiritually; so Dr. Whitby; as Christ is called the <I>true vine;</I> 
 or <I>truly meat,</I> in opposition to the shows and shadows with which 
 the world shams off those that feed upon it. In Christ and his gospel 
 there is real supply, solid satisfaction; that is <I>meat indeed,</I> 
 and <I>drink indeed,</I> which satiates and replenishes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:25,26">Jer. xxxi. 25, 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What is meant by <I>eating this flesh</I> and <I>drinking</I> this 
 <I>blood,</I> which is so necessary and beneficial; it is certain that 
 is means neither more nor less than believing in Christ. As we partake 
 of meat and drink by eating and drinking, so we partake of Christ and 
 his benefits by faith: and <I>believing in Christ</I> includes these 
 four things, which <I>eating and drinking</I> do:--<I>First,</I> It
 implies an <I>appetite</I> to Christ. This spiritual eating and 
 drinking begins with <I>hungering</I> and <I>thirsting</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:6">Matt. v. 6</A>),
 
 earnest and importunate desires after Christ, not willing to take up 
 with any thing short of an interest in him: "Give me Christ or else I 
 die." <I>Secondly,</I> An <I>application</I> of Christ to ourselves.
 Meat <I>looked upon</I> will not nourish us, but meat <I>fed upon,</I> 
 and so made <I>our own,</I> and as it were <I>one with us.</I> We must 
 so accept of Christ as to appropriate him to ourselves: <I>my Lord, and 
 my God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:28"><I>ch.</I> xx. 28</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> A <I>delight</I> in Christ and his salvation. The
 doctrine of Christ crucified must be <I>meat and drink</I> to us, most 
 pleasant and delightful. We must feast upon the dainties of the <I>New 
 Testament in the blood of Christ,</I> taking as great a complacency in 
 the methods which Infinite Wisdom has taken to redeem and save us as 
 ever we did in the most needful supplies or grateful delights of 
 nature. <I>Fourthly,</I> A <I>derivation of nourishment</I> from him 
 and a dependence upon him for the support and comfort of our spiritual 
 life, and the strength, growth, and vigour of the new man. To <I>feed 
 upon Christ</I> is to do all <I>in his name,</I> in union with him, and 
 by virtue drawn from him; it is to live upon him as we do upon our 
 meat. How our bodies are nourished by our food we cannot describe, but 
 that they are so we know and find; so it is with this spiritual 
 nourishment. Our Saviour was so well pleased with this metaphor (as 
 very significant and expressive) that, when afterwards he would 
 institute some outward sensible signs, by which to represent our 
 <I>communicating</I> of the benefits of his death, he chose those of 
 <I>eating</I> and <I>drinking,</I> and made them <I>sacramental</I> 
 actions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Having thus explained the general meaning of this part of Christ's 
 discourse, the particulars are reducible to two heads:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The <I>necessity</I> of our <I>feeding upon Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>):
 
 <I>Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you 
 have no life in you.</I> That is, <I>First,</I> "It is a certain sign 
 that you <I>have no</I> spiritual <I>life</I> in you if you have no 
 <I>desire</I> towards Christ, nor <I>delight</I> in him." If the soul 
 does not <I>hunger</I> and <I>thirst,</I> certainly it does not 
 <I>live:</I> it is a sign that we are dead indeed if we are dead to 
 such meat and drink as this. When <I>artificial</I> bees, that by 
 curious springs were made to move to and fro, were to be 
 <I>distinguished</I> from <I>natural</I> ones (they say), it was done 
 by putting honey among them, which the natural bees only flocked to, 
 but the artificial ones minded not, for <I>they had no life in them. 
 Secondly,</I> "It is certain that you <I>can have</I> no spiritual 
 life, unless you derive it from Christ by faith; separated from him you 
 can do nothing." Faith in Christ is the <I>primum vivens--the first
 living principle</I> of grace; without it we have not the <I>truth</I> 
 of <I>spiritual</I> life, nor any title to eternal life: our bodies may 
 as well live without meat as our souls without Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The <I>benefit</I> and <I>advantage</I> of it, in two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> We shall be <I>one with Christ,</I> as our bodies are 
 with our food when it is digested 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>):

 <I>He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood,</I> that lives by faith 
 in Christ crucified (it is spoken of as a continued act), he 
 <I>dwelleth in me, and I in him.</I> By faith we have a close and 
 intimate union with Christ; he is <I>in us,</I> and we <I>in him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21-23,1Jo+3:24"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 21-23; 1 John iii. 24</A>.

 Believers dwell in Christ as their stronghold or city of refuge; Christ
 dwells in them as the master of the house, to rule it and provide for
 it. Such is the union between Christ and believers that he shares in
 their griefs, and they share in his graces and joys; he <I>sups</I>
 with them upon their bitter herbs, and <I>they with him</I> upon his
 <I>rich dainties.</I> It is an inseparable union, like that between the
 body and digested food,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:35,1Jo+4:13">Rom. viii. 35; 1 John iv. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> We shall <I>live,</I> shall live eternally, <I>by 
 him,</I> as our bodies live by our food.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> We shall <I>live by him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>):

 <I>As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father, so he 
 that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</I> We have here the series 
 and order of the divine life. 

 (<I>a.</I>) God is the <I>living Father,</I> hath life in and of 
 himself. <I>I am that I am</I> is his name for ever. 

 (<I>b.</I>) Jesus Christ, as Mediator, lives <I>by the Father;</I> he 
 has life <I>in himself</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:26"><I>ch.</I> v. 26</A>),

 but he has it of the Father. He that sent him, not only qualified him
 with that life which was necessary to so great an undertaking, but 
 constituted him the treasury of divine life to us; he breathed into the 
 second Adam the breath of spiritual lives, as into the first Adam the 
 breath of natural lives. 

 (<I>c.</I>) True believers receive this divine life by virtue of their 
 union with Christ, which is inferred from the union between the Father 
 and the Son, as it is compared to it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 21</A>.

 For therefore <I>he that eateth me,</I> or feeds on me, <I>even he
 shall live by me:</I> those that live <I>upon</I> Christ shall live 
 <I>by</I> him. The life of believers is <I>had from Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16"><I>ch.</I> i. 16</A>);

 it is <I>hid with Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:4">Col. iii. 4</A>),

 we live by <I>him</I> as the members by the head, the branches by the 
 root; because he lives, we shall live also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> We shall live <I>eternally</I> by him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>):

 <I>Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood,</I> as prepared in the 
 gospel to be the food of souls, he <I>hath eternal life,</I> he hath it 
 now, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 He has that in him which is eternal life begun; he has the earnest and 
 foretaste of it, and the hope of it; he shall live <I>for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>.

 His happiness shall run parallel with the longest line of eternity 
 itself.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>60  Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard <I>this,</I>
 said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?
 &nbsp; 61  When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at
 it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?
 &nbsp; 62  <I>What</I> and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he
 was before?
 &nbsp; 63  It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
 nothing: the words that I speak unto you, <I>they</I> are spirit, and
 <I>they</I> are life.
 &nbsp; 64  But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew
 from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who
 should betray him.
 &nbsp; 65  And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come
 unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.
 &nbsp; 66  From that <I>time</I> many of his disciples went back, and walked
 no more with him.
 &nbsp; 67  Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?
 &nbsp; 68  Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go?
 thou hast the words of eternal life.
 &nbsp; 69  And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the
 Son of the living God.
 &nbsp; 70  Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one
 of you is a devil?
 &nbsp; 71  He spake of Judas Iscariot <I>the son</I> of Simon: for he it was
 that should betray him, being one of the twelve.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the effects of Christ's discourse. Some were 
 offended and others edified by it; some driven <I>from him</I> and 
 others brought nearer <I>to him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To some it was a <I>savour of death unto death;</I> not only to the 
 Jews, who were professed enemies to him and his doctrine, but even to 
 many of <I>his disciples,</I> such as were disciples <I>at large,</I> 
 who were his frequent hearers, and followed him <I>in public;</I> a 
 mixed multitude, like those among Israel, that began all the 
 discontents. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their murmurings at the doctrine they heard 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>):

 <I>This is a hard saying, who can hear it?</I> 

 (1.) They do not like it themselves: "What stuff is this? <I>Eat the 
 flesh, and drink the blood, of the Son of man!</I> If it is to be 
 understood figuratively, it is not intelligible; if literally, not 
 practicable. What! must we turn cannibals? Can we not be religious, but 
 we must be barbarous?" <I>Si Christiani adorant quod comedunt</I> (said 
 Averroes), <I>sit anima mea cum philosophis--If Christians adore what 
 they eat, my mind shall continue with the philosophers.</I> Now, when 
 they found it a hard saying, if they had humbly begged of Christ to 
 have <I>declared unto them this parable,</I> he would have opened it, 
 and their understandings too; for <I>the meek will he teach his 
 way.</I> But they were not willing to have Christ's sayings explained 
 to them, because they would not lose <I>this</I> pretence for rejecting 
 them--that they were <I>hard sayings.</I> 

 (2.) They think it impossible that any one else should like it: "<I>Who 
 can hear it?</I> Surely none can." Thus the scoffers at religion are 
 ready to undertake that all the intelligent part of mankind concur with 
 them. They conclude with great assurance that no <I>man of sense</I> 
 will admit the doctrine of Christ, nor any <I>man of spirit</I> submit 
 to his laws. Because they cannot bear to be so <I>tutored,</I> so 
 <I>tied up,</I> themselves, they think none else can: <I>Who can hear 
 it?</I> Thanks be to God, thousands have <I>heard</I> these sayings of 
 Christ, and have found them not only easy, but pleasant, as their 
 <I>necessary food.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ's animadversions upon their murmurings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He well enough knew their murmurings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>.

 Their cavils were secret in their own breasts, or whispered among 
 themselves in a corner. But,

 [1.] Christ <I>knew</I> them; he saw them, he heard them. Note, Christ 
 takes notice not only of the bold and open <I>defiances</I> that are 
 done to his name and glory by <I>daring sinners,</I> but of the secret 
 slights that are put upon his doctrine by carnal professors; he knows 
 that which the <I>fool saith in his heart,</I> and cannot for shame 
 <I>speak out;</I> he observes how his doctrine is <I>resented</I> by 
 those to whom it is <I>preached;</I> who <I>rejoice</I> in it, and who 
 <I>murmur</I> at it; who are reconciled to it, and bow before it, and 
 who quarrel with it, and rebel against it, though ever so secretly.
 
 [2.] He knew it <I>in himself,</I> not by any information given him, 
 nor any external indication of the thing, but by his own divine 
 omniscience. He knew it not as the prophets, by a <I>divine 
 revelation</I> made to him (that which the prophets desired to know was 
 sometimes hid from them, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:27">2 Kings iv. 27</A>),

 but by a <I>divine knowledge</I> in him. He is that essential Word that
 <I>discerns the thoughts of the heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12,13">Heb. iv. 12, 13</A>.

 Thoughts are words to Christ; we should therefore take heed not only
 what we say and do, but what we think.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He well enough knew how to answer them: "<I>Doth this offend 
 you?</I> Is this a stumbling-block to you?" See how people by their own 
 wilful mistakes create offences to themselves: they take offence where 
 there is none given, and even make it where there is nothing to make it 
 of. Note, We may justly wonder that so much offence should be taken at 
 the doctrine of Christ for so little cause. Christ speaks of it here 
 with wonder: "<I>Doth this offend you?</I>" Now, in answer to those who 
 condemned his doctrine as intricate and obscure (<I>Si non vis 
 intelligi, debes negligi</I>--<I>If you are unwilling to be understood,
 you ought to be neglected</I>),</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He gives them a hint of his ascension into heaven, as that which 
 would give an irresistible evidence of the truth of his doctrine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:62"><I>v.</I> 62</A>):

 <I>What and if you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was 
 before?</I> And what then? <I>First,</I> "If I should tell you of that, 
 surely it would much more offend you, and you would think my 
 pretensions too high indeed. If this be so hard a saying that you 
 cannot hear it, how will you digest it when I tell you of my returning 
 <I>to</I> heaven, whence I came down?" See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:12"><I>ch.</I> iii. 12</A>.

 Those who stumble at smaller difficulties should consider how they will
 get over greater. <I>Secondly,</I> "When you see the Son of man
 ascend, this will much more offend you, for then my body will be less 
 capable of being eaten by you in that gross sense wherein you now 
 understand it;" so Dr. Whitby. Or, <I>Thirdly,</I> "When you see that,
 or hear it from those that shall see it, surely then you will be 
 satisfied. You think I take too much upon me when I say, <I>I came down 
 from heaven,</I> for it was with this that you quarrelled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>);

 but will you think so when you see me return to heaven?" If he
 <I>ascended,</I> certainly he <I>descended,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:9,10">Eph. iv. 9, 10</A>.

 Christ did often refer himself thus to <I>subsequent</I> proofs, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:50,51,2:14,Mt+12:40,26:64"><I>ch.</I> i. 50, 51; ii. 14; Matt. xii. 40; xxvi. 64</A>.

 Let us wait awhile, till the mystery of God shall be finished, and then
 we shall see that there was no reason to be offended at any of Christ's 
 sayings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He gives them a general key to this and all such parabolical 
 discourses, teaching them that they are to be understood spiritually, 
 and not after a corporal and carnal manner: <I>It is the spirit that 
 quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:63"><I>v.</I> 63</A>.

 As it is in the natural body, the animal spirits quicken and enliven 
 it, and without these the most nourishing food would profit nothing 
 (what would the body be the better for bread, if it were not quickened 
 and animated by the spirit), so it is with the soul. <I>First,</I> The 
 bare participation of ordinances, unless the Spirit of God work with 
 them, and quicken the soul by them, <I>profits nothing;</I> the word 
 and ordinances, if the Spirit works with them, are as food to a living 
 man, if not, they are as food to a dead man. Even the flesh of Christ, 
 the sacrifice for sin, will avail us nothing unless the blessed Spirit 
 quicken our souls thereby, and enforce the powerful influences of his 
 death upon us, till we by his grace are planted together in the 
 likeness of it. <I>Secondly,</I> The doctrine of eating Christ's flesh 
 and drinking his blood, if it be understood literally, <I>profits 
 nothing,</I> but rather leads us into mistakes and prejudices; but the 
 spiritual sense or meaning of it quickens the soul, makes it 
 <I>alive</I> and <I>lively;</I> for so it follows: <I>The words that I 
 speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. To eat the flesh of 
 Christ!</I> this is a hard saying, but to believe that Christ died for 
 me, to derive from that doctrine strength and comfort in my approaches 
 to God, my oppositions to sin and preparations for a future state, this 
 is the <I>spirit and life</I> of that saying, and, construing it thus, 
 it is an excellent saying. The reason why men <I>dislike</I> Christ's 
 sayings if because they <I>mistake</I> them. The literal sense of a 
 parable does us no good, we are never the wiser for it, but the 
 spiritual meaning is instructive. <I>Thirdly,</I> The flesh profits 
 nothing--those that <I>are in the flesh</I> (so some understand it), 
 that are under the power of a carnal mind, <I>profit not</I> by 
 Christ's discourses; but <I>the Spirit quickeneth</I>--those that have 
 the Spirit, that are spiritual, are quickened and enlivened by them; 
 for they are received <I>ad modum recipientis--so as to correspond with 
 the state of the receiver's mind.</I> They found fault with Christ's 
 sayings, whereas the fault was in themselves; it is only to 
 <I>sensual</I> minds that spiritual things are <I>senseless</I> and 
 <I>sapless,</I> spiritual minds <I>relish</I> them; see 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:14,15">1 Cor. ii. 14, 15</A>.</P>

 [3.] He gives them an intimation of his <I>knowledge of them,</I> and 
 that he had expected no better from them, though they called themselves 
 his disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:64,65"><I>v.</I> 64, 65</A>.

 Now was fulfilled that of the prophet, speaking of Christ and his 
 doctrine

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1">Isa. liii. 1</A>),

 <I>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord 
 revealed?</I> Both these Christ here takes notice of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> They did not <I>believe his report:</I> "There are 
 <I>some of you</I> who said you would leave all to follow me who yet 
 <I>believe not;</I>" and this was the reason why the <I>word preached 
 did not profit them,</I> because it was <I>not mixed with faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:2">Heb. iv. 2</A>.

 They did not believe him to be the Messiah, else they would have
 acquiesced in the doctrine he preached, and not have quarrelled with 
 it, though there were some things in it <I>dark, and hard to be 
 understood. Oportet discentum credere--Young beginners in learning must 
 take things upon their teacher's word.</I> Note,

 1. Among those who are <I>nominal Christians,</I> there are many who
 are <I>real infidels.</I>

 2. The unbelief of hypocrites, before it discovers itself to the world,
 is naked and open before the eyes of Christ. He <I>knew from the 
 beginning</I> who they were of the multitudes that followed him that 
 <I>believed,</I> and who of the twelve should betray him; he knew 
 <I>from the beginning</I> of their acquaintance with him, and 
 attendance on him, when they were in the hottest pang of their zeal, 
 who were sincere, as Nathanael 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:47"><I>ch.</I> i. 47</A>),

 and who were not. Before they distinguished themselves by an overt act,
 he could infallibly distinguish <I>who believed</I> and who did not, 
 whose love was <I>counterfeit</I> and whose <I>cordial.</I> We may 
 gather hence, 

 (1.) That the apostasy of those who have long made a plausible 
 profession of religion is a certain proof of their constant hypocrisy, 
 and that <I>from the beginning they believed not,</I> but is not a 
 proof of the possibility of the total and final apostasy of any true 
 believers: such revolts are not to be called the fall of real saints, 
 but the discovery of pretended ones; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:19">1 John ii. 19</A>.

 <I>Stella cadens non stella fuit--The star that falls never was a 
 star.</I>

 (2.) That it is Christ's prerogative to <I>know the heart;</I> he knows
 who they are that <I>believe not,</I> but dissemble in their 
 profession, and yet continues them room in his church, the use of his 
 ordinances, and the credit of his name, and does not discover them in 
 this world, unless they by their own wickedness discover themselves; 
 because such is the constitution of his visible church, and the 
 discovering day is yet to come. But, if we pretend to judge men's 
 hearts, we step into Christ's throne, and anticipate his judgment. We 
 are often deceived in men, and see cause to change our sentiments of 
 them; but this we are sure of, that Christ knows all men, and <I>his 
 judgment is according to truth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The reason why they did not believe his report was
 because the <I>arm of the Lord</I> was not <I>revealed</I> to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:65"><I>v.</I> 65</A>):

 <I>Therefore said I unto you that no man can come to me, except it be 
 given unto him of my Father;</I> referring to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 Christ therefore could not but know who believed and who did not, 
 because faith is the gift and work of God, and all his Father's gifts 
 and works could not but be known to him, for they all passed through 
 his hands. There he had said that none could <I>come to him, except the 
 Father draw him;</I> here he saith, <I>except it be given him of my 
 Father,</I> which shows that God <I>draws</I> souls by giving them 
 grace and strength, and a heart to come, without which, such is the 
 moral impotency of man, in his fallen state, that he <I>cannot 
 come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We have here their final apostasy from Christ hereupon: <I>From that 
 time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:66"><I>v.</I> 66</A>.

 When we admit into our minds hard thoughts of the word and works of 
 Christ, and conceive a secret dislike, and are willing to hear 
 insinuations tending to their reproach, we are then <I>entering into 
 temptation;</I> it is as the letting forth of water; it is <I>looking 
 back,</I> which, if infinite mercy prevent not, will end in <I>drawing 
 back;</I> therefore <I>Obsta principiis--Take heed of the 
 beginnings</I> of apostasy.

 (1.) See here the <I>backsliding</I> of these <I>disciples. Many of 
 them went back</I> to their houses, and families, and callings, which 
 they had left for a time to follow him; <I>went back,</I> one to his 
 farm and another to his merchandise; <I>went back,</I> as Orpah did, to 
 their people, and to their gods, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:15">Ruth i. 15</A>.

 They had entered themselves in Christ's school, but they <I>went
 back,</I> did not only play truant for once, but took leave of him and 
 his doctrine for ever. Note, The apostasy of Christ's disciples from
 him, though really a strange thing, yet has been such a common thing 
 that we need not be surprised at it. Here were <I>many</I> that <I>went 
 back.</I> It is often so; when some backslide many backslide with them; 
 the disease is infectious.

 (2.) The occasion of this backsliding: <I>From that time,</I> from the 
 time that Christ preached this comfortable doctrine, that he is the 
 <I>bread of life,</I> and that those who by faith feed <I>upon him</I> 
 shall live <I>by him</I> (which, one would think, should have engaged 
 them to cleave more closely to him)--from <I>that</I> time they 
 withdrew. Note, The corrupt and wicked heart of man often makes that an 
 occasion of offence which is indeed matter of the greatest comfort. 
 Christ foresaw that they would thus take offence at what he said, and 
 yet he said it. That which is the undoubted word and truth of Christ 
 must be faithfully delivered, whoever may be offended at it. Men's 
 humours must be captivated to God's word, and not God's word 
 accommodated to men's humours. 

 (3.) The degree of their apostasy: <I>They walked no more with him,</I> 
 returned no more to him and attended no more upon his ministry. It is 
 hard for those who have been <I>once enlightened,</I> and have 
 <I>tasted the good word of God, if they fall away, to renew them again 
 to repentance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:4-6">Heb. vi. 4-6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This discourse was to others a <I>savour of life unto life. Many 
 went back,</I> but, thanks be to God, all did not; even then the 
 <I>twelve</I> stuck to him. Though the <I>faith of some be 
 overthrown,</I> yet the <I>foundation of God stands sure.</I> Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The affectionate question which Christ put to the twelve 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:67"><I>v.</I> 67</A>):
 
 <I>Will you also go away?</I> He saith nothing to those who went back. 
 <I>If the unbelieving depart, let them depart;</I> it was no great 
 <I>loss</I> of those whom he never <I>had;</I> lightly come, lightly 
 go; but he takes this occasion to speak to the twelve, to confirm them, 
 and by trying their stedfastness the more to fix them: <I>Will you also 
 go away?</I> 

 (1.) "It is <I>at your choice</I> whether you will or no; if you will 
 forsake me, now is the time, when so many do: it is an hour of 
 temptation; if you will go back, go now." Note, Christ will detain none 
 with him against their wills; his soldiers are volunteers, not pressed 
 men. The twelve had now had time enough to try how they liked Christ 
 and his doctrine, and that none of them might afterwards say that they 
 were trepanned into discipleship, and if it were to do again they would 
 not do it, he here allows them a power of revocation, and leaves them 
 at their liberty; as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+25:15,Ru+1:15">Josh. xxiv. 15; Ruth i. 15</A>.

 (2.) "It is <I>at your peril</I> if you do go away." If there was any 
 secret inclination in the heart of any of them to depart from him, he 
 stops it with this awakening question, "<I>Wilt you also go away?</I> 
 Think not that you hang at as loose an end as they did, and may go away 
 as easily as they could. They have not been so intimate with me as you 
 have been, nor received so many favours from me; they are gone, but 
 will <I>you</I> also go? Remember your character, and say, Whatever 
 others do, we will never go away. <I>Should such a man as I flee?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:11">Neh. vi. 11</A>.

 Note, The nearer we have been to Christ and the longer we have been
 with him, the more engagements we have laid ourselves under to him, the 
 greater will be our sin if we desert him.

 (3.) "I have reason <I>to think you will not.</I> Will you go away? No, 
 I have faster hold of you than so; <I>I hope better things of you</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:9">Heb. vi. 9</A>),

 for <I>you are they that have continued with me,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:28">Luke xxii. 28</A>.

 When the apostasy of some is a grief to the Lord Jesus, the constancy 
 of others is so much the more his honour, and he is pleased with it 
 accordingly. Christ and believers know one another too well to part
 upon every displeasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The believing reply which Peter, in the name of the rest, made to 
 this question, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:68,69"><I>v.</I> 68, 69</A>.

 Christ put the question to them, as Joshua put Israel to their choice 
 whom they would serve, with design to draw out from them a promise to 
 adhere to him, and it had the like effect. <I>Nay, but we will serve
 the Lord,</I> Peter was upon all occasions the <I>mouth of the 
 rest,</I> not so much because he had more of his Master's ear than 
 they, but because he had more tongue of his own; and what he said was 
 sometimes approved and sometimes reprimanded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:17,23">Matt. xvi. 17, 23</A>)

 --the common lot of those who are swift to speak. This here was well 
 said, admirably well; and probably he said it by the direction, and 
 with the express assent, of his fellow-disciples; at least he knew 
 their mind, and spoke the sense of them all, and did not except Judas, 
 for we must hope the best.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is a good resolution to adhere to Christ, and so expressed as 
 to intimate that they would not entertain the least thought of leaving 
 him: "<I>Lord, to whom shall we go?</I> It were folly to go from thee, 
 unless we knew where to better ourselves; no, Lord, we like our choice 
 too well to change." Note, Those who leave Christ would do well to 
 consider to whom they will go, and whether they can expect to find rest 
 and peace any where but in him. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:27,28,Ho+2:9">Ps. lxxiii. 27, 28; Hos. ii. 9</A>.
 
 "<I>Whither shall we go?</I> Shall we make our court to the world? It
 will certainly <I>deceive</I> us. Shall we return to sin? It will 
 certainly <I>destroy</I> us. Shall we leave the <I>fountain of living 
 waters</I> for <I>broken cisterns?</I>" The disciples resolve to 
 continue their pursuit of life and happiness, and will have a guide to 
 it, and will adhere to Christ as their guide, for they can never have a 
 better. "Shall we go to the heathen philosophers, and become their 
 disciples? They are become vain in their imaginations, and, professing 
 themselves to be wise in other things, are become fools in religion. 
 Shall we go to the scribes and Pharisees, and sit at their feet? What 
 good can they do us who have made void the commandments of God by their 
 traditions? Shall we go to Moses? He will send us back again to thee. 
 Therefore, if ever we find the way to happiness, it must be in 
 following thee." Note, Christ's holy religion appears to great 
 advantage when it is compared with other institutions, for then it will 
 be seen how far it excels them all. Let those who find fault with this 
 religion find a better before they quit it. A divine teacher we must 
 have; can we find a better than Christ? A divine revelation we cannot 
 be without; if the scripture be not such a one, where else may we look 
 for it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is a good reason for this resolution. It was not the 
 inconsiderate resolve of a blind affection, but the result of mature 
 deliberation. The disciples were resolved never to go away from 
 Christ,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Because of the <I>advantage</I> they promised themselves by him: 
 <I>Thou hast the words of eternal life.</I> They themselves did not 
 fully understand Christ's discourse, for as yet the doctrine of the 
 cross was a riddle to them; but in the general they were satisfied that 
 <I>he had the words of eternal life,</I> that is, <I>First,</I> That 
 the word of his doctrine showed the way to <I>eternal life,</I> set it 
 before us, and directed us what to do, that we might inherit it. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> That the word of his <I>determination</I> must confer 
 eternal life. His <I>having the words of eternal life</I> is the same 
 with his having <I>power to give eternal life to as many as were given 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:2"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 2</A>.

 He had in the foregoing discourse assured <I>eternal life</I> to his
 followers; these disciples fastened upon this plain saying, and 
 therefore resolved to stick to him, when the others overlooked this, 
 and fastened upon the <I>hard sayings,</I> and therefore forsook him. 
 Though we cannot account for every mystery, every obscurity, in 
 Christ's doctrine, yet we know, in the general, that it is the word of 
 eternal life, and therefore must live and die by it; for if we forsake 
 Christ <I>we forsake our own mercies.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Because of the assurance they had concerning him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:69"><I>v.</I> 69</A>):

 <I>We believe, and are sure, that thou art that Christ.</I> if he be 
 the promised Messiah, he must <I>bring in an everlasting 
 righteousness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24">Dan. ix. 24</A>),

 and therefore has the <I>words of eternal life,</I> for
 <I>righteousness reigns to eternal life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:21">Rom. v. 21</A>.

 observe, <I>First,</I> The <I>doctrine</I> they believed: that this 
 Jesus was the Messiah promised to the fathers and expected by them, and 
 that he was not a mere man, but the Son of the living God, the same to 
 whom God had said, <I>Thou art my Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7">Ps. ii. 7</A>.

 In times of temptation to apostasy it is good to have recourse to our
 first principles, and stick to them; and, if we faithfully abide by 
 that which is <I>past dispute,</I> we shall be the better able both to 
 <I>find</I> and to <I>keep</I> the truth in matters of doubtful 
 disputation. <I>Secondly,</I> The <I>degree</I> of their faith: it
 rose up to a full assurance: <I>We are sure.</I> We have known it <I>by 
 experience;</I> this is the best knowledge. We should take occasion 
 from others' wavering to be so much the more established, especially in 
 that which is the present truth. When we have so strong a faith in the 
 gospel of Christ as boldly to venture our souls <I>upon it,</I> knowing 
 <I>whom we have believed,</I> then, and not till then, we shall be 
 willing to venture every thing else for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The melancholy remark which our Lord Jesus made upon this reply of 
 Peter's 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:70,71"><I>v.</I> 70, 71</A>):

 <I>Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</I> And the 
 evangelist tells us whom he meant: <I>he spoke of Judas Iscariot.</I> 
 Peter had undertaken for them all that they would be faithful to their 
 Master. Now Christ does not condemn his charity (it is always good to 
 hope the best), but he tacitly corrects his confidence. We must not be 
 too sure concerning any. God knows those that are his; we do not. 
 Observe here, 

 (1.) Hypocrites and betrayers of Christ are no better than devils. 
 Judas not only <I>had</I> a devil, but he <I>was</I> a devil. One of 
 you is a <I>false accuser;</I> so <B><I>diabolos</I></B> sometimes 
 signifies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:3">2 Tim. iii. 3</A>);

 and it is probable that Judas, when he sold his Master to the chief 
 priests, represented him to them as a bad man, to justify himself in 
 what he did. But I rather take it as we read it: <I>He is a devil,</I> 
 a devil incarnate, a fallen apostle, as the devil a fallen angel. He is 
 Satan, an adversary, an enemy to Christ. He is Abaddon, and Apollyon, a 
 son of perdition. He was of his father the devil, did his lusts, was in 
 his interests, as Cain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:12">1 John iii. 12</A>.

 Those whose bodies were possessed by the devil are never called
 <I>devils</I> (<I>demoniacs,</I> but not <I>devils</I>); but Judas, 
 into whose <I>heart</I> Satan entered, and filled it, is called a 
 <I>devil.</I> 

 (2.) Many that are <I>seeming</I> saints are <I>real</I> devils. Judas 
 had as fair an outside as many of the apostles; his venom was, like 
 that of the serpent, covered with a fine skin. He <I>cast out 
 devils,</I> and appeared an enemy to the devil's kingdom, and yet was 
 himself a devil all the while. Not only he <I>will be</I> one shortly, 
 but he <I>is one</I> now. It is <I>strange,</I> and to be wondered at; 
 Christ speaks of it with wonder: <I>Have not I?</I> It is <I>sad,</I> 
 and to be lamented, that ever Christianity should be made a cloak to 
 diabolism. 

 (3.) The disguises of hypocrites, however they may deceive men, and put 
 a cheat upon them, cannot deceive Christ, for his piercing eye sees 
 through them. He can call those <I>devils</I> that call themselves 
 <I>Christians,</I> like the prophet's greeting to Jeroboam's wife, when 
 she came to him in masquerade 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:6">1 Kings xiv. 6</A>):

 <I>Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam.</I> Christ's <I>divine sight,</I> 
 far better than any <I>double sight,</I> can see spirits. 

 (4.) There are those who are chosen by Christ to special services who 
 yet prove false to him: <I>I have chosen you</I> to the 
 <I>apostleship,</I> for it is expressly said that Judas was not chosen 
 to eternal life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:18"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 18</A>),

 and yet one of <I>you</I> is a devil. Note, Advancement to places of
 honour and trust in the church is no certain evidence of saving grace. 
 <I>We have prophesied in thy name.</I> 

 (5.) In the most <I>select</I> societies on this side heaven it is no 
 new thing to meet with those that are corrupt. Of the twelve that were 
 chosen to an intimate conversation with an <I>incarnate Deity,</I> as 
 great an honour and privilege as ever men were chosen to, one was an 
 <I>incarnate devil.</I> The historian lays an emphasis upon this, that 
 Judas was <I>one of the twelve</I> that were so dignified and 
 distinguished. Let us not reject and unchurch the twelve because <I>one 
 of them is a devil,</I> nor say that they are all cheats and hypocrites 
 because one of them was so; let those that are so bear the blame, and 
 not those who, while they are undiscovered, incorporate with them. 
 There is a society within the veil into which no unclean thing shall 
 enter, a church of first-born, in which are no <I>false 
 brethren.</I></P>
