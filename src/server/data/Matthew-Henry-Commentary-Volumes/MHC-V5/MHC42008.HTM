 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Most of this chapter is a repetition of divers passages of Christ's 
 preaching and miracles which we had before in Matthew and Mark; they 
 are all of such weight, that they are worth repeating, and therefore 
 they are repeated, that out of the mouth not only of two, but of three, 
 witnesses every word may be established. Here is, 

 I. A general account of Christ's preaching, and how he had subsistence
 for himself and his numerous family by the charitable contributions of 
 good people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The parable of the sower, and the four sorts of ground, with the
 exposition of it, and some inferences from it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:4-18">ver. 4-18</A>.

 III. The preference which Christ gave to his obedient disciples before
 his nearest relations according to the flesh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:19-21">ver. 19-21</A>.

 IV. His stilling a storm at sea, with a word's speaking, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:22-25">ver. 22-25</A>.

 V. His casting a legion of devils out of a man that was possessed by
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:26-40">ver. 26-40</A>.

 VI. His healing the woman that had the bloody issue, and raising 
 Jairus's daughter to life,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every
 city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the
 kingdom of God: and the twelve <I>were</I> with him,
 &nbsp; 2 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and
 infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven
 devils,
 &nbsp; 3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna,
 and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>What</I> Christ <I>made</I> the <I>constant business</I> of his 
 <I>life</I>--it was <I>preaching;</I> in that work he was indefatigable,
 and went about doing good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>afterward</I>--<B><I>en to kathexes</I></B>--<I>ordine,</I> in the 
 proper <I>time</I> or <I>method.</I> Christ took his work before him 
 and went about it regularly. He observed a <I>series</I> or order of 
 business, so that the end of one good work was the beginning of 
 another. Now observe here, 

 1. <I>Where</I> he preached: <I>He went
 about</I>--<B><I>diodeue</I></B>--<I>peragrabat.</I> He was an 
 <I>itinerant</I> preacher, did not confine himself to one place, but 
 diffused the beams of his light. <I>Circumibat--He went his 
 circuit,</I> as a judge, having found his preaching perhaps most 
 <I>acceptable</I> where it was <I>new.</I> He went about <I>through 
 every city,</I> that none might plead ignorance. Hereby he set an 
 example to his disciples; they must traverse the nations of the earth, 
 as he did the cities of Israel. Nor did he confine himself to the 
 <I>cities,</I> but went into the <I>villages,</I> among the plain 
 country-people, to preach <I>to the inhabitants of the villages,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:11">Judg. v. 11</A>.

 2. What he preached: <I>He showed the glad tidings of the kingdom of
 God,</I> that it was now to be set up among them. Tidings of the 
 <I>kingdom of God</I> are <I>glad tidings,</I> and those Jesus Christ 
 came to bring; to tell the children of men that God was willing to take 
 all those <I>under his protection</I> that were willing to return <I>to 
 their allegiance.</I> It was <I>glad tidings</I> to the world that 
 there was hope of its being <I>reformed</I> and <I>reconciled.</I> 

 3. Who were his attendants: <I>The twelve were with him,</I> not to
 preach if he were present, but to learn from him what and how to preach 
 hereafter, and, if occasion were, to be sent to places where he could 
 not go. Happy were these his servants that heard his wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>Whence</I> he <I>had</I> the <I>necessary supports</I> of life: 
 He lived upon the kindness of his friends. There were <I>certain 
 women,</I> who frequently attended his ministry, that <I>ministered to 
 him of their substance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 Some of them are named; but there were <I>many others,</I> who were 
 zealously affected to the doctrine of Christ, and thought themselves 
 bound <I>in justice</I> to <I>encourage</I> it, having themselves found 
 benefit, and in <I>charity,</I> hoping that many others might find 
 benefit by it too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were such, for the most part, as had been <I>Christ's 
 patients,</I> and were the monuments of his power and mercy; they had 
 been <I>healed by him of evil spirits and infirmities.</I> Some of them 
 had been troubled in mind, had been melancholy, others of them 
 afflicted in body, and he had been to them a powerful healer. He is the 
 physician both of body and soul, and those who have been <I>healed by 
 him</I> ought to study what they shall <I>render to him.</I> We are 
 bound in <I>interest</I> to attend him, that we may be ready to apply 
 ourselves to him for help in case of a relapse; and we are bound in 
 <I>gratitude</I> to serve him and his gospel, who hath <I>saved</I> us, 
 and saved us <I>by it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. One of them was Mary Magdalene, out of whom had been <I>cast seven 
 devils;</I> a certain number for an uncertain. Some think that she was 
 one that had been <I>very wicked,</I> and then we may suppose her to be 
 the woman that <I>was a sinner</I> mentioned just before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:37"><I>ch.</I> vii. 37</A>.

 Dr. Lightfoot, finding in some of the Talmudists' writings that Mary
 Magdalene signified <I>Mary the plaiter of hair,</I> thinks it 
 applicable to her, she having been noted, in the days of her iniquity 
 and infamy, for that <I>plaiting of hair</I> which is opposed to 
 <I>modest apparel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:9">1 Tim. ii. 9</A>.

 But, though she had been an immodest woman, upon her repentance and
 reformation she found mercy, and became a zealous disciple of Christ. 
 Note, The greatest of sinners must not despair of pardon; and the worse 
 any have been before their conversion the more they should study to do 
 for Christ after. Or, rather, she was one that had been <I>very 
 melancholy,</I> and then, probably, it was Mary the sister of Lazarus, 
 who was a woman of a <I>sorrowful spirit,</I> who might have been 
 originally of Magdala, but removed to Bethany. This Mary Magdalene was 
 attending on Christ's cross and his sepulchre, and, if she was not Mary 
 the sister of Lazarus, either that particular friend and favourite of 
 Christ's did not attend then, or the evangelists did not take notice of 
 her, neither of which we can suppose; thus Dr. Lightfoot argues. Yet 
 there is this to be objected against it that Mary Magdalene is reckoned 
 <I>among the women that followed Jesus from Galilee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:55,56">Matt. xxvii. 55, 56</A>);

 whereas Mary the sister of Lazarus had her residence in Bethany.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Another of them was <I>Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's 
 steward.</I> She had been his wife (so some), but was now a widow, and 
 left in good circumstances. If she was now his wife, we have reason to 
 think that her <I>husband,</I> though preferred in Herod's court, had 
 received the gospel, and was very willing that his wife should be both 
 a hearer of Christ and a contributor to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. There were many of them that <I>ministered to Christ of their 
 substance.</I> It was an instance of the meanness of that condition to 
 which our Saviour humbled himself that he needed it, and of his great 
 humility and condescension that he accepted it. Though he was rich, yet 
 for our sakes <I>he became poor,</I> and lived upon alms. Let none say 
 that they scorn to be beholden to the charity of their neighbours, when 
 Providence has brought them into straits; but let them ask and be 
 thankful for it as a favour. Christ would rather be beholden to his 
 known friends for a maintenance for himself and his disciples than be 
 burdensome to strangers in the cities and villages whither he came to 
 preach. Note, It is the duty of those who are taught in the word to 
 <I>communicate to them who teach them in all good things;</I> and those 
 who are herein liberal and cheerful honour the Lord with their 
 substance, and bring a blessing upon it.</P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  And when much people were gathered together, and were come to
 him out of every city, he spake by a parable:
 &nbsp; 5 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell
 by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the
 air devoured it.
 &nbsp; 6 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up,
 it withered away, because it lacked moisture.
 &nbsp; 7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it,
 and choked it.
 &nbsp; 8 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit
 a hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He
 that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
 &nbsp; 9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable
 be?
 &nbsp; 10 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of
 the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they
 might not see, and hearing they might not understand.
 &nbsp; 11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
 &nbsp; 12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the
 devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they
 should believe and be saved.
 &nbsp; 13 They on the rock <I>are they,</I> which, when they hear, receive
 the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while
 believe, and in time of temptation fall away.
 &nbsp; 14 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they
 have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and
 pleasures of <I>this</I> life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
 &nbsp; 15 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and
 good heart, having heard the word, keep <I>it,</I> and bring forth
 fruit with patience.
 &nbsp; 16 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a
 vessel, or putteth <I>it</I> under a bed; but setteth <I>it</I> on a
 candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.
 &nbsp; 17 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest;
 neither <I>any thing</I> hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.
 &nbsp; 18 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him
 shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken
 even that which he seemeth to have.
 &nbsp; 19 Then came to him <I>his</I> mother and his brethren, and could
 not come at him for the press.
 &nbsp; 20 And it was told him <I>by certain</I> which said, Thy mother and
 thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.
 &nbsp; 21 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my
 brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The former paragraph began with an account of Christ's industry in 
 <I>preaching</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 this begins with an account of the people's industry in hearing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 He <I>went into every city,</I> to preach; so they, one would think, 
 should have contented themselves to hear him when he came to their own 
 city (we know those that would); but there were those here that came 
 <I>to him out of every city,</I> would not stay till he came to 
 <I>them,</I> nor think that they had enough when he left <I>them,</I> 
 but <I>met him</I> when he was coming towards them, and <I>followed 
 him</I> when he was going from them. Nor did he excuse himself from 
 going <I>to the cities</I> with this, that there were some <I>from</I> 
 the cities that <I>came to him;</I> for, though there were, yet the 
 most had not zeal enough to bring them to him, and therefore such is 
 his wonderful condescension that he will go to them; for <I>he is found 
 of those that sought him not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1">Isa. lxv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here was, it seems, a vast concourse, <I>much people were gathered 
 together,</I> abundance of fish to cast their net among; and he was as 
 ready and willing to <I>teach</I> as they were to be <I>taught.</I> Now 
 in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:4-21">these verses</A>

 we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Necessary and excellent rules and cautions for hearing the word, in 
 the parable of <I>the sower</I> and the explanation and application of 
 it, all which we had twice before more largely. When Christ had put 
 forth this parable, 

 1. The disciples were <I>inquisitive</I> concerning the meaning of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 They asked him, <I>What might this parable be?</I> Note, We should
 covet earnestly to know the true <I>in</I>tent, and full <I>ex</I>tent, 
 of the word we hear, that we may be neither mistaken nor defective in 
 our knowledge. 

 2. Christ made them sensible of what great advantage it was to them
 that they had opportunity of acquainting themselves with the mystery 
 and meaning of his word, which others had not: <I>Unto you it is 
 given,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Note, Those who would receive instruction from Christ must know and 
 consider what a privilege it is to be instructed by him, what a 
 distinguishing privilege to be led into the light, such a light, when 
 others are left in darkness, such a darkness. Happy are we, and for 
 ever indebted to free grace, if the same thing that is a <I>parable</I> 
 to others, with which they are only <I>amused,</I> is a <I>plain 
 truth</I> to us, by which we are <I>enlightened</I> and 
 <I>governed,</I> and into the mould of which we are 
 <I>delivered.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now from the parable itself, and the explication of it, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>heart of man</I> is as <I>soil</I> to the <I>seed of God's 
 word;</I> it is capable of receiving it, and bringing forth the fruits 
 of it; but, unless that seed be sown in it, it will bring forth nothing 
 valuable. Or care therefore must be to bring the <I>seed</I> and the 
 <I>soil</I> together. To what purpose have we the <I>seed</I> in the 
 scripture, if it be not <I>sown?</I> And to what purpose have we the 
 soil in our own hearts, if it be not sown with that seed?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>success</I> of the <I>seeding</I> is very much according to 
 the nature and temper of the <I>soil,</I> and as that is, or is not, 
 disposed to receive the seed. The word of God <I>is to us,</I> as <I>we 
 are,</I> a <I>savour of life unto life,</I> or <I>of death unto 
 death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The devil is a subtle and spiteful enemy, that makes it his 
 business to hinder our profiting by the word of God. He takes the word 
 out of the hearts of <I>careless</I> hearers, <I>lest they should 
 believe and be saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This is added here to teach us, 

 [1.] That we cannot be <I>saved</I> unless we <I>believe.</I> The word 
 of the gospel will not be a saving word to us, unless it be mixed with 
 faith.

 [2.] That therefore the devil does all he can to keep us from 
 <I>believing,</I> to make us not believe the word when we read and hear 
 it; or, if we heed it for the present, to make us forget it again, and 
 let it slip

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:1">Heb. ii. 1</A>);

 or, if we remember it, to create prejudices in our minds against it, or 
 <I>divert</I> our minds from it to something else; and all is <I>lest 
 we should believe and be saved,</I> lest we should believe and 
 <I>rejoice,</I> while he believes and <I>trembles.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Where the word of God is heard <I>carelessly</I> there is commonly 
 a <I>contempt</I> put upon it too. It is added here in the parable that 
 the seed which fell by the way-side was <I>trodden down,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They that wilfully shut their ears against the word do in effect 
 trample it under their feet; they <I>despise the commandment of the 
 Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Those on whom the word makes <I>some</I> impressions, but they are 
 not <I>deep</I> and <I>durable</I> ones, will show their hypocrisy in a 
 time of trial; as the seed sown upon the rock, where it gains no root, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 These <I>for awhile believe</I> a little while; their profession 
 promises something, but in <I>time of temptation they fall away</I> 
 from their good beginnings. Whether the temptation arises from the 
 smiles or the frowns, of the world, they are easily overcome by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) The <I>pleasures of this life</I> are as dangerous and mischievous 
 thorns to choke the good seed of the word as any other. This is added 
 here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 which was not in the other evangelists. Those that are <I>not entangled 
 in the cares of this life,</I> nor inveigled with the <I>deceitfulness 
 of riches,</I> but boast that they are dead to them, may yet be kept 
 from heaven by an affected indolence, and the love of ease and 
 pleasure. The delights of sense may ruin the soul, even lawful 
 delights, indulged, and too much delighted in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) It is not enough that the fruit be brought forth, but it must be 
 <I>brought to perfection,</I> it must be fully ripened. If it be not, 
 it is as if there was no fruit at all brought forth; for that which in 
 Matthew and Mark is said to be <I>unfruitful</I> is the same that here 
 is said to <I>bring forth none to perfection.</I> For <I>factum non 
 dicitur quod non perseverat</I>--<I>perseverance is necessary to the
 perfection of a work.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (8.) The good ground, which brings forth <I>good fruit,</I> is an 
 <I>honest</I> and <I>good heart,</I> well disposed to receive 
 instruction and commandment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 a heart free from sinful pollutions, and firmly fixed for God and duty, 
 an upright heart, a tender heart, and a heart that <I>trembles at the 
 word,</I> is an honest and good heart, which, having heard the word, 
 <I>understands</I> it (so it is in Matthew), <I>receives</I> it (so it
 is in Mark), and <I>keeps</I> it (so it is here), as the soil not only
 <I>receives,</I> but keeps, the seed; and the stomach not only 
 receives, but keeps, the food or physic.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (9.) Where the word is well kept there is fruit brought forth <I>with 
 patience.</I> This also is added here. There must be both 
 <I>bearing</I> patience and <I>waiting</I> patience; patience to suffer 
 the <I>tribulation</I> and <I>persecution</I> which may <I>arise 
 because of the word;</I> patience to continue to the end in 
 well-doing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (10.) In consideration of all this, we ought to take <I>heed how we 
 hear</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 take heed of those things that will hinder our profiting by the word we 
 hear, watch over our hearts in hearing, and take heed lest they betray 
 us; take heed <I>lest</I> we hear carelessly and slightly, lest, upon 
 any account, we entertain prejudice against the word we hear; and take 
 heed to the frame of our spirits after we have heard the word, lest we 
 lose what we have gained.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Needful instructions given to those that are appointed to preach 
 the word, and to those also that have heard it. 

 1. Those that have <I>received the gift</I> must <I>minister the
 same.</I> Ministers that have the dispensing of the gospel committed to 
 them, people that have profited by the word and are thereby qualified 
 to profit others, must look upon themselves as <I>lighted candles:</I> 
 ministers must in solemn authoritative preaching, and people in 
 brotherly familiar discourse, diffuse their light, for a <I>candle</I> 
 must not be <I>covered with a vessel</I> nor <I>put under a bed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Ministers and Christians are to be lights in the world, <I>holding 
 forth the word of life.</I> Their light must shine before men; they 
 must not only <I>be good,</I> but <I>do good.</I> 

 2. We must expect that what is now done <I>in secret,</I> and from
 unseen springs, will shortly be <I>manifested</I> and <I>made 
 known,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 What is committed to you <I>in secret</I> should be made manifest <I>by 
 you;</I> for your Master did not give you talents to be buried, but to 
 be traded with. Let that which is now hid be <I>made known;</I> for, if 
 it be not manifested <I>by you,</I> it will be manifested <I>against 
 you,</I> will be produced in evidence of your treachery. 

 3. The gifts we have will either be continued to us, or taken from us,
 according as we do, or do not, make use of them for the glory of God 
 and the edification of our brethren: <I>Whosoever hath, to him shall be 
 given,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 He that hath gifts, and does good with them, shall have more; he that 
 <I>buries his talent</I> shall lose it. From him that hath not shall be 
 taken away even <I>that which he hath,</I> so it is in Mark; that which 
 he <I>seemeth to have,</I> so it is in Luke. Note, The grace that is
 lost was but <I>seeming</I> grace, was never <I>true.</I> Men do but 
 <I>seem</I> to have what they do not <I>use,</I> and shows of religion 
 will be lost and forfeited. They <I>went out from us, because they were 
 not of us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:19">1 John ii. 19</A>.

 Let us see to it that we have grace in sincerity, the <I>root of the 
 matter</I> found in us; that is a good part which shall never be taken 
 away from those that have it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Great encouragement given to those that prove themselves faithful 
 <I>hearers of the word,</I> by being <I>doers of the work,</I> in a 
 particular instance of Christ's respect to his disciples, in preferring 
 them even before his nearest relations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>),

 which passage of story we had twice before. Observe, 

 1. What crowding there was after Christ. There was no coming near for 
 the throng of people that attended him, who, though they were crowded 
 very so much, would not be crowded out from his congregation. 

 2. Some of his nearest kindred were least solicitous to hear him
 preach. Instead of getting <I>within,</I> as they might easily have
 done if they had come in time, desiring to <I>hear him,</I> they stood 
 <I>without,</I> desiring to <I>see him;</I> and, probably, out of a 
 foolish fear, lest he should spend himself with too much speaking, 
 designing nothing but to interrupt him, and oblige him to break off. 

 3. Jesus Christ would rather be busy at his work than conversing with
 his friends. He would not leave his preaching, to speak with his 
 <I>mother</I> and his <I>brethren,</I> for it was his <I>meat and 
 drink</I> to be so employed. 

 4. Christ is pleased to own those as his nearest and dearest relations
 that <I>hear the word of God and do it;</I> they are to him more than 
 <I>his mother</I> and <I>brethren.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a
 ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over
 unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.
 &nbsp; 23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a
 storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled <I>with water,</I> and
 were in jeopardy.
 &nbsp; 24 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master,
 we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of
 the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.
 &nbsp; 25 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being
 afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is
 this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey
 him.
 &nbsp; 26 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is
 over against Galilee.
 &nbsp; 27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the
 city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no
 clothes, neither abode in <I>any</I> house, but in the tombs.
 &nbsp; 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him,
 and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,
 <I>thou</I> Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.
 &nbsp; 29 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the
 man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with
 chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of
 the devil into the wilderness.)
 &nbsp; 30 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said,
 Legion: because many devils were entered into him.
 &nbsp; 31 And they besought him that he would not command them to go
 out into the deep.
 &nbsp; 32 And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the
 mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to
 enter into them. And he suffered them.
 &nbsp; 33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the
 swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the
 lake, and were choked.
 &nbsp; 34 When they that fed <I>them</I> saw what was done, they fled, and
 went and told <I>it</I> in the city and in the country.
 &nbsp; 35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus,
 and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting
 at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they
 were afraid.
 &nbsp; 36 They also which saw <I>it</I> told them by what means he that was
 possessed of the devils was healed.
 &nbsp; 37 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes
 round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken
 with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back
 again.
 &nbsp; 38 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought
 him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,
 &nbsp; 39 Return to thine own house, and show how great things God
 hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published
 throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto
 him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here two illustrious proofs of the power of our Lord Jesus 
 which we had before--his power over the <I>winds,</I> and his power over
 the <I>devils.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:1-5:43">Mark iv. and v</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His power over the winds, those <I>powers of the air</I> that are so 
 much a terror to men, especially upon sea, and occasion the death of 
 such multitudes. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ ordered his disciples to put to sea, that he might show his 
 glory upon the water, in stilling the waves, and might do an act of 
 kindness to a poor possessed man on the other side the water: <I>He 
 went into a ship with his disciples,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They that observe Christ's orders may assure themselves of his 
 presence. If Christ sends his disciples, he goes <I>with them.</I> And 
 those may safely and boldly venture any where that have Christ 
 accompanying them. <I>He said, Let us go over unto the other side;</I> 
 for he had a piece of good work to do there. He might have gone by 
 land, a little way about; but he chose to go by <I>water,</I> that he 
 might show his <I>wonders in the deep.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Those that put to sea in a calm, yea, and at Christ's word, must yet 
 <I>prepare for a storm,</I> and for the utmost peril in that storm; 
 There <I>came down a storm of wind on the lake</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 as if it were there, and no where else; and presently their ship was so 
 tossed that it was filled with water, and they were in jeopardy of 
 their lives. Perhaps the devil, who is the <I>prince of the power of 
 the air,</I> and who <I>raiseth winds</I> by the permission of God, had 
 some suspicion, from some words which Christ might let fall, that he 
 was coming over the lake now on purpose to cast that legion of devils 
 out of the poor man on the other side, and therefore poured this storm 
 upon the ship he was in, designing, if possible, to have sunk him and 
 prevented that victory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ was <I>asleep</I> in the storm, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Some bodily refreshment he must have, and he chose to take it when it 
 would be least a hindrance to him in his work. The disciples of Christ 
 may really have his gracious presence with them at sea, and in a storm, 
 and yet he may seem as if he were <I>asleep;</I> he may not immediately 
 appear for their relief, no, not when things seem to be brought even to 
 the last extremity. Thus he will try their faith and patience, and 
 quicken them by prayer to awake, and make their deliverance the more 
 welcome when it comes at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. A complaint to Christ of our danger, and the distress his church is 
 in, is enough to engage him to awake, and appear for us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 They cried, <I>Master, master, we perish!</I> The way to have our fears 
 silenced is to bring them to Christ, and lay them before him. Those 
 that in sincerity call Christ <I>Master,</I> and with faith and 
 fervency call upon him as <I>their Master,</I> may be sure that he will 
 not let them <I>perish.</I> There is no relief for poor souls that are 
 under a sense of guilt, and a fear of wrath, like this, to go to 
 Christ, and call him <I>Master,</I> and say, "I am <I>undone,</I> if 
 thou do not <I>help me.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Christ's business is to <I>lay storms,</I> as it is Satan's business 
 to <I>raise</I> them. He can do it; he has done it; he delights to do 
 it: for he came to <I>proclaim peace on earth.</I> He <I>rebuked the 
 wind and the raging of the water,</I> and immediately <I>they 
 ceased</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 not, as at other times, by degrees, but all of a sudden, <I>there was a 
 great calm.</I> Thus Christ showed that, though the devil pretends to 
 be the prince of the power of the air, yet even there he has him in a 
 chain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. When our dangers are over, it becomes us to take to ourselves the 
 shame of our own fears and to give to Christ the glory of his power. 
 When Christ had turned the <I>storm</I> into a <I>calm, then were they 
 glad because they were quiet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:30">Ps. cvii. 30</A>.
 
 And then,

 (1.) Christ gives them a rebuke for their inordinate fear: <I>Where is
 your faith?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Note, Many that have <I>true faith</I> have it to seek when they have 
 occasion to use it. They tremble, and are discouraged, if second causes 
 frown upon them. A little thing disheartens them; and <I>where is their 
 faith</I> then?

 (2.) They give him the glory of his power: <I>They, being afraid, 
 wondered.</I> Those that had feared the storm, now that the danger was 
 over with good reason feared him that had stilled it, and <I>said one 
 to another, What manner of man is this!</I> They might as well have 
 said, <I>Who is a God like unto thee?</I> For it is God's prerogative 
 to <I>still the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:7">Ps. lxv. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His power over <I>the devil,</I> the <I>prince of the power of the 
 air.</I> In the next passage of story he comes into a closer grapple 
 with him than he did when he commanded <I>the winds.</I> Presently 
 after the winds were stilled they were brought to their desired haven, 
 and <I>arrived at the country of the Gadarenes,</I> and there went 
 ashore 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>);

 and he soon met with that which was his business over, and which he 
 thought it worth his while to go through a storm to accomplish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may learn a great deal out of this story concerning this world of 
 infernal, malignant spirits, which, though not working now ordinarily 
 in the same way as here, yet we are all concerned at all times to stand 
 upon our guard against.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. These <I>malignant</I> spirits are very <I>numerous.</I> They that 
 had taken possession of this one man called themselves <I>Legion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 because <I>many devils were entered into him:</I> he had <I>had devils
 a long time,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 But perhaps those that had been long in possession of him, upon some 
 foresight of our Saviour's coming to make an attack upon them, and 
 finding they could not prevent it by the storm they had raised, sent 
 for recruits, intending this to be <I>a decisive</I> battle, and hoping 
 now to be too hard for him that had cast out so many unclean spirits, 
 and to give him a defeat. They either were, or at least would be 
 thought to be, a <I>legion,</I> formidable as an <I>army with 
 banners;</I> and now, at least, to be, what the <I>twentieth legion</I> 
 of the Roman army, which was long quartered at Chester, was styled, 
 <I>legio victrix</I>--a <I>victorious legion.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They have an <I>inveterate enmity</I> to man, and all his 
 conveniences and comforts. This man in whom the devils had got 
 possession, and kept it long, being under their influence, <I>wore no 
 clothes, neither abode in any house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 though <I>clothing</I> and a <I>habitation</I> are two of the necessary 
 supports of this life. Nay, and because man has a natural dread of the
 habitations of the dead, they forced this man to <I>abide in the 
 tombs,</I> to make him so much the more a terror to himself and to all 
 about him, so that his soul had as much cause as ever any man's had to 
 be weary of his life, and to <I>choose strangling and death 
 rather.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They are very <I>strong, fierce,</I> and unruly, and hate and scorn 
 to be restrained: <I>He was kept bound with chains and in fetters,</I> 
 that he might not be mischievous either to others or to himself, but he 
 <I>broke the bands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Note, Those that are <I>ungovernable</I> by any other thereby show that 
 they are under Satan's government; and this is the language of those 
 that are so, even concerning God and Christ, their best friends, that 
 would not either bind them <I>from</I> or bind them<I>to</I> any thing 
 but for their own good: <I>Let us break their bands in sunder. He was 
 driven of the devil.</I> Those that are under Christ's government are 
 <I>sweetly led</I> with the cords of a man and the bands of love; those 
 that are under the devil's government are <I>furiously driven.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They are much enraged against our Lord Jesus, and have a great dread 
 and horror of him: <I>When the man</I> whom they had possession of, and 
 who spoke as they would have him, <I>saw Jesus,</I> he <I>roared 
 out</I> as one in an agony, and <I>fell down before him,</I> to 
 deprecate his wrath, and owned him to be <I>the Son of God most 
 high,</I> that was infinitely above him and too hard for him; but 
 protested against having any league or confederacy with him (which 
 might sufficiently have silenced the blasphemous cavils of the scribes 
 and Pharisees): <I>What have I to do with thee?</I> The devils have 
 neither inclination to do service to Christ nor expectation to receive 
 benefit by him: <I>What have we to do with thee?</I> But they dreaded 
 his power and wrath: <I>I beseech thee, torment me not.</I> They do not 
 say, <I>I beseech thee, save me,</I> but only, <I>Torment me not.</I> 
 See whose language <I>they</I> speak that have only a dread of hell as 
 a place of torment, but no desire of heaven as a place of holiness and 
 love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They are perfectly <I>at the command,</I> and under <I>the 
 power,</I> of our Lord Jesus; and they knew it, for they <I>besought 
 him that he would not command them to go</I> <B><I>eis ton 
 abysson</I></B>--<I>into the deep,</I> the place of their torment, which
 they acknowledge he could easily and justly do. O what a comfort is 
 this to the Lord's people, that all the powers of darkness are under 
 the check and control of the Lord Jesus! He has them all in a chain. He 
 can send them to <I>their own place,</I> when he pleaseth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. They delight in <I>doing mischief.</I> When they found there was no 
 remedy, but they must quit their hold of this poor man, they begged 
 they might have leave to take possession of a <I>herd of swine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 When the devil at first brought man into a miserable state he brought a 
 curse likewise upon the whole creation, and that became subject to 
 enmity. And here, as an instance of that extensive enmity of his, when 
 he could not destroy the man, he would destroy the swine. If he could 
 not hurt them in their bodies, he would hurt them in their goods, which 
 sometimes prove a great temptation to men to draw them from Christ, as 
 here. Christ <I>suffered them to enter into the swine,</I> to convince 
 the country what mischief the devil could do in it, if he should suffer 
 him. No sooner had the devils leave than they entered into the 
 <I>swine;</I> and no sooner had they entered into them than the herd 
 ran violently <I>down a steep place into the lake,</I> and were 
 <I>drowned.</I> For it is a miracle of mercy if those whom Satan 
 possesses are not brought to destruction and perdition. This, and other 
 instances, show that that roaring lion and red dragon seeks <I>what</I> 
 and whom he may devour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. When the devil's power is broken in any soul that soul recovers 
 itself, and returns into a right frame, which supposes that those whom 
 Satan gets possession of are put out of the possession of themselves: 
 <I>The man out of whom the devils were departed sat at the feet of 
 Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 While he was under the devil's power he was ready to <I>fly in the 
 face</I> of Jesus; but now he <I>sits at his feet,</I> which is a sign 
 that he is come to his <I>right mind.</I> If God has possession of us, 
 he preserves to us the government and enjoyment of ourselves; but, if 
 Satan has possession of us, he robs us of both. Let his power therefore 
 in our souls be overturned, and let <I>him</I> come whose right our 
 hearts are, and let us give them to him; for we are never more our own 
 than when we are his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us now see what was the effect of this miracle of casting the 
 legion of devils out of this man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What effect it had upon the people of that country who had lost 
 their swine by it: <I>The swineherds went and told it</I> both <I>in 
 city and country</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 perhaps with a design to incense people against Christ. They told <I>by 
 what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),
 
 that it was by sending the devils into the swine, which was capable of 
 an invidious representation, as if Christ could not have delivered the 
 man out of their hands, but by delivering the swine into them. <I>The 
 people came out, to see what was done,</I> and to enquire into it; and 
 <I>they were afraid</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);
 
 they were <I>taken with great fear</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>);

 they were surprised and amazed at it, and knew not what to say to it. 
 They thought more of the destruction of the swine than of the 
 deliverance of their poor afflicted neighbour, and of the country from 
 the terror of his frenzy, which was become a public nuisance; and 
 therefore <I>the whole multitude besought Christ to depart from 
 them</I> for fear he should bring some other judgment upon them; 
 whereas indeed none need to be afraid of Christ that are willing to 
 forsake their sins and give up themselves to him. But Christ took them 
 at their word: <I>He went up into the ship, and returned back 
 again.</I> Those lose their Saviour, and their hopes in him, that love 
 their swine better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What effect it had upon the poor man who had recovered himself by 
 it. He <I>desired</I> Christ's company as much as others <I>dreaded</I> 
 it: he besought Christ that <I>he might be with him</I> as others were 
 <I>that had been healed by him of evil spirits and infirmities</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that Christ might be to him a protector and teacher, and that he might 
 be to Christ for a name and a praise. He was loth to stay among those 
 rude and brutish Gadarenes that desired Christ to depart from them. 
 <I>O gather not my soul with these sinners!</I> But Christ would not 
 take him along with him, but sent him home, to publish among those that 
 knew him the great things God had done for him, that so he might be a 
 blessing to his country, as he had been a burden to it. We must 
 sometimes deny ourselves the satisfaction even of spiritual benefits 
 and comforts, to gain an opportunity of being serviceable to the souls 
 of others. Perhaps Christ knew that, when the resentment of the loss of 
 their swine was a little over, they would be better disposed to 
 consider the miracle, and therefore left the man among them to be a 
 standing monument, and a monitor to them of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>40  And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the
 people <I>gladly</I> received him: for they were all waiting for him.
 &nbsp; 41 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a
 ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and
 besought him that he would come into his house:
 &nbsp; 42 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and
 she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.
 &nbsp; 43 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had
 spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of
 any,
 &nbsp; 44 Came behind <I>him,</I> and touched the border of his garment:
 and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
 &nbsp; 45 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and
 they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee
 and press <I>thee,</I> and sayest thou, Who touched me?
 &nbsp; 46 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive
 that virtue is gone out of me.
 &nbsp; 47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came
 trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him
 before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how
 she was healed immediately.
 &nbsp; 48 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy
 faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.
 &nbsp; 49 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the
 synagogue's <I>house,</I> saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble
 not the Master.
 &nbsp; 50 But when Jesus heard <I>it,</I> he answered him, saying, Fear
 not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.
 &nbsp; 51 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go
 in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the
 mother of the maiden.
 &nbsp; 52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she
 is not dead, but sleepeth.
 &nbsp; 53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
 &nbsp; 54 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and
 called, saying, Maid, arise.
 &nbsp; 55 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he
 commanded to give her meat.
 &nbsp; 56 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that
 they should tell no man what was done.

 Christ was driven away by the <I>Gadarenes;</I> they were weary of him, 
 and willing to be rid of him. But when he had crossed the water, and 
 returned to the <I>Galileans,</I> they <I>gladly received him, 
 wished</I> and <I>waited</I> for his return, and <I>welcomed</I> him 
 with all their hearts when he did return, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 If some <I>will not</I> accept the favours Christ offers them, others 
 <I>will.</I> If the Gadarenes be not gathered, yet there are many among 
 whom <I>Christ shall be glorious.</I> When Christ had done his work on 
 the other side of the water he returned, and found work to do in the 
 place whence he came, fresh work. They that will lay out themselves to 
 do good shall never want occasion for it. The needy you have always 
 with you.</P>

 We have here two miracles interwoven, as they were in Matthew and 
 Mark--the raising of Jairus's daughter to life, and the cure of the
 woman that had an issue of blood, as he was going in a crowd to 
 Jairus's house. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A <I>public address</I> made to Christ by <I>a ruler of the 
 synagogue,</I> whose name was <I>Jairus,</I> on the behalf of a little 
 daughter of his, that was very ill, and, in the apprehension of all 
 about here, <I>lay a dying.</I> This address was very humble and 
 reverent. Jairus, though a <I>ruler, fell down at Jesus's feet,</I> as 
 owning him to be a ruler <I>above</I> him. It was very importunate. He 
 <I>besought him</I> that he would <I>come into his house;</I> not 
 having the <I>faith,</I> at least not having the <I>thought,</I> of the 
 centurion, who desired Christ only to <I>speak the</I> healing 
 <I>word</I> at a distance. But Christ complied with his request; <I>he 
 went along</I> with him. Strong faith shall be applauded, and yet weak 
 faith shall not be rejected. In the houses where sickness and death 
 are, it is very desirable to have the presence of Christ. When Christ 
 was going, <I>the people thronged him,</I> some out of curiosity to see 
 him, others out of an affection to him. Let us not complain of a crowd, 
 and a throng, and a hurry, as long as we are in the way of our duty, 
 and <I>doing good;</I> but otherwise it is what every wise man will 
 keep himself out of as much as he can.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a <I>secret application</I> made to Christ by a woman ill 
 of a <I>bloody issue,</I> which had been the consumption of her body 
 and the consumption of her purse too; for <I>she had spent all her 
 living upon physicians,</I> and was never the better, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 The nature of her disease was such that she did not care to make a 
 public complaint of it (it was agreeable to the modesty of her sex to 
 be very shy of speaking of it), and therefore she took this opportunity 
 of coming to Christ <I>in a crowd;</I> and the more people were present 
 the more likely she thought it was that she should be <I>concealed.</I> 
 Her <I>faith</I> was very <I>strong;</I> for she doubted not but that 
 by the <I>touch</I> of the <I>hem of his garment</I> she should derive 
 from him healing virtue sufficient for her relief, looking upon him to 
 be such a full fountain of mercies that she should <I>steal</I> a cure 
 and he not <I>miss it.</I> Thus many a poor soul is <I>healed,</I> and 
 <I>helped,</I> and <I>saved,</I> by Christ, that is <I>lost in a 
 crowd,</I> and that nobody takes notice of. The woman found an 
 immediate change for the better in herself, and that her disease was 
 cured, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 As believers have comfortable communion with Christ, so they have 
 comfortable communications from him <I>incognito</I>--<I>secretly, meat 
 to eat</I> that the <I>world knows not</I> of, and <I>joy</I> that a 
 <I>stranger does not intermeddle with.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is a <I>discovery</I> of this secret cure, to the glory both 
 of the physician and the patient.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ takes notice that there is a cure wrought: <I>Virtue is gone 
 out of me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.

 Those that have been healed by virtue derived from Christ must 
 <I>own</I> it, for he <I>knows it.</I> He speaks of it here, not in a 
 way of <I>complaint,</I> as if he were hereby either <I>weakened</I> or 
 <I>wronged,</I> but in a way of <I>complacency.</I> It was his delight 
 that <I>virtue</I> was gone out of him to do any good, and he did not 
 grudge it to the meanest; they were as welcome to it as to the light 
 and heat of the sun. Nor had he the less virtue <I>in him</I> for the 
 going out of the virtue <I>from him</I> for he is an <I>overflowing</I> 
 fountain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The poor patient owns her case, and the benefit she had received: 
 <I>When she saw that she was not hid, she came, and fell down before 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 Note, The consideration of this, that we cannot be <I>hid from 
 Christ,</I> should engage us to <I>pour</I> out <I>our hearts 
 before</I> him, and to show before him all our sin and all our trouble. 
 <I>She came trembling,</I> and yet <I>her faith saved her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.
 
 Note, There may be <I>trembling</I> where yet there is saving faith. 
 She <I>declared before all the people for what cause she had touched 
 him</I> because she believed that a touch would cure her, and it did 
 so. Christ's patients should communicate their experiences to one 
 another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The great physician confirms her cure, and sends her away with the 
 comfort of it: <I>Be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee 
 whole,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.

 Jacob got the blessing from Isaac clandestinely, and by a wile; but, 
 when the fraud was discovered, Isaac ratified it designedly. It was 
 obtained <I>surreptitiously</I> and <I>under-hand,</I> but it was 
 secured and seconded <I>above-board.</I> So was the cure here. He is 
 <I>blessed,</I> and he <I>shall be blessed;</I> so here, She <I>is</I> 
 healed, and she <I>shall be</I> healed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is an <I>encouragement</I> to Jairus not to distrust the power 
 of Christ, <I>though his daughter was now dead,</I> and they that 
 brought him the tidings advised him not to give <I>the Master any 
 further trouble</I> about her: <I>Fear not,</I> saith Christ, <I>only 
 believe.</I> Note, Our <I>faith in Christ</I> should be bold and 
 daring, as well as our <I>zeal for him.</I> They that are willing to do 
 any thing for him may depend upon his doing great things for them, 
 above what they are able to ask or think. When the patient is dead 
 there is no room for prayer, or the use of means; but here, though the 
 child is dead, yet <I>believe,</I> and all shall be well. <I>Post 
 mortem medicus</I>--<I>to call in the physician after death,</I> is an
 absurdity; but not <I>post mortem Christus</I>--<I>to call in Christ
 after death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The <I>preparatives</I> for the raising of her to life again. 

 1. The <I>choice</I> Christ made of witnesses that should see the
 miracle wrought. A <I>crowd</I> followed him, but perhaps they were 
 rude and noisy; however, it was not fit to let such a multitude come 
 into a gentleman's house, especially now that the family was all in 
 sorrow; <I>therefore</I> he sent them back, and not because he was 
 afraid to let the miracle pass their scrutiny; for he raised Lazarus 
 and the widow's son <I>publicly.</I> He took none with him but Peter, 
 and James, and John, that triumvirate of his disciples that he was most 
 intimate with, designing these three, with the parents, to be the only 
 spectators of the miracle, they being a competent number to attest the 
 truth of it. 

 2. The <I>check</I> he gave to the mourners. <I>They all wept, and
 bewailed her;</I> for, it seems, she was a very agreeable hopeful 
 child, and dear not only to the parents, but to all the neighbours. But 
 Christ bid them <I>not weep; for she is not dead, but sleepeth.</I> He 
 means, as to her peculiar case, that she was not dead for good and all, 
 but that she should now shortly be raised to life, so that it would be 
 to her friends as if she had been but a few hours asleep. But it is 
 applicable to all that die in the Lord; therefore we should not sorrow 
 for them as those that have <I>no hope,</I> because death is but a 
 <I>sleep</I> to them, not only as it is a <I>rest</I> from all the 
 <I>toils</I> of the <I>days of time,</I> but as there will be a 
 <I>resurrection,</I> a waking and rising again to all the 
 <I>glories</I> of the <I>days of eternity.</I> This was a comfortable 
 word which Christ said to these mourners, yet they wickedly ridiculed 
 it, and <I>laughed him to scorn</I> for it here was <I>a pearl cast 
 before swine.</I> They were ignorant of the scriptures of the Old 
 Testament who bantered it as an absurd thing to call death a 
 <I>sleep;</I> yet <I>this</I> good came out of <I>that</I> evil that 
 hereby the truth of the miracle was evinced; for they <I>knew that she 
 was dead,</I> they were certain of it, and therefore nothing less than 
 a <I>divine power</I> could restore her to life. We find not any answer 
 that he made them; but he soon <I>explained himself,</I> I hope to 
 their conviction, so that they would never again laugh at any word of 
 his. But he <I>put them all out,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.

 They were unworthy to be the witnesses of this work of wonder; they who 
 in the midst of their mourning were so merrily disposed as to laugh at 
 him for what he <I>said</I> would, it may be, have found something to 
 laugh at in what he <I>did,</I> and therefore are justly shut out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Her return to life, after a <I>short</I> visit to the 
 <I>congregation of the dead: He took her by the hand</I> (as we do by 
 one that we would awake out of sleep, and help up), and he called, 
 saying, <I>Maid, arise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>.

 Thus the <I>hand of Christ's grace</I> goes along with the <I>calls of 
 his word,</I> to make them effectual. Here that is expressed which was 
 only implied in the other evangelists, that <I>her spirit came 
 again;</I> her soul returned again to animate her body. This plainly 
 proves that the soul exists and acts in a state of separation from the 
 body, and therefore is immortal; that death does not extinguish this 
 <I>candle of the Lord,</I> but takes it out of a <I>dark lantern.</I> 
 It is not, as Grotius well observes, the <B><I>krasis</I></B> or
 <I>temperament</I> of the body, or anything that dies with it; but it 
 is <B><I>anthypostaton ti</I></B>--<I>something that subsists by 
 itself,</I> which, after death, is somewhere else than where the body 
 is. Where the soul of this child was in this interval we are not told; 
 it was in the hand of the <I>Father of spirits,</I> to whom all souls 
 at death return. When <I>her spirit came again</I> she arose, and made 
 it appear that she was alive by her motion, as she did also by her 
 appetite; for Christ <I>commanded to give her meat.</I> As babes newly 
 born, so those that are newly raised, desire spiritual food, that they 
 may grow <I>thereby.</I> In the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:56">last verse</A>,

 we need not wonder to find <I>her parents astonished;</I> but if that
 implies that <I>they only</I> were so, and not the other by-standers, 
 who had laughed Christ to scorn, we may well wonder at their stupidity, 
 which perhaps was the reason why Christ would not have it proclaimed, 
 as well as to give an instance of his humility.</P>
