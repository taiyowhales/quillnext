 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope and design of this chapter is to confirm our faith in Christ 
 as the eternal Son of God, and the true Messiah and Saviour of the
 world, that we may be brought to receive him, and rely upon him, as our
 Prophet, Priest, and King, and to give up ourselves to be ruled, and
 taught, and saved by him. In order to this, we have here, I. An account
 given of him by the inspired penman himself, fairly laying down, in the
 beginning, what he designed his whole book should be the proof of

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
 the Word was God.
 &nbsp; 2  The same was in the beginning with God.
 &nbsp; 3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any
 thing made that was made.
 &nbsp; 4  In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
 &nbsp; 5  And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
 comprehended it not.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Austin says (<I>de Civitate Dei,</I> lib. 10, cap. 29) that his friend
 Simplicius told him he had heard a Platonic philosopher say that these 
 first verses of St. John's gospel were <I>worthy to be written in 
 letters of gold.</I> The learned Francis Junius, in the account he 
 gives of his own life, tells how he was in his youth infected with 
 loose notions in religion, and by the grace of God was wonderfully 
 recovered by reading accidentally these verses in a bible which his 
 father had designedly laid in his way. He says that he observed such a 
 divinity in the argument, such an authority and majesty in the style, 
 that his flesh trembled, and he was struck with such amazement that for 
 a whole day he scarcely knew where he was or what he did; and thence he 
 dates the beginning of his being religious. Let us enquire what there 
 is in those strong lines. The evangelist here lays down the great truth 
 he is to prove, that Jesus Christ is God, one with the Father.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of whom he speaks--<I>The Word</I>--<B><I>ho logos</I></B>. This is an
 idiom peculiar to John's writings. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1,5:7,Re+19:13">1 John i. 1; v. 7; Rev. xix. 13</A>.

 Yet some think that Christ is meant by <I>the Word</I> in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:32,Heb+4:12,Lu+1:2">Acts xx. 32; Heb. iv. 12; Luke i. 2</A>.

 The Chaldee paraphrase very frequently calls the Messiah <I>Memra--the 
 Word of Jehovah,</I> and speaks of many things in the Old Testament, 
 said to be done by <I>the Lord,</I> as done by that <I>Word of the 
 Lord.</I> Even the vulgar Jews were taught that the <I>Word of God</I> 
 was the same with God. The evangelist, in the close of his discourse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 plainly tells us why he calls Christ <I>the Word--because he is the 
 only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and has declared 
 him. Word</I> is two-fold: <B><I>logos endiathetos</I></B>--<I>word 
 conceived;</I> and <B><I>logos prophorikos</I></B>--<I>word 
 uttered.</I> The <B><I>logos ho eso</I></B> and <B><I>ho exo</I></B>, 
 <I>ratio</I> and <I>oratio--intelligence</I> and <I>utterance.</I> 

 1. There is the <I>word conceived,</I> that is, <I>thought,</I> which
 is the first and only immediate product and conception of the soul (all 
 the operations of which are performed by <I>thought</I>), and it is one 
 with the soul. And thus the second person in the Trinity is fitly 
 called <I>the Word;</I> for he is the <I>first-begotten of the 
 Father,</I> that eternal essential Wisdom which <I>the Lord 
 possessed,</I> as the soul does its thought, <I>in the beginning of his 
 way,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:22">Prov. viii. 22</A>.

 There is nothing we are more sure of than <I>that we think,</I> yet 
 nothing we are more in the dark about than <I>how we think;</I> who can 
 declare the generation of <I>thought</I> in the soul? Surely then the 
 generations and births of the eternal mind may well be allowed to be 
 great mysteries of godliness, the bottom of which we cannot fathom, 
 while yet we adore the depth. 

 2. There is the <I>word uttered,</I> and this is <I>speech,</I> the 
 chief and most natural indication of the mind. And thus Christ is 
 <I>the Word,</I> for <I>by him</I> God has in <I>these last days spoken 
 to us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:2">Heb. i. 2</A>),

 and has directed us to <I>hear him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:5">Matt. xvii. 5</A>.

 He has made known God's mind to us, as a man's word or speech makes
 known his thoughts, as far as he pleases, and no further. Christ is 
 called that <I>wonderful speaker</I> (see notes on 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:13">Dan. viii. 13</A>),

 the <I>speaker of things hidden</I> and <I>strange.</I> He is <I>the 
 Word</I> speaking <I>from</I> God to us, and <I>to God</I> for us. John 
 Baptist was <I>the voice,</I> but Christ <I>the Word:</I> being <I>the 
 Word,</I> he is <I>the Truth,</I> the <I>Amen,</I> the <I>faithful 
 Witness</I> of the mind of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What he saith of him, enough to prove beyond contradiction that 
 <I>he is God.</I> He asserts,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His existence in the beginning: <I>In the beginning was the 
 Word.</I> This bespeaks his existence, not only before his incarnation, 
 but before all time. The beginning of time, in which all creatures were 
 produced and brought into being, found this eternal Word in being. The 
 world was <I>from</I> the beginning, but the Word was <I>in</I> the 
 beginning. Eternity is usually expressed by being <I>before the 
 foundation of the world.</I> The eternity of God is so described 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:2">Ps. xc. 2</A>),
 
 <I>Before the mountains were brought forth.</I> So 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:23">Prov. viii. 23</A>.

 The Word had a being before the world had a beginning. He that 
 <I>was</I> in the beginning <I>never</I> began, and therefore was 
 <I>ever,</I> <B><I>achronos</I></B>--<I>without beginning of time.</I>
 So Nonnus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His co-existence with the Father: <I>The Word was with God, and the 
 Word was God.</I> Let none say that when we invite them to Christ we 
 would draw them from God, for Christ is <I>with God</I> and <I>is 
 God;</I> it is repeated in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>:

 <I>the same,</I> the very same that we believe in and preach, was <I>in 
 the beginning with God,</I> that is, he was so from eternity. In the 
 beginning the world was <I>from God,</I> as it was created by him; but 
 the Word was <I>with God,</I> as ever with him. The Word was with God,

 (1.) In respect of <I>essence</I> and <I>substance;</I> for <I>the Word 
 was God:</I> a distinct person or substance, for he was <I>with 
 God;</I> and yet the same in substance, for he <I>was God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:3">Heb. i. 3</A>.

 (2.) In respect of <I>complacency</I> and <I>felicity.</I> There was a
 glory and happiness which Christ had <I>with God</I> before the world 
 was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:5"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 5</A>),

 the Son infinitely happy in the enjoyment of his Father's bosom, and no 
 less the Father's delight, the Son of his love,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>.

 (3.) In respect of <I>counsel</I> and <I>design.</I> The mystery of
 man's redemption by this Word incarnate was <I>hid in God</I> before
 all worlds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:9">Eph. iii. 9</A>.
 
 He that undertook to <I>bring us to God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:18">1 Pet. iii. 18</A>)

 was himself from eternity <I>with God;</I> so that this grand affair of
 man's reconciliation to God was concerted between the Father and Son 
 from eternity, and they understand one another perfectly well in it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:13,Mt+11:27">Zech. vi. 13; Matt. xi. 27</A>.

 He was <I>by him as one brought up with him</I> for this service,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>.

 He was <I>with God,</I> and therefore is said to <I>come forth from the
 Father.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His agency in making the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 This is here,

 (1.) Expressly asserted: <I>All things were made by him.</I> He was 
 <I>with God,</I> not only so as to be <I>acquainted</I> with the divine 
 counsels from eternity, but to be <I>active</I> in the divine 
 operations in the beginning of time. <I>Then was I by him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>.

 God made the world <I>by a word</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:6">Ps. xxxiii. 6</A>)

 and Christ was <I>the Word.</I> By him, not as a subordinate
 instrument, but as a co-ordinate agent, God <I>made the world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:2">Heb. i. 2</A>),

 not as the workman cuts by his axe, but as the body sees by the eye. 
 
 (2.) The contrary is denied: <I>Without him was not any thing made that 
 was made,</I> from the highest angel to the meanest worm. God the 
 Father did nothing without him in that work. Now, 

 [1.] This proves that <I>he is God;</I> for he that <I>built all things 
 is God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:4">Heb. iii. 4</A>.

 The God of Israel often proved himself to be God with this, that he 
 <I>made all things:</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:12,28,31:4">Isa. xl. 12, 28; xli. 4</A>;

 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:11,12">Jer. x. 11, 12</A>.

 [2.] This proves the excellency of the Christian religion, that the
 author and founder of it is the same that was the author and founder of 
 the world. How excellent must that constitution needs be which derives
 its institution from him who is the fountain of all excellency! When we 
 worship Christ, we worship him to whom the patriarchs gave honour as 
 the Creator of the world, and on whom all creatures depend. 

 [3.] This shows how well qualified he was for the work of our 
 redemption and salvation. Help was laid upon one that was mighty 
 indeed; for it was laid upon him that made all things; and he is 
 appointed the author of our bliss who was the author of our being.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The original of life and light that is in him: <I>In him was 
 life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This further proves that he is God, and every way qualified for his 
 undertaking; for,

 (1.) He has <I>life in himself;</I> not only the <I>true God,</I> but 
 the <I>living God.</I> God is life; he swears by himself when he saith, 
 <I>As I live.</I> 

 (2.) All living creatures have their life in him; not only all the 
 <I>matter</I> of the creation was <I>made</I> by him, but all the 
 <I>life</I> too that is in the creation is derived from him and 
 supported by him. It was the Word of God that produced the <I>moving 
 creatures that had life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:20,Ac+17:25">Gen. i. 20; Acts xvii. 25</A>.

 He is that Word by which man lives more than by bread, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:4">Matt. iv. 4</A>.

 (3.) Reasonable creatures have their <I>light</I> from him; that
 <I>life</I> which is <I>the light of men</I> comes from him. Life in
 man is something greater and nobler than it is in other creatures; it 
 is <I>rational,</I> and not merely <I>animal.</I> When man became a 
 <I>living soul,</I> his life was <I>light,</I> his capacities such as 
 distinguished him from, and dignified him above, the beasts that 
 perish. The <I>spirit of a man is the candle of the Lord,</I> and it 
 was the eternal Word that lighted this candle. The light of reason, as 
 well as the life of sense, is derived from him, and depends upon him. 
 This proves him fit to undertake our salvation; for life and light, 
 spiritual and eternal life and light, are the two great things that 
 fallen man, who lies so much under the power of <I>death</I> and 
 <I>darkness,</I> has need of. From whom may we better expect the light 
 of divine revelation than from him who gave us the light of human 
 reason? And if, when God gave us natural life, that life was in his 
 Son, how readily should we receive the gospel-record, that he hath 
 given us <I>eternal</I> life, and <I>that life</I> too <I>is in his 
 Son!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The manifestation of him to the children of men. It might be 
 objected, If this eternal Word was all in all thus in the creation of 
 the world, whence is it that he has been so little taken notice of and 
 regarded? To this he answers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>The light shines, but the darkness comprehends it not.</I> 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The discovery of the eternal Word to the lapsed world, even before 
 he was manifested in the flesh: <I>The light shineth in darkness.</I> 
 Light is self-evidencing, and will make itself known; this light, 
 whence the light of men comes, hath shone, and doth shine. 

 [1.] The eternal Word, <I>as God,</I> shines in <I>the darkness</I> of 
 <I>natural conscience.</I> Though men by the fall are become 
 <I>darkness,</I> yet that which may be known of God is manifested in 
 them; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:19,20">Rom. i. 19, 20</A>.

 The light of nature is this light shining in darkness. Something of the
 power of the divine Word, both as <I>creating</I> and as 
 <I>commanding,</I> all mankind have an innate sense of; were it not for 
 this, earth would be a hell, a place of <I>utter darkness;</I> blessed 
 be God, it is not so yet.

 [2.] The eternal Word, as Mediator, shone in the darkness of the 
 Old-Testament types and figures, and the prophecies and promises which 
 were of the Messiah from the beginning. He that had commanded the light 
 of this world to shine out of darkness was himself long a light 
 <I>shining in darkness;</I> there was a <I>veil</I> upon this 
 <I>light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13">2 Cor. iii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The disability of the degenerate world to receive this discovery:
 <I>The darkness comprehended it not;</I> the most of men received the 
 grace of God in these discoveries in vain. 

 [1.] The world of mankind <I>comprehended not</I> the natural light 
 that was in their understandings, but became <I>vain in their
 imaginations</I> concerning the eternal God and the eternal Word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:21,28">Rom. i. 21, 28</A>.

 The darkness of error and sin overpowered and quite eclipsed this
 light. God <I>spoke once, yea twice,</I> but <I>man perceived it 
 not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:14">Job xxxiii. 14</A>.

 [2.] The Jews, who had the light of the Old Testament, yet comprehended
 not Christ in it. As there was a veil upon Moses's face, so there was 
 upon the people's hearts. In the <I>darkness</I> of the types and 
 shadows the light shone; but such as the <I>darkness</I> of their 
 understandings that they could not <I>see</I> it. It was therefore 
 requisite that Christ should come, both to rectify the errors of the 
 Gentile world and to improve the truths of the Jewish church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1> 6  There was a man sent from God, whose name <I>was</I> John.
 &nbsp; 7  The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light,
 that all <I>men</I> through him might believe.
 &nbsp; 8  He was not that Light, but <I>was sent</I> to bear witness of that
 Light.
 &nbsp; 9  <I>That</I> was the true Light, which lighteth every man that
 cometh into the world.
 &nbsp; 10  He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the
 world knew him not.
 &nbsp; 11  He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
 &nbsp; 12  But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
 the sons of God, <I>even</I> to them that believe on his name:
 &nbsp; 13  Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
 nor of the will of man, but of God.
 &nbsp; 14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
 beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
 Father,) full of grace and truth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The evangelist designs to bring in John Baptist bearing an honourable 
 testimony to Jesus Christ, Now in these verses, before he does 
 this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gives us some account of the witness he is about to produce. His 
 name was <I>John,</I> which signifies <I>gracious;</I> his conversation 
 was austere, but he was not the less <I>gracious.</I> Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We are here told concerning him, in general, that he was a <I>man 
 sent of God.</I> The evangelist had said concerning Jesus Christ that 
 he was <I>with God</I> and that he <I>was God;</I> but here concerning 
 John that he was a <I>man,</I> a mere man. God is pleased to speak to
 us by men like ourselves. John was a <I>great man,</I> but he was a 
 man, a son of man; he was <I>sent from God,</I> he was God's 
 <I>messenger,</I> so he is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal. iii. 1</A>.

 God gave him both his mission and his message, both his credentials and
 his instructions. John wrought no miracle, nor do we find that he had
 visions and revelations; but the strictness and purity of his life and 
 doctrine, and the direct tendency of both to reform the world, and to 
 revive the interests of God's kingdom among men, were plain indications 
 that he was <I>sent of God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We are here told what his office and business were 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>The same came for a witness,</I> an eye-witness, a leading witness. 
 He came <B><I>eis martyrian</I></B>--<I>for a testimony.</I> The legal 
 institutions had been long a testimony for God in the Jewish church. By 
 them revealed religion was kept up; hence we read of the <I>tabernacle 
 of the testimony, the ark of the testimony, the law and the 
 testimony:</I> but now divine revelation is to be turned into another 
 channel; now the testimony of Christ is the testimony of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:6,2:1">1 Cor. i. 6; ii. 1</A>.

 Among the Gentiles, God indeed had not left himself without witness
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:17">Acts xiv. 17</A>),

 but the Redeemer had no testimonies borne him among them. There was a
 profound silence concerning him, till John Baptist came for a witness 
 to him. Now observe, 

 (1.) The matter of his testimony: <I>He came to bear witness to the 
 light.</I> Light is a thing which witnesses for itself, and carries its 
 own evidence along with it; but to those who shut their eyes against 
 the light it is necessary there should be those that bear witness to 
 it. Christ's light needs not man's testimony, but the world's darkness 
 does. John was like the night watchman that goes round the town, 
 proclaiming the approach of the morning light to those that have closed 
 their eyes, and are not willing themselves to observe it; or like that 
 watchman that was set to tell those who asked him what of the night 
 that <I>the morning comes,</I> and, <I>if you will enquire, enquire 
 ye,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:11,12">Isa. xxi. 11, 12</A>.

 He was sent of God to tell the world that the long-looked-for Messiah 
 was now come, who should be <I>a light to enlighten the Gentiles and 
 the glory of his people Israel;</I> and to proclaim that dispensation 
 at hand which would bring life and immortality to light.

 (2.) The design of his testimony: <I>That all men through him might
 believe;</I> not in him, but in Christ, whose way he was sent to 
 prepare. He taught men to look through him, and pass through him, to 
 Christ; through the doctrine of repentance for sin to that of faith in 
 Christ. He prepared men for the reception and entertainment of Christ 
 and his gospel, by awakening them to a sight and sense of sin; and 
 that, their eyes being thereby opened, they might be ready to admit 
 those beams of divine light which, in the person and doctrine of the 
 Messiah, were now ready to shine in their faces. If they would but 
 receive this witness of man, they would soon find that the witness of 
 God was greater,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:9">1 John v. 9</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:41"><I>ch.</I> x. 41</A>.

 Observe, it was designed that all men through him might believe,
 excluding none from the kind and beneficial influences of his ministry 
 that did not exclude themselves, as multitudes did, who rejected the 
 counsel of God against themselves, and so received the grace of God in 
 vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We are here cautioned not to mistake him for the light who only came 
 to bear witness to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>He was not that light</I> that was expected and promised, but only 
 was sent to bear witness of that great and ruling light. He was a star, 
 like that which guided the wise men to Christ, a morning star; but he 
 was not the Sun; not the Bridegroom, but a friend of the Bridegroom; 
 not the Prince, but his harbinger. There were those who rested in 
 John's baptism, and looked no further, as those Ephesians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:3">Acts xix. 3</A>.
 
 To rectify this mistake, the evangelist here, when he speaks very
 honourably of him, yet shows that he must give place to Christ. He was 
 great as the prophet of the Highest, but not the Highest himself. Note, 
 We must take heed of over-valuing ministers, as well as of 
 under-valuing them; they are not our lords, nor have they dominion over 
 our faith, but ministers by whom we believe, stewards of our Lord's 
 house. We must not give up ourselves by an implicit faith to their 
 conduct, for they are not that light; but we must attend to, and 
 receive, their testimony; for they are sent to bear witness of that 
 light; so then let us esteem them, and not otherwise. Had John
 pretended to be that light he had not been so much as a faithful 
 witness of that light. Those who usurp the honour of Christ forfeit the 
 honour of being the servants of Christ; yet John was very serviceable 
 as a witness to the light, though he was not that light. Those may be
 of great use to us who yet shine with a borrowed light.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Before he goes on with John's testimony, he returns to give us a 
 further account of this Jesus to whom John bore record. Having shown in 
 the beginning of the chapter the glories of his Godhead, he here comes 
 to show the graces of his incarnation, and his favours to man as 
 Mediator.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ was the <I>true Light</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 not as if John Baptist were a false light, but, in comparison with 
 Christ, he was a very small light. Christ is the great light that 
 deserves to be called so. Other lights are but figuratively and 
 equivocally called so: Christ is the true light. The fountain of all 
 knowledge and of all comfort must needs be the true light. He is the 
 true light, for proof of which we are not referred to the emanations of 
 his glory in the invisible world (the beams with which he enlightens 
 that), but to those rays of his light which are darted downwards, and 
 with which this dark world of ours is enlightened. But how does Christ 
 enlighten every man that comes into the world? 

 (1.) By his creating power he enlightens every man with the light of 
 reason; that life which is the light of men is from him; all the 
 discoveries and directions of reason, all the comfort it gives us, and 
 all the beauty it puts upon us, are from Christ. 

 (2.) By the publication of his gospel to all nations he does in effect 
 enlighten every man. John Baptist was a light, but he enlightened only 
 Jerusalem and Judea, and the region round about Jordan, like a candle 
 that enlightens one room; but Christ is the true light, for he is a 
 light to enlighten the Gentiles. His everlasting gospel is to be 
 preached to every nation and language, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:6">Rev. xiv. 6</A>.

 Like the sun which enlightens every man that will open his eyes, and
 receive its light

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:6">Ps. xix. 6</A>),

 to which the preaching of the gospel is compared. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:18">Rom. x. 18</A>.

 Divine revelation is not now to be confined, as it had been, to one 
 people, but to be diffused to all people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:15">Matt. v. 15</A>.

 (3.) By the operation of his Spirit and grace he enlightens all those
 that are enlightened to salvation; and those that are not enlightened 
 by him perish in darkness. <I>The light of the knowledge of the glory 
 of God</I> is said to be <I>in the face of Jesus Christ,</I> and is 
 compared with that light which was at the beginning commanded to shine 
 out of darkness, and which enlightens every man that comes into the 
 world. Whatever light any man has, he is indebted to Christ for it, 
 whether it be natural or supernatural.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ <I>was in the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He was in the world, as the essential Word, before his incarnation, 
 upholding all things; but this speaks of his being in the world when he 
 took our nature upon him, and dwelt among us; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:28"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 28</A>.

 <I>I am come into the world.</I> The Son of the Highest was here in
 this <I>lower</I> world; that <I>light</I> in this <I>dark</I> world; 
 that <I>holy thing</I> in this sinful polluted world. He left a world 
 of bliss and glory, and was here in this melancholy miserable world. He 
 undertook to reconcile the world to God, and therefore was <I>in the 
 world,</I> to treat about it, and settle that affair; to satisfy God's 
 justice for the world, and discover God's favour to the world. He was 
 in the world, but not of it, and speaks with an air of triumph when he 
 can say, <I>Now I am no more in it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:11"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 11</A>.

 The greatest honour that ever was put upon this world, which is so mean
 and inconsiderable a part of the universe, was that the Son of God was 
 once <I>in the world;</I> and, as it should engage our affections to 
 things above that there Christ is, so it should reconcile us to our 
 present abode in <I>this</I> world that once Christ was <I>here.</I> He 
 <I>was</I> in the world for awhile, but it is spoken of as a thing 
 past; and so it will be said of us shortly, We were in the world. O 
 that when we are here no more we may be where Christ is! Now observe 
 here, 

 (1.) What reason Christ had to expect the most affectionate and 
 respectful welcome possible in this world; for <I>the world was made by 
 him. Therefore</I> he came to save a lost world because it was a world 
 of his own making. Why should he not concern himself to revive the 
 light that was of his own kindling, to restore a life of his own 
 infusing, and to renew the image that was originally of his own 
 impressing? The world was <I>made by him,</I> and therefore ought to do 
 him homage. 

 (2.) What cold entertainment he met with, notwithstanding: <I>The world 
 knew him not.</I> The great Maker, Ruler, and Redeemer of the world was 
 in it, and few or none of the inhabitants of the world were aware of 
 it. The <I>ox knows his owner,</I> but the more brutish world did not. 
 They did not own him, did not bid him welcome, because they did not 
 <I>know him;</I> and they did not know him because he did not make 
 himself known in the way that they expected--in external glory and 
 majesty. His kingdom came not <I>with observation,</I> because it was 
 to be a kingdom of trail and probation. When he shall come as a Judge 
 the world shall <I>know</I> him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He <I>came to his own</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 not only to the world, which was <I>his own,</I> but to the people of 
 Israel, that were peculiarly <I>his own</I> above all people; of them 
 he came, among them he lived, and to them he was <I>first sent.</I> The 
 Jews were at this time a mean despicable people; <I>the crown was 
 fallen from their head;</I> yet, in remembrance of the ancient 
 covenant, bad as they were, and poor as they were, Christ was not 
 ashamed to look upon them as his own. <B><I>Ta idia</I></B>--his own
 <I>things;</I> not <B><I>tous idious</I></B>--his own <I>persons,</I> 
 as <I>true believers</I> are called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:1"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 1</A>.

 The Jews were <I>his,</I> as a man's house, and lands, and goods are
 <I>his,</I> which he uses and possesses; but believers are his as a 
 man's wife and children are his own, which he loves and enjoys. He came 
 to his own, to seek and save them, because they were <I>his own.</I> He 
 was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, for it was he whose 
 own the sheep were. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That the generality <I>rejected</I> him: <I>His own received him 
 not.</I> He had reason to expect that those who were his own should 
 have bidden him welcome, considering how great the <I>obligations</I> 
 were which they <I>lay under</I> to him, and how fair the 
 <I>opportunities</I> were which they had of coming to the knowledge of 
 him. They had the oracles of God, which told them beforehand 
 <I>when</I> and <I>where</I> to expect him, and of what tribe and 
 family he should arise. He came among them himself, introduced with 
 signs and wonders, and himself the greatest; and therefore it is not 
 said of them, as it was of the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 that they <I>knew him not;</I> but <I>his own,</I> though they could 
 not but know him, yet <I>received him not;</I> did not receive his 
 doctrine, did not welcome him as the Messiah, but fortified themselves 
 against him. The <I>chief priests,</I> that were in a particular manner 
 <I>his own</I> (for the Levites were God's tribe), were ring-leaders in 
 this contempt put upon him. Now this was very <I>unjust,</I> because 
 they were <I>his own,</I> and therefore he might <I>command</I> their 
 respect; and it was very <I>unkind</I> and <I>ungrateful,</I> because 
 he came to them, to seek and save them, and so to <I>court</I> their 
 respect. Note, Many who in profession are <I>Christ's own,</I> yet do 
 not <I>receive him,</I> because they will not part with their sins, nor 
 have him to <I>reign over them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That yet there was a remnant who <I>owned</I> him, and were 
 faithful to him. Though his own received him not, yet there were those 
 that <I>received</I> him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>But as many as received him. Though Israel were not gathered,</I>
 yet Christ was <I>glorious.</I> Though the body of that nation 
 persisted and perished in unbelief, yet there were many of <I>them</I> 
 that were wrought upon to submit to Christ, and many more that <I>were 
 not of that fold.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The true Christian's <I>description</I> and <I>property;</I> and 
 that is, that he <I>receives Christ,</I> and <I>believes on his 
 name;</I> the latter explains the former. Note, <I>First,</I> To be a 
 Christian indeed is to <I>believe on Christ's name;</I> it is to 
 <I>assent</I> to the gospel discovery, and <I>consent</I> to the gospel 
 proposal, concerning him. His name is <I>the Word of God; the King of 
 kings, the Lord our righteousness; Jesus a Saviour.</I> Now to 
 <I>believe</I> on his name is to <I>acknowledge</I> that he is what 
 these great names bespeak him to be, and to <I>acquiesce</I> in it, 
 that he may be so <I>to us. Secondly,</I> Believing in Christ's name is 
 <I>receiving</I> him as a gift from God. We must receive his doctrine 
 as true and good; receive his law as just and holy; receive his offers 
 as kind and advantageous; and we must receive the image of his grace, 
 and impressions of his love, as the governing principle of our 
 affections and actions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The true Christian's dignity and privilege are twofold:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The <I>privilege of adoption,</I> which takes them into 
 the number of God's children: <I>To them gave he power to become the 
 sons of God.</I> Hitherto, the adoption pertained to the Jews only 
 (<I>Israel is my son, my first-born</I>); but now, by faith in Christ, 
 Gentiles are the <I>children of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:26">Gal. iii. 26</A>.

 They have <I>power,</I> <B><I>exousian</I></B>--<I>authority;</I> for 
 no man taketh this power to himself, but he who is <I>authorized</I> by 
 the gospel charter. To them gave he a <I>right;</I> to them gave he 
 this pre-eminence. <I>This power have all the saints.</I> Note, 

 1. It is the unspeakable privilege of all good Christians, that they
 are become the <I>children of God.</I> They were by nature children of 
 wrath, children of this world. If they be the <I>children of God,</I> 
 they <I>become</I> so, are <I>made</I> so <I>Fiunt, non nascuntur 
 Christiani--Persons are not born Christians, but made 
 such.</I>--Tertullian. <I>Behold what manner of love is this,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:1">1 John iii. 1</A>.

 God calls them <I>his children,</I> they call him <I>Father,</I> and 
 are entitled to all the privileges of children, those of their way and 
 those of their home.

 2. The privilege of adoption is entirely owing to <I>Jesus Christ;</I>
 he <I>gave</I> this power to them that believe on his name. God is his 
 Father, and so ours; and it is by virtue of our espousals to him, and 
 union with him, that we stand related to God as a Father. It was in 
 Christ that we were <I>predestinated to the adoption;</I> from him we 
 receive both the character and the Spirit of adoption, and he is the 
 <I>first-born among many brethren.</I> The Son of God became a Son of 
 man, that the sons and daughters of men might become the sons and 
 daughters of God Almighty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The <I>privilege of regeneration</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Which were born.</I> Note, All the children of God are born again; 
 all that are adopted are regenerated. This <I>real</I> change evermore 
 attends that <I>relative</I> one. Wherever God confers the dignity of 
 children, he creates the nature and disposition of children. Men cannot 
 do so when they adopt. Now here we have an account of the original of 
 this new birth. 
 
 1. Negatively.

 (1.) It is not <I>propagated</I> by natural generation from our
 parents. It is <I>not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,</I> nor 
 of <I>corruptible seed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:23">1 Pet. i. 23</A>.

 Man is called <I>flesh and blood,</I> because thence he has his 
 original: but we do not become the children of God as we become the 
 children of our natural parents. Note, Grace does not run in the blood, 
 as corruption does. Man polluted <I>begat a son in his own likeness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:3">Gen. v. 3</A>);

 but man sanctified and renewed does not beget a son in <I>that</I>
 likeness. The Jews gloried much in their parentage, and the noble blood 
 that ran in their veins: <I>We are Abraham's seed;</I> and 
 <I>therefore</I> to them <I>pertained the adoption</I> because they 
 were born of that blood; but this New-Testament adoption is not founded 
 in any such natural relation. 

 (2.) It is not <I>produced</I> by the natural power of our own will. As 
 it is not of <I>blood,</I> nor of <I>the will of the flesh,</I> so 
 neither is it of the <I>will of man,</I> which labours under a moral 
 impotency of determining itself to that which is good; so that the 
 principles of the divine life are not of our own planting, it is the 
 grace of God that makes us willing to be <I>his.</I> Nor can human laws 
 or writings prevail to sanctify and regenerate a soul; if they could, 
 the new birth would be by the will of man. But, 

 2. Positively: it is of <I>God.</I> This new birth is owing to the
 word of God as the means

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:23">1 Pet. i. 23</A>),

 and to the Spirit of God as the great and sole author. True believers
 are <I>born of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:9,5:1">1 John iii. 9; v. 1</A>.

 And this is necessary to their adoption; for we cannot expect the
 <I>love of God</I> if we have not something of his <I>likeness,</I> nor 
 claim the privileges of adoption if we be not under the power of 
 regeneration.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The <I>word was made flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This expresses Christ's incarnation more clearly than what went before. 
 By his divine presence he always <I>was in the world,</I> and by his 
 prophets he <I>came to his own.</I> But now that the fulness of time 
 was come he was sent forth after another manner, <I>made of a woman</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:4">Gal. iv. 4</A>);

 God manifested in the flesh, according to the faith and hope of holy 
 Job; <I>Yet shall I see God in my flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:26">Job xix. 26</A>.

 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>human nature of Christ</I> with which he was veiled; and
 that expressed two ways.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>The word was made flesh. Forasmuch as the children,</I> who 
 were to become the sons of God, <I>were partakers of flesh and blood, 
 he also himself likewise took part of the same,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14">Heb. ii. 14</A>.

 The Socinians agree that Christ is both God and man, but they say that
 he <I>was man,</I> and was <I>made a God,</I> as Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+7:1">Exod. vii. 1</A>),

 directly contrary to John here, who saith, <B><I>Theos 
 en</I></B>--<I>He was God,</I> but <B><I>sarxegeneto</I></B>--<I>He was 
 made flesh.</I> Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>

 with this. This intimates not only that he was really and truly man, 
 but that he subjected himself to the miseries and calamities of the 
 human nature. He was made <I>flesh,</I> the meanest part of man. Flesh
 bespeaks man <I>weak,</I> and he was crucified through <I>weakness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:4">2 Cor. xiii. 4</A>.

 <I>Flesh</I> bespeaks man <I>mortal</I> and <I>dying</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:39">Ps. lxxviii. 39</A>),

 and Christ was <I>put to death in the flesh</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:18">1 Pet. iii. 18</A>.

 Nay, <I>flesh</I> bespeaks <I>man tainted with sin</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:3">Gen. vi. 3</A>),

 and Christ, though he was perfectly holy and harmless, yet appeared 
 <I>in the likeness of sinful flesh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Rom. viii. 3</A>),

 and was made <I>sin for us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:21">2 Cor. v. 21</A>.

 When Adam had sinned, God said to him, <I>Dust thou art;</I> not only 
 because made out of the dust, but because by sin he was sunk into dust. 
 His fall did, <B><I>somatoun ten psychen</I></B>, <I>turn him</I> as it 
 were <I>all into body,</I> made him earthly; therefore he that was made 
 a curse for us was made <I>flesh,</I> and <I>condemned sin in the 
 flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Rom. viii. 3</A>.

 Wonder at this, that the eternal Word should be made flesh, when flesh
 was come into such an ill name; that he who made <I>all things</I> 
 should himself be made flesh, one of the meanest things, and submit to 
 that from which he was at the greatest distance. The voice that
 ushered in the gospel cried, <I>All flesh is grass</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:6">Isa. xl. 6</A>),

 to make the Redeemer's love the more wonderful, who, to <I>redeem</I> 
 and <I>save</I> us, was made flesh, and withered as grass; but the 
 <I>Word of the Lord,</I> who was made flesh, <I>endures for ever;</I> 
 when made flesh, he ceased not to be the Word of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He <I>dwelt among us,</I> here in this lower world. Having taken 
 upon him the nature of man, he put himself into the place and condition 
 of other men. The Word might have been made flesh, and dwelt among the 
 angels; but, having taken a <I>body</I> of the same mould with ours, in 
 it he came, and resided in the same world with us. He <I>dwelt among 
 us,</I> us worms of the earth, us that he had no need of, us that he 
 got nothing by, us that were <I>corrupt</I> and <I>depraved,</I> and 
 revolted from God. The Lord God came and dwelt even <I>among the 
 rebellious,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:18">Ps. lxviii. 18</A>.

 He that had dwelt among angels, those noble and excellent beings, came
 and dwelt <I>among us</I> that are a <I>generation of vipers,</I> us 
 <I>sinners,</I> which was worse to him than David's swelling in Mesech 
 and Kedar, or Ezekiel's dwelling <I>among scorpions,</I> or the church 
 of Pergamus dwelling <I>where Satan's seat is.</I> When we look upon 
 the upper world, the world of spirits, how mean and contemptible does 
 this flesh, this body, appear, which we carry about with us, and this 
 world in which our lot is cast, and how hard is it to a contemplative 
 mind to be reconciled to them! But that the eternal Word was <I>made
 flesh,</I> was clothed with a body as we are, and dwelt in this world 
 as we do, this has put an honour upon them both, and should make us 
 willing to abide in the flesh while God has any work for us to do; for 
 Christ dwelt in this lower world, bad as it is, till he had finished 
 what he had to do here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:4"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 4</A>.

 He dwelt <I>among</I> the Jews, that the scripture might be fulfilled,
 <I>He shall dwell in the tents of Shem,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:27">Gen. ix. 27</A>.
 
 And see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:10">Zech. ii. 10</A>.

 Though the Jews were unkind to him, yet he continued to dwell among
 them; though (as some of the ancient writers tell us) he was invited to 
 better treatment by Abgarus king of Edessa, yet he removed not to any 
 other nation. He <I>dwelt</I> among us. He was in the world, not as a 
 wayfaring man that tarries but for a night, but he <I>dwelt</I> among 
 us, made a long residence, the original word is observable, 
 <B><I>eskenosen en hemin</I></B>--<I>he dwelt among us,</I> he dwelt 
 <I>as in a tabernacle,</I> which intimates, <I>First,</I> That he dwelt 
 here in very <I>mean</I> circumstances, as shepherds that dwell in 
 tents. He did not dwell among us <I>as in a palace,</I> but as in a 
 <I>tent;</I> for he had not where to lay his head, and was always upon 
 the remove. <I>Secondly,</I> That his state here was a <I>military</I> 
 state. Soldiers <I>dwell in tents;</I> he had long since proclaimed war 
 with the <I>seed of the serpent,</I> and now he takes <I>the field</I> 
 in person, sets up his standard, and pitches his tent, to prosecute 
 this war. <I>Thirdly,</I> That his stay among us was not to be 
 perpetual. He dwelt here as <I>in a tent,</I> not as at <I>home.</I> 
 The patriarchs, by dwelling in tabernacles, <I>confessed that they were 
 strangers and pilgrims on earth,</I> and sought the better country, and 
 so did Christ, leaving us an example, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:13,14">Heb. xiii. 13, 14</A>.

 <I>Fourthly,</I> That as of old God dwelt in the tabernacle of Moses,
 by the shechinah between the cherubim, so now he dwells in the human 
 nature of Christ; that is now the true shechinah, the symbol of God's 
 peculiar presence. And we are to make all our addresses to God through
 Christ, and from him to receive divine oracles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>beams of his divine glory</I> that <I>darted</I> through 
 this <I>veil of flesh: We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only 
 begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</I> The sun is still 
 the fountain of light, though eclipsed or clouded; so Christ was still 
 the brightness of his Father's glory, even when he <I>dwelt among 
 us</I> in this lower world. And how slightly soever the Jews thought of 
 him there were those that saw through the veil. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Who were the witnesses of this glory: <I>we,</I> his disciples and 
 followers, that conversed most freely and familiarly with him; we among 
 whom he <I>dwelt.</I> Other men discover their weaknesses to those that 
 are most familiar with them, but it was not so with Christ; those that 
 were most intimate with him saw most of his glory. As it was with his 
 <I>doctrine,</I> the disciples knew the mysteries of it, while others 
 had it <I>under the veil of parables;</I> so it was with his 
 <I>person,</I> they saw the glory of his divinity, while others saw 
 only the veil of his human nature. He manifested himself <I>to them, 
 and not unto the world.</I> These witnesses were a competent number, 
 twelve of them, a whole jury of witnesses; men of plainness and 
 integrity, and far from any thing of design or intrigue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What evidence they had of it: <I>We saw it.</I> They had not their 
 evidence by report, at second hand, but were themselves eye-witnesses 
 of those proofs on which they built their testimony that he was the 
 <I>Son of the living God: We saw it.</I> The word signifies a fixed 
 abiding sight, such as gave them an opportunity of making their 
 observations. This apostle himself explains this: <I>What we declare 
 unto you</I> of the Word of life is what we have <I>seen with our 
 eyes,</I> and what <I>we have looked upon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1">1 John i. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] What the glory was: <I>The glory as of the only begotten of the 
 Father.</I> The glory of the <I>Word made flesh</I> was such a glory as 
 became the only <I>begotten Son of God,</I> and could not be the glory 
 of any other. Note, <I>First,</I> Jesus Christ is the only begotten of 
 the Father. Believers are the children of God by the special favour of 
 adoption and the special grace of regeneration. They are in a sense 
 <B><I>homoiousioi</I></B>--<I>of a like nature</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:4">2 Pet. i. 4</A>),

 and have the image of his perfections; but Christ is 
 <B><I>homousios</I></B>--<I>of the same nature,</I> and is the express 
 image of his person, and the Son of God by an eternal generation.
 Angels are sons of God, but he never said to any of them, <I>This day 
 have I begotten thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:5">Heb. i. 5</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> He was evidently declared to be the only begotten of
 the Father, by that which was seen of his glory when he dwelt among us. 
 Though he was in the <I>form of a servant,</I> in respect of outward 
 circumstances, yet, in respect of graces, his form was as that of the 
 <I>fourth</I> in the fiery furnace, <I>like the Son of God.</I> His 
 divine glory appeared in the holiness and heavenliness of his doctrine; 
 in his miracles, which extorted from many this acknowledgment, that he 
 was the <I>Son of God;</I> it appeared in the purity, goodness, and 
 beneficence, of his whole conversation. God's goodness is his glory, 
 and he went about doing good; he spoke and acted in every thing as an 
 incarnate Deity. Perhaps the evangelist had a particular regard to the 
 glory of his <I>transfiguration,</I> of which he was an eye-witness; 
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:16-18">2 Pet. i. 16-18</A>.

 God's calling him his <I>beloved Son, in whom he was well pleased,</I>
 intimated that he was the <I>only begotten of the Father;</I> but the 
 full proof of this was at his resurrection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] What advantage those he dwelt among had from this. He dwelt among 
 them, <I>full of grace and truth.</I> In the old tabernacle wherein God 
 dwelt was the <I>law,</I> in <I>this</I> was grace; in that were 
 <I>types,</I> in this was <I>truth.</I> The incarnate Word was every 
 way qualified for his undertaking as Mediator; for he was <I>full of 
 grace and truth,</I> the two great things that fallen man stands in 
 need of; and this proved him to be the <I>Son of God</I> as much as the 
 divine power and majesty that appeared in him. <I>First,</I> He has a 
 fulness of grace and truth <I>for himself;</I> he had the Spirit 
 without measure. He was full <I>of grace,</I> fully acceptable to his 
 Father, and therefore qualified to intercede for us; and full <I>of 
 truth,</I> fully apprized of the things he was to reveal, and therefore 
 fit to instruct us. He had a fulness of knowledge and a fulness of 
 compassion. <I>Secondly,</I> He has a fulness of grace and truth <I>for 
 us.</I> He <I>received,</I> that he might <I>give,</I> and God was well 
 pleased in him, that he might be well pleased with us in him; and this 
 was the <I>truth</I> of the legal <I>types.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The evangelist begins again to give us John Baptist's testimony 
 concerning Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 He had said
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 that he <I>came for a witness;</I> now here he tells us that he did 
 accordingly <I>bear witness.</I> Here, Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>How he expressed</I> his testimony: He <I>cried,</I> according to 
 the prediction that he should be <I>the voice of one crying.</I> The 
 Old-Testament prophets cried aloud, to show people their <I>sins;</I> 
 this New-Testament prophet cried aloud, to show people their 
 <I>Saviour.</I> This intimates, 

 (1.) That it was an open <I>public</I> testimony, proclaimed, that all 
 manner of persons might take notice of it, for all are concerned in it. 
 False teachers <I>entice secretly,</I> but wisdom publishes her 
 dictates in the chief places of concourse.

 (2.) That he was free and hearty in bearing this testimony. He 
 <I>cried</I> as one that was both <I>well assured</I> of the truth to 
 which he witnessed and <I>well affected</I> to it. He that had leaped 
 in his <I>mother's womb for joy</I> of Christ's approach, when newly 
 conceived, does now with a like exultation of spirit <I>welcome</I> his 
 public appearance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What his <I>testimony</I> was. He appeals to what he had said at the 
 beginning of his ministry, when he had directed them to expect one that 
 should <I>come after him,</I> whose forerunner he was, and never 
 intended any other than to lead them to him, and to prepare his way. 
 This he had given them notice of from the first. Note, It is very 
 comfortable to a minister to have the testimony of his conscience for 
 him that he set out in his ministry with honest principles and sincere 
 intentions, with a single eye to the glory and honour of Christ. Now 
 what he had then said he applies to this Jesus whom he had lately 
 baptized, and who was so remarkably owned from heaven: <I>This was he 
 of whom I spoke.</I> John did not tell them that there would shortly 
 appear such a one among them, and then leave them to find him out; but 
 in <I>this</I> he went beyond all the Old-Testament prophets that he 
 particularly specified the person: "<I>This was he,</I> the very man I 
 told you of, and to him all I said is to be accommodated." Now what was 
 it he said?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He had given the preference to this Jesus: <I>He that comes after 
 me,</I> in the time of his birth and public appearance, is preferred 
 before me; he that <I>succeeds</I> me in preaching and making disciples 
 is a more excellent person, upon all accounts; as the prince or peer 
 that <I>comes after</I> is preferred before the harbinger or 
 gentleman-usher that makes way for him. Note, Jesus Christ, who was to 
 be called the <I>Son of the Highest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32">Luke i. 32</A>),

 was preferred before John Baptist, who was to be called only the 
 <I>prophet of the Highest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:76">Luke i. 76</A>.

 John was a minister of the New Testament, but Christ was the Mediator 
 of the New Testament. And observe, though John was a great man, and had 
 a great name and interest, yet he was forward to give the preference to 
 him to whom it belonged. Note, All the ministers of Christ must prefer 
 him and his interest before themselves and their own interests; they 
 will make an ill account <I>that seek their own things, not the things 
 of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:21">Phil. ii. 21</A>.

 He comes <I>after me,</I> and yet is <I>preferred before me.</I> Note,
 God dispenses his gifts according to his good pleasure, and many times 
 crosses hands, as Jacob did, preferring the <I>younger</I> before the 
 <I>elder.</I> Paul far outstripped those that were in Christ before 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He here gives a good reason for it: <I>For he was before me,</I> 
 <B><I>protos mou en</I></B>--<I>He was my first,</I> or <I>first to
 me;</I> he was my first Cause, my original. The <I>First</I> is one of 
 <I>God's names,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:6">Isa. xliv. 6</A>.

 He is <I>before me,</I> is <I>my first,</I>

 [1.] In respect of <I>seniority:</I> he was <I>before me,</I> for he
 was before Abraham,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:58"><I>ch.</I> viii. 58</A>.

 Nay, he was <I>before all things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:17">Col. i. 17</A>.

 I am but of yesterday, he from eternity. It was but in <I>those
 days</I> that John Baptist came 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:1">Matt. iii. 1</A>),

 but the goings forth of our Lord Jesus <I>were of old, from 
 everlasting,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:2">Mic. v. 2</A>.

 This proves two natures in Christ. Christ, as man, <I>came after</I>
 John as to his public appearance; Christ, as God, was <I>before 
 him;</I> and how could he otherwise be before him but by an eternal 
 existence? 

 [2.] In respect of supremacy; for he was <I>my prince;</I> so some 
 princes are called the <I>first;</I> <B><I>proton</I></B>, "It is he 
 for whose sake and service I am sent: he is my Master, I am his 
 minister and messenger."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He presently returns again to speak of Jesus Christ, and cannot go 
 on with John Baptist's testimony till 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 The
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16">16th verse</A>

 has a manifest connection with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 where the incarnate Word was said to be <I>full of grace and truth.</I> 
 Now here he makes this the matter, not only of our adoration, but of 
 our thankfulness, because <I>from that fulness</I> of his <I>we all 
 have received. He received gifts for men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:18">Ps. lxviii. 18</A>),
 
 that he might <I>give gifts to men,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8">Eph. iv. 8</A>.
 
 He was filled, that he might <I>fill all in all</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:23">Eph. i. 23</A>),
 
 might <I>fill our treasures,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:21">Prov. viii. 21</A>.

 He has a fountain of fulness overflowing: <I>We all have received. All 
 we</I> apostles; so some. We have received the favour of this 
 apostleship, that is <I>grace;</I> and a fitness for it, that is 
 <I>truth.</I> Or, rather, <I>All we</I> believers; as many as received 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 received from him. Note, All true believers receive from Christ's 
 fulness; the best and greatest saints cannot live without him, the 
 meanest and weakest may live by him. This excludes proud boasting, that 
 we have nothing but <I>we have received it;</I> and silences perplexing 
 fears, that we want nothing but <I>we may receive it.</I> Let us see 
 what it is that we have received.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We have received <I>grace for grace.</I> Our receivings by Christ 
 are all summed up in this one word, <I>grace;</I> we have received 
 <B><I>kai charin</I></B>--<I>even grace,</I> so great a gift, so rich,
 so invaluable; we have received <I>no less</I> than grace; this is a 
 gift to be spoken of with an emphasis. It is repeated, <I>grace for 
 grace;</I> for to every stone in this building, as well as <I>to the 
 top-stone,</I> we must cry, <I>Grace, grace.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The blessing received. It is <I>grace;</I> the good will of God 
 towards us, and the good work of God in us. God's good will works the 
 good work, and then the good work qualifies us for further tokens of 
 his good will. As the cistern receives water from the fulness of the 
 fountain, the branches sap from the fulness of the root, and the air 
 light from the fulness of the sun, so we receive grace from the fulness 
 of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The manner of its reception: <I>Grace for grace</I>--<B><I>charin 
 anti charitos</I></B>. The phrase is singular, and interpreters put
 different senses upon it, each of which will be of use to illustrate 
 the unsearchable riches of the grace of Christ. <I>Grace for grace</I> 
 bespeaks, 

 [1.] The <I>freeness</I> of this grace. It is grace for grace' sake; so 
 <I>Grotius.</I> We receive grace, not for <I>our sakes</I> (be it known 
 to us), but even so, Father, <I>because it seemed good in thy 
 sight.</I> It is a <I>gift according to grace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:6">Rom. xii. 6</A>.

 It is grace <I>to us</I> for the sake of grace to Jesus Christ. God was
 well pleased in him, and is therefore well pleased with us in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:6">Eph. i. 6</A>.

 [2.] The <I>fulness</I> of this grace. <I>Grace for grace</I> is
 abundance of grace, grace upon grace (so <I>Camero</I>), one grace
 heaped upon another; as <I>skin for skin</I> is skin after skin, even 
 all that a man has, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:4">Job ii. 4</A>.

 It is a blessing poured out, that there shall not be room to receive 
 it, <I>plenteous redemption:</I> one grace a pledge of more grace. 
 <I>Joseph-He will add.</I> It is such a fulness as is called <I>the 
 fulness of God</I> which we are filled with. We are not straitened in 
 the grace of Christ, if we be not straitened in our own bosoms.

 [3.] The <I>serviceableness</I> of this grace. <I>Grace for grace</I>
 is grace for the promoting and advancing of grace. Grace to be 
 <I>exercised</I> by ourselves; gracious habits for gracious acts.
 Grace to be <I>ministered</I> to others; gracious vouchsafements for 
 gracious performances: grace is a talent to be traded with. The 
 apostles received grace

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:5,Eph+3:8">Rom. i. 5; Eph. iii. 8</A>),

 that they might communicate it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:10">1 Pet. iv. 10</A>.

 [4.] The <I>substitution</I> of New-Testament grace <I>in the room and 
 stead</I> of Old-Testament grace: so <I>Beza.</I> And this sense is 
 confirmed by what follows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 for the Old Testament had grace in type, the New Testament has grace in 
 truth. There was a grace under the Old Testament, the gospel was 
 preached then 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:8">Gal. iii. 8</A>);

 but that grace is superseded, and we have gospel grace instead of it, a 
 <I>glory which excelleth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:10">2 Cor. iii. 10</A>.

 Discoveries of grace are now more clear, distributions of grace far 
 more plentiful; this is grace instead of grace.

 [5.] It bespeaks the <I>augmentation</I> and <I>continuance of grace. 
 Grace for grace</I> is one grace to improve, confirm, and perfect 
 another grace. We are changed into the divine image, <I>from glory to 
 glory,</I> from one degree of glorious grace to another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>.

 Those that have <I>true</I> grace have that for <I>more grace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:6">Jam. iv. 6</A>.

 When God gives grace he saith, Take this <I>in part;</I> for he who 
 hath promised will perform.

 [6.] It bespeaks the <I>agreeableness</I> and <I>conformity</I> of
 grace in the saints to the grace that is in Jesus Christ; so Mr. 
 <I>Clark. Grace for grace</I> is grace in us answering to grace in him, 
 as the impression upon the wax answers the seal line for line. The 
 grace we receive from Christ <I>changes us into the same image</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>),
 
 the <I>image of the Son</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:29">Rom. viii. 29</A>),

 the <I>image of the heavenly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:49">1 Cor. xv. 49</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We have received <I>grace and truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 He had said
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)
 
 that Christ was <I>full of grace and truth;</I> now here he says that 
 by him <I>grace and truth</I> came to us. From Christ we <I>receive 
 grace;</I> this is a string he delights to harp upon, he cannot go off 
 from it. Two things he further observes in this verse concerning this 
 grace:--

 (1.) Its <I>preference</I> above the law of Moses: <I>The law was given 
 by Moses,</I> and it was a glorious discovery, both of God's <I>will 
 concerning</I> man and his <I>good will to</I> man; but the gospel of 
 Christ is a much clearer discovery both of duty and happiness. That 
 which was given by Moses was purely terrifying and threatening, and 
 bound with penalties, a law which could not <I>give life, which was</I> 
 given with abundance of terror 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18">Heb. xii. 18</A>);

 but that which is given by Jesus Christ is of another nature; it has 
 all the beneficial uses of the law, but not the terror, for it is 
 <I>grace:</I> grace <I>teaching</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:11">Tit. ii. 11</A>),
 
 grace <I>reigning,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:21">Rom. v. 21</A>.

 It is a law, but a remedial law. The endearments of love are the genius 
 of the gospel, not the affrightments of law and the curse.

 (2.) Its <I>connection</I> with truth: <I>grace and truth.</I> In the 
 gospel we have the discovery of the greatest <I>truths</I> to be 
 embraced by the understanding, as well as of the richest <I>grace</I> 
 to be embraced by the will and affections. It is a <I>faithful 
 saying,</I> and <I>worthy of all acceptation;</I> that is, it is 
 <I>grace and truth.</I> The offers of <I>grace</I> are <I>sincere,</I> 
 and what we may venture our souls upon; they are made <I>in 
 earnest,</I> for it is <I>grace and truth.</I> It is <I>grace and 
 truth</I> with reference to the <I>law</I> that was <I>given by 
 Moses.</I> For it is, 

 [1.] The performance of all the Old-Testament promises. In the Old 
 Testament we often find <I>mercy</I> and <I>truth</I> put together, 
 that is, mercy according to promise; so here <I>grace and truth</I> 
 denote grace according to promise. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:72,1Ki+8:56">Luke i. 72; 1 Kings viii. 56</A>.

 [2.] It is the substance of all the Old-Testament types and shadows. 
 Something of grace there was both in the ordinances that were 
 instituted for Israel and the providences that occurred concerning 
 Israel; but they were only shadows of good things to come, even of the 
 grace that is to be <I>brought to us by the revelation of Jesus 
 Christ.</I> He is the <I>true</I> paschal lamb, the <I>true</I> 
 scape-goat, the true <I>manna.</I> They had grace in the picture; we 
 have grace in the person, that is, <I>grace and truth. Grace and truth 
 came,</I> <B><I>egeneto</I></B>--<I>was made;</I> the same word that 
 was used

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 concerning Christ's <I>making all things.</I> The law was only <I>made
 known</I> by Moses, but the <I>being</I> of this grace and truth, as 
 well as the discovery of them, is owing to Jesus Christ; this was 
 <I>made</I> by him, as the world at first was; and by him this <I>grace 
 and truth</I> do <I>consist.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Another thing we receive from Christ is a clear revelation of God to 
 us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 He hath <I>declared</I> God to us, whom <I>no man hath seen at any 
 time.</I> This was the grace and truth which came by Christ, the 
 knowledge of God and an acquaintance with him. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The insufficiency of all other discoveries: <I>No man hath seen 
 God at any time.</I> This intimates, 

 [1.] That the nature of God being <I>spiritual,</I> he is invisible to 
 bodily eyes, he is a being <I>whom no man hath seen, nor can see,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:16">1 Tim. vi. 16</A>.

 We have therefore need to <I>live by faith,</I> by which we <I>see him 
 that is invisible,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:27">Heb. xi. 27</A>.

 [2.] That the revelation which God made of himself in the Old Testament
 was very short and imperfect, in comparison with that which he has made 
 by Christ: <I>No man hath seen God at any time;</I> that is, what was 
 seen and known of God before the incarnation of Christ was nothing to 
 that which is now seen and known; life and immortality are now brought 
 to a much clearer light than they were then. 

 [3.] That none of the Old-Testament prophets were so well qualified to 
 make known the mind and will of God to the children of men as our Lord 
 Jesus was, for none of them had <I>seen God at any time. Moses beheld
 the similitude of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:8">Num. xii. 8</A>),

 but was told that he could not <I>see his face,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:20">Exod. xxxiii. 20</A>.

 But <I>this</I> recommends Christ's holy religion to us that it was
 founded by one that had seen God, and knew more of his mind than any 
 one else ever did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The all-sufficiency of the gospel discovery proved from its 
 author: <I>The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he 
 has declared him.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] How <I>fit</I> he was to make this discovery, and every way 
 qualified for it. He and he alone was <I>worthy to take the book, and 
 to open the seals,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:9">Rev. v. 9</A>.

 For, <I>First,</I> He is <I>the only-begotten Son;</I> and who so 
 likely to know the Father as the Son? or in whom is the Father better
 known than in the Son? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Matt. xi. 27</A>.

 He is of the same nature with the Father, so that he who hath <I>seen
 him</I> hath seen <I>the Father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:9"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 9</A>.

 The servant is not supposed to know so well <I>what his Lord does</I>
 as the Son,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:15"><I>ch.</I> xv. 15</A>.

 Moses was <I>faithful as a servant,</I> but Christ <I>as a Son.
 Secondly,</I> He is <I>in the bosom of the Father.</I> He had lain in 
 his bosom from eternity. When he was here upon earth, yet still, as 
 God, he was in the bosom of the Father, and thither he returned when he 
 <I>ascended. In the bosom of the Father;</I> that is, 

 1. In the bosom of his <I>special love,</I> dear to him, in <I>whom he
 was well pleased,</I> always his delight. All God's saints are <I>in 
 his hand,</I> but his Son was <I>in his bosom,</I> one in nature and 
 essence, and therefore in the highest degree one <I>in love.</I> 

 2. In the bosom of his <I>secret counsels.</I> As there was a mutual 
 <I>complacency,</I> so there was a mutual <I>consciousness,</I> between 
 the Father and Son

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Matt. xi. 27</A>);

 none so fit as he to make known God, for none knew his mind as he did.
 Our most secret counsels we are said to hide <I>in our bosom (in 
 pectore</I>); Christ was privy to the <I>bosom-counsels</I> of the 
 Father. The prophets <I>sat down at his feet</I> as scholars; Christ 
 lay in his bosom as a friend. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:11">Eph. iii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] How <I>free</I> he was in making this discovery: <I>He hath 
 declared. Him</I> is not in the original. He has declared that of God 
 which no man had at any time seen or known; not only that which was hid 
 <I>of God,</I> but that which was hid <I>in</I> God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:9">Eph. iii. 9</A>),
 
 <B><I>exegesato</I></B>--it signifies a plain, clear, and full
 discovery, not by general and doubtful hints, but by particular 
 explications. He that runs may now read the will of God and the way of 
 salvation. This is the <I>grace,</I> this the <I>truth,</I> that came
 by Jesus Christ.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests
 and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?
 &nbsp; 20  And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not
 the Christ.
 &nbsp; 21  And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith,
 I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.
 &nbsp; 22  Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an
 answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
 &nbsp; 23  He said, I <I>am</I> the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
 Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.
 &nbsp; 24  And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
 &nbsp; 25  And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou
 then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that
 prophet?
 &nbsp; 26  John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there
 standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
 &nbsp; 27  He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose
 shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
 &nbsp; 28  These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where
 John was baptizing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the testimony of John, which he delivered to the 
 messengers who were sent from Jerusalem to examine him. Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who they were that sent to him, and who they were that were sent. 

 1. They that sent to him were <I>the Jews at Jerusalem,</I> the great
 sanhedrim or high-commission court, which sat at Jerusalem, and was the 
 representative of the Jewish church, who took cognizance of all matters 
 relating to religion. One would think that they who were the fountains 
 of learning, and the guides of the church, should have, by books, 
 understood the times so well as to know that the Messiah was at hand, 
 and therefore should presently have known him that was his forerunner, 
 and readily embraced him; but, instead of this, they sent messengers to 
 <I>cross questions</I> with him. Secular learning, honour, and power, 
 seldom dispose men's minds to the reception of divine light.

 2. They that were sent were,

 (1.) <I>Priests and Levites,</I> probably members of the council, men
 of learning, gravity, and authority. John Baptist was himself a priest 
 of the seed of Aaron, and therefore it was not fit that he should be 
 examined by any but priests. It was prophesied concerning John's 
 ministry that it should <I>purify the Sons of Levi</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:3">Mal. iii. 3</A>),

 and therefore they were jealous of him and his reformation. 

 (2.) They were <I>of the Pharisees,</I> proud, self-justiciaries, that 
 thought they needed no repentance, and therefore could not bear one 
 that made it his business to preach repentance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. On what errand they were sent; it was to enquire concerning John 
 and <I>his baptism.</I> They did not send for John to them, probably 
 because they <I>feared the people,</I> lest the people where John was 
 should be provoked to rise, or lest the people where they were should 
 be brought acquainted with him; they thought it was good to keep him at 
 a distance. They enquire concerning him, 

 1. To satisfy their curiosity; as the Athenians enquired concerning
 Paul's doctrine, for the novelty of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:19,20">Acts xvii. 19, 20</A>.

 Such a proud conceit they had of themselves that the doctrine of
 repentance was to them strange doctrine. 

 2. It was to show their authority. They thought they <I>looked
 great</I> when they called him to account whom all men counted as a
 prophet, and arraigned him at their bar. 

 3. It was with a design to <I>suppress</I> him and silence him if they
 could find any colour for it; for they were jealous of his growing 
 interest, and his ministry agreed neither with the Mosaic dispensation 
 which they had been long under, nor with the notions they had formed of 
 the Messiah's kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What was the answer he gave them, and his account, both concerning 
 himself and concerning his baptism, in both which he witnessed to 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning himself, and what he professed himself to be. They asked 
 him, <B><I>Sy tis ei</I></B>--<I>Thou, who art thou?</I> John's
 appearing in the world was surprising. He was in the wilderness till 
 the day of his showing unto Israel. His spirit, his converse, he 
 doctrine, had something in them which commanded and gained respect; but 
 he did not, as seducers do, give out himself to be <I>some great 
 one.</I> He was more industrious to <I>do good</I> than to <I>appear 
 great;</I> and therefore waived saying any thing of himself till he was 
 legally interrogated. Those speak best for Christ that say least of 
 themselves, whose <I>own works</I> praise them, not <I>their own 
 lips.</I> He answers their interrogatory,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Negatively.</I> He was not that great one whom some took him to 
 be. God's faithful witnesses stand more upon their guard <I>against 
 undue respect</I> than against <I>unjust contempt.</I> Paul writes as 
 warmly against those that overvalued him, and said, <I>I am of 
 Paul,</I> as against those that undervalued him, and said that his 
 bodily presence was weak; and he rent his clothes when he was called a 
 god. 
 
 [1.] John disowns himself to be <I>the Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>He said, I am not the Christ,</I> who was now expected and waited 
 for. Note, The ministers of Christ must remember that <I>they are not
 Christ,</I> and therefore must not usurp his powers and prerogatives, 
 nor assume the praises due to him only. They are not Christ, and 
 therefore must not lord it over God's heritage, nor pretend to a 
 dominion over the faith of Christians. They cannot created grace and 
 peace; they cannot enlighten, convert, quicken, comfort; for they are 
 not Christ. Observe how emphatically this is here expressed concerning 
 John: He <I>confessed, and denied not, but confessed;</I> it denotes 
 his vehemence and constancy in making this protestation. Note, 
 Temptations to pride, and assuming that honour to ourselves which does 
 not belong to us, ought to be resisted with a great deal of vigour and 
 earnestness. When John was taken to be the Messiah, he did not connive 
 at it with a <I>Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur--If the people will 
 be deceived, let them;</I> but openly and solemnly, without any 
 ambiguities, confessed, <I>I am not the Christ;</I> <B><I>hoti ouk eimi 
 ego ho Christos</I></B>--<I>I am not the Christ, not I;</I> another is 
 at hand, who is he, but I am not. His disowning himself to be the 
 Christ is called his <I>confessing</I> and not <I>denying</I> Christ.
 Note, Those that humble and abase themselves thereby confess Christ, 
 and give honour to him; but those that will not deny themselves do in 
 effect deny Christ, 
 
 [2.] He disowns himself to be Elias, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The Jews expected the person of Elias to return from heaven, and to 
 live among them, and promised themselves great things from it. Hearing 
 of John's character, doctrine, and baptism, and observing that he 
 appeared as one dropped from heaven, in the same part of the country 
 from which Elijah was carried to heaven, it is no wonder that they were 
 ready to take him for this Elijah; but he disowned this honour too. He 
 was indeed prophesied of under the name of Elijah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:5">Mal. iv. 5</A>),

 and he came in the <I>spirit and power of Elias</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:17">Luke i. 17</A>),

 and was the Elias that was to come 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:14">Matt. xi. 14</A>);

 but he was not the person of Elias, not that Elias that went to heaven 
 in the fiery chariot, as he was that met Christ in his transfiguration. 
 He was the Elias that God had promised, not the Elias that they 
 foolishly dreamed of. Elias did come, and <I>they knew him not</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:12">Matt. xvii. 12</A>);

 nor did he make himself known to them as the Elias, because they had 
 promised themselves such an Elias as God never promised them.

 [3.] He disowns himself to be that <I>prophet,</I> or the prophet.
 <I>First,</I> He was not <I>that</I> prophet which Moses said <I>the 
 Lord</I> would <I>raise up to them of their brethren,</I> like unto 
 him. If they meant this, they needed not ask that question, for that 
 prophet was no other than the Messiah, and he had said already, <I>I am 
 not the Christ. Secondly,</I> He was not such a prophet as they
 expected and wished for, who, like Samuel and Elijah, and some other of 
 the prophets, would interpose in public affairs, and rescue them from 
 under the Roman yoke. <I>Thirdly,</I> He was not one of the old
 prophets raised from the dead, as they expected one to come before 
 Elias, as Elias before the Messiah. <I>Fourthly,</I> Though John was a 
 prophet, yea, more than a prophet, yet he had his revelation, not by 
 dreams and visions, as the Old-Testament prophets had theirs; his 
 commission and work were of another nature, and belonged to another 
 dispensation. If John had said that he was Elias, and was a prophet, he 
 might have made his words good; but ministers must, upon all occasions, 
 express themselves with the utmost caution, both that they may not 
 confirm people in any mistakes, and particularly that they may not give 
 occasion to any to think of them <I>above what is meet.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Affirmatively.</I> The committee that was sent to examine him 
 pressed for a positive answer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 urging the authority of <I>those that sent them,</I> which they 
 expected he should pay a deference to: "<I>Tell us, What art thou?</I> 
 not that we may believe thee, and be baptized by three, but that we may 
 <I>give an answer</I> to those that sent us, and that it may not be 
 said we were sent on a fool's errand." John was looked upon as a man of 
 sincerity, and therefore they believed he would not give an evasive 
 ambiguous answer; but would be fair and above-board, and give a plain 
 answer to a plain question: <I>What sayest thou of thyself?</I> And he 
 did so, <I>I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness.</I> 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He gives his answer in the words of scripture, to show that the 
 scripture was fulfilled in him, and that his office was supported by a 
 divine authority. What the scripture saith of the office of the 
 ministry should be often thought of by those of that high calling, who 
 must look upon themselves as that, and that only, which the word of God 
 makes them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He gives in his answer in very humble, modest, self-denying 
 expressions. He chooses to apply that scripture to himself which 
 denotes not his dignity, but his duty and dependence, which bespeaks 
 him little: <I>I am the voice,</I> as if he were <I>vox et
 pr&aelig;terea nihil</I>--<I>mere voice.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] He gives such an account of himself as might be profitable to 
 them, and might excite and awaken them to hearken to him; for he <I>was 
 the voice</I> (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:3">Isa. xl. 3</A>),

 a voice to alarm, an articulate voice to instruct. Ministers are but 
 the <I>voice,</I> the vehicle, by which God is pleased to communicate 
 his mind. What are Paul and Apollos but messengers? Observe, 
 <I>First,</I> He was a <I>human</I> voice. The people were prepared to 
 receive the law by the voice of thunders, and a trumpet exceedingly 
 loud, such as made them tremble; but they were prepared for the gospel 
 by the voice of a man like ourselves, <I>a still small voice,</I> such 
 as that in which God came to Elijah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:12">1 Kings xix. 12</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> He was the voice of <I>one crying,</I> which denotes,

 1. His <I>earnestness</I> and <I>importunity</I> in calling people to
 repentance; he <I>cried aloud, and did not spare.</I> Ministers must 
 preach as those that are in earnest, and are themselves affected with 
 those things with which they desire to affect others. Those words are
 not likely to <I>thaw</I> the hearers' hearts that <I>freeze</I> 
 between the speaker's lips. 

 2. His <I>open publication</I> of the doctrine he preached; he was the 
 voice of one <I>crying,</I> that all manner of persons might hear and 
 take notice. <I>Doth not wisdom cry?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:1">Prov. viii. 1</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> It was in the <I>wilderness</I> that this voice was 
 crying; in a place of silence and solitude, out of the noise of the 
 world and the hurry of its business; the more retired we are from the 
 tumult of secular affairs the better prepared we are to hear from God. 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> That which he cried was, <I>Make straight the way of 
 the Lord;</I> that is, 

 1. He came to <I>rectify</I> the mistakes of people concerning the ways
 of God; it is certain that they are right ways, but the scribes and 
 Pharisees, with their corrupt glosses upon the law, had made them 
 crooked. Now John Baptist calls people to return to the original rule. 

 2. He came to prepare and dispose people for the reception and 
 entertainment of Christ and his gospel. It is an allusion to the 
 harbingers of a prince or great man, that cry, <I>Make room.</I> Note, 
 When God is coming towards us, we must prepare to meet him, and let the 
 word of the Lord have <I>free course.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:7">Ps. xxiv. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is his testimony concerning <I>his baptism.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The enquiry which the committee made about it: <I>Why baptizest 
 thou, if thou be not the Christ, nor Elias, nor that prophet?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 [1.] They readily apprehended baptism to be fitly and properly used as 
 a sacred rite or ceremony, for the Jewish church had used it with 
 circumcision in the admission of proselytes, to signify the cleansing 
 of them from the pollutions of their former state. That sign was made 
 use of in the Christian church, that it might be the more passable.
 Christ did not affect novelty, nor should his ministers. 

 [2.] They expected it would be used in the days of the Messiah, because 
 it was promised that then there should be a <I>fountain opened</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:1">Zech. xiii. 1</A>),
 
 and <I>clean water sprinkled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:25">Ezek. xxxvi. 25</A>.

 It is taken for granted that Christ, and Elias, and <I>that 
 prophet,</I> would baptize, when they came to <I>purify</I> a 
 <I>polluted</I> world. Divine justice drowned the old world <I>in its 
 filth,</I> but divine grace has provided for the cleansing of this new 
 world <I>from its filth.</I> 

 [3.] They would therefore know by what authority John baptized. His 
 denying himself to be Elias, or <I>that prophet,</I> subjected him to 
 this further question, <I>Why baptizest thou?</I> Note, It is no new 
 thing for a man's modesty to be turned against him, and improved to his 
 prejudice; but it is better that men should take advantage of our low 
 thoughts of ourselves, to <I>trample upon us,</I> than the devil take 
 advantage of our high thoughts of ourselves, to <I>tempt us</I> to 
 pride and draw us into his condemnation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The account he gave of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He owned himself to be only the minister of the outward sign: 
 "<I>I baptize with water,</I> and that is all; I am no more, and do no 
 more, than what you see; I have no other title than <I>John the 
 Baptist;</I> I cannot confer the spiritual grace signified by it." Paul 
 was in care that none should think of him above what they saw him to be 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:6">2 Cor. xii. 6</A>);

 so was John Baptist. Ministers must not set up for masters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He directed them to one who was greater than himself, and would do 
 that for them, if they pleased, which he could not do: "<I>I baptize 
 with water,</I> and that is the utmost of my commission; I have nothing 
 to do but by this to lead you to one that comes after me, and consign 
 you to him." Note, The great business of Christ's ministers is to 
 direct all people to him; we preach not ourselves, but <I>Christ Jesus 
 the Lord.</I> John gave the same account to this committee that he had 
 given to the people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>This as he of whom I spoke.</I> John was constant and uniform in his 
 testimony, not as a reed shaken with the wind. The sanhedrim were 
 jealous of his interest in the people, but he is not afraid to tell 
 them that there is one at the door that will go beyond him. 
 <I>First,</I> He tells them of Christ's <I>presence among them</I> now 
 at this time: <I>There stands one among you,</I> at this time, <I>whom 
 you know not.</I> Christ stood among the common people, and was as one 
 of them. Note, 

 1. Much true worth lies hid in this world; obscurity is often the lot
 of real excellency. Saints are God's <I>hidden ones,</I> therefore 
 <I>the world knows them not.</I> 

 2. God himself is often nearer to us than we are aware of. <I>The
 Lord</I> is <I>in this place,</I> and <I>I knew it not.</I> They were 
 gazing, in expectation of the messiah: <I>Lo he is here,</I> or he is 
 there, when the kingdom of God was abroad and already <I>among 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:21">Luke xvii. 21</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> He tells them of Christ's <I>preference above
 himself:</I> He comes <I>after me,</I> and yet is <I>preferred before 
 me.</I> This he had said before; he adds here, "Whose <I>shoe-latchet I 
 am not worthy to loose;</I> I am not fit to be named the same day with 
 him; it is an honour too great for me to pretend to be in the meanest 
 office about him,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:41">1 Sam. xxv. 41</A>.

 Those to whom Christ is precious reckon his service, even the most
 despised instances of it, an honour to them. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:10">Ps. lxxxiv. 10</A>.

 If so great a man as John accounted himself unworthy of the honour of
 being near Christ, how unworthy then should we account ourselves! Now, 
 one would think, these chief priests and Pharisees, upon this 
 intimation given concerning the approach of the Messiah, should 
 presently have asked who, and where, this excellent person was; and who 
 more likely to tell them than he who had given them this general 
 notice? No, they did not think this any part of their business or 
 concern; they came to molest John, not to receive any instructions from 
 him: so that their ignorance was <I>wilful;</I> they might have known 
 Christ, and would not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Notice is taken of the place where all this was done: 
 <I>In Bethabara beyond Jordan,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Bethabara signifies the <I>house of passage;</I> some think it was the 
 very place where Israel passed over Jordan into the land of promise 
 under the conduct of Joshua; there was opened the way into the gospel 
 state by Jesus Christ. It was at a great <I>distance</I> from
 Jerusalem, beyond Jordan; probably because what he did <I>there</I> 
 would be least offensive to the government. Amos must go prophesy in 
 the country, not near the court; but it was sad that Jerusalem should 
 put so far from her the things that belonged to <I>her peace.</I> He 
 made this confession in the same place where he was <I>baptizing,</I> 
 that all those who attended his baptism might be witnesses of it, and 
 none might say that they knew not what to <I>make of him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,
 Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.
 &nbsp; 30  This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
 preferred before me: for he was before me.
 &nbsp; 31  And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to
 Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
 &nbsp; 32  And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending
 from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
 &nbsp; 33  And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with
 water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit
 descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth
 with the Holy Ghost.
 &nbsp; 34  And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
 &nbsp; 35  Again the next day after John stood, and two of his
 disciples;
 &nbsp; 36  And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the
 Lamb of God!
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have in these verses an account of John's testimony concerning Jesus 
 Christ, which he witnessed to his own disciples that followed him. As 
 soon as ever Christ was <I>baptized</I> he was immediately hurried into 
 the wilderness, to be <I>tempted;</I> and there he was forty days. 
 During his absence John had continued to bear testimony to him, and to 
 tell the people of him; but now at last he <I>sees Jesus coming to 
 him,</I> returning from the wilderness of temptation. As soon as that 
 conflict was over Christ immediately returned to John, who was 
 <I>preaching</I> and <I>baptizing.</I> Now Christ was tempted for 
 example and encouragement to us; and this teaches us, 

 1. That the <I>hardships</I> of a tempted state should engage us to
 keep close to ordinances; to go into the <I>sanctuary of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:17">Ps. lxxiii. 17</A>.

 Our combats with Satan should oblige us to keep close to the communion
 of saints: two are better than one. 

 2. That the <I>honours</I> of a victorious state must not set us 
 <I>above ordinances.</I> Christ had triumphed over Satan, and been 
 attended by angels, and yet, after all, he returns to the place where 
 John was preaching and baptizing. As long as we are on this side 
 heaven, whatever extraordinary visits of divine grace we may have here 
 at any time, we must still keep close to the ordinary means of grace 
 and comfort, and walk with God in them. Now here are <I>two 
 testimonies</I> borne by John to Christ, but those two <I>agree in 
 one.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is his testimony to Christ on the first day that he saw him 
 coming from the wilderness; and here four things are witnessed by him 
 concerning Christ, when he had him before his eyes:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he is <I>the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the 
 world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 
 Let us learn here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That Jesus Christ is the <I>Lamb of God,</I> which bespeaks him 
 the great sacrifice, by which atonement is made for sin, and man 
 reconciled to God. Of all the legal sacrifices he chooses to allude to 
 the <I>lambs</I> that were offered, not only because a lamb is an 
 emblem of meekness, and Christ must be led as a <I>lamb to the 
 slaughter</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:7">Isa. liii. 7</A>),

 but with a special reference, 

 [1.] To the <I>daily sacrifice,</I> which was offered every morning and 
 evening continually, and that was always a <I>lamb</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:38">Exod. xxix. 38</A>),

 which was a type of Christ, as the everlasting propitiation, whose 
 blood continually speaks. 

 [2.] To the <I>paschal lamb,</I> the blood of which, being sprinkled 
 upon the door-posts, secured the Israelites from the stroke of the 
 destroying angel. Christ is <I>our passover,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:7">1 Cor. v. 7</A>.
 
 He is the Lamb <I>of God;</I> he is appointed by <I>him</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:25">Rom. iii. 25</A>),

 he was devoted to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:19"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 19</A>),

 and he was accepted with him; in him he was well pleased. The lot which
 fell on the goat that was to be offered for a sin-offering was called 
 the <I>Lord's lot</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:8,9">Lev. xvi. 8, 9</A>);

 so Christ, who was to make atonement for sin, is called the <I>Lamb of
 God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That Jesus Christ, as the <I>Lamb of God, takes away the sin of 
 the world.</I> This was his undertaking; he appeared, to <I>put away 
 sin by the sacrifice of himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:26">Heb. ix. 26</A>.

 John Baptist had called people to repent of their sins, in order to the
 remission of them. Now here he shows how and by whom that remission was 
 to be expected, what ground of hope we have that our sins shall be 
 pardoned upon our repentance, though our repentance makes no 
 satisfaction for them. This ground of hope we have--Jesus Christ is 
 <I>the Lamb of God.</I>

 [1.] He <I>takes away sin.</I> He, being Mediator between God and man, 
 takes away that which is, above any thing, offensive to the 
 <I>holiness</I> of God, and destructive to the <I>happiness</I> of man. 
 He came, <I>First,</I> To take away the guilt of sin by the merit of 
 his death, to vacate the judgment, and reverse the attainder, which 
 mankind lay under, by an act of indemnity, of which all penitent 
 obedient believers may claim the benefit. <I>Secondly,</I> To take away 
 the power of sin by the Spirit of his grace, so that it shall not have 
 dominion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:14">Rom. vi. 14</A>.

 Christ, as the Lamb of God, washes us from our sins in his own blood;
 that is, he both <I>justifies</I> and <I>sanctifies</I> us: he <I>takes 
 away sin.</I> He is <B><I>ho airon</I></B> --<I>he is taking away</I> 
 the sin of the world, which denotes it not a single but a continued 
 act; it is his constant work and office to take <I>away sin,</I> which 
 is such a <I>work of time</I> that it will never be completed till time 
 shall be no more. He is always <I>taking away</I> sin, by the continual 
 intercession of his blood in heaven, and the continual influence of his 
 grace on earth.

 [2.] He takes away the <I>sin of the world;</I> purchases pardon for 
 all those that repent, and believe the gospel, of what country, nation, 
 or language, soever they be. The legal sacrifices had reference only to 
 the sins of Israel, to make atonement for them; but the Lamb of God was 
 offered to be a propitiation for the <I>sin of the whole world;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:2">1 John ii. 2</A>.

 This is encouraging to our faith; if Christ takes away the sin of the
 world, then why not my sin? Christ levelled his force at the main body 
 of sin's army, struck at the root, and aimed at the overthrow, of that 
 <I>wickedness</I> which the <I>whole world lay in.</I> God was in him 
 reconciling the world to himself.

 [3.] He does this by <I>taking it upon himself.</I> He is the Lamb of 
 God, that <I>bears the sin of the world;</I> so the margin reads it. He 
 bore sin <I>for us,</I> and so bears it <I>from us;</I> he <I>bore the 
 sin of many,</I> as the scape-goat had the sins of Israel put upon his 
 head,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:21">Lev. xvi. 21</A>.

 God could have taken away the sin by taking away the sinner, as he took 
 away the sin of the old world; but he has found out a way of abolishing 
 the sin, and yet sparing the sinner, by making his Son <I>sin for 
 us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That it is our duty, with an eye of faith, to <I>behold</I> the 
 Lamb of God thus taking away the <I>sin of the world.</I> See him 
 taking away sin, and let that increase our hatred of sin, and 
 resolutions against it. Let not us hold that fast which the Lamb of God 
 came to take away: for Christ will either take our sins away or take us 
 away. Let it increase our love to Christ, <I>who loved us, and washed 
 us from our sins in his own blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5">Rev. i. 5</A>.

 Whatever God is pleased to take away from us, if withal he take away 
 our sins, we have reason to be thankful, and no reason to complain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That this was he of whom he had spoken before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>):

 <I>This is he,</I> this person whom I now point at, you see where he 
 stands, <I>this is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man.</I> 
 Observe, 

 (1.) This honour John had above all the prophets, that, whereas they 
 spoke of him as one that should come, he saw him already come. <I>This 
 is he.</I> He sees him <I>now,</I> he sees him <I>nigh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:17">Num. xxiv. 17</A>.
 
 Such a difference there is between present <I>faith</I> and future
 <I>vision.</I> Now we love one whom we have not seen; then we shall see 
 him whom our souls love, shall see him, and say, This is he of whom I 
 said, <I>my Christ,</I> and <I>my all, my beloved,</I> and <I>my 
 friend.</I> 

 (2.) John calls Christ <I>a man;</I> after me comes a 
 man--<B><I>aner</I></B>, a <I>strong man:</I> like <I>the man,</I> the 
 branch, or the <I>man of God's right hand.</I> 

 (3.) He refers to what he had himself said of him before: <I>This is he 
 of whom I said.</I> Note, Those who have said the most honourable 
 things of Christ will never see cause to unsay them; but the more they 
 know him the more they are confirmed in their esteem of him. John still 
 thinks as meanly of himself, and as highly of Christ, as ever. Though 
 Christ appeared not in any external pomp or grandeur, yet John is not 
 ashamed to own, <I>This is he whom I</I> meant, who is <I>preferred 
 before me.</I> And it was necessary that John should thus show them the 
 person, otherwise they could not have believed that one who made so 
 mean a figure should be he of whom John had spoken such great things.
 
 (4.) He protests against any confederacy or combination with this 
 Jesus: <I>And I knew him not.</I> Though there was some relation 
 between them (Elisabeth was cousin to the virgin Mary), yet there was 
 no acquaintance at all between them; John had no personal knowledge of 
 Jesus till he saw him come to his baptism. Their manner of life had 
 been different: John had spent his time in the wilderness, in solitude; 
 Jesus at Nazareth, in conversation. There was no correspondence, no 
 interview between them, that the matter might appear to be wholly 
 carried on by the direction and disposal of Heaven, and not by any 
 design or concert of the persons themselves. And as he hereby disowns 
 all collusion, so also all partiality and sinister regard in it; he 
 could not be supposed to favour him as a friend, for there was no 
 friendship or familiarity between them. Nay, as he could not be biassed 
 to speak honourably of him because he was a stranger to him, he was not 
 able to say any thing of him but what he <I>received from above,</I> to 
 which he appeals,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:27"><I>ch.</I> iii. 27</A>.

 Note, They who are taught believe and confess one whom they have not
 seen, and blessed are they who <I>yet have believed.</I> 

 (5.) The great intention of John's ministry and baptism was to 
 introduce Jesus Christ. That he should be <I>made manifest to Israel,
 therefore am I come baptizing with water.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] Though John did not know Jesus by face, yet he knew that he should 
 be made manifest. Note, We may know the certainty of that which yet we 
 do not fully know the nature and intention of. We know that the 
 happiness of heaven <I>shall be made manifest to Israel,</I> but cannot 
 describe it.

 [2.] The general assurance John had that Christ <I>should be made 
 manifest</I> served to carry him with diligence and resolution through 
 his work, though he was kept in the dark concerning particulars: 
 <I>Therefore am I come.</I> Our assurance of the reality of things, 
 though they are unseen, is enough to quicken us to our duty.

 [3.] God reveals himself to his people by degrees. At first, John knew 
 no more concerning Christ but that he should be made manifest; in 
 confidence of that, he came baptizing, and now he is favoured with a 
 sight of him. They who, upon God's word, believe what they do not see,
 shall shortly see what they now believe. 

 [4.] The ministry of the word and sacraments is designed for no other 
 end than to lead people to Christ, and to make him more and more 
 manifest. 

 [5.] Baptism with water made way for the manifesting of Christ, as it 
 supposed our corruption and filthiness, and signified our cleansing by 
 him who is the <I>fountain opened.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That this was he <I>upon whom the Spirit descended from heaven like 
 a dove.</I> For the confirming of his testimony concerning Christ, he 
 here vouches the extraordinary appearance at his baptism, in which God 
 himself bore witness to him. This was a considerable proof of Christ's 
 mission. Now, to assure us of the truth of it, we are here told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:32-34"><I>v.</I> 32-34</A>),</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That John Baptist saw it: He <I>bore record;</I> did not relate it 
 as a story, but solemnly attested it, with all the seriousness and 
 solemnity of <I>witness-bearing.</I> He made affidavit of it: <I>I saw 
 the Spirit descending</I> from heaven. John could not see the
 <I>Spirit,</I> but he saw the dove which was a sign and representation 
 of the Spirit. The Spirit came now upon Christ, both to <I>make him 
 fir</I> for his <I>work</I> and to <I>make him known</I> to the 
 <I>world.</I> Christ was notified, not by the descent of a crown upon 
 him, or by a transfiguration, but by the descent of the Spirit as a 
 dove upon him, to qualify him for his undertaking. Thus the first 
 testimony given to the apostles was by the descent of the Spirit upon 
 them. God's children are made manifest by their <I>graces;</I> their 
 glories are reserved for their future state. Observe, 

 [1.] The spirit descended <I>from heaven,</I> for every good and 
 perfect gift is <I>from above.</I> 

 [2.] He descended <I>like a dove</I>--an emblem of meekness, and 
 mildness, and gentleness, which makes him <I>fit to teach.</I> The dove 
 brought the olive-branch of peace,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:11">Gen. viii. 11</A>.

 [3.] The Spirit that descended upon Christ <I>abode upon him,</I> as 
 was foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:2">Isa. xi. 2</A>.

 The Spirit did not <I>move him at times,</I> as Samson

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:25">Judg. xiii. 25</A>),

 but <I>at all times.</I> The Spirit was given to him <I>without
 measure;</I> it was his prerogative to have the Spirit always upon him, 
 so that he could at no time be found either <I>unqualified</I> for his 
 work himself or <I>unfurnished</I> for the supply of those that seek to 
 him for his grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That he was <I>told to expect it,</I> which very much corroborates 
 the proof. It was not John's bare conjecture, that surely he on whom he 
 saw the Spirit descending was the Son of God; but it was an 
 <I>instituted</I> sign given him before, by which he might certainly 
 know it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>I knew him not.</I> He insists much upon this, that he knew no more 
 of him than other people did, otherwise than by revelation. But <I>he 
 that sent me to baptize</I> gave me this sign, <I>Upon whom thou shalt 
 see the Spirit descending, the same is he.</I> 

 [1.] See here what sure grounds John went upon in his ministry and 
 baptism, that he might proceed with all imaginable satisfaction.
 <I>First,</I> He did not run <I>without sending:</I> God <I>sent him to 
 baptize.</I> He had a warrant from heaven for what he did. When a 
 minister's call is clear, his comfort is sure, though his success is 
 not always so. <I>Secondly,</I> He did not run <I>without
 speeding;</I> for, when he was sent to <I>baptize with water,</I> he 
 was directed to one that should <I>baptize with the Holy Ghost.</I> 
 Under this notion John Baptist was taught to expect Christ, as one who 
 would give that repentance and faith which he called people to, and 
 would carry on and complete that blessed structure of which he was now 
 laying the foundation. Note, It is a great comfort to Christ's 
 ministers, in their administration of the outward signs, that he whose 
 ministers they are can confer the grace signified thereby, and so put 
 life, and soul, and power into their ministrations; can speak to the 
 heart what they speak to the ear, and <I>breathe</I> upon the dry bones 
 to which they <I>prophesy.</I> 

 [2.] See what sure grounds he went upon in his designation of the 
 person of the Messiah. God had before given him a sign, as he did to 
 Samuel concerning Saul: "On whom thou shalt see the Spirit descend, 
 <I>that same is he.</I>" This not only prevented any mistakes, but gave 
 him boldness in his testimony. When he had such assurance as this given 
 him, he could speak with assurance. When John was told this before,
 his expectations could not but be very much raised; and, when the event 
 exactly answered the prediction, his faith could not but be much 
 confirmed: and these things are written that we may believe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That he is <I>the Son of God.</I> This is the conclusion of John's 
 testimony, that in which all the particulars centre, as the <I>quod 
 erat demonstrandum--the fact to be demonstrated</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>I saw, and bore record, that this is the Son of God.</I> 

 (1.) The truth asserted is, <I>that this is the Son of God.</I> The 
 voice from heaven proclaimed, and John subscribed to it, not only that 
 he should baptize with the Holy Ghost by a divine authority, but that 
 he has a divine nature. This was the peculiar Christian creed, that 
 Jesus is the Son of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:16">Matt. xvi. 16</A>),

 and here is the first framing of it. 

 (2.) John's testimony to it: "<I>I saw, and bore record.</I> Not only I 
 now bear record of it, but I did so as soon as I had seen it." Observe, 
 
 [1.] What he <I>saw</I> he was forward to <I>bear record</I> of, as 
 they, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:20">Acts iv. 20</A>:

 <I>We cannot but speak the things which we have seen.</I> 

 [2.] What he <I>bore record</I> of was what he <I>saw.</I> Christ's 
 witnesses were eye-witnesses, and therefore the more to be credited: 
 they did not speak by hear-say and report, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:16">2 Pet. i. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is John's testimony to Christ, the next day after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:35,36"><I>v.</I> 35, 36</A>.
 
 Where observe, 

 1. He took every opportunity that offered itself to lead people to 
 Christ: <I>John stood looking upon Jesus as he walked.</I> It should 
 seem, John was now retired from the multitude, and was in close 
 conversation with <I>two</I> of his disciples. Note, Ministers should 
 not only in their public preaching, but in their private converse, 
 witness to Christ, and serve his interests. He saw Jesus <I>walking</I> 
 at some distance, yet did not go to him himself, because he would shun 
 every thing that might give the least colour to suspect a combination.
 He was <I>looking upon Jesus</I>--<B><I>emblepsas</I></B>; he looked 
 stedfastly, and fixed his eyes upon him. Those that would lead others 
 to Christ must be diligent and frequent in the <I>contemplation</I> of 
 him themselves. John had seen Christ before, but now looked upon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1">1 John i. 1</A>.

 2. He repeated the same testimony which he had given to Christ the day
 before, though he could have delivered some other great truth 
 concerning him; but thus he would show that he was uniform and constant 
 in his testimony, and consistent with himself. His doctrine was the 
 same in private that it was in public, as Paul's was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:20,21">Acts xx. 20, 21</A>.
 
 It is good to have that repeated which we have heard,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1">Phil. iii. 1</A>.

 The doctrine of Christ's sacrifice for the taking away of the sin of
 the world ought especially to be insisted upon by all good ministers: 
 Christ, the Lamb of God, <I>Christ and him crucified.</I>

 3. He intended this especially for his two disciples that stood with
 him; he was willing to turn them over to Christ, for to this end he
 bore witness to Christ in their hearing that they might leave all to
 follow him, even that they might leave <I>him.</I> He did not reckon
 that he lost those disciples who went over from him to Christ, any more
 than the schoolmaster reckons that scholar lost whom he sends to the
 university. John gathered disciples, not for himself, but for Christ to
 <I>prepare them for the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:17">Luke i. 17</A>.

 So far was he from being jealous of Christ's growing interest, that
 there was nothing he was more desirous of. Humble generous souls will 
 give others their due praise without fear of diminishing themselves by 
 it. What we have of reputation, as well as of other things, will not be 
 the less for our giving every body his own.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>37  And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed
 Jesus.
 &nbsp; 38  Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto
 them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say,
 being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?
 &nbsp; 39  He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he
 dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth
 hour.
 &nbsp; 40  One of the two which heard John <I>speak,</I> and followed him,
 was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
 &nbsp; 41  He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him,
 We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the
 Christ.
 &nbsp; 42  And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he
 said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called
 Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the turning over of two disciples from John to Jesus, and 
 one of them fetching in a third, and these are the first-fruits of 
 Christ's disciples; see how small the church was in its beginnings, and 
 what the dawning of the day of its great things was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Andrew and another with him were the two that John Baptist had 
 directed to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Who the other was we are not told; some think that it was Thomas, 
 comparing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:2"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 2</A>;

 others that it was John himself, the penman of this gospel, whose
 manner it is industriously to conceal his name,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:23,20:3"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 23, and xx. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is their readiness to go over to Christ: They <I>heard John 
 speak</I> of Christ as the <I>Lamb of God,</I> and they <I>followed 
 Jesus.</I> Probably they had heard John say the same thing the day 
 before, and then it had not the effect upon them which now it had; see 
 the benefit of repetition, and of private personal converse. They heard 
 him speak of Christ as the <I>Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of 
 the world,</I> and this made them <I>follow him.</I> The strongest and 
 most prevailing argument with a sensible awakened soul to follow Christ 
 is that it is he, and he only, that <I>takes away sin.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The kind notice Christ took of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 They came behind him; but, though he had his back towards them, he was 
 soon aware of them, and <I>turned,</I> and <I>saw them following.</I> 
 Note, Christ takes early cognizance of the first motions of a soul 
 towards him, and the first step taken in the way to heaven; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:5,Lu+15:20">Isa. lxiv. 5; Luke xv. 20</A>.

 He did not stay till they begged leave to speak with him, but spoke
 first. What communion there is between a soul and Christ, it is he that 
 <I>begins the discourse.</I> He saith unto them, <I>What seek ye?</I> 
 This was not a reprimand for their boldness in intruding into his 
 company: he that came to <I>seek us</I> never checked any for 
 <I>seeking</I> him; but, on the contrary, it is a kind invitation of 
 them into his acquaintance whom he saw bashful and modest: "Come, what 
 have you to say to me? What is your petition? What is your request." 
 Note, Those whose business it is to instruct people in the affairs of 
 their souls should be humble, and mild, and easy of access, and should 
 encourage those that apply to them. The question Christ put to them is 
 what we should all put to ourselves when we begin to follow Christ, and 
 take upon us the profession of his holy religion: "<I>What seek ye?</I> 
 What do we design and desire?" Those that <I>follow</I> Christ, and yet 
 <I>seek</I> the world, or themselves, or the praise of men, deceive 
 themselves. "<I>What seek we</I> in seeking Christ? Do we seek a 
 teacher, ruler, and reconciler? In following Christ, do we seek the 
 favour of God and eternal life?" If our <I>eye</I> be <I>single</I> in 
 this, we are <I>full of light.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their modest enquiry concerning the place of his abode: <I>Rabbi, 
 where dwellest thou?</I> 

 (1.) In calling him <I>Rabbi,</I> they intimated that their design in 
 coming to him was to be <I>taught by him; rabbi</I> signifies a 
 <I>master,</I> a teaching master; the Jews called their doctors, or 
 learned men, <I>rabbies.</I> The word comes from <I>rab, multus</I> or 
 <I>magnus,</I> a <I>rabbi,</I> a <I>great man,</I> and one that, as we 
 say, has <I>much in him.</I> Never was there such a rabbi as our Lord 
 Jesus, such a <I>great one,</I> in whom were <I>hid all the treasures 
 of wisdom and knowledge.</I> These came to Christ to be his scholars, 
 so must all those that apply themselves to him. John had told them that 
 he was the <I>Lamb of God;</I> now this <I>Lamb</I> is worthy to
 <I>take the book and open the seals</I> as a rabbi, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:9">Rev. v. 9</A>.

 And, unless we give up ourselves to be ruled and taught by him, he will 
 not <I>take away our sins.</I>

 (2.) In asking <I>where he dwelt,</I> they intimate a desire to be
 better acquainted with him. Christ was a stranger in this country, so 
 that they meant where was his <I>inn</I> where he <I>lodged;</I> for 
 there they would attend him at some seasonable time, when he should 
 appoint, to receive instruction from him; they would not press rudely 
 upon him, when it was not proper. Civility and good manners well
 become those who follow Christ. And, besides, they hoped to have more 
 from him than they could have in a short conference now by the way. 
 They resolved to make a business, not a by-business of conversing with 
 Christ. Those that have had some communion with Christ cannot but 
 desire, 

 [1.] A <I>further communion</I> with him; they follow on to know more 
 of him. 

 [2.] A <I>fixed communion</I> with him; where they may sit down at his 
 feet, and abide by his instructions. It is not enough to take a turn 
 with Christ now and then, but we must <I>lodge with him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The courteous invitation Christ gave them to his lodgings: <I>He 
 saith unto them, Come and see.</I> Thus should good desires towards 
 Christ and communion with him be countenanced. 

 (1.) He invites them to come to his lodgings: the nearer we approach to 
 Christ, the more we see of his beauty and excellency. Deceivers 
 maintain their interest in their followers by keeping them at a 
 distance, but that which Christ desired to recommend him to the esteem 
 and affections of his followers was that they would <I>come and see: 
 "Come and see</I> what a mean lodging I have, what poor accommodations 
 I take up with, that you may not expect any worldly advantage by 
 following me, as they did who made their court to the scribes and 
 Pharisees, and called them rabbin. <I>Come and see</I> what you must
 count upon if you follow me." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:20">Matt. viii. 20</A>.

 (2.) He invites them to come <I>immediately</I> and without delay. They
 asked where he lodged, that they might wait upon him at a more 
 convenient season; but Christ invites them immediately to <I>come and 
 see;</I> never in better time than now. Hence learn, 

 [1.] As to others, that it is best taking people when they are in a 
 good mind; strike while the iron is hot. 

 [2.] As to ourselves, that it is wisdom to embrace the present
 opportunities: <I>Now is the accepted time,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:2">2 Cor. vi. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Their cheerful and (no doubt) thankful acceptance of his invitation:
 <I>They came and saw where he dwelt,</I> and <I>abode with him that 
 day.</I> It had been greater modesty and manners than had done them 
 good if they had refused this offer. 

 (2.) They readily went along with him: <I>They came and saw where he 
 dwelt.</I> Gracious souls cheerfully accept Christ's gracious 
 invitations; as David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:8">Ps. xxvii. 8</A>.

 They enquired not how they might be accommodated with him, but would 
 put that to the venture, and make the best of what they found. It is 
 good being where Christ is, wherever it be.

 (2.) They were so well pleased with what they found that they <I>abode
 with him that day</I> ("Master, it is good to be here"); and he bade
 them welcome. It was about the tenth hour. Some think that John reckons 
 according to the Roman computation, and that it was about ten o'clock 
 in the morning, and they staid with him till night; others think that 
 John reckons as the other evangelists did, according to the Jewish 
 computation, and that it was four o'clock in the afternoon, and they 
 abode with him that night and the next day. Dr. Lightfoot conjectures
 that this next day that they spent with Christ was a sabbath-day, and, 
 it being late, they could not get home before the sabbath. As it is our 
 duty, wherever we are, to contrive to spend the sabbath as much as may 
 be to our spiritual benefit and advantage, so they are blessed who, by 
 the lively exercises of faith, love, and devotion, spend their sabbaths 
 in communion with Christ. These are Lord's days indeed, <I>days of the
 Son of man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Andrew brought his brother Peter to Christ. If Peter had been the 
 first-born of Christ's disciples, the papists would have made a noise 
 with it: he did indeed afterwards come to be more eminent in gifts, but 
 Andrew had the honour first to be acquainted with Christ, and to be the 
 instrument of bringing Peter to him. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The <I>information</I> which Andrew gave to Peter, with an 
 intimation to come to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He <I>found him: He first finds his own brother Simon;</I> his 
 finding implies his seeking him. Simon came along with Andrew to attend 
 John's ministry and baptism, and Andrew knew where to look for him. 
 Perhaps the other disciple that was with him went out to seek some 
 friend of his at the same time, but Andrew sped first: <I>He first 
 findeth Simon,</I> who came only to attend on John, but has his 
 expectations out-done; he meets with Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He told him whom they had found: <I>We have found the Messias.</I> 
 Observe, 

 [1.] he speaks <I>humbly;</I> not, "I have found," assuming the honour 
 of the discovery to himself, but "<I>We</I> have," rejoicing that he 
 had shared with others in it.

 [2.] He speaks <I>exultingly,</I> and with triumph: <I>We have 
 found</I> that pearl of great price, that true treasure; and, having 
 found it, he proclaims it as those lepers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:9">2 Kings vii. 9</A>,

 for he knows that he shall have never the less in Christ for others 
 sharing.

 [3.] He speaks <I>intelligently: We have found the Messias,</I> which
 was more than had yet been said. John had said, <I>He is the Lamb of 
 God, and the Son of God,</I> which Andrew compares with the scriptures 
 of the Old Testament, and, comparing them together, concludes that he 
 is the Messiah promised to the fathers, for it is now that the fulness 
 of time is come. Thus, by <I>making God's testimonies his 
 meditation,</I> he speaks more clearly concerning Christ than ever 
 <I>his teacher</I> had done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:99">Ps. cxix. 99</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He <I>brought him to Jesus;</I> would not undertake to instruct 
 him himself, but brought him to the fountain-head, persuaded him to 
 come to Christ and introduced him. Now this was, 

 [1.] An instance of true love to his brother, <I>his own</I> brother, 
 so he is called here, because he was very dear to him. Note, We ought 
 with a particular concern and application to seek the spiritual welfare 
 of those that are related to us; for their relation to us adds both to 
 the <I>obligation</I> and to the <I>opportunity</I> of doing good to 
 their souls. 

 [2.] It was an effect of his day's conversation with Christ. Note, the
 best evidence of our profiting by the means of grace is the piety and 
 usefulness of our conversation afterwards. Hereby it appeared that 
 Andrew had <I>been with Jesus</I> that he was so full of him, that he 
 had been <I>in the mount,</I> for his face shone. He knew there was 
 enough in Christ for all; and, having tasted that he is gracious, he 
 could not rest till those he loved had tasted it too. Note, True grace
 hates monopolies, and loves not to eat its morsels alone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The <I>entertainment</I> which Jesus Christ gave to Peter, who was 
 never the less welcome for his being influenced by his brother to come, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ called him by his name: <I>When Jesus beheld him, he said, 
 Thou art Simon, the son of Jona.</I> It should seem that Peter was 
 utterly a stranger to Christ, and if so, 

 [1.] It was a proof of Christ's omniscience that upon the first sight, 
 without any enquiry, he could tell the name both of him and of his 
 father. <I>The Lord knows them that are his,</I> and their whole case. 
 However, 

 [2.] It was an instance of his condescending grace and favour, that he 
 did thus freely and affably call him by his name, though he was of mean 
 extraction, and <I>vir mullius nominis--a man of no name.</I> It was an 
 instance of God's favour to Moses that he <I>knew him by name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:17">Exod. xxxiii. 17</A>.

 Some observe the signification of these names:
 <I>Simon</I>--<I>obedient, Jona</I>--<I>a dove.</I> An obedient 
 dove-like spirit qualifies us to be the disciples of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He gave him a new name: <I>Cephas.</I> 

 [1.] His giving him a name intimates <I>Christ's favour</I> to him. A 
 new name denotes some great dignity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:17,Isa+62:2">Rev. ii. 17; Isa. lxii. 2</A>.

 By this Christ not only wiped off the reproach of his mean and obscure 
 parentage, but adopted him into his family as one of his own. 

 [2.] The name which he gave him bespeaks his <I>fidelity</I> to Christ: 
 <I>Thou shalt be called Cephas</I> (that is Hebrew for <I>a stone), 
 which is by interpretation Peter;</I> so it should be rendered, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:36">Acts ix. 36</A>.
 
 <I>Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas;</I> the former 
 Hebrew, the latter Greek, for a <I>young roe.</I> Peter's natural 
 temper was stiff, and hardy, and resolute, which I take to be the 
 principal reason why Christ called him <I>Cephas--a stone.</I> When 
 Christ afterwards prayed for him, that his faith might not fail, that 
 so he might be firm to Christ himself, and at the same time bade him 
 <I>strengthen his brethren,</I> and lay out himself for the support of 
 others, then he <I>made him</I> what he here called him, <I>Cephas--a 
 stone.</I> Those that come to Christ must come with a fixed resolution 
 to be firm and constant to him, <I>like a stone,</I> solid and 
 stedfast; and it is by his grace that they are so. His saying, <I>Be
 thou steady,</I> makes them so. Now this does no more prove that Peter 
 was the singular or only rock upon which the church is built than the 
 calling of James and John <I>Boanerges</I> proves them the only <I>sons 
 of thunder,</I> or the calling of Joses <I>Barnabas</I> proves him the 
 only <I>son of consolation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>43  The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and
 findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.
 &nbsp; 44  Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
 &nbsp; 45  Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found
 him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus
 of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
 &nbsp; 46  And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come
 out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
 &nbsp; 47  Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold
 an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
 &nbsp; 48  Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus
 answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when
 thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
 &nbsp; 49  Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the
 Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
 &nbsp; 50  Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee,
 I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see
 greater things than these.
 &nbsp; 51  And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
 Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God
 ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the call of Philip and Nathanael.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Philip was called immediately by Christ himself, not as Andrew, who 
 was directed to Christ by John, or Peter, who was invited by his 
 brother. God has various methods of bringing his chosen ones home to 
 himself. But, whatever means he <I>uses,</I> he is not <I>tied</I> to 
 any. 

 1. Philip was called in a <I>preventing</I> was: <I>Jesus findeth
 Philip.</I> Christ sought us, and found us, before we made any 
 enquiries after him. The name <I>Philip</I> is of Greek origin, and 
 much used among the Gentiles, which some make an instance of the 
 degeneracy of the Jewish church at this time, and their conformity to 
 the nations; yet Christ changed not his name. 

 2. He was called the <I>day following.</I> See how closely Christ 
 applied himself to his business. When work is to be done for God, we 
 must not <I>lose a day.</I> Yet observe, Christ now called one or two a 
 day; but, after the Spirit was poured out, there were thousands a day 
 effectually called, in which was fulfilled

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:12"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 12</A>.

 3. Jesus <I>would go forth into Galilee</I> to call him. Christ will
 find out all those that are given to him, wherever they are, and none
 of them shall be lost. 

 4. Philip was brought to be a disciple by the power of Christ going
 along with that word, <I>Follow me.</I> See the nature of true
 Christianity; it is <I>following Christ,</I> devoting ourselves to his
 <I>converse</I> and <I>conduct,</I> attending his movements, and
 treading in his steps. See the efficacy of the grace of it is the
 <I>rod of his strength.</I> 

 5. We are told that Philip was of Bethsaida, and Andrew and Peter were
 so too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 These eminent disciples received not honour from the place of their 
 nativity, but reflected honour upon it. <I>Bethsaida</I> signifies the 
 <I>house of nets,</I> because inhabited mostly by fishermen; thence 
 Christ chose disciples, who were to be furnished with extraordinary 
 gifts, and therefore needed not the ordinary advantages of learning. 
 Bethsaida was a wicked place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:21">Matt. xi. 21</A>),

 yet even <I>there</I> was a remnant, according to the election of 
 grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Nathanael was invited to Christ by Philip, and much is said 
 concerning him. In which we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What passed between Philip and Nathanael, in which appears an 
 observable mixture of pious zeal with weakness, such as is usually 
 found in beginners, that are yet but <I>asking the way to Zion.</I> 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The joyful news that Philip brought to Nathanael, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 As Andrew before, so Philip here, having got some knowledge of Christ 
 himself, rests not till he has <I>made manifest the savour of that 
 knowledge.</I> Philip, though newly come to an acquaintance with Christ 
 himself, yet steps aside to seek Nathanael. Note, When we have the 
 fairest opportunities of getting good to our own souls, yet ever then 
 we must seek opportunities of doing good to the souls of others, 
 remembering the words of Christ, <I>It is more blessed to give than to 
 receive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:35">Acts xx. 35</A>.

 O, saith Philip, <I>we have found him of whom Moses and the prophets 
 did write,</I> Observe here,

 [1.] What a transport of joy Philip was in, upon this new acquaintance
 with Christ: "We have found him whom we have so often talked of, so 
 long wished and waited for; at last, <I>he is come he is come,</I> and 
 <I>we</I> have found him!" 

 [2.] What an advantage it was to him that he was so well acquainted 
 with the scriptures of the Old Testament, which prepared his mind for 
 the reception of evangelical light, and made the entrance of it much 
 the more easy: <I>Him of whom Moses and the prophets did write.</I> 
 What was written entirely and from eternity in the <I>book of the 
 divine counsels</I> was in part, at sundry times and in divers manners, 
 copied out into the book of the <I>divine revelations.</I> Glorious 
 things were written there concerning the Seed of the woman, the Seed of 
 Abraham, Shiloh, the prophet like Moses, the Son of David, Emmanuel, 
 the Man, the Branch, Messiah the Prince. Philip had studied these 
 things, and was full of them, which made him readily welcome Christ. 
 
 [3.] What mistakes and weaknesses he laboured under: he called Christ 
 <I>Jesus of Nazareth,</I> whereas he was of <I>Bethlehem;</I> and the 
 <I>Son of Joseph,</I> whereas he as but his <I>supposed</I> Son. Young 
 beginners in religion are subject to mistakes, which time and the grace 
 of God will rectify. It was his weakness to say, <I>We have found 
 him,</I> for Christ found them before they found Christ. He did not yet 
 <I>apprehend,</I> as Paul did, how he was <I>apprehended of Christ 
 Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:12">Phil. iii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The objection which Nathanael made against this, <I>Can any good 
 thing come out of Nazareth?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.
 
 Here, 

 [1.] His <I>caution</I> was commendable, that he did not lightly assent 
 to every thing that was said, but took it into examination; our rule 
 is, <I>Prove all things.</I> But, 

 [2.] His objection arose from Ignorance. If he meant that no good thing 
 could come out of Nazareth it was owing to his ignorance of the divine 
 grace, as if that were less affected to one place than another, or tied 
 itself to men's foolish and ill-natured observations. If he meant that 
 the Messiah, that great good thing, could not come out of Nazareth, so 
 far he was right (Moses, in the law, said that he should come out of 
 Judah, and the prophets had assigned Bethlehem for the place of his 
 nativity); but then he was ignorant of the matter of <I>fact,</I> that 
 this Jesus was born at Bethlehem; so that the blunder Philip made, in 
 calling him <I>Jesus of Nazareth,</I> occasioned this objection. Note, 
 The mistakes of preachers often give rise to the prejudices of 
 hearers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The short reply which Philip gave to this objection: <I>Come and 
 see.</I> 

 [1.] It was his <I>weakness</I> that he could not give a satisfactory 
 answer to it; yet it is the common case of young beginners in religion. 
 We may <I>know</I> enough to <I>satisfy</I> ourselves, and yet not be 
 able to <I>say</I> enough to <I>silence</I> the cavils of a subtle 
 adversary. 

 [2.] It was his <I>wisdom</I> and zeal that, when he could not answer 
 the objection himself, he would have him go to one that could: <I>Come 
 and see.</I> Let us not stand arguing here, and raising difficulties to 
 ourselves which we cannot get over; let us go and converse with Christ 
 himself, and these difficulties will all vanish presently. Note, It is 
 folly to spend that time in doubtful disputation which might be better 
 spent, and to much better purpose, in the exercises of piety and 
 devotion. <I>Come and see;</I> not, <I>Go and see,</I> but, 
 "<I>Come,</I> and I will go along with thee;" as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3,Jer+1:5">Isa. ii. 3; Jer. i. 5</A>.

 From this parley between Philip and Nathanael, we may observe, 
 <I>First,</I> That many people are kept from the ways of religion by 
 the unreasonable prejudices they have conceived against religion, upon 
 the account of some foreign circumstances which do not at all touch the 
 merits of the case. <I>Secondly,</I> The best way to remove the 
 prejudices they have entertained against religion is to prove 
 themselves, and make trial of it. Let us not answer this matter before 
 we hear it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What passed between Nathanael and our Lord Jesus. He came and 
 <I>saw,</I> not in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Our Lord Jesus bore a very honourable testimony to Nathanael's
 integrity: <I>Jesus saw him</I> coming, and met him with favourable 
 encouragement; he said of him to those about him, Nathanael himself 
 being within hearing, <I>Behold an Israelite indeed.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That he <I>commended</I> him; not to flatter him, or puff him up 
 with a good conceit of himself, but perhaps because he knew him to be a 
 <I>modest</I> man, if not a <I>melancholy</I> man, one that had hard 
 and mean thoughts of himself, was ready to doubt his own sincerity; and 
 Christ by this testimony put the matter out of doubt. Nathanael had, 
 more than any of the candidates, objected against Christ; but Christ 
 hereby showed that he excused it, and was not extreme to mark what he 
 had said amiss, because he knew his heart was upright. He did not 
 retort upon him, <I>Can any good thing come out of Cana</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:2"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 2</A>),

 an obscure town in Galilee? But kindly gives him this character, to 
 encourage us to hope for acceptance with Christ, notwithstanding our 
 weakness, and to teach us to speak honourably of those who without 
 cause have spoken slightly of us, and to give them their due 
 praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That he commended him for his <I>integrity. First, Behold an 
 Israelite indeed.</I> It is Christ's prerogative to know what men are 
 <I>indeed;</I> we can but <I>hope the best.</I> The whole nation were 
 Israelites in name, but <I>all are not Israel that are of Israel</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:6">Rom. ix. 6</A>);

 here, however, was <I>an Israelite indeed.</I> 

 1. A sincere follower of the good example of Israel, whose character it
 was that he was a <I>plain man,</I> in opposition to Esau's character 
 of a <I>cunning man.</I> He was a genuine son of <I>honest Jacob,</I> 
 not only of his <I>seed,</I> but of his <I>spirit.</I> 

 2. A sincere professor of the faith of Israel; he was true to the 
 religion he professed, and lived up to it: he was really as good as he 
 seemed, and his practice was <I>of a piece</I> with his profession. He 
 is the Jew that is one <I>inwardly</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:29">Rom. ii. 29</A>),

 so is he <I>the Christian. Secondly,</I> He is one in whom is <I>no
 guile</I>--that is the character of an Israelite indeed, a Christian 
 indeed: <I>no guile</I> towards men; a man without trick or design; a 
 man that one may trust; <I>no guile</I> towards God, that is, sincere 
 in his repentance for sin; sincere in his covenanting with God; in 
 whose spirit is <I>no guile,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:2">Ps. xxxii. 2</A>.

 He does not say without <I>guilt,</I> but without <I>guile.</I> Though
 in many things he is foolish and forgetful, yet in nothing false, nor 
 <I>wickedly departing from God:</I> there is no allowed approved guilt 
 in him; not painted, though he have his spots: "<I>Behold</I> this 
 Israelite <I>indeed.</I>"

 1. "Take notice of him, that you may learn his way, and do like him." 

 2. "Admire him; <I>behold,</I> and <I>wonder.</I>" The hypocrisy of the 
 scribes and Pharisees had so leavened the Jewish church and nation, and 
 their religion was so degenerated into formality or state-policy, that 
 an Israelite indeed was a <I>man wondered at,</I> a miracle of divine 
 grace, like Job,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:8"><I>ch.</I> i. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Nathanael is much surprised at this, upon which Christ gives him a 
 further proof of his omnisciency, and a kind memorial of his former 
 devotion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Here is Nathanael's modesty, in that he was soon put out of 
 countenance at the kind notice Christ was pleased to take of him: 
 "<I>Whence knowest thou me,</I> me that am unworthy of thy cognizance? 
 <I>who am I, O Lord God?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:18">2 Sam. vii. 18</A>.

 This was an evidence of his sincerity, that he did not catch at the
 praise he met with, but declined it. Christ knows us better than we 
 know ourselves; we know not what is in a man's heart by looking in his 
 face, but all things are naked and open before Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12,13">Heb. iv. 12, 13</A>.

 Doth Christ know us? Let us covet to know him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Here is Christ's further <I>manifestation</I> of himself to him: 
 <I>Before Philip called thee, I saw thee. First,</I> He gives him to 
 understand that he <I>knew him,</I> and so manifests his divinity. It 
 is God's prerogative infallibly to know all persons and all things; by 
 this Christ proved himself to be God upon many occasions. It was 
 prophesied concerning the Messiah that he should be of <I>quick 
 understanding in the fear of the Lord,</I> that is, in judging the 
 sincerity and degree of the fear of God in others, and that he should 
 not <I>judge after the sight of his eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:2,3">Isa. xi. 2, 3</A>.

 Here he answers that prediction. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:19">2 Tim. ii. 19</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> That before Philip called him he saw him under the
 fig-tree; this manifests a particular kindness for him.

 1. His eye was towards him before Philip called him, which was the
 first time that ever Nathanael was acquainted with Christ. Christ has 
 knowledge of us before we have any knowledge of him; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:4,Ga+4:9">Isa. xlv. 4; Gal. iv. 9</A>.

 2. His eye was upon him when he as <I>under the fig-tree;</I> this was
 a private token which nobody understood but Nathanael: "When thou wast
 retired <I>under the fig-tree</I> in thy garden, and thoughtest that no
 eye saw thee, I have then my eye upon thee, and saw that which was very
 acceptable." It is most probable that Nathanael under the fig-tree was
 employed, as Isaac in the field, in meditation, and prayer, and
 communion with God. Perhaps then and there it was that he solemnly
 joined himself to the Lord in an inviolable covenant. Christ saw in
 secret, and by this public notice of it did in part reward him openly.
 <I>Sitting under the</I> fig-tree denotes quietness and composedness of
 spirit, which much befriend communion with God. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:4,Zec+3:10">Mic. iv. 4; Zech. iii. 10</A>.

 Nathanael here in was an Israelite indeed, that, like Israel, he 
 <I>wrestled with God alone</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:24">Gen. xxxii. 24</A>),

 prayed not like the hypocrites, in the corners of the streets, but
 under the fig-tree.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Nathanael hereby obtained a full assurance of faith in Jesus 
 Christ, expressed in that noble acknowledgment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):

 <I>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the king of Israel;</I> 
 that is, in short, thou art the true Messiah. Observe here, 

 [1.] How <I>firmly</I> he believed <I>with the heart.</I> Though he had 
 lately laboured under some prejudices concerning Christ, they had now 
 all vanished. Note, The grace of God, in working faith, casts down 
 imaginations. Now he asks no more, <I>Can any good thing come out of 
 Nazareth?</I> For he believes Jesus of Nazareth to be the chief good, 
 and embraces him accordingly.

 [2.] How <I>freely</I> he confessed <I>with the mouth.</I> His 
 confession is made in form of an adoration, directed to our Lord Jesus 
 himself, which is a proper way of confessing our faith. <I>First,</I> 
 He confesses Christ's prophetical office, in calling him <I>Rabbi,</I> 
 a title which the Jews commonly gave to their teachers. Christ is the 
 great rabbi, at whose feet we must all be <I>brought up. Secondly,</I> 
 He confesses his divine nature and mission, in calling him the Son of 
 God (that Son of God spoken of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7">Ps. ii. 7</A>);

 though he had but a human <I>form</I> and <I>aspect,</I> yet having a 
 divine knowledge, the knowledge of the heart, and of things distant and 
 secret, Nathanael thence concludes him to be the <I>Son of God. 
 Thirdly,</I> He confesses, "<I>Thou art the king of Israel;</I> that 
 king of Israel whom we have been long waiting for." If he be the Son of 
 God, he is king of the Israel of God. Nathanael hereby proves himself 
 an Israelite indeed that he so readily owns and submits to the king of 
 Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Christ hereupon raises the hopes and expectations of Nathanael to
 something further and greater than all this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:50,51"><I>v.</I> 50, 51</A>.

 Christ is very tender of young converts, and will encourage good 
 beginnings, though weak, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:20">Matt. xii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He here signifies his acceptance, and (it should seem) his 
 admiration, of the ready faith of Nathanael: <I>Because I said, I saw 
 thee under the fig-tree, believest thou?</I> He wonders that such a 
 small indication of Christ's divine knowledge should have such an 
 effect; it was a sign that Nathanael's heart was prepared beforehand, 
 else the work had not been done so suddenly. Note, It is much for the 
 honour of Christ and his grace, when the heart is surrendered to him at 
 the first summons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He promises him much greater helps for the confirmation and 
 increase of his faith than he had had for the first production of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> In general: "<I>Thou shalt see greater things than 
 these,</I> stronger proofs of my being the Messiah;" the miracles of 
 Christ, and his resurrection. Note, 

 1. To him that hath, and maketh good use of what he hath, more shall be
 given.

 2. Those who truly believe the gospel will find its evidences grow upon 
 them, and will see more and more cause to believe it. 

 3. Whatever discoveries Christ is pleased to make of himself to his
 people while they are here in this world, he hath still greater things 
 than these to make known to them; a glory yet further <I>to be 
 revealed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> In particular: "Not thou only, but you, all you my
 disciples, whose faith this is intended for the confirmation of, you 
 <I>shall see heaven opened;</I>" this is more than telling Nathanael of 
 his being under the fig-tree. This is introduced with a solemn preface, 
 <I>Verily, verily I say unto you,</I> which commands both a <I>fixed 
 attention</I> to what is said as very weighty, and a <I>full assent</I> 
 to it as undoubtedly true: "I say it, whose word you may rely upon, 
 <I>amen, amen.</I>" None used this word at the beginning of a sentence 
 but Christ, though the Jews often used it at the close of a prayer, and 
 sometimes doubled it. It is a solemn asseveration. Christ is called the 
 <I>Amen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:14">Rev. iii. 14</A>),

 and so some take it here, <I>I the Amen, the Amen, say unto you.</I> I 
 the faithful witness. Note, The assurances we have of the glory to be 
 revealed are built upon the word of Christ. Now see what it is that 
 Christ assures them of: <I>Hereafter,</I> or <I>within awhile,</I> or 
 <I>ere long,</I> or henceforth, ye shall see heaven opened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> It is a mean title that Christ here takes to himself: <I>The 
 Son of man;</I> a title frequently applied to him in the gospel, but 
 always by himself. Nathanael had called him the <I>Son of God</I> and 
 <I>king of Israel:</I> he calls himself <I>Son of man,</I> 

 (<I>a.</I>) To express his <I>humility</I> in the midst of the honours done
 him.

 (<I>b.</I>) To teach his <I>humanity,</I> which is to be believed as
 well as his divinity.

 (<I>c.</I>) To intimate his present state of humiliation, that
 Nathanael might not expect this king of Israel to appear in external 
 pomp.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> Yet they are great things which he here foretels: <I>You 
 shall see heaven opened,</I> and <I>the angels of God ascending and 
 descending upon the Son of man.</I> 

 (<I>a.</I>) Some understand it literally, as pointing at some 
 particular event. Either,

 [<I>a.</I>] There was some vision of Christ's glory, in which this was 
 exactly fulfilled, which Nathanael was an eye-witness of, as Peter, and 
 James, and John were of his transfiguration. There were many things 
 which Christ did, and those in the presence of his disciples, which 
 were not written

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:30"><I>ch.</I> xx. 30</A>),

 and why not this? Or, 

 [<I>b.</I>] It was fulfilled in the many ministrations of the angels to 
 our Lord Jesus, especially that at his ascension, when heaven was 
 opened to receive him, and the angels <I>ascended</I> and 
 <I>descended,</I> to attend him and to do him honour, and this in the 
 sight of the disciples. Christ's ascension was the great proof of his 
 mission, and much confirmed the faith of his disciples,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:62"><I>ch.</I> vi. 62</A>.

 Or,

 [<I>c.</I>] It may refer to Christ's second coming, to judge the world,
 when the heavens shall be <I>open,</I> and every eye shall see him, and 
 the angels of God shall ascend and descend about him, as attendants on 
 him, every one employed; and a busy day it will be. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:10">2 Thess. i. 10</A>.
 
 (<I>b.</I>) Others take it figuratively, as speaking of a state or 
 series of things to commence <I>from henceforth;</I> and so we may 
 understand it, 

 [<I>a.</I>] Of Christ's <I>miracles.</I> Nathanael believed, because 
 Christ, as the prophets of old, could tell him things secret; but what 
 is this? Christ is now beginning a dispensation of miracles, much more 
 great and strange than this, as if heaven were opened; and such a power 
 shall be exerted by the Son of man as if the angels, which excel in 
 strength, were continually attending his orders. Immediately after
 this, Christ began to work miracles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:11"><I>ch.</I> ii. 11</A>.

 Or, 

 [<I>b.</I>] Of his <I>mediation,</I> and that blessed intercourse which 
 he hath settled between heaven and earth, which his disciples should be 
 degrees be let into the mystery of. <I>First,</I> By Christ, as 
 Mediator, they shall see <I>heaven opened,</I> that we may <I>enter 
 into the holiest</I> by his blood

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:19,20">Heb. x. 19, 20</A>);

 heaven opened, that by faith we may <I>look in,</I> and at length may 
 <I>go in;</I> may now behold the glory of the Lord, and hereafter enter 
 into the joy of our Lord. And, <I>Secondly,</I> They shall <I>see 
 angels ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</I> Through Christ 
 we have communion with and benefit by the holy angels, and things in 
 heaven and things on earth are <I>reconciled</I> and <I>gathered 
 together.</I> Christ is to us as Jacob's ladder 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:12">Gen. xxviii. 12</A>),

 by whom angels continually ascend and descend for the good of the 
 saints.</P>
