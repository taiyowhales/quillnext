 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be
 some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death,
 till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.
 &nbsp; 2  And after six days Jesus taketh <I>with him</I> Peter, and James,
 and John, and leadeth them up into a high mountain apart by
 themselves: and he was transfigured before them.
 &nbsp; 3  And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so
 as no fuller on earth can white them.
 &nbsp; 4  And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were
 talking with Jesus.
 &nbsp; 5  And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for
 us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee,
 and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
 &nbsp; 6  For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
 &nbsp; 7  And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice
 came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
 &nbsp; 8  And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no
 man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
 &nbsp; 9  And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that
 they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son
 of man were risen from the dead.
 &nbsp; 10  And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one
 with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
 &nbsp; 11  And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias
 must first come?
 &nbsp; 12  And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first,
 and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of
 man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.
 &nbsp; 13  But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have
 done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A prediction of Christ's kingdom now near approaching, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 That which is foretold, is, 

 1. That the <I>kingdom of God</I> would <I>come,</I> and would come so
 as to be <I>seen:</I> the kingdom of the Messiah shall be set up in the 
 world by the utter destruction of the Jewish polity, which stood in the 
 way of it; this was the restoring of the kingdom of God among men, 
 which had been in a manner lost by the woeful degeneracy both of Jews 
 and Gentiles. 

 2. That it would come <I>with power,</I> so as to make its own way, and
 bear down the opposition that was given to it. It came <I>with 
 power,</I> when vengeance was taken on the Jews for crucifying Christ, 
 and when it conquered the idolatry of the Gentile world. 

 3. That it would come while some now <I>present were alive;</I> There
 are some <I>standing here, that shall not taste of death,</I> till they
 <I>see</I> it; this speaks the same with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:34">Matt. xxiv. 34</A>,

 This <I>generation shall not pass, till all these things be
 fulfilled.</I> Those that were standing here with Christ, should see 
 it, when the others could not discern it to be the kingdom of God, for 
 it came not with observation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A specimen of that kingdom in the transfiguration of Christ, <I>six 
 days</I> after Christ spoke that prediction. He had begun to give 
 notice to his disciples of his death and sufferings; and, to prevent 
 their offence at that, he gives them this glimpse of his glory, to show 
 that his sufferings were voluntary, and what a virtue the dignity and 
 glory of his person would put into them, and to prevent the <I>offence 
 of the cross.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was on the top of a <I>high mountain,</I> like the converse Moses 
 had with God, which was on the top of mount Sinai, and his prospect of 
 Canaan from the top of mount Pisgah. Tradition saith, It was on the top 
 of the mount Tabor that Christ was transfigured; and if so, the 
 scripture was fulfilled, <I>Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy 
 name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:12">Ps. lxxxix. 12</A>.

 Dr. Lightfoot, observing that the last place where we find Christ was
 in the coasts of C&aelig;sarea-Philippi, which was far from mount 
 Tabor, rather thinks it was a high mountain which Josephus speaks of, 
 near C&aelig;sarea.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The witnesses of it were Peter, James, and John; these were the 
 <I>three</I> that were to <I>bear record on earth,</I> answering to 
 Moses, Elias, and the <I>voice from heaven,</I> the three that were to 
 bear record from above. Christ did not take all the disciples with him, 
 because the thing was to be kept very private. As there are 
 distinguishing favours which are given to disciples and not to the 
 world, so there are to some disciples and not to others. All the saints 
 are a people <I>near to Christ,</I> but some lie in his bosom. James 
 was the first of all the twelve that died for Christ, and John survived 
 them all, to be the last eyewitness of this glory; he bore record 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14">John i. 14</A>);

 <I>We saw his glory:</I> and so did Peter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:16-18">2 Pet. i. 16-18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The manner of it; <I>He was transfigured before them;</I> he 
 appeared in another manner than he used to do. This was a change of the 
 accidents, the substance remaining the same, and it was a miracle. But 
 transubstantiation, the change of the substance, all the accidents 
 remaining the same, is not a miracle, but a fraud and imposture, such a 
 work as Christ never wrought. See what a great change human bodies are 
 capable of, when God is pleased to put an honour upon them, as he will 
 upon the bodies of the saints, at the resurrection. He was transfigured 
 <I>before them;</I> the change, it is probable, was <I>gradual,</I> 
 from glory to glory, so that the disciples, who had their eye upon him 
 all the while, had the clearest and most certain evidence they could 
 have, that this glorious appearance was no other than the blessed Jesus 
 himself, and there was no illusion in it. John seems to refer to this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1">1 John i. 1</A>),

 when he speaks of the <I>word of life,</I> as that which they had 
 <I>seen with their eyes, and looked upon.</I> His <I>raiment became 
 shining;</I> so that, though probably, it was sad-coloured, if not 
 black, yet it was now <I>exceeding white as snow,</I> beyond what the 
 fuller's art could do toward whitening it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. His companions in this glory were Moses and Elias 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 They appeared <I>talking with him,</I> not to <I>teach</I> him, but to 
 <I>testify</I> to him, and to be <I>taught</I> by him; by which it 
 appears that there are converse and intercourse between glorified 
 saints, they have ways of talking one with another, which we understand 
 not. Moses and Elias lived at a great distance of time one from 
 another, but that breaks no squares in heaven, where the <I>first shall 
 be last, and the last first,</I> that is, all one in Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The great delight that the disciples took in seeing this sight, and 
 hearing this discourse, is expressed by Peter, the mouth of the rest; 
 <I>He said, Master, it is good for us to be here,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Though Christ was transfigured, and was in discourse with Moses and 
 Elias, yet he gave Peter leave to speak to him, and to be as free with 
 him as he used to be. Note, Our Lord Jesus, in his exaltation and 
 glory, doth not at all abate of his condescending kindness to his 
 people. Many, when they are in their greatness, oblige their friends to 
 keep their distance; but even to the glorified Jesus true believers 
 have access with boldness, and freedom of speech with him. Even in this 
 heavenly discourse there was room for Peter to put in a word; and this 
 is it, "<I>Lord, it is good to be here,</I> it is good <I>for us</I> to 
 be here; here <I>let us make tabernacles;</I> let this be our rest for 
 ever." Note, Gracious souls reckon it <I>good to be</I> in communion 
 with Christ, good to be near him, good to be <I>in the mount</I> with 
 him, though it be a cold and solitary place; it is good to be here 
 retired from the world, and alone with Christ: and if it is good to be 
 with Christ transfigured only upon a mountain with Moses and Elias, how 
 good it will be to be with Christ glorified in heaven with all the 
 saints! But observe, While Peter was for staying here, he forgot what 
 need there was of the presence of Christ, and the preaching of his 
 apostles, among the people. At this very time, the other disciples 
 wanted them greatly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Note, When it is well with us, we are apt to be mindless of others, and 
 in the fulness of our <I>enjoyments</I> to forget the 
 <I>necessities</I> of our brethren; it was a weakness in Peter to 
 prefer private communion with God before public usefulness. Paul is
 willing to <I>abide in the flesh,</I> rather than depart to the 
 mountain of glory (though that be far better), when he sees it needful 
 for the church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:24,25">Phil. i. 24, 25</A>.

 Peter talked of making three distinct tabernacles for Moses, Elias, and 
 Christ, which was not well-contrived; for such a perfect harmony there 
 is between the law, the prophets, and the gospel, that one tabernacle 
 will hold them all; they dwell together in unity. But whatever was 
 incongruous in what he said, he may be excused, for they were all 
 <I>sore afraid;</I> and he, for his part, <I>wist not what to say</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 not knowing what would be the end thereof.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The voice that came from heaven, was an attestation of Christ's 
 mediatorship, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 <I>There was a cloud that overshadowed them,</I> and was a shelter to 
 them. Peter had talked of making tabernacles for Christ and his 
 friends; but <I>while he yet spoke,</I> see how his project was 
 superseded; this cloud was unto them instead of tabernacles for their 
 shelter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:5">Isa. iv. 5</A>);

 while he <I>spoke</I> of his tabernacles, God created his tabernacle 
 <I>not made with hands.</I> Now out of this cloud (which was but a 
 shade to <I>the excellent glory</I> Peter speaks of, whence <I>this 
 voice</I> came) it was said, <I>This is my beloved Son, hear him.</I> 
 God owns him, and accepts him, as his beloved Son, and is ready to 
 accept of us in him; we must then own and accept him as our beloved 
 Saviour, and must give up ourselves to be ruled by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. The vision, being designed only to introduce the voice, when that 
 was delivered, disappeared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 <I>Suddenly when they had looked round about,</I> as men amazed to see 
 where they were, all was gone, <I>they saw no man any more.</I> Elias 
 and Moses were vanished out of sight, and Jesus only remained with 
 them, and he not transfigured, but as he used to be. Note, Christ doth 
 not leave the soul, when extraordinary joys and comforts leave it. 
 Though more sensible and ravishing communications may be withdrawn, 
 Christ's disciples have, and shall have, his ordinary presence with 
 them always, even to the end of the world, and that is it we must 
 depend upon. Let us thank God for <I>daily bread</I> and not expect a 
 continual feast on this side of heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. We have here the discourse between Christ and his disciples, as they 
 came down from the mount.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He charged them to keep this matter very private, till he was 
 <I>risen from the dead,</I> which would complete the proof of his 
 divine mission, and then this must be produced with the rest of the 
 evidence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 And besides, he, being now in a state of humiliation, would have 
 nothing publicly taken notice of, that might be seen disagreeable to 
 such a state; for to that he would in every thing accommodate himself. 
 This enjoining of silence to the disciples, would likewise be of use to 
 them, to prevent their boasting of the intimacy they were admitted to, 
 that they might not be <I>puffed up</I> with the <I>abundance of the 
 revelations.</I> It is a mortification to a man, to be tied up from 
 telling of his advancements, and may help to hide pride from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The disciples were at a loss what the <I>rising from the dead</I> 
 should mean; they could not form any notion of the Messiah's dying 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:34">Luke xviii. 34</A>),

 and therefore were willing to think that the <I>rising</I> he speaks 
 of, was figurative, his rising from his present mean and low estate to 
 the dignity and dominion they were in expectation of. But if so, here 
 is another thing that embarrasses them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 <I>Why say the Scribes,</I> that before the appearing of the Messiah in 
 his glory, according to the order settled in the prophecies of the Old 
 Testament, <I>Elias must first come?</I> But Elias was gone, and Moses 
 too. Now that which raised this difficulty, was, the scribes taught 
 them to expect the person of Elias, whereas the prophecy intended one 
 <I>in the spirit and power of Elias.</I> Note, The misunderstanding of 
 scripture is a great prejudice to the entertainment of truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Christ gave them a key to the prophecy concerning Elias 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>);

 "It is indeed prophesied that Elias will come, and will <I>restore all 
 things,</I> and set them to rights; and (though you will not understand 
 it) it is also prophesied of the <I>Son of man,</I> that he must 
 <I>suffer many things,</I> and be <I>set at nought,</I> must be a 
 reproach of men, and despised of the people: and though the scribes do 
 not tell you so, the <I>scriptures</I> do, and you have as much reason 
 to expect that as the other, and should not <I>make so strange</I> of 
 it; but as to Elias, I tell you <I>he is come;</I> and if you consider 
 a little, you will understand whom I mean, it is one to whom they have 
 <I>done whatsoever they listed;</I>" which was very applicable to the 
 ill usage they had given John Baptist. Many of the ancients, and the 
 Popish writers generally, think, that besides the coming of John 
 Baptist in the spirit of Elias, himself in his own person is to be 
 expected, with Enoch, before the second appearance of Christ, wherein 
 the prophecy of Malachi will have a more full accomplishment than it 
 had in John Baptist. But it is groundless fancy; the true Elias, as 
 well as the true Messiah promised, is come, and we are to look for 
 <I>no other.</I> These words <I>as it is</I> written of him, refer not 
 to their <I>doing to him whatever they listed</I> (that comes in a 
 parenthesis), but only to his coming. He is come, and hath been, and 
 done, according as was <I>written of him.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  And when he came to <I>his</I> disciples, he saw a great
 multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.
 &nbsp; 15  And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were
 greatly amazed, and running to <I>him</I> saluted him.
 &nbsp; 16  And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?
 &nbsp; 17  And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have
 brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;
 &nbsp; 18  And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he
 foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I
 spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they
 could not.
 &nbsp; 19  He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how
 long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him
 unto me.
 &nbsp; 20  And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him,
 straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and
 wallowed foaming.
 &nbsp; 21  And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came
 unto him? And he said, Of a child.
 &nbsp; 22  And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the
 waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have
 compassion on us, and help us.
 &nbsp; 23  Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things <I>are</I>
 possible to him that believeth.
 &nbsp; 24  And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said
 with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
 &nbsp; 25  When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he
 rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, <I>Thou</I> dumb and deaf
 spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into
 him.
 &nbsp; 26  And <I>the spirit</I> cried, and rent him sore, and came out of
 him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.
 &nbsp; 27  But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he
 arose.
 &nbsp; 28  And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
 privately, Why could not we cast him out?
 &nbsp; 29  And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing,
 but by prayer and fasting.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of Christ casting the devil out of a child, 
 somewhat more fully related than it was in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:14">Matt. xvii. 14</A>,

 &c. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's return to his disciples, and the perplexity he found them 
 in. He laid aside his robes of glory, and came to look after his 
 family, and to enquire what was become of them. Christ's glory above 
 does not make him forget the concerns of his church below, which he 
 visits in <I>great humility,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 And he came very seasonably, when the disciples were embarrassed and 
 run a-ground; the scribes, who were sworn enemies both to him and them, 
 had gained an advantage against them. A child possessed with a devil 
 was brought to them, and they could not cast out the devil, whereupon 
 the scribes insulted over them, and reflected upon their Master, and 
 triumphed as if the day were their own. He <I>found the scribes 
 questioning with them,</I> in the hearing of the multitude, some of 
 whom perhaps began to be shocked by it. Thus Moses, when he came down 
 from the mount, found the camp of Israel in great disorder; so soon 
 were Christ and Moses missed. Christ's return was very welcome, no
 doubt, to the disciples, and <I>un</I>welcome to the scribes. But 
 particular notice is taken of its being very surprising to the people, 
 who perhaps were ready to say, <I>As for this Jesus, we wot not what is 
 become of him;</I> but when <I>they beheld him</I> coming to them 
 again, they were <I>greatly amazed</I> (some copies add, <B><I>kai 
 exephobethesan</I></B>--<I>and they were afraid</I>); and <I>running to 
 him</I> (some copies for <B><I>prostrechontes</I></B>, read 
 <B><I>proschairontes</I></B>--<I>congratulating</I> him, or bidding
 him welcome), they saluted him. It is easy to give a reason why they
 should be glad to see him; but why where they <I>amazed, greatly 
 amazed,</I> when they beheld him? Probably, there might remain
 something unusual in his countenance; as Moses's <I>face shone</I> when 
 he came down from the mount, which made the people <I>afraid to come 
 nigh him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:40">Exod. xxxiv. 30</A>.

 So perhaps did Christ's face, in some measure; at least, instead of
 seeming <I>fatigued,</I> there appeared a wonderful briskness and 
 sprightliness in his looks, which <I>amazed</I> them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The case which perplexed the disciples, brought before him. He 
 asked the scribes, who, he knew, were always <I>vexatious</I> to his 
 disciples, and <I>teazing</I> them upon every occasion, "<I>What 
 question ye with them?</I> What is the quarrel now?" The scribes made 
 no answer, for they were confounded at his presence; the disciples made 
 none, for they were comforted, and now left all to him. But the father 
 of the child opened the case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 1. His child is possessed with a <I>dumb spirit;</I> he has the 
 falling-sickness, and in his fits <I>is speechless;</I> his case is 
 very sad, for, wheresoever the fit takes him, the spirit <I>tears</I> 
 him, throws him into such violent convulsions as almost pull him to 
 pieces; and, which is very grievous to himself, and frightful to those 
 about him, <I>he foams</I> at his mouth, and <I>gnashes with his 
 teeth,</I> as one in pain and great misery; and though the fits go off 
 presently, yet they leave him so weak, that he <I>pines away,</I> is 
 worn to a skeleton; his flesh is <I>dried</I> away; so the word 
 signifies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:3-5">Ps. cii. 3-5</A>.

 This was a constant affliction to a tender father.

 2. The disciples cannot give him any relief; "I <I>desired they would
 cast him out,</I> as they had done many, and they would willingly have 
 done it, but <I>they could not;</I> and therefore thou couldest never 
 have come in better time; <I>Master, I have brought him to 
 thee.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The rebuke he gave to them all 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 <I>O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall 
 I suffer you?</I> Dr. Hammond understands this as spoken to the
 disciples, reproving them for not exerting the power he had given them, 
 and because they did not <I>fast</I> and <I>pray,</I> as in some cases 
 he had directed them to do. But Dr. Whitby takes it as a rebuke to the 
 scribes, who gloried in this disappointment that the disciples met 
 with, and hoped to run them down with it. Them he calls a <I>faithless
 generation,</I> and speaks as one weary of <I>being with them,</I> and 
 of <I>bearing with</I> them. We never heard him complaining, "How long 
 shall I be in this low condition, and suffer that?" But, "How long 
 shall I be among these <I>faithless</I> people, and suffer them?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The deplorable condition that the child was actually in, when he 
 was brought to Christ, and the doleful representation which the father 
 made of it. When the child saw Christ, he fell into a fit; <I>The 
 spirit straightway tore him, boiled within him, troubled him</I> (so 
 Dr. Hammond); as if the devil would set Christ at defiance, and hoped 
 to be too hard for him too, and to keep possession in spite of him. The 
 child <I>fell</I> on the <I>ground, and wallowed foaming.</I> We may 
 put another construction upon it--that the devil raged, and had so much
 the greater wrath, because he <I>knew</I> that <I>his time was 
 short,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:12">Rev. vii. 12</A>.

 Christ asked, <I>How long since this came to him?</I> And, it seems, 
 the disease was of long standing; it came to him <I>of a child</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 which made the case the more sad, and the cure more difficult. We are 
 all by nature <I>children of disobedience,</I> and in such the evil 
 spirit <I>works,</I> and has done so from our childhood; for 
 <I>foolishness is bound in the heart of a child,</I> and nothing but 
 the mighty grace of Christ can cast it out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The pressing instances which the father of the child makes with
 Christ for a cure

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);

 <I>Ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to 
 destroy him.</I> Note, The devil aims at the ruin of those in whom he 
 rules and works, and <I>seeks whom he may devour.</I> But, <I>if thou 
 canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.</I> The leper 
 was confident of Christ's power, but put an <I>if</I> upon his will 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:2">Matt. viii. 2</A>);

 <I>If thou wilt, thou canst.</I> This poor man referred himself to his 
 good-will, but put an <I>if</I> upon his power, because his disciples, 
 who cast out devils <I>in his name,</I> had been non-plussed in this 
 case. Thus Christ suffers in his honour by the difficulties and follies 
 of his disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The answer Christ gave to his address 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 <I>If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that 
 believeth.</I> Here, 

 1. He tacitly checks the weakness of his faith. The sufferer put it
 upon Christ's power, <I>If thou canst do any thing,</I> and reflected 
 on the want of power in the disciples; but Christ turns it upon him, 
 and puts him upon questioning his own faith, and will have him impute 
 the disappointment to the want of that; <I>If thou canst believe.</I> 
 
 2. He graciously encourages the strength of his desire; "<I>All things
 are possible,</I> will appear possible, <I>to him that believes</I> the 
 almighty power of God, to which all things are possible;" or "That 
 shall be done by the grace of God, for them that believe in the promise 
 of God, which seemed utterly impossible." Note, In dealing with Christ, 
 very much is put upon our believing, and very much promised it.
 <I>Canst thou believe?</I> Darest thou believe? Art thou willing to
 venture thy all in the hands of Christ? To venture all thy spiritual 
 concerns with him, and all thy temporal concerns for him? Canst thou 
 find in thy heart to do this? If so, it is not impossible but that, 
 though thou has been a great sinner, thou mayest be reconciled; though 
 thou art very mean and unworthy, thou mayest get to heaven. <I>If thou 
 canst believe,</I> it is possible that thy hard heart may be softened, 
 thy spiritual diseases may be cured; and that, weak as thou art, thou 
 mayest be able to hold out to the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The <I>profession of faith</I> which the poor man made hereupon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 He cried out, "<I>Lord, I believe;</I> I am fully persuaded both of thy 
 power and of thy pity; my cure shall not be prevented by the want of 
 faith; <I>Lord, I believe.</I>" He adds a prayer for grace to enable 
 him more firmly to rely upon the assurances he had of the ability and 
 willingness of Christ to save; <I>Help thou my unbelief.</I> Note, 

 1. Even those who through grace can say, <I>Lord, I believe,</I> have
 reason to complain of their unbelief; that they cannot so readily apply 
 to themselves, and their own case, the word of Christ as they should, 
 no so cheerfully depend upon it. 

 2. Those that complain of unbelief, must look up to Christ for grace to
 <I>help</I> them against it, <I>and his grace</I> shall be 
 <I>sufficient for them. "Help mine unbelief,</I> help me to a pardon
 for it, help me with power against it; help out what is wanting in my 
 faith with thy grace, the strength of which is perfected in our 
 weakness."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. The cure of the child, and the conquest of this raging devil in 
 the child. Christ <I>saw the people come running together,</I> 
 expecting to see the issue of this trial of skill, and therefore kept 
 them in suspense no longer, but <I>rebuked the foul spirit;</I> the 
 <I>unclean spirit,</I> so it should be rendered, as in other places. 
 Observe, 

 1. What the charge was which Christ gave to this unclean spirit;
 "<I>Thou dumb and deaf spirit,</I> that makest the poor child dumb and 
 deaf, but shalt thyself be made to <I>hear</I> thy doom, and not be 
 able to <I>say</I> any thing against it, <I>come out of him</I> 
 immediately, and <I>enter no more into him.</I> Let him not only be 
 brought out of this fit, but let his fits never return." Note, Whom 
 Christ cures, he cures effectually. Satan may <I>go out himself,</I> 
 and yet recover possession; but if Christ <I>cast</I> him out, he will 
 <I>keep</I> him out. 

 2. How the unclean spirit took it; he grew yet more outrageous, he
 <I>cried,</I> and <I>rent him sore,</I> gave him such a twitch at 
 parting, that he was <I>as one dead;</I> so loth was he to quit his 
 hold, so exasperated at the superior power of Christ, so malicious to 
 the child, and so desirous was he to kill him. <I>Many said, He is 
 dead.</I> Thus the toss that a soul is in at the breaking of Satan's 
 power in it may perhaps be frightful for the present, but opens the 
 door to lasting comfort. 
 
 3. How the child was perfectly restored

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 <I>Jesus took him by the hand,</I> <B><I>kratesas</I></B>--<I>took
 fast hold of him,</I> and strongly bore him up, and he arose and 
 recovered, and all was well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. The reason he gave to the disciples why they could not cast out 
 this devil. They <I>enquired</I> of him privately <I>why they could 
 not,</I> that wherein they were defective might be made up another
 time, and they might not again be thus publicly shamed; and he told 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 <I>This kind can come forth by nothing but prayer and fasting.</I> 
 Whatever other difference there really might be, none appears between 
 this and other kinds, but that the unclean spirit had had possession of 
 this poor patient <I>from a child,</I> and that strengthened his 
 interest, and confirmed his hold. When <I>vicious habits</I> are rooted 
 by long usage, and begin to plead prescription, like chronical diseases 
 that are <I>hardly cured.</I> <I>Can the &AElig;thiopian change his 
 skin?</I> The disciples must not think to do their work always with a 
 like ease; some services call them to take more than ordinary pains; 
 but Christ can do that with a word's speaking, which they must prevail 
 for the doing of by <I>prayer and fasting.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>30  And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he
 would not that any man should know <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 31  For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of
 man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him;
 and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.
 &nbsp; 32  But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask
 him.
 &nbsp; 33  And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked
 them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?
 &nbsp; 34  But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed
 among themselves, who <I>should be</I> the greatest.
 &nbsp; 35  And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them,
 If any man desire to be first, <I>the same</I> shall be last of all,
 and servant of all.
 &nbsp; 36  And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and
 when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,
 &nbsp; 37  Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name,
 receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me,
 but him that sent me.
 &nbsp; 38  And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting
 out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad
 him, because he followeth not us.
 &nbsp; 39  But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which
 shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.
 &nbsp; 40  For he that is not against us is on our part.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Christ foretels his own approaching sufferings. He <I>passed through 
 Galilee</I> with more expedition than usual, and <I>would not that any 
 man should know of it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>);

 because he had done many mighty and good works among them in vain, they 
 shall not be invited to see them and have the benefit of them, as they 
 have been. The time of his sufferings drew nigh, and therefore he was 
 willing to be private awhile, and to converse only with his disciples, 
 to prepare them for the approaching trial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 He said to them, <I>The Son of man is delivered</I> by the determinate 
 council and fore-knowledge of God <I>into the hands of men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 and <I>they shall kill him.</I> He had been delivered into the hands of 
 devils, and they had worried him, it had not been so strange; but that 
 <I>men,</I> who have <I>reason,</I> and should have <I>love,</I> that 
 they should be thus spiteful to the <I>Son of man,</I> who came to 
 redeem and save them, is unaccountable. But still it is observable that 
 when Christ spoke of his death, he alway spoke of his resurrection, 
 which took away the reproach of it from himself, and should have taken 
 away the grief of it from his disciples. But they <I>understood not 
 that saying,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 The words were plain enough, but they could not be reconciled to the 
 thing, and therefore would suppose them to have some mystical meaning 
 which they did not understand, and they were <I>afraid to ask him;</I> 
 not because he was difficult of access, or stern to those who consulted 
 him, but either because they were loth to know the truth, or because 
 they expected to be chidden for their backwardness to receive it. Many 
 remain ignorant because they are ashamed to enquire.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He rebukes his disciples for magnifying themselves. When he came to 
 Capernaum, he privately asked his disciples what it was they 
 <I>disputed among themselves by the way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 He knew very well what the dispute was, but he would know it <I>from 
 them,</I> and would have them to confess their fault and folly in it. 
 Note, 

 1. We must all expect to be called to an account by our Lord Jesus,
 concerning what passes while we are in the way in this state of passage 
 and probation.

 2. We must in a particular manner be called to an account about our
 discourses among ourselves; for by our words we must be justified or 
 condemned. 

 3. As our other discourses among ourselves by the way, so especially
 our disputes, will be all called over again, and we shall be called to 
 an account about them. 

 4. Of all disputes, Christ will be sure to reckon with his disciples
 for their disputes about precedency and superiority: that was the 
 subject of the debate here, <I>who should be the greater,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Nothing could be more contrary to the two great laws of Christ's 
 kingdom, lessons of his school, and instructions of his example, which 
 are <I>humility</I> and <I>love,</I> than <I>desiring</I> preferment in 
 the world, and <I>disputing</I> about it. This ill temper he took all
 occasions to check, both because it arose from a mistaken notion of his 
 kingdom, as if it were of this world, and because it tended so directly 
 to be debasing of the honour, and the corrupting of the purity, of his 
 gospel, and, he foresaw, would be so much the bane of the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 (1.) They were willing to <I>cover this fault</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 they <I>held their peace.</I> As they would not <I>ask</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),
 
 because they were ashamed to own their ignorance, so here they would 
 not <I>answer</I> because they were ashamed to own their pride. 

 (2.) He was willing to <I>amend this fault</I> in them, and to bring 
 them to a better temper; and therefore <I>sat down,</I> that he might 
 have a solemn and full discourse with them about this matter; he 
 <I>called the twelve to him,</I> and told them, 

 [1.] That ambition and affectation of dignity and dominion, instead of 
 gaining them preferment in his kingdom, would but postpone their 
 preferment; <I>If any man desire</I> and aim <I>to be first,</I> he 
 <I>shall be last;</I> he that exalteth himself, shall be abased, and 
 men's <I>pride</I> shall <I>bring them low.</I>

 [2.] That there is no preferment to be had under him, but an 
 opportunity for, and an obligation to, so much the more labour and 
 condescension; <I>If any man desire to be first,</I> when he is so, he 
 must be much the more busy and serviceable to every body. <I>He that
 desires the office of a bishop, desires a good work,</I> for he must, 
 as St. Paul did, labour the more abundantly, and make himself the 
 <I>servant of all.</I>

 [3.] That those who are most humble and self-denying, do most resemble 
 Christ, and shall be most tenderly owned by him. This he taught them by 
 a sign; <I>He took a child in his arms,</I> that had nothing of pride 
 and ambition in it. "Look you," saith he; "<I>whosoever shall 
 receive</I> one like this child, <I>receives me.</I> Those of a humble, 
 meek, mild disposition are such as I will own and countenance, and 
 encourage every body else to do so too, and will take what is done to 
 them as done to myself; and so will my Father too, for he who thus 
 <I>receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me,</I> and it shall be placed 
 to his account, and repaid with interest."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He rebukes them for <I>vilifying all but themselves;</I> while 
 they are striving which of them should be greatest, they will not allow 
 those who are not in communion with them to be any thing. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The account which John gave him, of the restraint they had laid upon 
 one from making use of the name of Christ, because he was not of their 
 society. Though they were ashamed to own their contests for preferment, 
 they seem to boast of this exercise of their authority, and expected 
 their Master would not only justify them in it, but commend them for 
 it; and hoped he would not blame them for desiring to be great, when 
 they would thus use their power for maintaining the honour of the 
 sacred college. <I>Master,</I> saith John, <I>we saw one casting out
 devils in thy name, but he followeth not us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 (1.) It was strange that the one who was not a professed disciple and 
 follower of Christ, should yet have power to <I>cast out devils,</I> in 
 his name, for that seemed to be peculiar to those whom he called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:7"><I>ch.</I> vi. 7</A>.

 But some think that he was a disciple of John, who made use of the name
 of the Messiah, not as come, but as near at hand, not knowing that 
 Jesus was he. It should rather seem that he made use of the name of 
 Jesus, believing him to be the Christ, as the other disciples did. And 
 why not he receive that power from Christ, whose <I>Spirit,</I> like 
 the wind, <I>blows where it listeth,</I> without such an outward call 
 as the apostles had? And perhaps there were many more such. Christ's 
 grace is not tied to the visible church.

 (2.) It was strange that one who <I>cast out devils</I> in the name of
 Christ, did not join himself to the apostles, and follow Christ with 
 them, but should continue to act in <I>separation</I> from them. I know 
 of nothing that could hinder him from following them, unless because he 
 was loth to leave all to follow them; and if so, that was an ill 
 principle. The thing did not look well, and therefore the disciples 
 <I>forbade him</I> to make use of Christ's name as they did, unless he 
 would follow him as they did. This was like the motion Joshua made 
 concerning Eldad and Medad, that prophesied in the camp, and went not 
 up with the rest to the door of the tabernacle; "<I>My lord Moses, 
 forbid them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:28">Num. xi. 28</A>);

 restrain them, silence them, for it is a schism." Thus apt are we to 
 imagine that those do not follow Christ at all, who do not follow him 
 <I>with us,</I> and that those do nothing well, who do not just as we 
 do. But the <I>Lord knows them that are his,</I> however they are 
 dispersed; and this instance gives us a needful caution, to take heed 
 lest we be carried, by an excess of zeal for the unity of the church, 
 and for that which we are sure is right and good, to oppose that which 
 yet may tend to the enlargement of the church, and the advancement of 
 its true interests another way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The rebuke he gave to them for this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>);

 <I>Jesus said, "Forbid him not,</I> nor any other that does likewise." 
 This was like the check Moses gave to Joshua; <I>Enviest thou for my 
 sake?</I> Note, That which is good, and doeth good, must not be 
 prohibited, though there be some defect or irregularity in the manner 
 of doing it. <I>Casting out devils,</I> and so destroying Satan's 
 kingdom, doing this <I>in Christ's name,</I> and so owning him to be 
 sent of God, and giving honour to him as the Fountain of grace, 
 preaching down sin, and preaching up Christ, are good things, very good 
 things, which ought not to be forbidden to any, merely because they 
 <I>follow not with us.</I> If Christ be preached, Paul therein doth, 
 and will rejoice, though he be eclipsed by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:18">Phil. i. 18</A>.

 Two reasons Christ gives why such should not be forbidden.

 (1.) Because we cannot suppose that any man who makes use of Christ's 
 name in working miracles, should blaspheme his name, as the scribes and 
 Pharisees did. There were those indeed that did <I>in Christ's name
 cast out devils,</I> and yet in other respects were <I>workers of 
 iniquity;</I> but they did not <I>speak evil of Christ.</I> 

 (2.) Because those that differed in communion, while they agreed to 
 fight against Satan under the banner of Christ, ought to look upon one 
 another as on the same side, notwithstanding that difference. <I>He
 that is not against us is on our part.</I> As to the great controversy 
 between Christ an Beelzebub, he had said, <I>He that is not with me is 
 against me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:30">Matt. xii. 30</A>.

 He that will not own Christ, owns Satan. But as to those that own
 Christ, though not in the same circumstances, that follow him, though 
 <I>not with us,</I> we must reckon that though these differ from us, 
 they are not against us, and therefore are <I>on our part,</I> and we 
 must not be any hindrance to their usefulness.</P>

 shall be salted with salt.
 &nbsp; 50  Salt <I>is</I> good: but if the salt have lost his saltness,
 wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have
 peace one with another.

 Here, 

 I. Christ promiseth a reward to all those that are any way kind to his 
 disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>);

 "<I>Whosoever shall give you a cup of water,</I> when you need it, and 
 will be a refreshment to you, <I>because ye belong to Christ,</I> and 
 are of his family, <I>he shall not lose his reward.</I>" Note, 

 1. It is the honour and happiness of Christians, that they <I>belong to
 Christ,</I> they have joined themselves to him, and are owned by him; 
 they wear his livery and retainers to his family; nay, they are more 
 nearly related, they are <I>members of his body.</I> 

 2. They who belong to Christ, may sometimes be reduced to such straits
 as to be glad of a <I>cup of cold water.</I> 

 3. The relieving of Christ's poor in their distresses, is a good deed,
 and will turn a good account; he accepts it, and will reward it. 

 4. What kindness is done to Christ's poor, must be done them <I>for
 his sake,</I> and <I>because they belong to him;</I> for that is it 
 that sanctifies the kindness, and puts a value upon it in the sight of 
 God.

 5. This is a reason why we must not discountenance and discourage those
 who are serving the interests of Christ's kingdom, though they are not 
 in every thing of our mind and way. It comes in here as a reason why 
 those must not be hindered, that cast out devils in Christ's name, 
 though they did not follow him; for (as Dr. Hammond paraphrases it) "It 
 is not only the great eminent performances which are done by you my 
 constant attendants and disciples, that are accepted by me, but every 
 the least degree of sincere faith and Christian performance, 
 proportionable but to the expressing the least kindness, as giving a 
 cup of water to a disciple of mine for being such, shall be accepted 
 and rewarded." If Christ reckons <I>kindness to us</I> services to 
 <I>him,</I> we ought to reckon <I>services to him</I> kindnesses to us, 
 and to encourage them, though done by those that follow not with 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He threatens those that <I>offend</I> his <I>little ones,</I> that 
 wilfully are the occasion of sin or trouble to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 Whosoever shall grieve any true Christians, though they be of the 
 weakest, shall oppose their <I>entrance</I> into the ways of God, or 
 discourage and obstruct their <I>progress</I> in those ways, shall 
 either restrain them from doing good, or draw them in to commit sin, it 
 were <I>better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and 
 he were cast into the sea:</I> his punishment will be very great, and 
 the death and ruin of his soul more terrible than such a death and ruin 
 of his body would be. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:6">Matt. xviii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He warns all his followers to take heed of ruining their own 
 souls. This charity must begin at home; if we must take heed of doing 
 any thing to hinder others from good, and to occasion their sin, much 
 more careful must we be to avoid every thing that will take us off from 
 our duty, or lead us to sin; and that which doth so we must part with, 
 though it be ever so dear to us. This we had twice in Matthew, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:29,30,18:8,9"><I>ch.</I> v. 29, 30,
 and <I>ch.</I> xviii. 8, 9</A>.

 It is here urged somewhat more largely and pressingly; certainly this
 requires our serious regard, which is so much insisted upon.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The case supposed, that our own <I>hand,</I> or <I>eye,</I> or 
 <I>foot, offend us;</I> that the impure <I>corruption</I> we indulge is 
 as dear to us as an eye or a hand, or that that which is to us as an 
 eye or a hand, is become an invisible <I>temptation</I> to sin, or 
 <I>occasion</I> of it. Suppose the beloved is become a sin, or the sin 
 a beloved. Suppose we cannot keep that which is dear to us, but it will 
 be a snare and a stumbling-block; suppose we must part with it, or part 
 with Christ and a good conscience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The duty prescribed in that case; <I>Pluck out the eye, cut off the 
 hand and foot,</I> mortify the darling lust, kill it, crucify it, 
 starve it, make no provision for it. Let the idols that have been 
 <I>delectable</I> things, be cast away as <I>detestable</I> things; 
 keep at a distance from that which is a temptation, though ever so 
 pleasing. It is necessary that the part which is gangrened, should be 
 taken off for the preservation of the whole. <I>Immedicabile vulnus 
 ense recidendum est, ne pars sincera trahatur--The part that is
 incurably wounded must be cut off, lest the parts that are sound be 
 corrupted.</I> We must put ourselves to pain, that we may not bring 
 ourselves to ruin; self must be denied, that it may not be 
 destroyed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The necessity of doing this. The flesh must be mortified, that we 
 may <I>enter into life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:43,45"><I>v.</I> 43, 45</A>),
 
 into the kingdom of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 Though, by abandoning sin, we may, for the present, feel ourselves as 
 if we were <I>halt</I> and <I>maimed</I> (it may seem to be a force put 
 upon ourselves, and may create us some uneasiness), yet it is for 
 <I>life;</I> and all that men have, they will give for their lives: it 
 is for a <I>kingdom,</I> the <I>kingdom of God,</I> which we cannot 
 otherwise obtain; these <I>halts</I> and <I>maims</I> will be the 
 <I>marks of the Lord Jesus,</I> will be in that kingdom <I>scars of 
 honour.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The danger of not doing this. The matter is brought to this issue, 
 that either sin must die, or we must die. If we will lay this 
 <I>Delilah</I> in our bosom, it will betray us; if we be <I>ruled</I> 
 by sin, we shall inevitably be <I>ruined</I> by it; if we must keep our 
 <I>two hands,</I> and <I>two eyes,</I> and <I>two feet,</I> we must 
 with them be <I>cast into hell.</I> Our Saviour often pressed our duty 
 upon us, from the consideration of the torments of hell, which we run 
 ourselves into if we continue in sin. With what an emphasis of terror 
 are those words repeated three times here, <I>Where their worm dieth 
 not, and the fire is not quenched!</I> The words are quoted from 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:24">Isa. lxvi. 24</A>.

 (1.) The reflections and reproaches of the sinner's own conscience are
 the <I>worm that dieth not;</I> which will cleave to the damned soul as 
 the worms do to the dead body, and prey upon it, and never leave it 
 till it is quite devoured. <I>Son, remember,</I> will set this worm 
 gnawing; and how terrible will it bite that word 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:12,23">Prov. v. 12, 23</A>),
 
 <I>How have I hated instruction!</I> The soul that is food to this 
 worm, dies not; and the worm is bred in it, and one with it, and 
 therefore neither doth that die. Damned sinners will be to eternity 
 accusing, condemning, and upbraiding, themselves with their own 
 follies, which, how much soever they are now in love with them, will at 
 the last <I>bite like a serpent,</I> and <I>sting like an adder.</I> 
 
 (2.) The wrath of God fastening upon a guilty and polluted conscience, 
 is the <I>fire</I> that is <I>not quenched;</I> for it is the wrath of 
 the living God, the eternal God, into whose hands it is a fearful thing 
 to fall. There are no operations of the Spirit of grace upon the souls 
 of the damned sinners, and therefore there is nothing to alter the 
 nature of the fuel, which must remain for ever combustible; nor is 
 there any application of the merit of Christ to them, and therefore 
 there is nothing to appease or quench the violence of the fire. Dr.
 Whitby shows that the eternity of the torments of hell was not only the 
 constant faith of the Christian church, but had been so of the Jewish 
 church. Josephus saith, The Pharisees held that the souls of the wicked 
 were to be <I>punished with perpetual punishment;</I> and that there 
 was appointed for them <I>a perpetual prison.</I> And Philo saith, The 
 punishment of the wicked is <I>to live for ever dying,</I> and to be 
 <I>for ever in pains and griefs that never cease.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:49,50">two last verses</A>

 are somewhat difficult, and interpreters agree not in the sense of
 them; <I>for every one</I> in general, or rather every one <I>of 
 them</I> that are cast into hell, shall be <I>salted with fire, and 
 every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.</I> Therefore <I>have salt 
 in yourselves.</I> 

 [1.] It was appointed by the law of Moses, that every sacrifice should 
 be <I>salted with salt,</I> not to <I>preserve</I> it (for it was to be 
 immediately consumed), but because it was the food of God's table, and 
 no flesh is eaten without salt; it was therefore particularly required 
 in the meat-offerings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+2:13">Lev. ii. 13</A>.

 [2.] The nature of man, being <I>corrupt,</I> and as such being called
 <I>flesh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:3,Ps+78:39">Gen. vi. 3; Ps. lxxviii. 39</A>),

 some way or other must be <I>salted,</I> in order to its being a
 sacrifice to God. The <I>salting</I> of fish (and I think of other 
 things) they call the <I>curing</I> of it. 

 [3.] Our chief concern is, to present ourselves <I>living 
 sacrifices</I> to the grace of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1">Rom. xii. 1</A>),

 and, in order to our acceptableness, we must be <I>salted with 
 salt,</I> our corrupt affections must be subdued and mortified, and we 
 must have in our souls a savour of grace. Thus the <I>offering up</I> 
 or <I>sacrificing</I> of the Gentiles is said to be <I>acceptable, 
 being sanctified by the Holy Ghost,</I> as the sacrifices were 
 <I>salted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16">Rom. xv. 16</A>.

 [4.] Those that have the salt of grace, must make it appear that they
 have it; that they <I>have salt in themselves,</I> a living principle 
 of grace in their hearts, which works out all corrupt dispositions, and 
 every thing in the soul that tends to <I>putrefaction,</I> and would 
 <I>offend</I> our God, or our own consciences, as unsavoury meat doth.
 Our <I>speech</I> must be <I>always with grace seasoned with</I> this 
 salt, that no <I>corrupt communication</I> may <I>proceed out of our 
 mouth,</I> but we may loathe it as much as we would to put putrid meat 
 into our mouths.

 [5.] As this gracious salt will keep our own consciences void of 
 offence, so it will keep our conversation with others so, that we may 
 not offend any of Christ's little ones, but may be <I>at peace one with 
 another.</I>

 [6.] We must not only have this salt of grace, but we must always 
 retain the relish and savour of it; for if this <I>salt lose its 
 saltiness,</I> if a Christian revolt from his Christianity, if he loses 
 the savour of it, and be no longer under the power and influence of it, 
 what can recover him, or <I>wherewith will ye season him?</I> This was 
 said 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:13">Matt. v. 13</A>.

 [7.] Those that present not themselves <I>living</I> sacrifices to 
 God's grace, shall be made for ever <I>dying</I> sacrifices to his 
 justice, and since they would not give honour to him, he will get him 
 honour upon them; they would not be <I>salted with the salt</I> of 
 divine grace, would not admit that to subdue their corrupt affections, 
 no, they would not submit to the operation, could not bear the 
 corrosives that were necessary to eat out the proud flesh, it was to 
 them like cutting off a hand, or plucking out an eye; and therefore in 
 hell they shall be <I>salted with fire;</I> coals of fire shall be 
 <I>scattered</I> upon them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+10:2">Ezek. x. 2</A>),

 as salt upon the meat, and <I>brimstone</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:15">Job xviii. 15</A>),

 as fire and brimstone were rained on Sodom; the pleasures they have 
 lived <I>in, shall eat their flesh, as it were with fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:3">Jam. v. 3</A>.
 
 The pain of mortifying the flesh now is no more to be compared with the
 punishment for not mortifying it, than <I>salting</I> with 
 <I>burning.</I> And since he had said, that the <I>fire</I> of hell 
 <I>shall not be quenched,</I> but it might be objected, that the fuel 
 will not last always, he here intimates, that by the power of God it 
 shall be made to last always; for those that are <I>cast into hell,</I> 
 will find the fire to have not only the <I>corroding</I> quality of 
 salt, but its <I>preserving</I> quality; whence it is used to signify 
 that which is <I>lasting:</I> a covenant of <I>salt</I> is a 
 <I>perpetual</I> covenant, and Lot's wife being turned into a <I>pillar 
 of salt,</I> made her a remaining monument of divine vengeance. Now 
 since this will certainly be the doom of those that do not crucify the 
 flesh with its affections and lusts, let us, knowing this <I>terror of 
 the Lord,</I> be <I>persuaded</I> to do it.</P>
