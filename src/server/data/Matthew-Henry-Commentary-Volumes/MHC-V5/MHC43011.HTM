 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have the history of that illustrious miracle which 
 Christ wrought a little before his death--the raising of Lazarus to
 life, which is recorded only by this evangelist; for the other three 
 confine themselves to what Christ did in Galilee, where he resided 
 most, and scarcely ever carried their history into Jerusalem till the 
 passion-week: whereas John's memoirs relate chiefly to what passed at
 Jerusalem; this passage therefore was reserved for his pen. Some 
 suggest that, when the other evangelists wrote, Lazarus was alive, and 
 it would not well agree either with his safety or with his humility to 
 have it recorded till now, when it is supposed he was dead. It is more 
 largely recorded than any other of Christ's miracles, not only because 
 there are many circumstances of it so very instructive and the miracle 
 of itself so great a proof of Christ's mission, but because it was an 
 earnest of that which was to be the crowning proof of all--Christ's own
 resurrection. Here is, 

 I. The tidings sent to our Lord Jesus of the sickness of Lazarus, and
 his entertainment of those tidings,

 death, and their entertainment of the visit,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now a certain <I>man</I> was sick, <I>named</I> Lazarus, of Bethany,
 the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
 &nbsp; 2  (It was <I>that</I> Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment,
 and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was
 sick.)
 &nbsp; 3  Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he
 whom thou lovest is sick.
 &nbsp; 4  When Jesus heard <I>that,</I> he said, This sickness is not unto
 death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be
 glorified thereby.
 &nbsp; 5  Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
 &nbsp; 6  When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two
 days still in the same place where he was.
 &nbsp; 7  Then after that saith he to <I>his</I> disciples, Let us go into
 Jud&aelig;a again.
 &nbsp; 8  <I>His</I> disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought
 to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
 &nbsp; 9  Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any
 man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light
 of this world.
 &nbsp; 10  But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there
 is no light in him.
 &nbsp; 11  These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our
 friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of
 sleep.
 &nbsp; 12  Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do
 well.
 &nbsp; 13  Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he
 had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
 &nbsp; 14  Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
 &nbsp; 15  And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the
 intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.
 &nbsp; 16  Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his
 fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A particular account of the parties principally concerned in this 
 story, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 1. They lived at <I>Bethany,</I> a village nor far from Jerusalem, 
 where Christ usually lodged when he came up to the feasts. It is here
 called the <I>town of Mary and Martha,</I> that is, the town where they 
 dwelt, as Bethsaida is called the <I>city of Andrew and Peter,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:44"><I>ch.</I> i. 44</A>.

 For I see no reason to think, as some do, that Martha and Mary were
 owners of the town, and the rest were <I>their</I> tenants.

 2. Here was a brother named <I>Lazarus;</I> his <I>Hebrew</I> name
 probably was <I>Eleazar,</I> which being contracted, and a Greek
 termination put to it, is made <I>Lazarus.</I> Perhaps in prospect of
 this history our Saviour made use of the name of <I>Lazarus</I> in that
 parable wherein he designed to set forth the blessedness of the
 righteous in the bosom of Abraham immediately after death,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:22">Luke xvi. 22</A>.

 3. Here were two sisters, <I>Martha</I> and <I>Mary,</I> who seem to
 have been the housekeepers, and to have managed the affairs of the 
 family, while perhaps Lazarus lived a retired life, and gave himself to 
 study and contemplation. Here was a decent, happy, well-ordered family, 
 and a family that Christ was very much conversant with, where yet there 
 was neither husband nor wife (for aught that appears), but the house
 kept by a brother, and his sisters dwelling together in unity. 

 4. One of the sisters is particularly described to be <I>that Mary
 which anointed the Lord with ointment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Some think she was that woman that we read of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:37,38">Luke vii. 37, 38</A>,

 who had been a <I>sinner,</I> a bad woman. I rather think it refers to
 that anointing of Christ which this evangelist relates

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:3"><I>ch.</I> xii. 3</A>);

 for the evangelists do never refer one to another, but John frequently
 refers in one place of his gospel to another. Extraordinary acts of
 piety and devotion, that come from an honest principle of love to
 Christ, will not only find acceptance with him, but gain reputation in
 the church, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:13">Matt. xxvi. 13</A>.

 This was she <I>whose brother Lazarus was sick;</I> and the sickness of
 those we love is our affliction. The more friends we have the more 
 frequently we are thus afflicted by sympathy; and the dearer they are 
 the more grievous it is. The multiplying of our comforts is but the 
 multiplying of our cares and crosses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The tidings that were sent to our Lord Jesus of the sickness of 
 Lazarus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 <I>His sisters</I> knew where Jesus was, a great way off beyond Jordan, 
 and they sent a special messenger to him, to acquaint him with the 
 affliction of their family, in which they manifest, 

 1. The affection and concern they had for their brother. Though, it is
 likely, his estate would come to them after his death, yet they 
 earnestly desired his life, as they ought to do. They showed their love 
 to him now that he was sick, for a <I>brother is born for 
 adversity,</I> and so is a sister too. We must weep with our friends 
 when they weep, as well as rejoice with them when they rejoice. 

 2. The regard they had to the Lord Jesus, whom they were willing to
 make acquainted with all their concerns, and, like Jephthah, to utter 
 all their words before him. Though God knows all our wants, and
 griefs, and cares, he will know them from us, and is honoured by our 
 laying them before him. The message they sent was very short, not 
 <I>petitioning,</I> much less <I>prescribing</I> or <I>pressing,</I> 
 but barely relating the case with the tender insinuation of a powerful 
 plea, <I>Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</I> They do not 
 say, He whom <I>we</I> love, but <I>he whom thou lovest.</I> Our 
 greatest encouragements in prayer are fetched from God himself and from 
 his grace. They do not say, Lord, behold, he <I>who loveth thee,</I> 
 but <I>he whom thou lovest;</I> for <I>herein is love, not that we 
 loved God, but that he loved us.</I> Our love to him is not worth 
 speaking of, but his to us can never be enough spoken of. Note,

 (1.) There are some of the friends and followers of the Lord Jesus for 
 whom he has a special kindness above others. Among the twelve there was 
 one whom Jesus loved. 

 (2.) It is no new thing for those whom Christ loves to be sick: all 
 things come alike to all. Bodily distempers correct the corruption,
 and try the graces, of God's people. 

 (3.) It is a great comfort to us, when we are sick, to have those about 
 us that will pray for us. 

 (4.) We have great encouragement in our prayers for those who are sick,
 if we have ground to hope that they are such as Christ loves; and we 
 have reason to love and pray for those whom we have reason to think 
 Christ loves and cares for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. An account how Christ entertained the tidings brought him of the 
 illness of his friend.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He prognosticated the event and issue of the sickness, and probably 
 sent it as a message to the sisters of Lazarus by the express, to 
 support them while he delayed to come to them. Two things he 
 prognosticates:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>This sickness is not unto death.</I> It was mortal, proved
 <I>fatal,</I> and no doubt but Lazarus was truly dead for four days. 
 But, 

 [1.] That was not the errand upon which this sickness was sent; it came 
 not, as in a common case, to be a summons to the grave, but there was a 
 further intention in it. Had it been sent on that errand, his <I>rising 
 from the dead would have defeated it.</I> 

 [2.] That was not the final effect of this sickness. He <I>died,</I> 
 and yet it might be said he did not <I>die,</I> for <I>factum non 
 dicitur quod non perseverat--That is not said to be done which is not 
 done for a perpetuity.</I> Death is an everlasting farewell to this 
 world; it is the way whence we shall not return; and in this sense it 
 was <I>not unto death.</I> The grave was his <I>long home,</I> his 
 <I>house of eternity.</I> Thus Christ said of the maid whom he proposed 
 to restore to life, <I>She is not dead.</I> The sickness of good 
 people, how threatening soever, is <I>nor unto death,</I> for it is not 
 unto <I>eternal</I> death. The body's death to this world is the soul's 
 birth into another world; when we or our friends are sick, we make it 
 our principal support that there is hope of a recovery, but in that we 
 may be disappointed; therefore it is our wisdom to build upon that in 
 which we cannot be disappointed; if they belong to Christ, let the 
 worst come to the worst, they cannot be <I>hurt of the second 
 death,</I> and then not much hurt of the first.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>But it is for the glory of God,</I> that an opportunity may be 
 given for the manifesting of God's glorious power. The afflictions of 
 the saints are designed for the glory of God, that he may have 
 opportunity of showing them favour; for the sweetest mercies, and the 
 most effecting, are those which are occasioned by trouble. Let this 
 reconcile us to the darkest dispensations of Providence, they are all 
 for the glory of God, this sickness, this loss, or this disappointment, 
 is so; and, if God be glorified, we ought to be satisfied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:3">Lev. x. 3</A>.
 
 It was for the glory of God, for it was <I>that the Son of God might be 
 glorified thereby,</I> as it gave him occasion to work that glorious 
 miracle, the <I>raising of him from the dead.</I> As, before, the man 
 was <I>born blind</I> that Christ might have the honour of curing him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:3"><I>ch.</I> ix. 3</A>),

 so Lazarus must be sick and die, that Christ may be glorified as the
 Lord of life. Let this comfort those whom Christ loves under all their
 grievances that the design of them all is that <I>the Son of God may be
 glorified thereby,</I> his wisdom, power, and goodness, glorified in
 supporting and relieving them; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:9,10">2 Cor. xii. 9, 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He deferred visiting his patient, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 They had pleaded, <I>Lord, it is he whom thou lovest,</I> and the plea 
 is allowed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</I> Thus the claims
 of faith are ratified in the court of heaven. Now one would think it 
 should follow, <I>When he heard therefore that he was sick</I> he made 
 all the haste that he could to him; if he loved them, now was a time to 
 show it by hastening to them, for he knew they impatiently expected 
 him. But he took the contrary way to show his love: it is not said, He 
 loved them and <I>yet</I> he lingered; but he loved them and 
 <I>therefore</I> he lingered; when he heard that his friend was sick, 
 instead of coming post to him, he abode <I>two days still in the same 
 place where he was.</I> 

 (1.) He <I>loved them,</I> that is, had a great opinion of Martha and 
 Mary, of their wisdom and grace, of their faith and patience, above 
 others of his disciples, and therefore he deferred coming to them, that 
 he might try them, that their trial might at last <I>be found to praise 
 and honour.</I> 

 (2.) He <I>loved them,</I> that is, he designed to do something great 
 and extraordinary for them, to work such a miracle for their relief as 
 he had not wrought for any of his friends; and therefore he delayed 
 coming to them, that Lazarus might be <I>dead</I> and <I>buried</I> 
 before he came. If Christ had come presently, and cured the sickness of 
 Lazarus, he had done no more than he did for <I>many;</I> if he had 
 raised him to life when newly dead, no more than he had done for 
 <I>some:</I> but, deferring his relief so long, he had an opportunity 
 of doing more for him than for <I>any.</I> Note, God hath gracious 
 intentions even in seeming delays,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:7,8,49:14">Isa. liv. 7, 8; xlix. 14</A>,

 &c. Christ's friends at Bethany were not out of his thoughts, though,
 when he heard of their distress, he made no haste to them. When the 
 work of deliverance, temporal or spiritual, public or personal, stands 
 at a stay, it does but stay the time, and <I>every thing is beautiful 
 in its season.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The discourse he had with his disciples when he was about to visit 
 his friends at Bethany, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:7-16"><I>v.</I> 7-16</A>.

 The conference is so very free and familiar as to make out what Christ 
 saith, <I>I have called you friends.</I> Two things he discourses 
 about--his own <I>danger</I> and Lazarus's <I>death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His own danger in going into Judea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:7-10"><I>v.</I> 7-10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is the notice which Christ gave his disciples of his purpose 
 to go into Judea towards Jerusalem. His disciples were the men of his 
 counsel, and to them he saith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 "<I>Let us go into Judea again,</I> though those of Judea are unworthy
 of such a favour." Thus Christ repeats the tenders of his mercy to
 those who have often rejected them. Now this may be considered,

 [1.] As a purpose of his kindness to his friends at Bethany, whose
 affliction, and all the aggravating circumstances of it, he knew very
 well, though no more expresses were sent to him; for he was present in
 spirit, though absent in body. When he knew they were brought to the
 last extremity, when the brother and sisters had given and taken a
 final farewell, "Now," saith he, "let us go to Judea." Christ will
 arise in favour of his people when <I>the time to favour them, yea, the
 set time, is come;</I> and the worst time is commonly the set
 time--when <I>our hope is lost, and we are cut off for our parts;</I>
 then they shall <I>know that I am the Lord</I> when <I>I have opened
 the graves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:11,13">Ezek. xxxvii. 11, 13</A>.

 In the depths of affliction, let this therefore keep us out of the
 depths of despair, that man's extremity is God's opportunity, 
 <I>Jehovah-jireh.</I> Or,

 [2.] As a trial of the courage of the disciples, whether they would 
 venture to follow him thither, where they had so lately been frightened 
 by an attempt upon their Master's life, which they looked upon as an 
 attempt upon theirs too. To go to Judea, which was so lately made 
 <I>too hot</I> for them, was a saying that <I>proved them.</I> But 
 Christ did not say, "<I>Go you into Judea,</I> and I will stay and take 
 shelter here;" no, <I>Let us go.</I> Note, Christ never brings his 
 people into any peril but he accompanies them in it, and is with them 
 even when they <I>walk through the valley of the shadow of 
 death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their objection against this journey 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee, and goest thou
 thither again?</I> Here,

 [1.] They remind him of the danger he had been in there not long since. 
 Christ's disciples are apt to make a greater matter of sufferings than 
 their Master does, and to remember injuries longer. He had put up with 
 the affront, it was over and gone, and forgotten, but his disciples 
 could not forget it; <I>of late,</I> <B><I>nyn</I></B>--<I>now,</I> as
 if it were this very day, they <I>sought to stone thee.</I> Though it 
 was at least two months ago, the remembrance of the fright was fresh in 
 their minds. 

 [2.] They marvel that he will <I>go thither again.</I> "Wilt thou 
 favour those with thy presence that have expelled thee out of their 
 coasts?" Christ's ways in passing by offences are <I>above our 
 ways.</I> "Wilt thou expose thyself among a people that are so 
 desperately enraged against thee? <I>Goest thou thither again,</I> 
 where thou hast been so ill used?" Here they showed great care for 
 their Master's safety, as Peter did, when he said, <I>Master, spare 
 thyself;</I> had Christ been inclined to shift off suffering, he did 
 not want friends to persuade him to it, but he had <I>opened his mouth 
 to the Lord,</I> and he would not, he could not, go back. Yet, while 
 the disciples show a concern for his safety, they discover at the same 
 time, <I>First,</I> A distrust of his power; as if he could not secure 
 both himself and them now in Judea as well as he had done formerly. Is 
 his arm shortened? When we are solicitous for the interests of Christ's 
 church and kingdom in the world, we must yet rest satisfied in the 
 wisdom and power of the Lord Jesus, who knows how to secure a flock of 
 sheep in the midst of a herd of wolves. <I>Secondly,</I> A secret fear 
 of suffering themselves; for they count upon this if he suffer. When 
 our own private interests happen to run in the same channel with those 
 of the public, we are apt to think ourselves zealous for the Lord of 
 hosts, when really we are only zealous for our own wealth, credit, 
 ease, and safety, and <I>seek our own things,</I> under colour of 
 seeking the things of Christ; we have therefore need to distinguish 
 upon our principles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Christ's answer to this objection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 <I>Are there not twelve hours in the day?</I> The Jews divided every
 day into twelve hours, and made their hours longer or shorter according 
 as the days were, so that an hour with them was the twelfth part of the 
 time between sun and sun; so some. Or, lying much more south than we, 
 their days were nearer twelve hours long than ours. The divine 
 Providence has given us day-light to work by, and lengthens it out to a 
 competent time; and, reckoning the year round, <I>every country</I> has 
 just as much <I>daylight as night,</I> and so much more as the 
 <I>twilights</I> amount to. Man's life is a <I>day;</I> this day is 
 divided into divers ages, states, and opportunities, as into hours 
 shorter or longer, as God has appointed; the consideration of this 
 should make us not only <I>very busy,</I> as to the <I>work</I> of life 
 (if there were <I>twelve hours in the day,</I> each of them ought to be 
 filled up with duty, and none of <I>them</I> trifled away), but also 
 <I>very easy</I> as to the perils of life; our day shall be lengthened 
 out till our work be done, and our testimony finished. This Christ 
 applies to his case, and shows why he must go to Judea, because he had 
 a <I>clear call to go.</I> For the opening of this,

 [1.] He shows the comfort and satisfaction which a man has in his own 
 mind while he keeps in the way of his duty, as it is in general 
 prescribed by the word of God, and particularly determined by the 
 providence of God: <I>If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not;</I> 
 that is, If a man keep close to his duty, and mind that, and set the 
 will of God before him as his rule, with an impartial respect to all 
 God's commandments, he does not <I>hesitate</I> in his own mind, but, 
 <I>walking uprightly, walks surely,</I> and with a holy confidence. As 
 he that walks in the day stumbles not, but goes on steadily and 
 cheerfully in his way, <I>because he sees the light of this world,</I> 
 and by it sees his way before him; so a good man, without any 
 collateral security or sinister aims, relies upon the word of God as 
 his rule, and regards the glory of God as his end, <I>because he 
 sees</I> those two great lights, and keeps his eye upon them; thus he 
 is furnished with a faithful guide in all his doubts, and a powerful 
 guard in all his dangers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:4,Ps+119:6">Gal. vi. 4; Ps. cxix. 6</A>.

 Christ, wherever he went, walked <I>in the day,</I> and so shall we, if
 we follow his steps.

 [2.] He shows the pain and peril a man is in who walks not according to 
 this rule 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>If a man walk in the night, he stumbles;</I> that is, If a man walk
 in the way of his heart, and the sight of his eyes, and according to
 the course of this world,--if he consult his own carnal reasonings more
 than the will and glory of God,--he falls into temptations and snares,
 is liable to great uneasiness and frightful apprehensions, trembles at
 the <I>shaking of a leaf,</I> and <I>flees</I> when none
 <I>pursues;</I> while an upright man <I>laughs at the shaking of the
 spear,</I> and stands undaunted when ten thousand invade. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:14-16">Isa. xxxiii. 14-16</A>,

 he stumbles, <I>because there is no light in him,</I> for light in us
 is that to our moral actions which light about us is to our natural 
 actions. He has not a good principle within; he is not sincere; his eye 
 is evil. Thus Christ not only justifies his purpose of going into 
 Judea, but encourages his disciples to go along with him, and fear no 
 evil.</P>

 2. The death of Lazarus is here discoursed of between Christ and his 
 disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:11-16"><I>v.</I> 11-16</A>,
 
 where we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The notice Christ gave his disciples of death of Lazarus, and an 
 intimation that his business into Judea was to look after him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 After he had prepared his disciples for this dangerous march into an 
 enemy's country, he then gives them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Plain intelligence of the death of Lazarus, though he had received 
 no advice of it: <I>Our friend Lazarus sleepeth.</I> See here how 
 Christ calls a believer and a believer's death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He calls a believer his friend: <I>Our friend 
 Lazarus.</I> Note, 

 1. There is a covenant of friendship between Christ and believers, and 
 a friendly affection and communion pursuant to it, which our Lord Jesus 
 will own and not be ashamed of. <I>His secret is with the 
 righteous.</I> 

 2. Those whom Christ is pleased to own as his friends all his disciples
 should take for <I>theirs.</I> Christ speaks of Lazarus as their common 
 friend: <I>Our friend.</I> 

 3. Death itself does not break the bond of friendship between Christ 
 and a believer. Lazarus is dead, and yet he is still <I>our
 friend.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He calls the death of a believer a <I>sleep: he 
 sleepeth.</I> It is good to call death by such names and titles as will 
 help to make it more <I>familiar</I> and less <I>formidable</I> to us. 
 The death of Lazarus was in a peculiar sense a sleep, as that of 
 Jairus's daughter, because he was to be raised again speedily; and, 
 since we are sure to <I>rise again at last,</I> why should that make 
 any great difference? And why should not the believing hope of that 
 resurrection to eternal life make it as easy to us to put off the body 
 and die as it is to put off our clothes and go to sleep? A good 
 Christian, when he dies, does but sleep: he rests from the labours of 
 the day past, and is refreshing himself for the next morning. Nay, 
 herein death has the advantage of sleep, that sleep is only the 
 <I>parenthesis,</I> but death is the <I>period,</I> of our cares and 
 toils. The soul does not sleep, but becomes more active; but the body 
 sleeps without any toss, without any terror; not distempered nor 
 disturbed. The grave to the wicked is a prison, and its grave-clothes 
 as the shackles of a criminal reserved for execution; but to the godly 
 it is a bed, and all its bands as the soft and downy fetters of an easy 
 quiet sleep. Though the body <I>corrupt,</I> it will rise in the 
 morning as if it had never seen corruption; it is but putting off our 
 clothes to be mended and trimmed up for the marriage day, the 
 coronation day, to which we must rise. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:2,1Th+4:14">Isa. lvii. 2; 1 Thess. iv. 14</A>.

 The Greeks called their burying-places
 <I>dormitories</I>--<B><I>koimeteria</I></B>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Particular intimations of his favourable intentions concerning 
 Lazarus: <I>but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</I> He could 
 have done it, and yet have staid where he was: he that restored at a
 distance one that was <I>dying</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:50"><I>ch.</I> iv. 50</A>)

 could have raised at a distance one that was <I>dead;</I> but he would
 put this honour upon the miracle, to work it by the grave side: <I>I 
 go, to awake him.</I> As sleep is a resemblance of death, so a man's 
 awaking out of sleep when he is called, especially when he is called by 
 his own name, is an emblem of the resurrection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:15">Job xiv. 15</A>):

 <I>Then shalt thou call.</I> Christ had no sooner said, <I>Our friend
 sleeps,</I> but presently he adds, <I>I go, that I may awake him.</I> 
 When Christ tells his people at any time how bad the case is he lets 
 them know in the same breath how easily, how quickly, he can mend it.
 Christ's telling his disciples that this was his business to Judea 
 might help to take off their fear of going with him thither; he did not 
 go up on a public errand to the temple, but a private visit, which 
 would not so much expose him and them; and, besides, it was to do a 
 kindness to a family to which they were all obliged.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their mistake of the meaning of this notice, and the blunder they 
 made about it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>):

 They said, <I>Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</I> This intimates,

 [1.] <I>Some concern</I> they had for their friend Lazarus; they hoped 
 he would recover; <B><I>sothesetai</I></B>--<I>he shall be saved</I> 
 from dying at this time. Probably they had understood, by the messenger 
 who brought news of his illness, that one of the most threatening 
 symptoms he was under was that he was restless, and could get no sleep; 
 and now that they heard he slept they concluded the fever was going 
 off, and the worst was past. Sleep is often nature's physic, and 
 reviving to its weak and weary powers. This is true of the sleep of 
 death; if a good Christian so <I>sleep,</I> he shall do well, better 
 than he did here. 

 [2.] A <I>greater concern</I> for themselves; for hereby they insinuate 
 that it was now needless for Christ to go to him, and expose himself 
 and them. "If he sleep, he will be quickly well, and we may stay where 
 we are." Thus we are willing to hope that the good work which we are 
 called to do will do itself, or will be done by some other hand, if 
 there be peril in the doing of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) This mistake of theirs rectified 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Jesus spoke of his death.</I> See here,

 [1.] How dull of understanding Christ's disciples as yet were. Let us 
 not therefore condemn all those as heretics who mistake the sense of 
 some of Christ's sayings. It is not good to aggravate our brethren's 
 mistakes; yet this was a <I>gross</I> one, for it had easily been 
 prevented if they had remembered how frequently death is called a sleep 
 in the Old Testament. They should have understood Christ when he spoke 
 scripture language. Besides, it would sound oddly for their Master to 
 undertake a journey of two or three days only to awake a friend out of 
 a natural sleep, which any one else might do. What Christ undertakes to 
 do, we may be sure, is something great and uncommon, and a work 
 <I>worthy of himself.</I> 

 [2.] How carefully the evangelist corrects this error: <I>Jesus spoke 
 of his death.</I> Those that speak in an unknown tongue, or use 
 similitudes, should learn hence to <I>explain themselves,</I> and pray 
 that they may interpret, to prevent mistakes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The plain and express declaration which Jesus made to them of the 
 death of Lazarus, and his resolution to go to Bethany, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 [1.] He gives them notice of the death of Lazarus; what he had before 
 said darkly he now says plainly, and without a figure: <I>Lazarus is 
 dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Christ takes cognizance of the death of his saints, for it is precious 
 in his sight

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:15">Ps. cxvi. 15</A>),

 and he is not pleased if we do not consider it, and lay it to heart.
 See what a compassionate teacher Christ is, and how he condescends to 
 those that are out of the way, and by his subsequent sayings and doings 
 explains the difficulties of what went before.

 [2.] He gives them the reason why he had delayed so long to go and see 
 him: <I>I am glad for your sakes that I was not there.</I> If he had 
 been there time enough, he would have healed his disease and prevented 
 his death, which would have been much for the comfort of Lazarus's 
 friends, but then his disciples would have seen no further proof of his 
 power than what they had often seen, and, consequently, their faith had 
 received no improvement; but now that he went and raised him from the 
 dead, as there were many brought to <I>believe on him</I> who before 
 did no 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>),

 so there was much done towards the perfecting of what was lacking in
 the faith of those that did, which Christ aimed at: <I>To the intent 
 that you may believe.</I>

 [3.] He resolves now to go to Bethany, and take his disciples along 
 with him: <I>Let us go unto him.</I> Not, "Let us go to his sisters, to 
 comfort them" (which is the utmost we can do), but, Let us go <I>to 
 him;</I> for Christ can <I>show wonders to the dead.</I> Death, which 
 will separate us from all our other friends, and cut us off from 
 correspondence with them, cannot separate us from the love of Christ, 
 nor put us out of the reach of his calls; as he will maintain his 
 <I>covenant with the dust,</I> so he can make visits to the dust.
 <I>Lazarus is dead,</I> but <I>let us go to him;</I> though perhaps 
 those who said, If he sleep there is <I>no need</I> to go, were ready 
 to say, If he be dead it is to <I>no purpose</I> to go.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Thomas exciting his fellow-disciples cheerfully to attend their 
 Master's motions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Thomas, who is called Didymus.</I> Thomas in Hebrew and Didymus in
 Greek signify a <I>twin;</I> it is said of Rebekah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:24">Gen. xxv. 24</A>)

 that there were <I>twins in her womb;</I> the word is <I>Thomim.</I>
 Probably Thomas was a <I>twin.</I> He said <I>to his 
 fellow-disciples</I> (who probably looked with fear and concern upon 
 one another when Christ had said so positively, <I>Let us go to 
 him</I>), very courageously, <I>Let us also go that we may die with 
 him; with him,</I> that is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] With Lazarus, who was now dead; so some take it. Lazarus was a 
 dear and loving friend both to Christ and his disciples, and perhaps 
 Thomas had a particular intimacy with him. Now if he be dead, saith he, 
 <I>let us</I> even <I>go and die with him.</I> For, <I>First,</I> "If 
 we <I>survive,</I> we know not how to <I>live without him.</I>" 
 Probably Lazarus had done them many good offices, sheltered them, and 
 provided for them, and been to them <I>instead of eyes;</I> and now 
 that he was gone they had <I>no man like-minded,</I> and "Therefore," 
 saith he, "we had as good die with him." Thus we are sometimes ready to 
 think our lives bound up in the lives of some that were dear to us: but 
 God will teach us to live, and to live comfortably, upon himself, when 
 those are gone without whom we thought we could not live. But this is 
 not all. <I>Secondly,</I> "If we die, we hope to be <I>happy with 
 him.</I>" Such a firm belief he has of a happiness on the other side 
 death, and such good hope through grace of their own and Lazarus's 
 interest in it, that he is willing they should all go and <I>die with 
 him.</I> It is better to die, and go along with our Christian friends 
 to that world which is enriched by their removal to it, than stay 
 behind in a world that is impoverished by their departure out of it. 
 The more of our friends are translated hence, the fewer cords we have 
 to bind us to this earth, and the more to draw our hearts heavenwards. 
 How pleasantly does the good man speak of dying, as if it were but 
 undressing and going to bed!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] "Let us go and die <I>with our Master,</I> who is now exposing 
 himself to death by venturing into Judea;" and so I rather think it is 
 meant. "If he will go into danger, let us also go and take our lot with 
 him, according to the command we received, <I>Follow me.</I>" Thomas 
 knew so much of the malice of the Jews against Christ, and the counsels 
 of God concerning him, which he had often told them of, that it was no 
 foreign supposition that he was now going to die. And now Thomas 
 manifests, <I>First,</I> A gracious readiness to die with Christ 
 himself, flowing from strong affections to him, though his faith was 
 weak, as appeared afterwards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:5,20:25"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 5; xx. 25</A>.

 <I>Where thou diest I will die,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:17">Ruth i. 17</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> A zealous desire to help his fellow-disciples into the
 same frame: "<I>Let us go,</I> one and all, and <I>die with him;</I> if 
 they stone him, let them stone us; who would desire to survive such a 
 Master?" Thus, in difficult times, Christians should animate one 
 another. We may each of us say, <I>Let us die with him.</I> Note, The 
 consideration of the dying of the Lord Jesus should make us willing to 
 die whenever God calls for us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Then when Jesus came, he found that he had <I>lain</I> in the
 grave four days already.
 &nbsp; 18  Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs
 off:
 &nbsp; 19  And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort
 them concerning their brother.
 &nbsp; 20  Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming,
 went and met him: but Mary sat <I>still</I> in the house.
 &nbsp; 21  Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here,
 my brother had not died.
 &nbsp; 22  But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God,
 God will give <I>it</I> thee.
 &nbsp; 23  Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
 &nbsp; 24  Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in
 the resurrection at the last day.
 &nbsp; 25  Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he
 that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
 &nbsp; 26  And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
 Believest thou this?
 &nbsp; 27  She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the
 Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
 &nbsp; 28  And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary
 her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for
 thee.
 &nbsp; 29  As soon as she heard <I>that,</I> she arose quickly, and came
 unto him.
 &nbsp; 30  Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that
 place where Martha met him.
 &nbsp; 31  The Jews then which were with her in the house, and
 comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and
 went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep
 there.
 &nbsp; 32  Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she
 fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been
 here, my brother had not died.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The matter being determined, that Christ will go to Judea, and his 
 disciples with him, they address themselves to their journey; in this 
 journey some circumstances happened which the other evangelists record, 
 as the healing of the blind man at Jericho, and the conversion of 
 Zaccheus. We must not reckon ourselves out of our way, while we are in 
 the way of doing good; nor be so intent upon one good office as to 
 neglect another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 At length, he comes near to Bethany, which is said to be about 
 <I>fifteen furlongs</I> from Jerusalem, about two measured miles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Notice is taken of this, that this miracle was in effect wrought <I>in 
 Jerusalem,</I> and so was put to her score. Christ's miracles in
 Galilee were more <I>numerous,</I> but those in or near Jerusalem were 
 more <I>illustrious;</I> there he healed one that had been diseased 
 <I>thirty-eight years,</I> another that had been blind <I>from his 
 birth,</I> and raised one that had been dead <I>four days.</I> To 
 Bethany Christ came, and observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What posture he found his friends there in. When he had been last 
 with them it is probable that he left them well, in health and joy; but 
 when we part from our friends (though Christ knew) we know not what 
 changes may affect us or them before we meet again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He found his friend Lazarus <I>in the grave,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 When he came near the town, probably by the burying-place belonging to 
 the town, he was told by the neighbours, or some persons whom he met, 
 that Lazarus had been <I>four days buried.</I> Some think that Lazarus 
 died the same day that the messenger came to Jesus with the tidings of 
 his sickness, and so reckon two days for his abode in the same place 
 and two days for his journey. I rather think that Lazarus died at the 
 very instant that Jesus, <I>"Our friend sleepeth,</I> he is now newly 
 fallen asleep;" and that the time between his death and burial (which 
 among the Jews was but short), with the four days of his lying in the 
 grave, was taken up in this journey; for Christ travelled publicly, as 
 appears by his passing through Jericho, and his abode at Zaccheus's 
 house took up some time. Promised salvations, though they always come 
 surely, yet often come slowly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He found his friends that survived <I>in grief.</I> Martha and Mary 
 were almost swallowed up with sorrow for the death of their brother, 
 which is intimated where it is said that <I>many of the Jews came to 
 Martha and Mary to comfort them.</I> Note, 

 (1.) Ordinarily, where death is there are <I>mourners,</I> especially 
 when those that were agreeable and amiable to their relations, and 
 serviceable to their generation, are taken away. The house where death 
 is called <I>the house of mourning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:2">Eccl. vii. 2</A>.

 When man goes to his long home the <I>mourners go about the streets</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:5">Eccl. xii. 5</A>),

 or rather sit alone, and <I>keep silence.</I> Here was Martha's house,
 a house where the fear of God was, and on which his blessing rested, 
 yet made a <I>house of mourning.</I> Grace will keep sorrow from the 
 heart

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:1"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 1</A>),

 not from the house. 
 
 (2.) Where there are mourners there ought to be comforters. It is a
 duty we owe to those that are in sorrow to mourn with them, and to 
 comfort them; and our mourning with them will be some comfort to them. 
 When we are under the present impressions of grief, we are apt to 
 forget those things which would minister comfort to us, and therefore 
 have need of remembrancers. It is a mercy to have remembrancers when we 
 are in sorrow, and our duty to be remembrancers to those who are in 
 sorrow. The Jewish doctors laid great stress upon this, obliging their 
 disciples to make conscience of comforting the mourners after the 
 burial of the dead. They comforted them <I>concerning their 
 brother,</I> that is, by speaking to them of him, not only of the good 
 name he left behind, but of the happy state he was gone to. When godly 
 relations and friends are taken from us, whatever occasion we have to 
 be afflicted concerning ourselves, who are left behind and miss them, 
 we have reason to be comforted concerning those who are gone before us 
 to a happiness where they have no need of us. This visit which the
 Jews made to Martha and Mary is an evidence that they were persons of 
 distinction, and made a figure; as also that they behaved obligingly to 
 all; so that though they were followers of Christ, yet those who had no 
 respect for him were civil to them. There was also a providence in it, 
 that so many Jews, Jewish ladies it is probable, should come together, 
 just at this time, to comfort the mourners, that they might be 
 unexceptionable witnesses of the miracle, and see what miserable 
 comforters they were, in comparison with Christ. Christ did not
 usually send for witnesses to his miracles, and yet had none been by 
 but relations this would have been excepted against; therefore God's 
 counsel so ordered it that these should come together accidentally, to 
 bear their testimony to it, that infidelity might stop her mouth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What passed between him and his surviving friends at this 
 interview. When Christ defers his visits for a time they are thereby 
 made the more acceptable, much the more welcome; so it was here. His 
 departures endear his returns, and his absence teaches us how to value 
 his presence. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The interview between Christ and Martha.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We are told that she <I>went and met him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 [1.] It should seem that Martha was earnestly expecting Christ's 
 arrival, and enquiring for it. Either she had sent out messengers, to 
 bring her tidings of his first approach, or she had often asked, <I>Saw 
 you him whom my soul loveth?</I> so that the first who discovered him 
 ran to her with the welcome news. However it was, she heard of his 
 coming before he arrived. She had waited long, and often asked, <I>Is 
 he come?</I> and could hear no tidings of him; but long-looked-for came 
 at last. <I>At the end the vision will speak, and not lie.</I> 

 [2.] Martha, when the good news was brought that Jesus was coming, 
 threw all aside, and <I>went and met him,</I> in token of a most 
 affectionate welcome. She waived all ceremony and compliment to the
 Jews who came to visit her, and hastened to go and meet Jesus. Note, 
 When God by his grace or providence is coming towards us in ways of 
 mercy and comfort, we should go forth by faith, hope, and prayer to 
 meet him. Some suggest that Martha went out of the town to meet Jesus, 
 to let him know that there were several Jews in the house, who were no 
 friends to him, that if he pleased he might keep out of the way of 
 them. 

 [3.] When Martha went to meet Jesus, Mary <I>sat still in the 
 house.</I> Some think she did <I>not</I> hear the tidings, being in her 
 drawing-room, receiving visits of condolence, while Martha who was 
 busied in the household-affairs had early notice of it. Perhaps Martha 
 would not tell her sister that Christ was coming, being ambitious of 
 the honour of receiving him first. <I>Sancta est prudentia clam 
 fratribus clam parentibus ad Christum esse conferre--Holy prudence 
 conducts us to Christ, while brethren and parents know not what we are 
 doing.</I>--Maldonat. in locum. Others think she <I>did</I> hear that 
 Christ was come, but was so overwhelmed with sorrow that she did not 
 care to stir, choosing rather to indulge her sorrow, and to sit poring 
 upon her affliction, and saying, <I>I do well to</I> mourn. Comparing 
 this story with that in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:38">Luke x. 38</A>,

 &c., we may observe the different tempers of these two sisters, and the
 temptations and advantages of each. Martha's natural temper was active 
 and busy; she loved to be here and there, and at the end of every 
 thing; and this had been a snare to her when by it she was not only 
 careful and cumbered about many things, but hindered from the exercises 
 of devotion: but now in a day of affliction this active temper did her 
 a kindness, kept the grief from her heart, and made her forward to meet 
 Christ, and so she received comfort from him the sooner. On the other 
 hand, Mary's natural temper was contemplative and reserved. This had 
 been formerly an advantage to her, when it placed her Christ's feet, to 
 hear his word, and enabled her there to attend upon him without those 
 distractions with which Martha was cumbered; but now in the day of 
 affliction that same temper proved a snare to her, made her less able 
 to grapple with her grief, and disposed her to melancholy: <I>But Mary 
 sat still in the house.</I> See here how much it will be our wisdom 
 carefully to watch against the temptations, and improve the advantages, 
 of our natural temper.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is fully related the discourse between Christ and Martha.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Martha's address to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> She complains of Christ's long absence and delay. She 
 said it, not only with grief for the death of her brother, but with 
 some resentment of the seeming unkindness of the Master: <I>Lord if you 
 hadst been here, my brother had not died.</I> Here is, 

 1. Some evidence of faith. She believed Christ's <I>power,</I> that, 
 though her brother's sickness was very grievous, yet he could have 
 cured it, and so have prevented his death. She believed his 
 <I>pity,</I> that if he had but seen Lazarus in his extreme illness, 
 and his dear relations all in tears about him, he would have had 
 compassion, and have prevented so sad a breach, for his compassions 
 fail not. But, 

 2. Here are sad instances of unbelief. Her faith was true, but weak as
 a bruised reed, for she limits the power of Christ, in saying, <I>If 
 thou hadst been here;</I> whereas she ought to have known that Christ 
 could cure at a distance, and that his gracious operations were not 
 limited to his bodily presence. She reflects likewise upon the wisdom 
 and kindness of Christ, that he did not hasten to them when they sent 
 for him, as if he had not <I>timed his business</I> well, and now might 
 as well have staid away, and not have come at all, as to come too late; 
 and, as for any help now, she can scarcely entertain the thought of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Yet she corrects and comforts herself with the 
 thoughts of the prevailing interest Christ had in heaven; at least, she 
 blames herself for blaming her Master, and for suggesting that he comes 
 too late: <I>for I know that even now,</I> desperate as the case is, 
 <I>whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it to thee.</I> 
 Observe, 

 1. How <I>willing</I> her hope was. Though she had not courage to ask
 of Jesus that he should raise him to life again, there having been no 
 precedent as yet of any one raised to life that had been so long dead, 
 yet, like a modest petitioner, she humbly recommends the case to the 
 wise and compassionate consideration of the Lord Jesus. When we know
 not what in particular to ask or expect, let us in general refer 
 ourselves to God, let him do as seemeth him good. <I>Judicii tui est, 
 non pr&aelig;sumptionis me&aelig;--I leave it to thy judgment, not to 
 my presumption.</I>--Aug. in locum. When we know not what to pray for, 
 it is our comfort that the great Intercessor knows what to ask for us, 
 and is always heard. 

 2. How <I>weak</I> her faith was. She should have said, "Lord, thou
 canst do whatsoever thou wilt;" but she only says, "Thou canst obtain 
 whatsoever thou prayest for." She had forgotten that the Son had 
 <I>life in himself,</I> that he wrought miracles by his own power. Yet 
 both these considerations must be taken in for the encouragement of our 
 faith and hope, and neither excluded: the dominion Christ has on earth 
 and his interest and intercession in heaven. He has in the one hand the 
 golden sceptre, and in the other the golden censer; his power is always 
 predominant, his intercession always prevalent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The comfortable word which Christ gave to Martha, in an answer to 
 her pathetic address 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</I> Martha, in
 her complaint, looked back, reflecting with regret <I>that Christ was 
 not there,</I> for then, thinks she, my brother had been now alive. We 
 are apt, in such cases, to add to our own trouble, by fancying what 
 <I>might have been.</I> "If such a method had been taken, such a 
 physician employed, my friend had not died;" which is more than we 
 know: but what good does this do? When God's will is done, our business 
 is to submit to him. Christ directs Martha, and us in her, to look 
 forward, and to think what <I>shall be,</I> for that is a certainty, 
 and yields sure comfort: <I>Thy brother shall rise again. First,</I> 
 This was true of Lazarus in a sense peculiar to him: he was now 
 presently to be raised; but Christ speaks of it in general as a thing 
 to be done, not which he himself would do, so humbly did our Lord Jesus 
 speak of what he did. He also expresses it <I>ambiguously,</I> leaving
 her uncertain at first whether he would raise him presently or not till 
 the last day, that he might try her faith and patience. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> It is applicable to all the saints, and their 
 resurrection at the last day. Note, It is a matter of comfort to us, 
 when we have buried our godly friends and relations, to think that they 
 shall <I>rise again.</I> As the soul at death is not lost, but gone 
 before, so the body is not lost, but laid up. Think you hear Christ 
 saying, "Thy parent, thy child, thy yoke-fellow, shall rise again; 
 <I>these dry bones shall live.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The faith which Martha mixed with this word, and the unbelief 
 mixed with this faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> She accounts it a <I>faithful saying</I> that <I>he shall 
 rise again at the last day.</I> Though the doctrine of the resurrection 
 was to have its full proof from Christ's resurrection, yet, as it was 
 already revealed, she firmly believed it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:15">Acts xxiv. 15</A>.

 1. That there shall be a <I>last day,</I> with which all the days of
 time shall be numbered and finished. 

 2. That there shall be a <I>general</I> resurrection at that day, when
 the earth and sea shall give up their dead. 

 3. That there shall be a <I>particular</I> resurrection of each one: "I 
 know that I shall rise again, and this and the other relation that was 
 dear to me." As bone shall return to his bone in that day, so friend to 
 his friend.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Yet she seems to think this saying not so well worthy 
 of all acceptation as really it was: "<I>I know he shall rise again at 
 the last day;</I> but what are we the better for that now?" As if the 
 comforts of the resurrection to eternal life were not worth speaking 
 of, or yielded not satisfaction sufficient to balance her affliction. 
 See our weakness and folly, that we suffer present sensible things to 
 make a deeper impression upon us, both of grief and joy, than those 
 things which are the objects of faith. <I>I know that he shall rise 
 again at the last day;</I> and is not this enough? She seems to think 
 it is not. Thus, by our discontent under present crosses, we greatly 
 undervalue our future hopes, and put a slight upon them, as if not 
 worth regarding.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] The further instruction and encouragement which Jesus Christ gave 
 her; for he will not quench the smoking flax nor break the bruised 
 reed. He said to her, <I>I am the resurrection and the life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 Two things Christ possesses her with the belief of, in reference to the 
 present distress; and they are the things which our faith should fasten 
 upon in the like cases.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The power of Christ, his sovereign power: <I>I am the 
 resurrection and the life,</I> the fountain of life, and the head and 
 author of the resurrection. Martha believed that at his prayer God 
 would give any thing, but he would have her know that by his word he 
 could work anything. Martha believed a resurrection at the <I>last 
 day;</I> Christ tells her that he had that power lodged in his own 
 hand, that the dead were to <I>hear his voice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:25"><I>ch.</I> v. 25</A>),

 whence it was easy to infer, He that could raise a world of men that
 had been dead many ages could doubtless raise one man that had been 
 dead but <I>four days.</I> Note, It is an unspeakable comfort to all 
 good Christians that Jesus Christ is the resurrection and the life, and 
 will be so to them. <I>Resurrection</I> is a return to life; Christ is 
 the author of that return, and of that life to which it is a return. We 
 look for the <I>resurrection of the dead</I> and the <I>life of the 
 world to come,</I> and Christ is both; the author and principle of 
 both, and the ground of our hope of both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The promises of the new covenant, which give us 
 further ground of hope that <I>we shall live.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> To whom these promises are made--to those that believe in
 Jesus Christ, to those that consent to, and confide in, Jesus Christ as 
 the only Mediator of reconciliation and communion between God and man, 
 that receive the record God has given in his word concerning his Son, 
 sincerely comply with it, and answer all the great intentions of it. 
 The condition of the latter promise is thus expressed: <I>Whosoever 
 liveth and believeth in me,</I> which may be understood, either, 
 
 (<I>a.</I>) Of <I>natural</I> life: <I>Whosoever lives in this
 world,</I> whether he be Jew or Gentile, wherever he lives, if he 
 believe in Christ, he shall live by him. Yet it limits the time: 
 Whoever during <I>life,</I> while he is here in this state of 
 probation, <I>believes in me,</I> shall be happy in me, but after death 
 it will be too late. Whoever <I>lives</I> and <I>believes,</I> that is, 
 lives by faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:20">Gal. ii. 20</A>),

 has a faith that influences his conversation. Or,

 (<I>b.</I>) Of <I>spiritual</I> life: He that <I>lives</I> and
 <I>believes</I> is he that by faith is born again to a heavenly and 
 divine life, to whom <I>to live is Christ</I>--that makes Christ the 
 life of his soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> What the promises are 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>Though he die, yet shall he live,</I> nay, <I>he shall never
 die,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Man consists of body and soul, and provision is made for the happiness 
 of both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) For the <I>body;</I> here is the promise of a <I>blessed 
 resurrection.</I> Though the body be dead because of sin (there is no 
 remedy but it will die), yet it <I>shall live again.</I> All the 
 difficulties that attend the state of the dead are here overlooked, and 
 made nothing of. Though the sentence of death was just, though the 
 effects of death be dismal, though the bands of death be strong, though 
 he be dead and buried, dead and putrefied, though the scattered dust be 
 so mixed with common dust that no art of man can distinguish, much less 
 separate them, put the case as strongly as you will on that side, yet 
 we are sure that <I>he shall live</I> again: the body shall be raised a 
 glorious body.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) For the <I>soul;</I> here is the promise of a <I>blessed 
 immortality.</I> He that <I>liveth and believeth,</I> who, being united 
 to Christ by faith, lives spiritually by virtue of that union, he shall 
 <I>never die.</I> That spiritual life shall never be extinguished, but 
 perfected in eternal life. As the soul, being in its nature spiritual, 
 is therefore immortal; so if by faith it live a spiritual life, 
 consonant to its nature, its felicity shall be immortal too. It 
 <I>shall never die,</I> shall never be otherwise than easy and happy, 
 and there is not any intermission or interruption of its life, as there 
 is of the life of the body. The <I>mortality</I> of the body shall at 
 length be <I>swallowed up of life;</I> but the life of the soul, the 
 believing soul, shall be immediately at death swallowed up of 
 immortality. <I>He shall not die,</I> <B><I>eis ton aiona</I></B>,
 <I>for ever--Non morietur in &aelig;ternum;</I> so Cyprian quotes it. The
 body shall not be <I>for ever</I> dead in the grave; it dies (like the 
 two witnesses) but for a <I>time, times, and the dividing of time;</I> 
 and when time shall be no more, and all the divisions of it shall be 
 numbered and finished, a <I>spirit of life from God shall enter into 
 it.</I> But this is not all; the souls shall not die that death which 
 is <I>for ever,</I> shall <I>not die eternally, Blessed and holy,</I> 
 that is, blessed and happy, is he that by faith <I>has part in the 
 first resurrection,</I> has part in Christ, who is that resurrection; 
 for on such the <I>second death,</I> which is a death for ever, 
 <I>shall have no power;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:40"><I>ch.</I> vi. 40</A>.

 Christ asks her, "<I>Believest thou this?</I> Canst thou <I>assent</I>
 to it with application? Canst thou take my word for it?" Note, When we 
 have read or heard the word of Christ, concerning the great things of 
 the other world, we should seriously put it to ourselves, "<I>Do we 
 believe this, this</I> truth in particular, <I>this</I> which is 
 attended with so many difficulties, <I>this</I> which is suited to my 
 case? Does my belief of it realize it to me, and give my soul an 
 assurance of it, so that I can say not only <I>this</I> I believe, but 
 <I>thus</I> I believe it?" Martha was doting upon her brother's being 
 raised in this world; before Christ gave her hopes of this, he directed 
 her thoughts to another life, another world: "No matter for 
 <I>that,</I> but <I>believest thou this</I> that I tell thee concerning 
 the <I>future</I> state?" The crosses and comforts of this present time 
 would not make such an impression upon us as they do if we did but 
 believe the things of eternity as we ought.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [5.] Martha's unfeigned assent yielded to what Christ said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 We have here Martha's creed, the good confession she witnessed, the 
 same with that for which Peter was commended

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:16,17">Matt. xvi. 16, 17</A>),

 and it is the <I>conclusion of the whole matter.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Here is the <I>guide of her faith,</I> and that is the word of
 Christ; without any alteration, exception, or proviso, she takes it 
 entire as Christ had said it: <I>Yea, Lord,</I> whereby she subscribes 
 to the truth of all and every part of that which Christ had promised, 
 in his own sense: <I>Even so.</I> Faith is an echo to divine 
 revelation, returns the same words, and resolves to abide by them: 
 <I>Yea, Lord, As the word did make it so I believe and take it,</I> 
 said queen Elizabeth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The <I>ground of her faith,</I> and that is the 
 authority of Christ; she believes <I>this</I> because she believes that 
 he who saith it is Christ. She has recourse to the foundation for the 
 support of the superstructure. <I>I believe,</I> 
 <B><I>pepisteuka</I></B>, "<I>I have believed</I> that thou art Christ, 
 and therefore <I>I do believe this.</I>" Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> What she believed and confessed concerning Jesus; three 
 things, all to the same effect:--

 (<I>a.</I>) That he was the Christ, or Messiah, promised and expected 
 under this name and notion, the <I>anointed one.</I>

 (<I>b.</I>) That he was the <I>Son of God;</I> so the Messiah was 
 called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7">Ps. ii. 7</A>),
 
 not by office only, but by nature.
 
 (<I>c.</I>) That it was <I>he who should come</I> into the world, the
 <B><I>ho erchomenos</I></B>. That blessing of blessings which the 
 church had for so many ages waited for as <I>future,</I> she embraced 
 as <I>present.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> What she inferred hence, and what she alleged this for. If 
 she admits this, that Jesus is the Christ, there is no difficulty in 
 believing that he is the resurrection and the life; for if he be the 
 Christ, then,

 (<I>a.</I>) He is the fountain of light and truth, and we may take all 
 his sayings for faithful and divine, upon his own word. If he be the 
 Christ, he is that prophet whom we are to hear <I>in all things.</I>

 (<I>b.</I>) He is the fountain of life and blessedness, and we may 
 therefore depend upon his ability as well as upon his veracity. How
 shall bodies, turned to dust, <I>live again?</I> How shall souls, 
 clogged and clouded as ours are, <I>live for ever?</I> We could not 
 believe this, but that we believe him that undertakes it to be <I>the 
 Son of God,</I> who has life <I>in himself,</I> and has it for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The interview between Christ and Mary the other sister. And here 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The notice which Martha gave her of Christ's coming 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):
 
 <I>When she had so said,</I> as one that needed to say no more, <I>she
 went her way,</I> easy in her mind, and <I>called Mary her sister.</I> 
 
 [1.] Martha, having received instruction and comfort from Christ 
 herself, called her sister to share with her. Time was when Martha 
 would have drawn Mary from Christ, to come and help her in <I>much 
 serving</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:40">Luke x. 40</A>);

 but, to make her amends for this, here she is industrious to draw her
 to Christ.

 [2.] She called her <I>secretly,</I> and whispered it in her ear, 
 because there was company by, Jews, who were no friends to Christ. The 
 saints are called <I>into the fellowship of Jesus Christ</I> by an 
 invitation that is secret and distinguishing, given to them and not to 
 others; they have meat to eat that the world knows not of, joy that a 
 stranger does not intermeddle with. 

 [3.] She called her by order from Christ; he bade her <I>go call her 
 sister.</I> This call that is <I>effectual,</I> whoever brings it, is 
 sent by Christ. <I>The Master is come, and calleth for thee. First,</I> 
 She calls Christ <I>the Master,</I> <B><I>didaskalos</I></B>, a 
 <I>teaching master;</I> by that title he was commonly called and known 
 among them. Mr. George Herbert took pleasure in calling Christ, <I>my
 Master. Secondly,</I> She triumphs in his arrival: <I>The Master is
 come.</I> He whom we have long wished and waited for, <I>he is come, he 
 is come;</I> this was the best cordial in the present distress. 
 "Lazarus is gone, and our comfort in him is gone; but the <I>Master is 
 come,</I> who is better than the dearest friend, and has that in him 
 which will abundantly make up all our losses. He is come who is our 
 <I>teacher,</I> who will teach us how to get good by our sorrow 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:12">Ps. xciv. 12</A>),

 who will <I>teach,</I> and so comfort." <I>Thirdly,</I> She invites her
 sister to go and meet him: "<I>He calls for thee,</I> enquires what is 
 become of thee, and would have thee sent for." Note, When Christ our 
 Master comes, he <I>calls for us.</I> He comes in his word and 
 ordinances, calls us to them, calls us by them, calls us to himself. He 
 calls for thee in particular, for thee <I>by name</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:8">Ps. xxvii. 8</A>);

 and, if he call thee, he will cure thee, he will comfort thee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The haste which Mary made to Christ upon this notice given her 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>As soon as she heard</I> this good news, that the <I>Master was
 come,</I> she <I>arose quickly,</I> and came to him. She little thought 
 how near he was to her, for he is often nearer to them that mourn in 
 Zion than they are aware of; but, when she knew how near he was, she 
 started up, and in a transport of joy ran to meet him. The least 
 intimation of Christ's gracious approaches is enough to a lively faith, 
 which stands ready to take the hint, and answer the first call. When 
 Christ was come,

 [1.] She did not consult the decorum of her mourning, but, forgetting 
 ceremony, and the common usage in such cases, she ran through the town, 
 to meet Christ. Let no nice punctilios of decency and honour deprive us 
 at any time of opportunities of conversing with Christ. 

 [2.] She did not consult her neighbours, the Jews that were <I>with 
 her, comforting her;</I> she left them all, to come to him, and did not 
 only not ask their advice, but not so much as ask their leave, or beg 
 their pardon for her rudeness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) We are told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 where she found the Master; he was not yet come into Bethany, but was
 at the town's end, <I>in that place where Martha met him.</I> See here,

 [1.] Christ's love to his work. He staid near the place where the grave 
 was, that he might be ready to go to it. He would not go into the
 town, to <I>refresh himself</I> after the fatigue of his journey, till 
 he had done the work he came to do; nor would he go into the town, lest 
 it should look like ostentation, and a design to levy a crowd to be 
 spectators of the miracle. 

 [2.] Mary's love to Christ; still she <I>loved much.</I> Though Christ 
 had seemed unkind in his delays, yet she could take nothing amiss from 
 him. Let us go thus to Christ <I>without the camp,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:13">Heb. xiii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The misconstruction which the Jews that were with Mary made of her 
 going away so hastily 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 They said, <I>She goes to the grave, to weep there.</I> Martha bore up
 better under this affliction than Mary did, who was a woman of a tender 
 and sorrowful spirit; such was her natural temper. Those that are so 
 have need to watch against melancholy, and ought to be pitied and 
 helped. These comforters found that their formalities did her no 
 service, but that she hardened herself in sorrow: and therefore 
 concluded when she went out, and turned that way, it was to go <I>to 
 the grave</I> and <I>weep there.</I> See,

 [1.] What often is the folly and fault of mourners; they contrive how 
 to aggravate their own grief, and to make bad worse. We are apt in
 such cases to take a strange pleasure in our own pain, and to say, 
 <I>We do well</I> to be passionate in our grief, even unto death; we 
 are apt to fasten upon those things that aggravate the affliction, and 
 what good does this do us, when it is our duty to reconcile ourselves 
 to the will of God in it? Why should mourners go to the grave to weep 
 there, when they sorrow not as those that have no hope? Affliction of 
 itself is grievous; why should we make it more so?

 [2.] What is the wisdom and duty of comforters; and that is, to prevent 
 as much as may be, in those who grieve inordinately, the revival of the 
 sorrow, and to divert it. Those Jews that followed Mary were thereby 
 led to Christ, and became the witnesses of one of his most glorious 
 miracles. It is good cleaving to Christ's friends in their sorrows, for 
 thereby we may come to know him better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Mary's address to our Lord Jesus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 She came, attended with her train of comforters, and <I>fell down at
 his feet,</I> as one overwhelmed with a passionate sorrow, and said 
 with many tears (as appears

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 <I>Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died,</I> as
 Martha said before, for they had often said it to one another. Now 
 here,

 [1.] Her posture is very humble and submissive: <I>She fell down at his 
 feet,</I> which was more than Martha did, who had a greater command of 
 her passions. She fell down not as a sinking mourner, but fell down at 
 his feet as a humble petitioner. This Mary had sat <I>at Christ's feet 
 to hear his word</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:39">Luke x. 39</A>),

 and here we find her there on another errand. Note, Those that in a day
 of peace place themselves at Christ's feet, to receive instructions
 from him, may with comfort and confidence in a day of trouble cast
 themselves at his feet with hope to find favour with him. She <I>fell
 at his feet,</I> as one submitting to his will in what was done, and
 referring herself to his good-will in what was now to be done. When we
 are in affliction we must cast ourselves at Christ's feet in a penitent
 sorrow and self-abasement for sin, and a patient resignation of
 ourselves to the divine disposal. Mary's casting herself at Christ's
 feet was in token of the profound respect and veneration she had for
 him. Thus subjects were wont to give honour to their kings and princes;
 but, our Lord Jesus not appearing in secular glory as an earthly
 prince, those who by this posture of adoration gave honour to him
 certainly looked upon him as more than man, and intended hereby to give
 him divine honour. Mary hereby made profession of the Christian faith
 as truly as Martha did, and in effect said, <I>I believe that thou art
 the Christ; bowing the knee to</I> Christ, and <I>confessing him with
 the tongue,</I> are put together as equivalent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:11,Php+2:10,11">Rom. xiv. 11; Phil. ii. 10, 11</A>.

 This she did in presence of <I>the Jews</I> that attended her, who, 
 though friends to her and her family, yet were bitter enemies to 
 Christ; yet in their sight she fell at Christ's feet, as one that was 
 neither ashamed to own the veneration she had for Christ nor afraid of 
 disobliging her friends and neighbours by it. Let them resent it as 
 they pleased, she falls at his feet; and, if this be to be vile, she 
 will be yet more vile; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:1">Cant. viii. 1</A>.

 We serve a Master of whom we have no reason to be ashamed, and whose
 acceptance of our services is sufficient to balance the reproach of men 
 and all their revilings.

 [2.] Her address is very pathetic: <I>Lord, if thou hadst been here, my 
 brother had not died.</I> Christ's delay was designed for the best, and 
 proved so; yet both the sisters very indecently <I>cast the same in his 
 teeth,</I> and in effect charge him with the death of their brother.
 This repeated challenge he might justly have resented, might have told 
 them he had something else to do than to be at their beck and to attend 
 them; he must come when his business would permit him: but not a word 
 of this; he considered the circumstances of their affliction, and that 
 losers think they may have leave to speak, and therefore overlooked the 
 rudeness of this welcome, and gave us an example of mildness and 
 meekness in such cases. Mary added no more, as Martha did; but it 
 appears, by what follows, that what she fell short in words she made up 
 in tears; she said less than Martha, but wept more; and tears of devout 
 affection have a voice, a loud prevailing voice, in the ears of Christ; 
 no rhetoric like this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>33  When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also
 weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was
 troubled,
 &nbsp; 34  And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord,
 come and see.
 &nbsp; 35  Jesus wept.
 &nbsp; 36  Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
 &nbsp; 37  And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the
 eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have
 died?
 &nbsp; 38  Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the
 grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
 &nbsp; 39  Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of
 him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he
 stinketh: for he hath been <I>dead</I> four days.
 &nbsp; 40  Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou
 wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
 &nbsp; 41  Then they took away the stone <I>from the place</I> where the
 dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up <I>his</I> eyes, and said, Father,
 I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
 &nbsp; 42  And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
 people which stand by I said <I>it,</I> that they may believe that
 thou hast sent me.
 &nbsp; 43  And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
 Lazarus, come forth.
 &nbsp; 44  And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
 graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus
 saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. Christ's tender <I>sympathy</I> with his afflicted friends, and the 
 share he took to himself in their sorrows, which appeared three 
 ways:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By the inward groans and troubles of his spirit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>Jesus saw Mary weeping</I> for the loss of a loving brother, and the
 <I>Jews that came with her weeping</I> for the loss of a good neighbour 
 and friend; when he saw what a <I>place of weepers,</I> a 
 <I>bochim,</I> this was, <I>he groaned in the spirit, and was 
 troubled.</I> See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The griefs of the sons of men represented in the tears of Mary and 
 her friends. What an emblem was here of this world, this vale of tears! 
 Nature itself teaches us to weep over our dear relations, when they are 
 removed by death; Providence thereby calls to <I>weeping and 
 mourning.</I> It is probable that Lazarus's estate devolved upon his 
 sisters, and was a considerable addition to their fortunes; and in such 
 a case people say, now-a-days, though they cannot wish their relations 
 dead (that is, they do not say they do), yet, if they were dead, they 
 would not wish them alive again; but these sisters, whatever they got 
 by their brother's death, heartily wished him alive again. Religion 
 teaches us likewise to <I>weep with them that weep,</I> as these Jews 
 wept with Mary, considering that we ourselves also <I>are in the 
 body.</I> Those that truly love their friends will share with them in 
 their joys and griefs; for what is friendship but a communication of 
 affections? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:5">Job xvi. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The grace of the Son of God and his compassion towards those that
 are in misery. <I>In all their afflictions he is afflicted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9,Jdg+10:16">Isa. lxiii. 9; Judg. x. 16</A>.
 
 When Christ saw them all in tears,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He <I>groaned in the spirit.</I> He suffered himself to be tempted 
 (as we are when we are disturbed by some great affliction), <I>yet
 without sin.</I> This was an expression, either, <I>First,</I> Of his
 displeasure at the inordinate grief of those about him, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:39">Mark v. 39</A>:

 "<I>Why make ye this ado and weep?</I> What a hurry is here! does this 
 become those that believe in a God, a heaven, and another world?" Or, 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Of his feeling sense of the calamitous state of human 
 lie, and the power of death, to which fallen man is subject. Having now 
 to make a vigorous attack upon death and the grave, he thus stirred up 
 himself to the encounter, <I>put on the garments of vengeance,</I> and 
 <I>his fury it upheld him;</I> and that he might the more resolutely 
 undertake the redress of our grievances, and the cure of our griefs, he 
 was pleased to make himself sensible of the weight of them, and under 
 the burden of them he now <I>groaned in spirit.</I> Or, <I>Thirdly,</I> 
 It was an expression of his kind sympathy with his friends that were in 
 sorrow. Here was the sounding of the bowels, the mercies which the 
 afflicted church so earnestly solicits, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:15">Isa. lxiii. 15</A>.

 Christ not only seemed concerned, but he <I>groaned in the spirit;</I>
 he was inwardly and sincerely affected with the case. David's pretended 
 friends counterfeited sympathy, to disguise their enmity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:6">Ps. xli. 6</A>);

 but we must learn of Christ to have our love and sympathy <I>without
 dissimulation.</I> Christ's was a deep and hearty sigh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He was <I>troubled.</I> He <I>troubled himself;</I> so the phrase 
 is, very significantly. He had all the passions and affections of the 
 human nature, for in all things he must <I>be like to his brethren;</I> 
 but he had a perfect command of them, so that they were never 
 <I>up,</I> but <I>when</I> and <I>as</I> they were called; he was never 
 troubled, but when he <I>troubled himself,</I> as he saw cause. He 
 often <I>composed</I> himself to trouble, but was never discomposed or 
 disordered by it. He was voluntary both in his passion and in his 
 compassion. He had power to lay down his grief, and power to take it 
 again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His concern for them appeared by his <I>kind enquiry</I> after the 
 poor remains of his deceased friend 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 Where <I>have you laid him?</I> He knew where he was laid, and yet
 asks, because,

 (1.) He would thus express himself as <I>a man,</I> even when he was 
 going to exert the power of a God. Being found in fashion as a man, he 
 accommodates himself to the way and manner of the sons of men: <I>Non 
 nescit, sed quasi nescit--He is not ignorant, but he makes as if he 
 were,</I> saith Austin here.

 (2.) He enquired where the grave was, lest, if he had gone straight to 
 it of his own knowledge, the unbelieving Jews should have thence taken 
 occasion to suspect a collusion between him and Lazarus, and a trick in 
 the case. Many expositors observe this from Chrysostom. 

 (3.) He would thus divert the grief of his mourning friends, by raising 
 their expectations of something great; as if he had said, "I did not 
 come hither with an address of condolence, to mingle a few fruitless 
 insignificant tears with yours; no, I have other work to do; come, let 
 us adjourn to the grave, and go about our business there." Note, A 
 serious address to our work is the best remedy against inordinate 
 grief. 

 (4.) He would hereby intimate to us the special care he takes of the 
 bodies of the saints while they lie in the grave; he takes notice 
 <I>where they are laid,</I> and will look after them. There is not only 
 a covenant with the dust, but a guard upon it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It appeared by <I>his tears.</I> Those about him did not tell him 
 where the body was buried, but desired him to <I>come and see,</I> and 
 led him directly to the grave, that his eye might yet more affect his 
 heart with the calamity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As he was going to the grave, as if he had been following the 
 corpse thither, <I>Jesus wept,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 A very short verse, but it affords many useful instructions.

 [1.] That Jesus Christ was really and truly man, and partook with the 
 children, not only of flesh and blood, but of a human soul, susceptible 
 of the impressions of joy, and grief, and other affections. Christ gave 
 this proof of his humanity, in both senses of the word; that, as a man, 
 he could weep, and, as a merciful man, he <I>would weep,</I> before he 
 gave this proof of his divinity.

 [2.] That he was <I>a man of sorrows,</I> and <I>acquainted with 
 grief,</I> as was foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:3">Isa. liii. 3</A>.

 We never read that he laughed, but more than once we have him in tears.
 Thus he shows not only that a mournful state will consist with the love 
 of God, but that those who sow to the Spirit must sow in tears.

 [3.] Tears of compassion well become Christians, and make them most to 
 resemble Christ. It is a relief to those who are in sorrow to have 
 their friends sympathize with them, especially such a friend as their 
 Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Different constructions were put upon Christ's weeping. 

 [1.] Some made a kind and candid interpretation of it, and what was 
 very natural 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</I> They seem to wonder
 that he should have so strong an affection for one to whom he was not
 related, and with whom he had not had any long acquaintance, for Christ
 spent most of his time in Galilee, a great way from Bethany. It
 becomes us, according to this example of Christ, to show our love to
 our friends, both living and dying. We must sorrow for our brethren
 that sleep in Jesus as those that are full of love, though not void of
 hope; as the <I>devout men</I> that buried Stephen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:2">Acts viii. 2</A>.

 Though our tears profit not the dead, they embalm their memory. These
 tears were indications of his particular love to Lazarus, but he has 
 given proofs no less evident of his love to all the saints, in that he 
 died for them. When he only dropped a tear over Lazarus, they said, 
 <I>See how he loved him!</I> Much more reason have we to say so, for 
 whom he hath laid down his life: <I>See how he loved us! Greater love 
 has no man than this</I>

 [2.] Others made a peevish unfair reflection upon it, as if these tears 
 bespoke his inability to help his friend 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind,</I> have
 prevented the death of Lazarus? Here it is slyly insinuated, 
 <I>First,</I> That the death of Lazarus being (as it seemed by his 
 tears) a great grief to him, if he could have prevented it he would, 
 and therefore because he <I>did not</I> they incline to think that he 
 <I>could not;</I> as, when he was dying, they concluded that he could 
 not, because he did not, save himself, and <I>come down from the 
 cross;</I> not considering that divine power is always directed in its 
 operations by divine wisdom, not merely according to his will, but 
 according to the counsel of his will, wherein it becomes us to 
 acquiesce. If Christ's friends, whom he loves, die,--if his church, 
 whom he loves, be persecuted and afflicted,--we must not impute it to 
 any defect either in his power or love, but conclude that it is because 
 he sees it for the best. <I>Secondly,</I> That therefore it might 
 justly be questioned whether he did indeed <I>open the eyes of the 
 blind,</I> that is, whether it was not a sham. His not working this
 miracle they thought enough to invalidate the former; at least, it 
 should seem that he had limited power, and therefore not a divine one.
 Christ soon convinced these <I>whisperers,</I> by raising Lazarus from 
 the dead, which was the greater work, that he could have prevented his 
 death, but therefore did not because he would glorify himself the 
 more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's approach to the grave, and the preparation that was made 
 for working this miracle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ repeats his groans upon his coming near the grave 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):
 
 <I>Again groaning in himself, he comes to the grave:</I> he groaned,
 
 (1.) Being displeased at the unbelief of those who spoke doubtingly of
 his power, and blamed him for not preventing the death of Lazarus; he
 was <I>grieved for the hardness of their hearts.</I> He never groaned
 so much for his own pains and sufferings as for the sins and follies of
 men, particularly Jerusalem's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>.

 (2.) Being affected with the fresh lamentations which, it is likely,
 the mourning sisters made when they came near the grave, more 
 passionately and pathetically than before, his tender spirit was 
 sensibly touched with their wailings.

 (3.) Some think that he <I>groaned in spirit</I> because, to gratify 
 the desire of his friends, he was to bring Lazarus again into this 
 sinful troublesome world, from that rest into which he was newly 
 entered; it would be a kindness to Martha and Mary, but it would be to 
 him like thrusting one out to a stormy sea again who was newly got into 
 a safe and quiet harbour. If Lazarus had been let alone, Christ would 
 quickly have gone to him into the other world; but, being restored to 
 life, Christ quickly left him behind in this world. 

 (4.) Christ groaned as one that would affect himself with the 
 calamitous state of the human nature, as subject to death, from which 
 he was now about to redeem Lazarus. Thus he stirred up himself to take 
 hold on God in the prayer he was to make, that he might <I>offer it up 
 with strong crying,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>.

 Ministers, when they are sent by the preaching of the gospel to raise
 dead souls, should be much affected with the deplorable condition of 
 those they preach to and pray for, and groan in themselves to think of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The grave wherein Lazarus lay is here described: <I>It was a cave, 
 and a stone lay upon it.</I> The graves of the common people, probably, 
 were dug as ours are; but persons of distinction were, as with us, 
 interred in vaults, so Lazarus was, and such was the sepulchre in which 
 Christ was buried. Probably this fashion was kept up among the Jews, in 
 imitation of the patriarchs, who buried their dead in the cave of 
 Machpelah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:19">Gen. xxiii. 19</A>.

 This care taken of the dead bodies of their friends intimates their
 expectation of their resurrection; they reckoned the solemnity of the 
 funeral ended when the stone was rolled to the grave, or, as here, 
 <I>laid upon it,</I> like that on the mouth of the den into which 
 Daniel was cast

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:17">Dan. vi. 17</A>),

 that the <I>purpose might not be changed;</I> intimating that the dead
 are separated from the living, and gone the <I>way whence they shall 
 not return.</I> This stone was probably a <I>gravestone,</I> with an 
 inscription upon it, which the Greeks called 
 <B><I>mnemeion</I></B>--<I>a memorandum,</I> because it is both a 
 <I>memorial</I> of the dead and a <I>memento</I> to the living, putting 
 them in remembrance of that which we are all concerned to remember. It 
 is called by the Latins, <I>Monumentum, &agrave; monendo,</I> because 
 it gives <I>warning.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Orders are given to remove the stone 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>Take away the stone.</I> He would have this stone removed that all
 the standersby might see the body lie dead in the sepulchre, and that 
 way might be made for its coming out, and it might appear to be a true 
 body, and not a <I>ghost</I> or <I>spectre.</I> He would have some of 
 the servants to remove it, that they might be witnesses, by the smell 
 of the putrefaction of the body, and that therefore it was truly dead. 
 It is a good step towards the raising of a soul to spiritual life when 
 the stone is taken away, when prejudices are removed and got over, and 
 way made for the word to the heart, that it may do its work there, and 
 say what it has to say.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. An objection made by Martha against the opening of the grave: 
 <I>Lord, by this time he stinketh,</I> or <I>is become noisome, for he 
 has been dead four days,</I> <B><I>tetartaios gar esti</I></B>, 
 <I>quatriduanus est;</I> he is <I>four days old</I> in the other world; 
 a citizen and inhabitant of the grave of four days' standing. Probably 
 Martha perceived the body to smell, as they were removing the stone, 
 and therefore cried out thus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is easy to observe hence the nature of human bodies: four days 
 are but a little while, yet what a great change will this time make 
 with the body of man, if it be but so long <I>without food,</I> much 
 more if so long <I>without life!</I> Dead bodies (saith Dr. Hammond) 
 after a revolution of the humours, which is completed in seventy-two 
 hours, naturally tend to putrefaction; and the Jews say that by the 
 fourth day after death the body is so altered that one cannot be sure 
 it is such a person; so Maimonides in Lightfoot. Christ rose the third 
 day because he was not to <I>see corruption.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is not so easy to say what was Martha's design in saying this. 
 
 [1.] Some think she said it in a due tenderness, and such as decency 
 teaches to the dead body; now that it began to putrefy, she did not 
 care it should be thus publicly shown and made a spectacle of. 

 [2.] Others think she said it out of a concern for Christ, lest the 
 smell of the dead body should be <I>offensive</I> to him. That which is 
 very noisome is compared to an open sepulchre, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:9">Ps. v. 9</A>.

 If there were any thing noisome she would not have her Master near it;
 but he was none of those tender and delicate ones that cannot bear as 
 ill smell; if he had, he would not have visited the world of mankind, 
 which sin had made a perfect dunghill, altogether noisome,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:3">Ps. xiv. 3</A>.

 [3.] It should seem, by Christ's answer, that it was the language of
 her unbelief and distrust: "Lord, it is too late now to attempt any 
 kindness to him; his body begins to rot, and it is impossible that this 
 putrid carcase should <I>live.</I>" She gives up his case as helpless 
 and hopeless, there having been no instances, either of late or 
 formerly, of any raised to life after they had begun to see corruption.
 When <I>our bones are dried,</I> we are ready to say, <I>Our hope is 
 lost.</I> Yet this distrustful word of hers served to make the miracle 
 both the more evident and the more illustrious; by this it appeared 
 that he was truly dead, and not in a trance; for, though the posture of 
 a dead body might be counterfeited, the smell could not. Her suggesting 
 that it <I>could not be done</I> puts the more honour upon him that 
 <I>did it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The gentle reproof Christ gave to Martha for the weakness of her 
 faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 <I>Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest
 see the glory of God?</I> This word of his to her was not before 
 recorded; it is probable that he said it to her when she had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 <I>Lord, I believe:</I> and it is enough that it is recorded here,
 where it is repeated. Note,

 (1.) Our Lord Jesus has given us all the assurances imaginable that a 
 sincere faith shall at length be crowned with a blessed vision: "If 
 thou believe, thou shalt see God's glorious appearances for thee in 
 this world, and to thee in the other world." If we will take Christ's 
 word, and rely on his power and faithfulness, we shall see the glory of 
 God, and be happy in the sight. 

 (2.) We have need to be often reminded of these <I>sure mercies</I> 
 with which our Lord Jesus hath encouraged us. Christ does not give a 
 direct answer to what Martha had said, nor any particular promise of 
 what he would do, but orders her to keep hold of the general assurances 
 he had already given: <I>Only believe.</I> We are apt to forget what 
 Christ has spoken, and need him to put us in mind of it by his Spirit: 
 "<I>Said I not unto thee</I> so and so? And dost thou think that he 
 will ever unsay it?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The opening of the grave, in obedience to Christ's order, 
 notwithstanding Martha's objection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 <I>Then they took away the stone.</I> When Martha was satisfied, and
 had waived her objection, <I>then</I> they proceeded. If we will see 
 the glory of God, we must let Christ take his own way, and not 
 <I>prescribe</I> but <I>subscribe</I> to him. <I>They took away the 
 stone,</I> and this was all they could do; Christ only could <I>give 
 life.</I> What man can do is but to <I>prepare the way of the Lord,</I> 
 to fill the valleys, and level the hills, and, as here, to <I>take away 
 the stone.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The miracle itself wrought. The spectators, invited by the rolling 
 away of the stone, gathered about the grave, not to commit <I>dust to 
 dust, earth to earth,</I> but to receive dust from the dust, and earth 
 from the earth again; and, their expectations being raised, our Lord 
 Jesus addresses himself to his work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He applies himself to his <I>living Father in heaven,</I> so he had 
 called him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:17"><I>ch.</I> vi. 17</A>),
 
 and so eyes him here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The gesture he used was very significant: <I>He lifted up his 
 eyes,</I> an outward expression of the elevation of his mind, and to 
 show those who stood by whence he derived his power; also to set us an 
 example; this outward sign is hereby recommended to our practice; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 1</A>.

 Look how those will answer it who profanely ridicule it; but that which
 is especially charged upon us hereby is to <I>lift up our hearts</I> to
 God in the heavens; what is prayer, but the ascent of the soul to God,
 and the directing of its affections and motions heavenward? He
 <I>lifted up</I> his eyes, as looking above, looking beyond the grave
 where Lazarus lay, and overlooking all the difficulties that arose
 thence, that he might have his eyes fixed upon the divine omnipotence;
 to teach us to do as Abraham, who considered not <I>his own body now
 dead, nor the deadness of Sarah's womb,</I> never took these into his
 thoughts, and so gained such a degree of faith as not to <I>stagger at
 the promise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:20">Rom. iv. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His address to God was with great assurance, and such a confidence 
 as became him: <I>Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He has here taught us, by his own example, <I>First,</I> In prayer 
 to call God Father, and to draw nigh to him as children to a father, 
 with a humble reverence, and yet with a holy boldness. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 In our <I>prayers</I> to <I>praise him,</I> and, when we come to beg 
 for further mercy, thankfully to acknowledge former favours. 
 Thanksgivings, which bespeak <I>God's glory</I> (not <I>our own,</I> 
 like the Pharisee's God, <I>I thank thee</I>), are decent forms into 
 which to put our supplications.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] But our Saviour's thanksgiving here was intended to express the 
 unshaken assurance he had of the effecting of this miracle, which he 
 had in his own power to do in concurrence with his Father: "<I>Father, 
 I thank thee</I> that my will and thine are in this matter, as always, 
 the same." Elijah and Elisha raised the dead, as servants, by 
 <I>entreaty;</I> but Christ, as a Son, by <I>authority,</I> having life 
 in himself, and power to quicken whom he would; and he speaks of this 
 as his own act 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>I go, that I may awake him;</I> yet he speaks of it as what he had
 obtained by prayer, for his Father <I>heard him:</I> probably he put up 
 the prayer for it when he <I>groaned in spirit</I> once and again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:33,38"><I>v.</I> 33, 38</A>),

 in a <I>mental</I> prayer, with groanings which could not be
 <I>uttered.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Christ speaks of this miracle as an answer to prayer, 

 1. Because he would thus <I>humble himself;</I> though he was a Son,
 yet <I>learned he this obedience,</I> to ask and receive. His 
 mediatorial crown was granted him upon request, though it is <I>of 
 right,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8,Joh+17:5">Ps. ii. 8, and <I>ch.</I> xvii. 5</A>.

 He prays for the glory he had before the world was, though, having
 never forfeited it, he might have demanded it. 

 2. Because he was pleased thus to <I>honour prayer,</I> making it the
 key wherewith even he unlocked the treasures of divine power and grace.
 Thus he would teach us in prayer, by the lively exercise of faith, to 
 <I>enter into the holiest.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Christ, being assured that his prayer was answered,
 professes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> His thankful acceptance of this answer: <I>I thank thee that 
 thou hast heard me.</I> Though the miracle was not yet wrought, yet the 
 prayer was answered, and he triumphs before the victory. No other can 
 pretend to such an assurance as Christ had; yet we may by faith in the 
 promise have a prospect of mercy before it be actually given in, and 
 may rejoice in that prospect, and give God thanks for it. In David's 
 devotions, the same psalm which begins with prayer for a mercy closes 
 with thanksgivings for it. Note, 

 (<I>a.</I>) Mercies in answer to prayer ought in a special manner to be
 acknowledged with thankfulness. Besides the grant of the mercy itself,
 we are to value it as a great favour to have our poor prayers taken 
 notice of.

 (<I>b.</I>) We ought to <I>meet</I> the first appearances of the return
 of prayer with early thanksgivings. As God <I>answers</I> us with 
 mercy, even <I>before we call,</I> and <I>hears while we are yet 
 speaking,</I> so we should answer him with praise even before he 
 grants, and give him thanks while he is yet speaking good words and 
 comfortable words.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> His cheerful assurance of a ready answer at any time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):
 
 <I>And I know that thou hearest me always.</I> Let none think that this
 was some uncommon favour granted him now, such as he never had before, 
 nor should ever have again; no, he had the same divine power going 
 along with him in his whole undertaking, and undertook nothing but what 
 he knew to be agreeable to the counsel of God's will. "I <I>gave 
 thanks</I>" (saith he) "for being heard in this, because I am sure to 
 be heard in every thing." See here, 

 (<I>a.</I>) The interest our Lord Jesus had in heaven; the Father 
 <I>heard him always,</I> he had access to the Father upon every 
 occasion, and success with him in every errand. And we may be sure that 
 his interest is not the less for his going to heaven, which may 
 encourage us to depend upon his intercession, and put all our petitions 
 into his hand, for we are sure that him the Father <I>hears always.</I>

 (<I>b.</I>) The confidence he had of that interest: <I>I knew it.</I>
 He did not in the least hesitate or doubt concerning it, but had an
 entire satisfaction in his own mind of the Father's complacency in him
 and concurrence with him in every thing. We cannot have such a
 particular assurance as he had; but this we know, that <I>whatsoever we
 ask according to his will he heareth us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:14,15">1 John v. 14, 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> But why should Christ give this public intimation of 
 his obtaining this miracle by prayer? He adds, It is <I>because of the 
 people who stand by, that they may believe that thou hast sent me;</I> 
 for <I>prayer may preach.</I> 

 1. It was to obviate the objections of his enemies, and their
 reflections. It was blasphemously suggested by the Pharisees, and their 
 creatures, that he wrought his miracles by compact with the devil; now, 
 to evidence the contrary, he openly made his address to God, using 
 <I>prayers,</I> and not <I>charms,</I> not <I>peeping and muttering</I> 
 as those did that used <I>familiar spirits</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19">Isa. viii. 19</A>),

 but, with elevated eyes and voice professing his communication with
 Heaven, and dependence on Heaven. 

 2. It was to corroborate the faith of those that were well inclined to
 him: <I>That they may believe that thou hast sent me,</I> not to 
 destroy men's lives, but to save them. Moses, to show that God sent
 him, made the earth open and swallow men up

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:31">Num. xvi. 31</A>);
 
 Elijah, to show that God sent him, made fire come from heaven and
 devour men; for the law was a dispensation of terror and death but 
 Christ proves his mission by raising to life one that was dead. Some 
 give this sense: had Christ declared his doing it freely by his own 
 power, some of his weak disciples, who as yet understood not his divine 
 nature, would have thought he took too much upon him, and have been 
 stumbled at it. These <I>babes</I> could not bear that <I>strong 
 meat,</I> therefore he chooses to speak of his power as received and 
 derived he speaks self-denyingly of himself, that he might speak the 
 more plainly to us. <I>Non ita respexit ad swam dignitatem atque ad
 nostram salutem</I>--<I>In what he said, he consulted not so much his 
 dignity as our salvation.</I>--Jansenius.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He now applies himself to his <I>dead friend in the earth.</I> He 
 <I>cried with a loud voice, Lazarus come forth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He could have raised Lazarus by a silent exertion of his power and 
 will, and the indiscernible operations of the Spirit of life; but he 
 did it by a call, a loud call,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] To be significant of the power then put forth for the raising of 
 Lazarus, how he <I>created this new thing;</I> he <I>spoke, and it was 
 done.</I> He cried aloud, to signify the greatness of the work, and of 
 the power employed in it, and to excite himself as it were to this 
 attack upon the gates of death, as soldiers engage with a shout. 
 Speaking to Lazarus, it was proper to <I>cry with a loud voice;</I> 
 for, <I>First,</I> The soul of Lazarus, which was to be called back, 
 was at a distance, not hovering about the grave, as the Jews fancied, 
 but removed to Hades, the world of spirits; now it is natural to speak 
 loud when we call to those at a distance. <I>Secondly,</I> The body of 
 Lazarus, which was to be called up, was <I>asleep,</I> and we usually 
 speak loud when we would awake any out of sleep. He cried with a loud 
 voice that the scripture might be fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:19">Isa. xlv. 19</A>),

 <I>I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] To be typical of other works of wonder, and particularly other 
 resurrections, which the power of Christ was to effect. This loud call 
 was a figure, <I>First,</I> Of the gospel call, by which dead souls 
 were to be brought out of the grave of sin, which resurrection Christ 
 had formerly spoken of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:25"><I>ch.</I> v. 25</A>),
 
 and of his word as the means of it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:63"><I>ch.</I> vi. 63</A>),

 and now he gives a specimen of it. By his word, he saith to souls, 
 <I>Live, yea, he</I> saith to them, <I>Live,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:6">Ezek. xvi. 6</A>.

 <I>Arise from the dead,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:14">Eph. v. 14</A>.

 The spirit of life from God entered into those that had been dead and
 dry bones, when Ezekiel prophesied over them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:10">Ezek. xxxvii. 10</A>.

 Those who infer from the commands of the word to <I>turn and live</I> 
 that man has a power of his own to convert and regenerate himself might 
 as well infer from this call to Lazarus that he had a power to raise 
 himself to life. <I>Secondly,</I> Of the sound of the archangel's 
 trumpet at the last day, with which they that sleep in the dust shall 
 be awakened and summoned before the great tribunal, when Christ shall 
 <I>descend with a shout, a call, or command,</I> like this here, 
 <I>Come forth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:4">Ps. l. 4</A>.

 <I>He shall call</I> both <I>to the heavens</I> for their souls, <I>and 
 to the earth</I> for their bodies, <I>that he may judge his 
 people.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) This <I>loud call</I> was but <I>short,</I> yet <I>mighty through
 God</I> to the battering down of the strongholds of the grave. 

 [1.] He calls him by name, Lazarus, as we call those by their names 
 whom we would awake out of a fast sleep. God said to Moses, as a mark 
 of his favour, <I>I know thee by name.</I> The naming of him intimates 
 that the same individual person that died shall rise again at the last 
 day. He that <I>calls the stars by their names</I> can distinguish by
 name his stars that are in the dust of the earth, and will lose none of 
 them. 

 [2.] He calls him <I>out of the grave,</I> speaking to him as if he 
 were already alive, and had nothing to do but to come out of his grave. 
 He does not say unto him, <I>Live;</I> for he himself must give life; 
 but he saith to him, <I>Move,</I> for when by the grace of Christ we 
 live spiritually we must stir up ourselves to <I>move;</I> the grave of 
 sin and this world is no place for those whom Christ has quickened, and 
 therefore they must <I>come forth.</I> 

 [3.] The event was according to the intention: <I>He that was dead came 
 forth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 Power went along with the word of Christ to reunite the soul and the 
 body of Lazarus, and then he came forth. The miracle is described, not 
 by its invisible springs, to satisfy our curiosity, but by its visible 
 effects, to conform our faith. Do any ask where the soul of Lazarus was 
 during the four days of its separation? We are not told, but have 
 reason to think it was in paradise; <I>in joy and felicity;</I> but you 
 will say, "Was it not then really an unkindness to it to cause it to 
 return into the prison of the body?" And if it were, yet, being for the 
 honour of Christ and the serving of the interests of his kingdom, it 
 was no more an injury to him than it was to St. Paul to continue in the 
 flesh when he knew that to depart to Christ was so much better. If any 
 ask whether Lazarus, after he was raised, could give an account or 
 description of his soul's removal out of the body or return to it, or 
 what he saw in the other world, I suppose both those changes were so 
 unaccountable to himself that he must say with Paul, <I>Whether in the 
 body or out of the body, I cannot tell;</I> and of what he saw and 
 heard, that it was not lawful nor possible to express it. In a world
 of sense we cannot frame to ourselves, much less communicate to others, 
 any adequate ideas of the world of spirits and the affairs of that 
 world. Let us not covet to be wise above what is written, and this is 
 all that is written concerning the resurrection of that Lazarus, that 
 <I>he that was dead came forth.</I> Some have observed that though we 
 read of many who were raised from the dead, who no doubt conversed 
 familiarly with men afterwards, yet the scripture has not recorded one 
 word spoken by any of them, except by our Lord Jesus only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) This miracle was wrought, 

 [1.] <I>Speedily.</I> Nothing intervenes between the command, <I>Come 
 forth,</I> and the effect, <I>He came forth; dictum factum--no sooner 
 said than done;</I> let there be life, and there was life. Thus the 
 change in the resurrection will be <I>in a moment, in the twinkling of 
 an eye,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:52">1 Cor. xv. 52</A>.

 The almighty power that can do it can do it in an instant: <I>Then 
 shalt thou call and I will answer;</I> will come at the call, as 
 Lazarus, <I>Here am I.</I>

 [2.] <I>Perfectly.</I> He was so thoroughly revived that he got up out
 of his grave as strongly as ever he got up out of his bed, and returned 
 not only to life, but health. He was not raised to serve a present 
 turn, but to live as other men. 

 [3.] With this additional miracle, as some reckon it, that he came out 
 of his grave, though he was fettered with his grave-clothes, with which 
 he was <I>bound hand and foot,</I> and <I>his face bound about with a 
 napkin</I> (for so the manner of the Jews was to bury); and he came 
 forth in the same dress wherein he was buried, that it might appear 
 that it was he himself and not another, and that he was not only alive, 
 but strong, and able to walk, after a sort, even in his grave-clothes. 
 The <I>binding of his face with a napkin</I> proved that he had been 
 really dead, for otherwise, in less than so many days' time, that would 
 have smothered him. And the standers-by, in unbinding him, would 
 <I>handle him, and see him, that it was he himself,</I> and so be 
 witnesses of the miracle. Now see here, <I>First,</I> How little we
 carry away with us, when we leave the world--only a winding-sheet and a 
 coffin; there is no change of raiment in the grave, nothing but a 
 single suit of grave-clothes. <I>Secondly,</I> What condition we shall
 be in in the grave. What <I>wisdom or device</I> can there be where the 
 eyes are hoodwinked, or what working where the hands and feet are 
 fettered? And so it will be in the grave, whither we are going. Lazarus 
 being <I>come forth,</I> hampered and embarrassed with his 
 grave-clothes, we may well imagine that those about the grave were 
 exceedingly surprised and frightened at it; we should be so if we 
 should see a dead body rise; but Christ, to make the thing familiar, 
 sets them to work: "<I>Loose him,</I> slacken his grave-clothes, that 
 they may serve for day-clothes till he comes to his house, and then he 
 will go himself, so clad, without guide or supporter to his own house." 
 As, in the Old Testament, the translations of Enoch and Elias were 
 sensible demonstrations of an invisible and future state, the one about 
 the middle of the patriarchal age, the other of the Mosaic economy, so 
 the resurrection of Lazarus, in the New Testament, was designed for the 
 confirmation of the doctrine of the resurrection.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>45  Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
 things which Jesus did, believed on him.
 &nbsp; 46  But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told
 them what things Jesus had done.
 &nbsp; 47  Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council,
 and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.
 &nbsp; 48  If we let him thus alone, all <I>men</I> will believe on him: and
 the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.
 &nbsp; 49  And one of them, <I>named</I> Caiaphas, being the high priest
 that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,
 &nbsp; 50  Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man
 should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
 &nbsp; 51  And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that
 year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
 &nbsp; 52  And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather
 together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.
 &nbsp; 53  Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to
 put him to death.
 &nbsp; 54  Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but
 went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city
 called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
 &nbsp; 55  And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out
 of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify
 themselves.
 &nbsp; 56  Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as
 they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to
 the feast?
 &nbsp; 57  Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a
 commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show
 <I>it,</I> that they might take him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the consequences of this glorious miracle, 
 which were as usual; to some it was a savour of life unto life, to 
 others of death unto death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Some were invited by it, and induced to believe. Many of the Jews, 
 when they <I>saw the things that Jesus did, believed on him,</I> and 
 well they might, for it was an incontestable proof of his divine 
 mission. They had often heard of his miracles, and yet evaded the 
 conviction of them, by calling in question the matter of fact; but now 
 that they had themselves seen this done their unbelief was conquered, 
 and they yielded at last. But <I>blessed are those who have not seen 
 and yet have believed.</I> The more we see of Christ the more cause we 
 shall see to love him and confide in him. These were some of those Jews 
 that came to Mary, to comfort her. When we are doing good offices to 
 others we put ourselves in the way of receiving favours from God, and 
 have opportunities of getting good when we are doing good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Others were irritated by it, and hardened in their unbelief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The <I>informers</I> were so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>):

 <I>Some of them,</I> who were eye-witnesses of the miracle, were so far
 from being convinced that they <I>went to the Pharisees,</I> whom they 
 knew to be his implacable enemies, and <I>told them what things Jesus 
 had done;</I> not merely as a matter of news worthy their notice, much 
 less as an inducement to them to think more favourably of Christ, but 
 with a spiteful design to excite those who needed no spur the more 
 vigorously to prosecute him. Here is a strange instance,

 (1.) Of a most <I>obstinate infidelity,</I> refusing to yield to the 
 most powerful means of conviction; and it is hard to imagine how they 
 could evade the force of this evidence, but that the <I>god of this 
 world</I> had <I>blinded their minds.</I> 

 (2.) Of a most <I>inveterate enmity.</I> If they would not be satisfied 
 that he was to be believed in as the Christ, yet one would think they 
 should have been mollified, and persuaded not to persecute him; but, if 
 the water be not sufficient to <I>quench</I> the fire, it will 
 <I>inflame</I> it. They told <I>what Jesus had done,</I> and told no 
 more than what was true; but their malice gave a tincture of diabolism 
 to their information equal to that of <I>lying;</I> perverting what is 
 true is as bad as forging what is false. <I>Doeg</I> is called a 
 <I>false, lying,</I> and <I>deceitful tongue</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:2-4.120:2,3">Ps. lii. 2-4; cxx. 2, 3</A>),

 though what he said was <I>true.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The judges, the leaders, the <I>blind leaders,</I> of the people 
 were no less exasperated by the report made to them, and here we are 
 told what they did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A special council is called and held 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>):

 <I>Then gathered the chief priests and Pharisees a council,</I> as was
 foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:2">Ps. ii. 2</A>,

 <I>The rulers take counsel together against the Lord.</I> Consultations 
 of the sanhedrim were intended for the public good; but here, under 
 colour of this, the greatest injury and mischief are done to the 
 people. The things that belong to the nation's peace were hid from the 
 eyes of those that were entrusted with its counsels. This council was 
 called, not only for joint advice, but for mutual irritation; that as 
 iron sharpens iron, and as coals are to burning coals and wood to fire, 
 so they might exasperate and inflame one another with enmity and rage 
 against Christ and his doctrine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The case is proposed, and shown to be weighty and of great 
 consequence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The matter to be debated was what course they should take with 
 this Jesus, to stop the growth of his interest; they said <I>What do 
 we? For this man doeth many miracles.</I> The information given about 
 the raising of Lazarus was produced, and the <I>men, brethren, and 
 fathers</I> were called in to help as solicitously as if a formidable 
 enemy had been with an army in the heart of their country. 
 <I>First,</I> They own the truth of Christ's miracles, and that he had 
 wrought many of them; they are therefore witnesses against themselves, 
 for they acknowledge his credentials and yet deny his commission. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> They consider what is to be done, and chide themselves 
 that they have not done something sooner effectually to crush him. They 
 do not take it at all into their consideration whether they shall not 
 receive him and own him as the Messiah, though they profess to expect 
 him, and Jesus gave pregnant proofs of his being so; but they take it 
 for granted that he is an enemy, and as such is to be run down: 
 "<I>What do we?</I> Have we no care to support our church? Is it 
 nothing to us that a doctrine so destructive to our interest spreads 
 thus? Shall we tamely yield up the ground we have got in the affections 
 of the people? Shall we see our authority brought into contempt, and 
 the craft by which we get our living ruined, and not bestir ourselves? 
 What have we been doing all this while? And what are we now thinking 
 of? Shall we be always talking, and bring nothing to pass?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That which made this matter weighty was the peril they apprehended 
 their church and nation to be in from the Romans 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>):

 "If we do not silence him, and take him off, <I>all men will believe on
 him;</I> and, this being the setting up of a new king, the Romans will 
 take umbrage at it, <I>and will come</I> with an army, and <I>take away 
 our place and nation,</I> and therefore it is no time to trifle." See 
 what an opinion they have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Of their own <I>power.</I> They speak as if they thought 
 Christ's progress and success in his work depended upon their 
 connivance; as if he could not go on to work miracles, and make 
 disciples, unless they <I>let him alone;</I> as if it were in their 
 power to conquer him who had conquered death, or as if they could 
 <I>fight against God,</I> and prosper. But he that sits in heaven 
 laughs at the fond conceit which impotent malice has of its own 
 omnipotence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Of their own <I>policy.</I> They fancy themselves to 
 be men of mighty insight and foresight, and great sagacity in their 
 moral prognostications.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> They take on them to prophecy that, in a little time, if he 
 have liberty to go on, <I>all men will believe on him,</I> hereby 
 owning, when it was to serve their purpose, that his doctrine and 
 miracles had a very convincing power in them, such as could not be 
 resisted, but that all men would become his proselytes and votaries. 
 Thus do they now make his interest formidable, though, to serve another 
 turn, these same men strove to make it contemptible, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:48"><I>ch.</I> vii. 48</A>,

 <I>Have any of the rulers believed on him?</I> This was the thing they
 were afraid of, that men would <I>believe on him,</I> and then all 
 their measures were broken. Note, The success of the gospel is the 
 dread of its adversaries; if souls be saved, they are undone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> They foretel that if the generality of the nation be <I>drawn 
 after him,</I> the rage of the Romans will be <I>drawn upon them.</I> 
 They <I>will come and take away our place;</I> the country in general, 
 especially Jerusalem, or the temple, the <I>holy place,</I> and 
 <I>their</I> place, their darling, their idol; or, their 
 <I>preferments</I> in the temple, their <I>places</I> of power and 
 trust. Now it was true that the Romans had a very jealous eye upon 
 them, and knew they wanted nothing but power and opportunity to shake 
 off their yoke. It was likewise true that if the Romans should pour an 
 army in upon them it would be very hard for them to make any head 
 against it; yet here appeared a cowardice which one would not have 
 found in the priests of the Lord if they had not by their wickedness 
 forfeited their interest in God and all good men. Had they kept their 
 integrity, they needed not to have feared the Romans; but they speak 
 like a dispirited people, as the men of Judah when they basely said to 
 Samson, <I>Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:11">Judg. xv. 11</A>.
 
 When men lose their piety they lose their courage. But,
 
 (<I>a.</I>) It was false that there was any danger of the Romans' being
 irritated against their nation by the progress of Christ's gospel, for 
 it was no way <I>hurtful to kings nor provinces,</I> but highly 
 beneficial. The Romans had no jealousy at all of his growing interest; 
 for he taught men to give tribute to C&aelig;sar, and not to <I>resist
 evil,</I> but to take up the cross. The Roman governor, at his trial, 
 could <I>find no fault in him.</I> There was more danger of the Romans' 
 being incensed against the Jewish nation by the priests than by Christ. 
 Note, Pretended fears are often the colour of malicious designs.
 
 (<I>b.</I>) Had there really been some danger of displeasing the Romans
 by tolerating Christ's preaching, yet this would not justify their 
 hating and persecuting a good man. Note, 

 [<I>a.</I>] The enemies of Christ and his gospel have often coloured 
 their enmity with a seeming care for the <I>public good</I> and the 
 <I>common safety,</I> and, in order to this, have branded his prophets 
 and ministers as troublers of Israel, and men that <I>turn the world 
 upside down.</I> 

 [<I>b.</I>] Carnal policy commonly sets up <I>reasons of state,</I> in 
 opposition to <I>rules of justice.</I> When men are concerned for their 
 own wealth and safety more than for truth and duty, it is wisdom from 
 beneath, which is <I>earthly, sensual, and devilish.</I> But see what 
 was the issue; they pretended to be afraid that their tolerating 
 Christ's gospel would bring desolation upon them by the Romans, and 
 therefore, <I>right or wrong,</I> set themselves against it; but it 
 proved that their persecuting the gospel brought upon them that which 
 they feared, filled up the measure of their iniquity, and the Romans 
 came and <I>took away their place and nation,</I> and their place 
 <I>knows them no more.</I> Note, That calamity, which we seek to escape 
 by sin we take the most effectual course to bring upon our own heads; 
 and those who think by opposing Christ's kingdom to secure or advance 
 their own secular interest will find Jerusalem a more <I>burdensome 
 stone</I> than they think it is,

 The <I>fear of the wicked it shall come upon them,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Caiaphas makes a malicious but mystical speech in the council on 
 this occasion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The <I>malice</I> of it appears evident at first view, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:49,50"><I>v.</I> 49, 50</A>.
 
 He, being the high priest, and so president of the council, took upon 
 him to decide the matter before it was debated: "<I>You know nothing at 
 all,</I> your hesitating betrays your ignorance, for it is not a thing 
 that will bear a dispute, it is soon determined, if you consider that 
 received maxim, <I>That it is expedient for us that one man should die 
 for the people.</I>" Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The counsellor was Caiaphas, who was <I>high priest that 
 same year.</I> The high priesthood was by divine appointment settled 
 upon the heir male of the house of Aaron, for and during the term of 
 his natural life, and then to his heir male; but in those degenerate 
 times it was become, though not an annual office, like a consulship, 
 yet frequently changed, as they could make an interest with the Roman 
 powers. Now it happened that <I>this year</I> Caiaphas wore the 
 mitre.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The drift of the advice was, in short, this, That some 
 way or other must be found out to put Jesus to death. We have reason to 
 think that they strongly suspected him to be indeed the Messiah; but 
 his doctrine was so contrary to their darling traditions and secular 
 interest, and his design did so thwart their notions of the Messiah's 
 kingdom, that they resolve, be he who he will, he must be put to death. 
 Caiaphas does not say, Let him be silenced, imprisoned, banished, 
 though amply sufficient for the <I>restraint</I> of one they thought 
 dangerous; but <I>die he must.</I> Note, Those that have set themselves 
 against Christianity have commonly divested themselves of humanity, and 
 been infamous for cruelty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> This is plausibly insinuated, with all the subtlety as 
 well as malice of the old serpent. 

 1. He suggests his own sagacity, which we must suppose him as high 
 priest to excel in, though the <I>Urim</I> and <I>Thummim</I> were long 
 since lost. How scornfully does he say, "<I>You know nothing,</I> who 
 are but common priests; but you must give me leave to see further into 
 things than you do!" Thus it is common for those in authority to impose 
 their corrupt dictates by virtue of that; and, because they <I>should 
 be</I> the wisest and best, to expect that every body should believe 
 they <I>are so.</I> 

 2. He takes it for granted that the case is plain and past dispute, and
 that those are very ignorant who do not see it to be so. Note, Reason 
 and justice are often run down with a high hand. <I>Truth is fallen in
 the streets,</I> and, when it is down, down with it; and <I>equity 
 cannot enter,</I> and, when it is out, out with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:14">Isa. lix. 14</A>.

 3. He insists upon a maxim in politics, That the welfare of communities
 is to be preferred before that of particular persons. <I>It is 
 expedient for us</I> as priests, whose all lies at stake, that <I>one 
 man die for the people.</I> Thus far it holds true, that it is 
 <I>expedient,</I> and more than so, it is truly <I>honourable,</I> for 
 a man to hazard his life in the service of his country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:17,1Jo+3:16">Phil. ii. 17; 1 John iii. 16</A>);

 but to put an innocent man to death under colour of consulting the
 public safety is the devil's policy. Caiaphas craftily insinuates that 
 the greatest and best man, though <I>major singulis--greater than any 
 one individual,</I> is <I>minor universis--less than the collected 
 mass,</I> and ought to think his life well spent, nay well lost, to 
 save his country from ruin. But what is this to the murdering of one 
 that was evidently a great blessing under pretence of preventing an 
 imaginary mischief to the country? The case ought to have been put 
 thus: Was it expedient for them to bring upon themselves and upon their 
 nation the guilt of blood, a prophet's blood, for the securing of their 
 civil interests from a danger which they had no just reason to be 
 afraid of? Was it expedient for them to drive God and their glory from
 them, rather than venture the Romans' displeasure, who could do them no 
 harm if they had God on their side? Note, Carnal policy, which steers 
 only by secular considerations, while it thinks to <I>save all</I> by 
 sin, <I>ruins all</I> at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The <I>mystery</I> that was in this counsel of Caiaphas does not 
 appear at first view, but the evangelist leads us into it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:51,52"><I>v.</I> 51, 52</A>):
 
 <I>This spoke he not of himself,</I> it was not only the language of
 his own enmity and policy, but in these words he prophesied, though he 
 himself was not aware of it, <I>that Jesus should die for that 
 nation.</I> Here is a precious comment upon a pernicious text; the 
 counsel of cursed Caiaphas so construed as to fall in with the counsels 
 of the blessed God. Charity teaches us to put the most favourable
 construction upon men's words and actions that they will fear; but 
 piety teaches us to make a good improvement of them, even contrary to 
 that for which they were intended. If wicked men, in what they 
 <I>do</I> against us, <I>are God's hand</I> to humble and reform us, 
 why may they not in what they say against us be God's mouth to instruct 
 and convince us? But in this of Caiaphas there was an extraordinary 
 direction of Heaven prompting him to say that which was capable of a 
 very sublime sense. As the hearts of all men are in God's hand, so are 
 their tongues. Those are deceived who say, "<I>Our tongues are our 
 own,</I> so that either we <I>may</I> say what we will, and are not 
 accountable to God's judgment, or we <I>can</I> say what we will, and 
 are not restrainable by his providence and power." Balaam could not say 
 what he would, when he came to curse Israel, nor Laban when he pursued 
 Jacob.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The evangelist explains and enlarges upon Caiaphas's words.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He explains what he said, and shows how it not only was, but was 
 intended to be, accommodated to an excellent purpose. He did not 
 <I>speak it of himself.</I> As it was an artifice to stir up the 
 council against Christ, he spoke it of himself, or of the devil rather; 
 but as it was an <I>oracle,</I> declaring it the purpose and design of 
 God by the death of Christ to save God's spiritual Israel from sin and 
 wrath, he did not speak it of himself, for he knew nothing of the 
 matter, he <I>meant not so, neither did his heart think so,</I> for 
 nothing was in his heart but to destroy and cut off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7">Isa. x. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He <I>prophesied,</I> and those that prophesied did not, 
 in their prophesying, <I>speak of themselves.</I> But is Caiaphas also 
 among the prophets? He is so, <I>pro h&acirc;c vice--this once,</I>
 though a bad man, and an implacable enemy to Christ and his gospel. 
 Note, 

 1. God can and often does make wicked men instruments to serve his own 
 purposes, even contrary to their own intentions; for he has them not 
 only <I>in a chain,</I> to restrain them from doing the mischief they 
 would, but <I>in a bridle,</I> to lead them to do the service they 
 would not. 

 2. Words of prophecy in the mouth are no infallible evidence of a
 principle of grace in the heart. <I>Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied 
 in thy name?</I> will be rejected as a frivolous plea.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He prophesied, <I>being high priest that year;</I> not 
 that his being high priest did at all dispose or qualify him to be a 
 prophet; we cannot suppose the pontifical mitre to have first inspired 
 with prophecy the basest head that ever wore it; but, 

 1. Being high priest, and therefore of note and eminence in the 
 conclave, God was pleased to put this significant word into his mouth 
 rather than into the mouth of any other, that it might be the more 
 observed or the non-observance of it the more aggravated. The 
 apophthegms of great men have been thought worthy of special regard: 
 <I>A divine sentence is in the lips of the king;</I> therefore this 
 divine sentence was put into the lips of the high priest, that even out 
 of his mouth this word might be established, That Christ died for 
 <I>the good of the nation,</I> and not <I>for any iniquity in his 
 hands.</I> He happened to be high priest that year which was fixed to 
 be the <I>year of the redeemed,</I> when Messiah the prince <I>must be 
 cut off, but not for himself</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:26">Dan. ix. 26</A>),

 and he must own it.

 2. Being high priest <I>that year,</I> that famous year, in which there
 was to be such a plentiful effusion of the Spirit, more than had ever 
 been yet, according to the prophecy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:28,29">Joel ii. 28, 29</A>,
 
 compared with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:17">Acts ii. 17</A>),

 some drops of the blessed shower light upon Caiaphas, as the crumbs
 (says Dr. Lightfoot) of the children's bread, which fall from the table 
 among the dogs. This year was the year of the expiration of the 
 Levitical priesthood; and out of the mouth of him who was that year 
 high priest was extorted an implicit resignation of it to him who 
 should not (as they had done for many ages) offer beasts for that 
 nation, but offer himself, and so make an end of the 
 <I>sin-offering.</I> This resignation he made <I>inwittingly,</I> as 
 Isaac gave the blessing to Jacob.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> The matter of his prophecy was <I>that Jesus should die 
 for that nation,</I> the very thing to which all the prophets bore 
 witness, who <I>testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11">1 Pet. i. 11</A>),

 that the death of Christ must be the life and salvation of Israel; he
 meant by <I>that nation</I> those in it that obstinately adhered to 
 Judaism, but God meant those in it that would receive the doctrine of 
 Christ, and become followers of him, all believers, the spiritual seed 
 of Abraham. The death of Christ, which Caiaphas was now projecting, 
 proved the ruin of that interest in the nation of which he intended it 
 should be the security and establishment, for it brought wrath upon 
 them to the uttermost; but it proved the advancement of that interest 
 of which he hoped it would have been the ruin, for Christ, being lifted 
 up from the earth, drew all men unto him. It is a great thing that is 
 here prophesied: That Jesus should <I>die,</I> die for others, not only 
 <I>for their good,</I> but <I>in their stead, dies for that nation,</I> 
 for they had the first offer made them of salvation by his death. If 
 the whole nation of the Jews had unanimously believed in Christ, and 
 received his gospel, they had been not only saved eternally, but saved 
 as a nation from their grievances. The fountain was first <I>opened to 
 the house of David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:1">Zech. xiii. 1</A>.

 He so died for <I>that nation</I> as that <I>the whole nation should
 not perish,</I> but that <I>a remnant should be saved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:5">Rom. xi. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The evangelist enlarges upon this word of Caiaphas 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>),

 <I>not for that nation only,</I> how much soever it thought itself the
 darling of Heaven, but <I>that also he should gather together in one 
 the children of God that were scattered abroad.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The persons Christ died for: <I>Not for the nation</I> of 
 the Jews <I>only</I> (it would have been comparatively but <I>a light 
 thing</I> for the Son of God to go through so vast an undertaking only 
 to restore the <I>preserved of Jacob,</I> and <I>the outcasts of 
 Israel</I>); no, he must be <I>salvation to the ends of the earth,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:6">Isa. xlix. 6</A>.

 He must die for <I>the children of God that were scattered abroad.</I>
 
 1. Some understand it of the children of God that were then <I>in
 being,</I> scattered abroad in the Gentile world, <I>devout men</I> of 
 every nation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:5">Acts ii. 5</A>),
 
 that <I>feared God</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:2">Acts x. 2</A>),
 
 and worshipped him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:4">Acts xvii. 4</A>),

 proselytes of the gate, who served the God of Abraham, but submitted
 not to the ceremonial law of Moses, persons that had a savour of 
 natural religion, but were <I>dispersed</I> in the nations, had no 
 solemn assemblies of their own, nor any peculiar profession to unite in 
 or distinguish themselves by. Now Christ died to incorporate these in
 one great society, to be denominated from him and governed by him; and 
 this was the setting up of a standard, to which all that had a regard 
 to God and a concern for their souls might have recourse, and under 
 which they might enlist themselves. 

 2. Others take in with these all that belong to the election of grace,
 who are called the children of God, though not yet born, because they 
 are <I>predestinated to the adoption of children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:5">Eph. i. 5</A>.

 Now these are <I>scattered abroad</I> in several <I>places of the
 earth,</I> out of all kindreds and tongues

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>),

 and in several <I>ages of the world,</I> to the end of time; there are
 those that <I>fear him throughout all generations,</I> to all these he 
 had an eye in the atonement he made by his blood; as he prayed, so he 
 died, for <I>all that should believe on him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The purpose and intention of his death concerning those
 persons; he died to <I>gather in</I> those who wandered, and to 
 <I>gather together in one</I> those who were scattered; to invite those 
 to him who were at a distance from him, and to unite those in him who 
 were at a distance from each other. Christ's dying is, 

 1. The great <I>attractive of our hearts;</I> for this end he is lifted 
 up, to draw men to him. The conversion of souls is the gathering to 
 them in to Christ as their ruler and refuge, as the doves to their 
 windows; and he died to effect this. By dying he purchased them to 
 himself, and the gift of the Holy Ghost for them; his love in dying for 
 us is the great loadstone of our love.

 2. The great <I>centre of our unity.</I> He gathers them together <I>in
 one,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:10">Eph. i. 10</A>.

 They are one with him, one body, one spirit, and one with each other in
 him. All the saints in all places and ages meet in Christ, as all the 
 members in the head, and all the branches in the root. Christ by the 
 merit of his death recommended all the saints in <I>one</I> to the 
 grace and favour <I>of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:11-13">Heb. ii. 11-13</A>),

 and by the motive of his death recommends them all severally to the
 love and affection one of another,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:34"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 34</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The result of this debate is a resolve of the council to put Jesus 
 to death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>):

 <I>From that day they took counsel together, to put him to death.</I>
 They now understood one another's minds, and so each was fixed in his 
 own, that Jesus must die; and, it should seem, a committee was 
 appointed to sit, <I>de die in diem--daily,</I> to consider of it, to 
 consult about it, and to receive proposals for effecting it. Note, The 
 wickedness of the wicked ripens by degrees,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:15,Eze+7:10">James i. 15; Ezek. vii. 10</A>.

 Two considerable advances were now made in their accursed design 
 against Christ.

 [1.] What before they had thought of <I>severally</I> now they
 <I>jointly</I> concurred in, and so strengthened the hands one of 
 another in this wickedness, and proceeded with the greater assurance. 
 Evil men confirm and encourage themselves and one another in evil 
 practices, by comparing notes; men of corrupt minds bless themselves 
 when they find others of <I>the same mind:</I> then the wickedness 
 which before seemed impracticable appears not only possible, but easy 
 to be effected, <I>vis unita fortior--energies, when united, become 
 more efficient.</I> 

 [2.] What before they wished done, but <I>wanted a colour for,</I> now 
 they are furnished with a plausible pretence to justify themselves in, 
 which will serve, if not to take off the guilt (that is the least of 
 their care), yet to take off the odium, and so satisfy, if not the 
 personal, yet the political conscience, as some subtly distinguish. 
 Many will go on very securely in doing an evil thing as long as they 
 have but something to say in excuse for it. Now this resolution of 
 theirs to put him to death, right or wrong, proves that all the 
 formality of a trial, which he afterwards underwent, was but show and 
 pretence; they were before determined what to do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Christ hereupon absconded, knowing very well what was the vote of 
 their close cabal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He suspended his public appearances: <I>He walked no more openly 
 among the Jews,</I> among the inhabitants of Judea, who were properly 
 called Jews, especially those at Jerusalem; <B><I>ou 
 periepatei</I></B>--<I>he did not walk up and down</I> among them, did
 not go from place to place, preaching and working miracles with the 
 freedom and openness that he had done, but while he staid in Judea, he 
 was there <I>incognito.</I> Thus the chief priests put the light of 
 Israel <I>under a bushel.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He withdrew into an obscure part of the country, so obscure that 
 the name of the town he retired to is scarcely met with any where else. 
 He went to a country <I>near the wilderness,</I> as if he were driven 
 out from among men, or rather wishing, with Jeremiah, that he might 
 have in the wilderness a <I>lodging place of way-faring men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:2">Jer. ix. 2</A>.

 He entered into a city called Ephraim, some think Ephratah, that is,
 Bethlehem, where he was born, and which bordered upon the wilderness of 
 Judah; others think Ephron, or Ephraim, mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:19">2 Chron. xiii. 19</A>.
 
 Thither his disciples went with him; neither would they leave him in
 solitude, nor would he leave them in danger. There he continued, 
 <B><I>dietribe</I></B>, there he <I>conversed,</I> he knew how to 
 improve this time of retirement in private conversation, when he had 
 not an opportunity of preaching publicly. He <I>conversed with his 
 disciples,</I> who were his family, when he was forced from the temple, 
 and his <B><I>diatribai</I></B>, or <I>discourses</I> there, no doubt, 
 were very edifying. We must do the good we can, when we cannot do the 
 good we would. But why would Christ abscond now? It was not because he 
 either feared the power of his enemies or distrusted his own power; he 
 had many ways to save himself, and was neither averse to suffering nor 
 unprepared for it; but he retired, <I>First,</I> To put a mark of his 
 displeasure upon Jerusalem and the people of the Jews. They rejected 
 him and his gospel; justly therefore did he remove himself and his 
 gospel from them. The prince of <I>teachers</I> was now <I>removed into 
 a corner</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:20">Isa. xxx. 20</A>);

 there was <I>no open vision</I> of him; and it was a sad presage of
 that thick darkness which was shortly to come upon Jerusalem, because 
 she knew not the day of her visitation. <I>Secondly,</I> To render the
 cruelty of his enemies against him the more inexcusable. If that which 
 was grievous to them, and thought dangerous to the public, was his 
 <I>public appearance,</I> he would try whether their anger would be 
 turned away by his retirement into privacy; when David had fled to 
 Gath, Saul was satisfied, and sought no more for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+27:4">1 Sam. xxvii. 4</A>.

 But it was the <I>life,</I> the precious life, that these wicked men
 hunted after. <I>Thirdly,</I> His hour was <I>not yet come,</I> and 
 therefore he declined danger, and did it in a way common to men, both 
 to warrant and encourage the flight of his servants in time of 
 persecution and to comfort those who are forced from their usefulness, 
 and buried alive in privacy and obscurity; <I>the disciple is not 
 better than his Lord. Fourthly,</I> His retirement, for awhile, was to
 make his return into Jerusalem, when his hour was come, the more 
 remarkable and illustrious. This swelled the acclamations of joy with
 which his well-wishers welcomed him at his next public appearance, when 
 he rode triumphantly into the city.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) The strict enquiry made for him during his recess, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:55-57"><I>v.</I> 55-57</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The occasion of it was the approach of the passover, at which they 
 expected his presence, according to custom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>):

 <I>The Jews' passover was nigh at hand;</I> a festival which shone
 bright in their calendar, and which there was great expectation of for 
 some time before. This was Christ's fourth and last passover, since he 
 entered upon his public ministry, and it might truly be said (as,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:18">2 Chron. xxxv. 18</A>),

 <I>There never was such a passover in Israel,</I> for in it <I>Christ
 our passover was sacrificed for us.</I> Now the passover being at hand, 
 <I>many went out</I> of all parts of <I>the country to Jerusalem, to 
 purify themselves.</I> This was either, <I>First,</I> A <I>necessary 
 purification</I> of those who had contracted any ceremonial pollution; 
 they came to be sprinkled with the <I>water of purification,</I> and to 
 perform the other rites of cleansing according to the law, for they 
 might not eat the passover in their uncleanness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:6">Num. ix. 6</A>.

 Thus before our gospel passover we must renew our repentance, and by
 faith wash in the blood of Christ, and so <I>compass God's altar.</I> 
 Or, <I>Secondly,</I> A <I>voluntary purification,</I> or 
 self-sequestration, by fasting and prayer, and other religious 
 exercises, which many that were more devout than their neighbours spent 
 some time in before the passover, and chose to do it at Jerusalem, 
 because of the advantage of the temple-service. Thus must we by solemn 
 preparation set bounds about the mount on which we expect to meet with 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The enquiry was very solicitous: <I>They said, What think you, 
 that he will not come to the feast?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Some think this was said by those who wished well to him, 
 and expected his coming, that they might hear his doctrine and see his 
 miracles. Those who came early out of the country, that they might 
 purify themselves, were very desirous to meet with Christ, and perhaps 
 came up the sooner with that expectation, and therefore <I>as they 
 stood in the temple,</I> the place of their purification, they enquired 
 what news of Christ? Could any body give them hopes of seeing him? If 
 there were those, and those of the most devout people, and best 
 affected to religion, who showed this respect to Christ, it was a check 
 to the enmity of the chief priests, and a witness against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> It should rather seem that they were his enemies who 
 made this enquiry after him, who wished for an opportunity to lay hands 
 on him. They, seeing the town begin to fill with devout people out of 
 the country, wondered they did not find him among them. When they 
 should have been assisting those that came to purify themselves, 
 according to the duty of their place, they were plotting against 
 Christ. How miserably degenerate was the Jewish church, when the 
 priests of the Lord were become like the priests of the calves, a 
 <I>snare upon Mizpeh, and a net spread upon Tabor,</I> and were 
 <I>profound to make slaughter</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:1,2">Hos. v. 1, 2</A>),

 --when, instead of keeping the feast with unleavened bread, they were
 themselves soured with the leaven of the worst malice! Their asking, 
 <I>What think you? Will he not come up to the feast?</I> implies,

 1. An invidious reflection upon Christ, as if he would omit his
 attendance on the feast of the Lord for fear of exposing himself. If 
 others, through irreligion, be absent, they are not animadverted upon; 
 but if Christ be absent, for his own preservation (for God will have 
 mercy, and not sacrifice), it is turned to his reproach, as it was to 
 David's that his seat was empty at the feast, though Saul wanted him 
 only that he might have an opportunity of nailing him to the wall with 
 his javelin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:25-27">1 Sam. xx. 25-27</A>,

 &c. It is sad to see holy ordinances prostituted to such unholy
 purposes. 

 2. A fearful apprehension that they had of missing their game: "<I>Will
 he not come up to the feast?</I> If he do not, our measures are broken, 
 and we are all undone; for there is no sending a pursuivant into the 
 country, to fetch him up."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The orders issued out by the government for the apprehending of 
 him were very strict, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>.

 The great sanhedrim issued out a proclamation, strictly charging and 
 requiring that if any person in city or country <I>knew where he 
 was</I> (pretending that he was a criminal, and had fled from justice) 
 they should show it, that he might be taken, probably promising a 
 reward to any that would discover him, and imposing a penalty on such 
 as harboured him; so that hereby he was represented to the people as an 
 obnoxious dangerous man, an outlaw, whom any one might have a blow at. 
 Saul issued out such a proclamation for the apprehending of David, and 
 Ahab of Elijah. See, <I>First,</I> How intent they were upon this 
 prosecution, and how indefatigably they laboured in it, now at a time 
 when, if they had had any sense of religion and the duty of their 
 function, they would have found something else to do. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 How willing they were to involve others in the guilt with them; if any 
 man were capable of betraying Christ, they would have him think himself 
 bound to do it. Thus was the interest they had in the people abused to 
 the worst purposes. Note, It is an aggravation of the sins of wicked 
 rulers that they commonly make those that are under them instruments of 
 their unrighteousness. But notwithstanding this proclamation, though 
 doubtless many knew where he was, yet such was his interest in the 
 affections of some, and such God's hold of the consciences of others, 
 that he continued undiscovered, for the <I>Lord hid him.</I></P>
