 At the start of this chapter, concerning the baptism of John, begins 
 the gospel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:1">Mark i. 1</A>);

 what went before is but preface or introduction; this is "the beginning 
 of the gospel of Jesus Christ." And Peter observes the same date,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:22">Acts i. 22</A>,

 beginning from the baptism of John, for then Christ began first to
 appear in him, and then to appear to him, and by him to the world. Here 
 is,

 I. The glorious rising of the morning-star--John the Baptist, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:1">ver. 1</A>.

 1. The doctrine he preached,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:2">ver. 2</A>.

 2. The fulfilling of the scripture in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:3">ver. 3</A>.

 3. His manner of life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:4">ver. 4</A>.

 4. The resort of multitudes to him, and their submission to his baptism, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 5. His sermon that he preached to the Pharisees and Sadducees, wherein
 he endeavours to bring them to repentance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>),

 and so to bring them to Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 II. The more glorious shining forth of the Sun of righteousness,
 immediately after: where we have, 

 1. The honour done by him to the baptism of John, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.

 2. The honour done to him by the descent of the Spirit upon him, and a
 voice from heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the
 wilderness of Judea,
 &nbsp; 2  And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
 &nbsp; 3  For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias,
 saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
 way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
 &nbsp; 4  And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a
 leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and
 wild honey.
 &nbsp; 5  Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the
 region round about Jordan,
 &nbsp; 6  And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the preaching and baptism of John, which 
 were the dawning of the gospel-day. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when he appeared. <I>In those days</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 or, <I>after those days,</I> long after what was recorded in the 
 foregoing chapter, which left the child Jesus in his infancy. <I>In 
 those days,</I> in the time appointed of the Father for the beginning 
 of the gospel, when the <I>fulness of time</I> was come, which was 
 often thus spoken of in the <I>Old Testament, In those days.</I> Now 
 the last of Daniel's weeks began, or rather, the latter half of the 
 week, when the Messiah was to <I>confirm the covenant with many,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27">Dan. ix. 27</A>.

 Christ's appearances are all in their season. Glorious things were
 spoken both of John and Jesus, at and before their births, which would 
 have given occasion to expect some extraordinary appearances of a 
 divine presence and power with them when they were very young; but it 
 is quite otherwise. Except Christ's disputing with the doctors at 
 twelve years old, nothing appears remarkable concerning either of them, 
 till they were about thirty years old. Nothing is recorded of their 
 childhood and youth, but the greatest part of their life is 
 <I>tempos,</I> <B><I>adelon</I></B>--<I>wrapt up in darkness and
 obscurity:</I> these children differ little in outward appearance from 
 other children, as the heir, while he is under age, differs nothing 
 from a servant, though he be <I>lord of all.</I> And this was to show,

 1. That even when God is acting as the God of Israel, the
 <I>Saviour,</I> yet <I>verily he is a God that hideth himself</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:15">Isa. xlv. 15</A>).
 
 <I>The Lord is in this place and I knew it not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:16">Gen. xxviii. 16</A>.

 Our beloved stands behind the wall long before he <I>looks forth at the 
 windows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:9">Cant. ii. 9</A>.

 2. That our faith must principally have an eye to Christ in his office
 and undertaking, for there is the <I>display</I> of his power; but in 
 his person is the <I>hiding</I> of his power. All this while, Christ 
 was god-man; yet we are not told what he said or did, till he appeared 
 as a prophet; and then, <I>Hear ye him.</I> 

 3. That young men, though well qualified, should not be forward to put
 forth themselves in public service, but be humble, and modest, and 
 self-diffident, <I>swift to hear, and slow to speak.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Matthew says nothing of the conception and birth of John the Baptist, 
 which is largely related by St. Luke, but finds him at full age, as if 
 dropt from the clouds to preach in the wilderness. For above three 
 hundred years the church had been without prophets; those lights had 
 been long put out, that <I>he</I> might be the more desired, who was to 
 be the great prophet. After Malachi there was no prophet, nor any 
 pretender to prophecy, till John the Baptist, to whom therefore the 
 prophet Malachi points more directly than any of the Old Testament 
 prophets had done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal. iii. 1</A>);
 
 <I>I send my messenger.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The place where he appeared first. <I>In the wilderness of 
 Judea.</I> It was not an uninhabited desert, but a part of the country 
 not so thickly peopled, nor so much enclosed into fields and vineyards, 
 as other parts were; it was such a wilderness as had six cities and 
 their villages in it, which are named, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:61,62">Josh. xv. 61, 62</A>.

 In these cities and villages John preached, for thereabouts he had
 hitherto lived, being born hard by, in Hebron; the scenes of his action 
 began there, where he had long spent his time in contemplation; and 
 even when he showed himself to Israel, he showed how well he loved 
 retirement, as far as would consist with his business. The <I>word of 
 the Lord</I> found John here in a <I>wilderness.</I> Note, No place is 
 so remote as to shut us out from the visits of divine grace; nay, 
 commonly the sweetest intercourse the saints have with Heaven, is when 
 they are withdrawn furthest from the noise of this world. It was in 
 this <I>wilderness</I> of Judah that David penned the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:1-11">63d Psalm</A>,

 which speaks so much of the sweet communion he then had with God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:14">Hos. ii. 14</A>.

 In a wilderness the law was given; and as the <I>Old Testament,</I> so
 the <I>New Testament Israel</I> was first found in the desert land, and 
 there God <I>led him about and instructed him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:10">Deut. xxxii. 10</A>.

 John Baptist was a priest of the order of Aaron, yet we find him
 preaching in a <I>wilderness,</I> and never officiating in the 
 <I>temple;</I> but Christ, who was not a son of Aaron, is yet often 
 found in the temple, and sitting there as one having authority; so it 
 was foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal. iii. 1</A>.

 <I>The Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple;</I> not the
 <I>messenger</I> that was to prepare his way. This intimated that the 
 priesthood of Christ was to thrust out that of Aaron, and drive it into 
 a wilderness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The beginning of the gospel in a wilderness, speaks comfort to the 
 deserts of the Gentile world. Now must the prophecies be fulfilled, 
 <I>I will plant in the wilderness the cedar,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:18,19">Isa. xli. 18, 19</A>.

 The wilderness shall be <I>a fruitful field,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:15">Isa. xxxii. 15</A>.

 And the <I>desert shall rejoice,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:1,2">Isa. xxxv. 1, 2</A>.

 The Septuagint reads, <I>the deserts of Jordan,</I> the very wilderness
 in which John preached. In the Romish church there are those who call 
 themselves <I>hermits,</I> and pretend to follow John; but when they 
 say of Christ, <I>Behold, he is in the desert, go not forth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:26"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 26</A>.

 There was a seducer that led his followers <I>into the wilderness,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:38">Acts xxi. 38</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His preaching. This he made his business. He came, not fighting, 
 nor disputing, but <I>preaching</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 for by the foolishness of preaching, Christ's kingdom must be set 
 up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The doctrine he preached was that of repentance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 <I>Repent ye.</I> He preached this in <I>Judea,</I> among those that 
 were called <I>Jews,</I> and made a profession of religion; for even 
 they needed repentance. He preached it, not in Jerusalem, but in the 
 wilderness of Judea, among the plain country people; for even those who 
 think themselves most out of the way of temptation, and furthest from 
 the vanities and vices of the town, cannot wash their hands in 
 innocency, but must do it in repentance. John Baptist's business was to 
 call men to <I>repent</I> of their sins; 
 <B><I>Metanoeite</I></B>--<I>Bethink yourselves;</I> "Admit a second
 <I>thought,</I> to correct the errors of the first--an 
 <I>afterthought.</I> Consider your ways, <I>change your minds;</I> you 
 have thought amiss; <I>think again,</I> and <I>think aright.</I>" Note, 
 True penitents have <I>other thoughts</I> of God and Christ, and sin 
 and holiness, and this world and the other, than they have had, and 
 stand otherwise affected toward them. The change of the <I>mind</I> 
 produces a change of the <I>way.</I> Those who are truly sorry for what 
 they have done amiss, will be careful to do so no more. This
 repentance is a necessary duty, in obedience to the command of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:30">Acts xvii. 30</A>);

 and a necessary preparative and qualification for the comforts of the 
 gospel of Christ. If the heart of man had continued upright and 
 unstained, divine consolations might have been received without this 
 painful operation preceding; but, being sinful, it must be first pained 
 before it can be laid at ease, must <I>labour</I> before it can be at 
 rest. The sore must be searched, or it cannot be cured. <I>I wound</I>
 and <I>I heal.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The argument he used to enforce this call was, <I>For the kingdom of 
 heaven is at hand.</I> The prophets of the <I>Old Testament</I> called 
 people to <I>repent,</I> for the obtaining and securing of temporal 
 national mercies, and for the preventing and removing of temporal 
 national judgments: but now, though the duty pressed is the same, the 
 reason is new, and purely evangelical. Men are now considered in their 
 personal capacity, and not so much as then in a social and political 
 one. Now repent, for the <I>kingdom of heaven is at hand;</I> the 
 gospel dispensation of the covenant of grace, the opening of the 
 kingdom of heaven to all believers, by the death and resurrection of 
 Jesus Christ. It is a <I>kingdom</I> of which Christ is the Sovereign, 
 and we must be the willing, loyal subjects of it. It is a kingdom of 
 <I>heaven,</I> not of this world, a spiritual kingdom: its original 
 from heaven, its tendency to heaven. John preached this as <I>at 
 hand;</I> then it was at the door; to us it is come, by the pouring out 
 of the Spirit, and the full exhibition of the riches of gospel-grace. 
 Now, 

 (1.) This is a great <I>inducement</I> to us <I>to repent.</I> There is 
 nothing like the consideration of divine grace to break the heart, both 
 <I>for sin</I> and <I>from sin.</I> That is evangelical repentance, 
 that flows from a sight of Christ, from a sense of his love, and the 
 hopes of pardon and forgiveness through him. Kindness is conquering; 
 abused kindness, humbling and melting. What a wretch was I to sin 
 against such grace, against the law and love of such a kingdom!

 (2.) It is a <I>great encouragement</I> to us <I>to repent;</I> 
 "Repent, for your sins shall be pardoned upon your repentance. Return 
 to God in a way of duty, and he will, through Christ, return to you in 
 a way of mercy." The proclamation of pardon discovers, and fetches in, 
 the malefactor who before fled and absconded. Thus we are drawn to it 
 with the cords of man, and the bands of love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The <I>prophecy</I> that was fulfilled in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This is he that was spoken of in the beginning of that part of the
 prophecy of Esaias, which is mostly evangelical, and which points at 
 gospel-times and gospel-grace; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:3,4">Isa. xl. 3, 4</A>.

 John is here spoken of,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As the <I>voice of one crying in the wilderness.</I> John owned it 
 himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:23">John i. 23</A>);

 <I>I am the voice,</I> and that is all, God is the Speaker, who makes 
 known his mind by John, as a man does by his voice. The word of God
 must be received as such 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:13">1 Thess. ii. 13</A>);

 what else is Paul, and what is Apollos, but the voice! John is called 
 the <I>voice,</I> <B><I>phone boontos</I></B>--<I>the voice of one 
 crying</I> aloud, which is startling and awakening. Christ is called 
 <I>the Word,</I> which, being distinct and articulate, is more 
 instructive. John as the <I>voice,</I> roused men, and then Christ, as 
 the <I>Word,</I> taught them; as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:2">Rev. xiv. 2</A>.

 The voice of many waters, and of a great thunder, made way for the
 melodious voice of <I>harpers</I> and the <I>new song,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Some observe that, as Samson's mother must drink no <I>strong
 drink,</I> yet he was designed to be a <I>strong man;</I> so John 
 Baptist's father was struck dumb, and yet he was designed to be the 
 <I>voice of one crying.</I> When the crier's voice is begotten of a 
 dumb father, it shows the <I>excellency of the power to be of God, and 
 not of man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As one whose business it was to <I>prepare the way of the Lord, and 
 to make his paths straight;</I> so it was said of him before he was 
 born, that he should <I>make ready a people prepared for the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:17">Luke i. 17</A>),

 as Christ's harbinger and forerunner: he was such a one as intimated 
 the nature of Christ's kingdom, for he came not in the gaudy dress of a 
 herald at arms, but in the homely one of a hermit. Officers were sent 
 before great men to clear the way; so John prepares the way of the 
 Lord.

 (1.) He himself did so among the men of that generation. In the Jewish
 church and nation, at that time, all was out of course; there was a 
 great decay of piety, the vitals of religion were corrupted and eaten 
 out by the traditions and injunctions of the elders. The <I>Scribes</I> 
 and <I>Pharisees,</I> that is, the greatest hypocrites in the world, 
 had the key of knowledge, and the key of government, at their girdle. 
 The people were, generally, extremely proud of their privileges, 
 confident of justification by their own righteousness, insensible of 
 sin; and, though now under the most <I>humbling</I> providences, being 
 lately made a province of the Roman Empire, yet they were 
 <I>unhumbled;</I> they were much in the same temper as they were in 
 Malachi's time, insolent and haughty, and ready to contradict the word 
 of God: now John was sent to level these mountains, to take down their 
 high opinion of themselves, and to show them their sins, that the 
 doctrine of Christ might be the more acceptable and effectual.

 (2.) His doctrine of repentance and humiliation is still as necessary 
 as it was then to prepare the way of the Lord. Note, There is a great 
 deal to be done, to make way for Christ into a soul, to <I>bow the 
 heart</I> for the reception of the Son of David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:14">2 Sam. xix. 14</A>);

 and nothing is more needful, in order to this, than the discovery of 
 sin, and a conviction of the insufficiency of our own righteousness. 
 That which lets will let, until it be taken out of the way; prejudices 
 must be removed, high thoughts brought down, and captivated to the 
 obedience of Christ. Gates of brass must be broken, and bars of iron 
 cut asunder, ere the everlasting doors be opened for the King of glory 
 to come in. The way of sin and Satan is a <I>crooked way;</I> to
 prepare a way for Christ, the paths must be <I>made straight,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:13">Heb. xii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The garb in which he appeared, the figure he made, and the manner of 
 his life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They, who expected the Messiah as a temporal prince, would think that
 his forerunner must come in great pomp and splendour, that his equipage 
 should be very magnificent and gay; but it proves quite contrary; he 
 shall be <I>great in the sight of the Lord,</I> but mean in the eyes of 
 the world; and, as Christ himself, having <I>no form or comeliness;</I> 
 to intimate betimes, that the glory of Christ's kingdom was to be 
 spiritual, and the subjects of it such as ordinarily were either 
 <I>found</I> by <I>it,</I> or <I>made</I> by it, poor and despised, who 
 derived their honours, pleasures, and riches, from another world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His <I>dress</I> was <I>plain.</I> This same John had <I>his raiment 
 of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins;</I> he did not 
 go in <I>long clothing,</I> as the <I>scribes,</I> or <I>soft 
 clothing,</I> as the courtiers, but in the clothing of a country 
 husbandman; for he lived in a country place, and suited his 
 <I>habit</I> to his <I>habitation.</I> Note, It is good for us to 
 accommodate ourselves to the place and condition which God, in his 
 providence, has put us in. John appeared in this dress, 

 (1.) To show that, like Jacob, he was a <I>plain man,</I> and mortified 
 to this world, and the delights and gaieties of it. <I>Behold an 
 Israelite indeed!</I> Those that are <I>lowly in heart</I> should show 
 it by a holy negligence and indifference in their attire; and not make 
 the putting on of apparel their adorning, nor value others by their 
 attire.

 (2.) To show that he was a <I>prophet,</I> for prophets wore <I>rough 
 garments,</I> as mortified men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:4">Zech. xiii. 4</A>);

 and, especially, to show that he was the Elias promised; for particular 
 notice is taken of Elias, that he was a <I>hairy man</I> (which, some 
 think, is meant of the hairy garments he wore), and that <I>he was girt 
 with a girdle of leather about his loins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:8">2 Kings i. 8</A>.

 John Baptist appears no way inferior to him in mortification; this 
 therefore is <I>that</I> Elias <I>that was to come.</I>

 (3.) To show that he was a man of resolution; his girdle was not
 <I>fine,</I> such as were then commonly worn, but it was <I>strong,</I> 
 it was a <I>leathern girdle;</I> and blessed is that servant, whom his 
 Lord, when he comes, finds with <I>his loins girt,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:35,1Pe+1:13">Luke xii. 35; 1 Pet. i. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His <I>diet</I> was <I>plain;</I> his <I>meat</I> was <I>locusts</I> 
 and <I>wild honey;</I> not as if he never ate any thing else; but these 
 he frequently fed upon, and made many meals of them, when he retired 
 into solitary places, and continued long there for contemplation. 
 <I>Locusts</I> were a sort of flying insect, very good for food, and 
 allowed as clean 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:22">Lev. xi. 22</A>);

 they required little dressing, and were light, and easy of digestion, 
 whence it is reckoned among the infirmities of old age, that the 
 <I>grasshopper,</I> or <I>locust,</I> is then <I>a burden</I> to the 
 stomach, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:5">Eccl. xii. 5</A>.

 <I>Wild honey</I> was that which <I>Canaan</I> flowed with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:26">1 Sam. xiv. 26</A>.

 Either it was gathered immediately, as it fell in the dew, or rather,
 as it was found in the hollows of trees and rocks, where bees built, 
 that were not, like those in hives, under the care and inspection of 
 men. This intimates that he ate <I>sparingly,</I> a little served his 
 turn; a man would be long ere he filled his belly with locusts and wild 
 honey: <I>John Baptist</I> came <I>neither eating nor drinking</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:18"><I>ch.</I> xi. 18</A>)--

 not with the curiosity, formality, and familiarity that other people
 do. He was so entirely taken up with spiritual things, that he could 
 seldom find time for a set meal. Now, 

 (1.) This agreed with the doctrine he preached of <I>repentance,</I> 
 and <I>fruits meet for repentance.</I> Note, Those whose business it is 
 to call others to mourn for sin, and to mortify it, ought themselves to 
 live a serious life, a life of self-denial, mortification, and contempt 
 of the world. John Baptist thus showed the deep sense he had of the
 badness of the time and place he lived in, which made the preaching of 
 repentance needful; every day was a <I>fast-day</I> with him. 

 (2.) This agreed with his office as Christ's <I>forerunner;</I> by this 
 practice he showed that he knew what the <I>kingdom of heaven</I> was, 
 and had experienced the powers of it. Note, Those that are acquainted 
 with divine and spiritual pleasures, cannot but look upon all the 
 delights and ornaments of sense with a holy indifference; they know 
 better things. By giving others this example he made way for Christ. 
 Note, A conviction of the vanity of the world, and everything in it, is 
 the best preparative for the entertainment of the kingdom of heaven in 
 the heart. <I>Blessed are the poor in spirit.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The people who attended upon him, and flocked after him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);
 
 <I>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea.</I> Great multitudes 
 came to him from the city, and from all parts of the country; some of 
 all sorts, men and women, young and old, rich and poor, Pharisees and 
 publicans; they <I>went out to him,</I> as soon as they heard his 
 preaching the <I>kingdom of heaven,</I> that they might hear what they 
 heard so much of. Now, 

 1. This was a great <I>honour</I> put upon John, that so many attended
 him, and with so much respect. Note, Frequently those have most real 
 honour done them, who least court the shadow of it. Those who live a 
 mortified life, who are humble and self-denying, and dead to the world, 
 command respect; and men have a secret value and reverence for them, 
 more than they would imagine. 

 2. This gave John a great opportunity of doing good, and was an
 evidence that God was with him. Now people began to crowd and <I>press 
 into the kingdom of heaven</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:16">Luke xvi. 16</A>);

 and a blessed sight it was, to see the <I>dew of the youth</I> dropping 
 <I>from the womb</I> of the gospel-morning 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>),

 to see the net cast where there were so many fish. 

 3. This was an evidence, that it was now a time of great expectation; 
 it was generally thought that the <I>kingdom of God</I> would presently 
 <I>appear</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:11">Luke xix. 11</A>),

 and therefore, when John showed himself to Israel, lived and preached 
 at this rate, so very different from the Scribes and Pharisees, they 
 were ready to say of him, that he was <I>the Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:15">Luke iii. 15</A>);

 and this occasioned such a confluence of people about him.

 4. Those who would have the benefit of John's ministry must <I>go
 out</I> to him in the wilderness, sharing in his reproach. Note, They 
 who truly desire the sincere milk of the word, it if be not brought to 
 them, will seek out for it: and they who would learn the doctrine of 
 repentance must <I>go out</I> from the hurry of this world, and be 
 still. 

 5. It appears by the issue, that of the many who came to John's
 Baptism, there were but few that adhered to it; witness the cold 
 reception Christ had in Judea, and about Jerusalem. Note, There may be
 a multitude of forward hearers, where there are but a few true 
 believers. Curiosity, and affectation of novelty and variety, may bring 
 many to attend upon good preaching, and to be affected with it for a 
 while, who yet are never subject to the power of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:31,32">Ezek. xxxiii. 31, 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The rite, or ceremony, by which he admitted disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Those who received his doctrine, and submitted to his discipline, were
 <I>baptized of him in Jordan,</I> thereby professing their repentance, 
 and their belief that the kingdom of the Messiah was at hand.

 1. They testified their repentance by <I>confessing their sins;</I> a
 general confession, it is probable, they made to John that they were 
 <I>sinners,</I> that they were polluted by sin, and needed cleansing; 
 but to God they made a confession of particular sins, for he is the 
 party offended. The Jews had been taught to <I>justify</I> themselves; 
 but John teaches them to <I>accuse</I> themselves, and not to rest, as 
 they used to do, in the general confession of sin made for all Israel, 
 once a year, upon the day of atonement; but to make a particular 
 acknowledgment, every one, of the <I>plague of his own heart.</I> Note, 
 A penitent confession of sin is required in order to peace and pardon; 
 and those only are ready to receive Jesus Christ as their 
 Righteousness, who are brought with sorrow and shame to their own 
 guilt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:9">1 John i. 9</A>.

 2. The benefits of the <I>kingdom of heaven,</I> now <I>at hand,</I>
 were thereupon sealed to them by baptism. He washed them with water, in 
 token of this--that from all their iniquities God would <I>cleanse 
 them.</I> It was usual with the Jews to baptize those whom they 
 admitted proselytes to their religion, especially those who were only 
 <I>Proselytes of the gate,</I> and were not circumcised, as the 
 <I>Proselytes of righteousness</I> were. Some think it was likewise a 
 custom for persons of eminent religion, who set up for leaders, by 
 baptism to admit pupils and disciples. Christ's question concerning 
 John's Baptism, Was it <I>from heaven,</I> or <I>of men?</I> implied, 
 that there were baptisms of men, who pretended not to a divine mission; 
 with this usage John complied, but <I>his</I> was from heaven, and was 
 distinguished from all others by this character, It was <I>the baptism 
 of repentance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:4">Acts xix. 4</A>.
 
 All Israel were baptized unto Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:2">1 Cor. x. 2</A>.

 The <I>ceremonial law</I> consisted in <I>divers washings or
 baptisms</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10">Heb. ix. 10</A>);

 but John's baptism refers to the remedial law, the law of repentance 
 and faith. He is said to baptize them in Jordan, that river which was 
 famous for Israel's passage through it, and Naaman's cure; yet it is 
 probable that John did not baptize in that river at first, but that 
 afterward, when the people who came to his baptism were numerous, he 
 removed Jordan. By baptism he obliged them to live a holy life, 
 according to the profession they took upon themselves. Note, Confession 
 of sin must always be accompanied with holy resolutions, in the 
 strength of divine grace, not to return to it again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
 his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath
 warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
 &nbsp; 8  Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:
 &nbsp; 9  And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to
 <I>our</I> father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these
 stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
 &nbsp; 10  And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
 therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
 down, and cast into the fire.
 &nbsp; 11  I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that
 cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy
 to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and <I>with</I>
 fire:
 &nbsp; 12  Whose fan <I>is</I> in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
 floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up
 the chaff with unquenchable fire.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The doctrine John preached was that of repentance, in consideration of 
 the <I>kingdom of heaven</I> being <I>at hand;</I> now here we have the 
 use of that doctrine. Application is the life of preaching, so it was 
 of John's preaching.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Observe,</I> 

 1. To whom he applied it; to the Pharisees and Sadducees that came to
 his baptism, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 To others he thought it enough to say, <I>Repent, for the kingdom of
 heaven is at hand;</I> but when he saw these Pharisees and Sadducees 
 come about him, he found it necessary to explain himself, and deal more 
 closely. These were two of the three noted sects among the Jews at that 
 time, the third was that of the Essenes, whom we never read of in the 
 gospels, for they affected retirement, and declined busying themselves 
 in public affairs. The Pharisees were zealots for the ceremonies, for 
 the power of the church, and the traditions of the elders; the 
 Sadducees ran into the other extreme, and were little better than 
 deists, denying the existence of spirits and a future state. It was 
 strange that they came to John's baptism, but their curiosity brought 
 them to be hearers; and some of them, it is probable, submitted to be 
 baptized, but it is certain that the generality of them did not; for 
 Christ says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:29,30">Luke vii. 29, 30</A>),

 that <I>when the publicans justified God, and were baptized of John, 
 the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against 
 themselves, being not baptized of him.</I> Note, Many come to 
 ordinances, who come not under the power of them. Now to them John here 
 addresses himself with all faithfulness, and what he said to them, he 
 said to the multitude 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:7">Luke iii. 7</A>),

 for they were all concerned in what he said. 

 2. What the application was. It is plain and home, and directed to
 their consciences; he speaks as one that came not to preach 
 <I>before</I> them, but to preach <I>to</I> them. Though his education 
 was private, he was not bashful when he appeared in public, nor did he 
 fear the face of man, for he was full of the Holy Ghost, and of 
 power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a word of conviction and awakening. He begins harshly, calls 
 them not Rabbi, gives them not the titles, much less the applauses, 
 they had been used to. 

 1. The <I>title</I> he gives them is, <I>O generation of vipers.</I>
 Christ gave them the same title;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:34,23:23"><I>ch.</I> xii. 34; xxiii. 33</A>.

 They were as <I>vipers;</I> though specious, yet venomous and
 poisonous, and full of malice and enmity to every thing that was good; 
 they were a <I>viperous brood,</I> the seed and offspring of such as 
 had been of the same spirit; it was bred in the bone with them. They 
 gloried in it, that they were the seed of Abraham; but John showed them 
 that they were the serpent's seed (compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>);
 
 of their father the Devil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:44">John viii. 44</A>.

 They were a <I>viperous gang,</I> they were all alike; though enemies 
 to one another, yet confederate in mischief. Note, A wicked generation
 is a <I>generation of vipers,</I> and they ought to be told so; it 
 becomes the ministers of Christ to be bold in showing sinners their 
 true character. 

 2. The <I>alarm</I> he gives them is, <I>Who has warned you to flee
 from the wrath to come?</I> This intimates that they were in danger of 
 the wrath to come; and that their case was so nearly desperate, and 
 their hearts so hardened in sin (the Pharisees by their parade of 
 religion, and the Sadducees by their arguments against religion), that 
 it was next to a miracle to effect anything hopeful among them. "What 
 brings you hither? Who thought of seeing you here? What fright have
 you been put into, that you enquire after the kingdom of heaven?" Note,

 (1.) There is a <I>wrath to come;</I> besides present wrath, the vials 
 of which are poured out now, there is future wrath, the stores of which 
 are treasured up for hereafter. 

 (2.) It is the great concern of every one of us to flee from this 
 wrath. 

 (3.) It is wonderful mercy that we are fairly warned to flee from this 
 wrath; think--<I>Who has warned us?</I> God has warned us, who delights 
 not in our ruin; he warns by the written word, by ministers, by 
 conscience. 

 (4.) These warnings sometime startle those who seemed to have been very 
 much hardened in their security and good opinion of themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a word of <I>exhortation</I> and <I>direction</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);
 
 "<I>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance. Therefore,</I> 
 because you are <I>warned to flee from the wrath to come,</I> let the 
 terrors of the Lord persuade you to a holy life." Or, 
 "<I>Therefore,</I> because you profess repentance, and attend upon the 
 doctrine and baptism of repentance, evidence that you are true 
 penitents." Repentance is seated in the heart. There it is as a root; 
 but in vain do we pretend to have it there, if we do not <I>bring forth 
 the fruits</I> of it in a universal reformation, forsaking all sin, and 
 cleaving to that which is good; these are fruits, <B><I>axious tes 
 metanoias</I></B>--<I>worthy of repentance.</I> Note, Those are not
 worthy the name of penitents, or their privileges, who say they are 
 sorry for their sins, and yet persist in them. They that profess 
 repentance, as all that are baptized do, must be and act as becomes 
 penitents, and never do any thing unbecoming a penitent sinner. It 
 becomes penitents to be humble and low in their own eyes, to be 
 thankful for the least mercy, patient under the greatest affliction, to 
 be watchful against all appearances of sin, and approaches towards it, 
 to abound in every duty, and to be charitable in judging others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is a word of caution, not to trust to their external 
 privileges, so as with them to shift off these calls to repentance 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 <I>Think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our 
 father.</I> Note, There is a great deal which carnal hearts are apt to 
 say within themselves, to put by the convincing, commanding power of 
 the word of God, which ministers should labour to meet with and 
 anticipate; vain thoughts which lodge within those who are called to 
 <I>wash their hearts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:14">Jer. iv. 14</A>.

 <B><I>Me doxete</I></B>--<I>Pretend not, presume not,</I> to say within
 yourselves; be not of the opinion that this will save you; harbour not 
 such a conceit. "<I>Please not yourselves</I> with saying this" (so 
 some read); "rock not yourselves asleep with this, nor flatter 
 yourselves into a fool's paradise." Note, God takes notice of what we 
 say <I>within</I> ourselves, which we dare not speak out, and is 
 acquainted with all the false rests of the soul, and the fallacies with 
 which it deludes itself, but which it will not discover, lest it should 
 be undeceived. Many hide the lie that ruins them, in <I>their right 
 hand,</I> and roll it <I>under their tongue,</I> because they are 
 ashamed to own it; they keep in the Devil's interest, by keeping the 
 Devil's counsel. Now John shows them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What their pretence was; "<I>We have Abraham to our father;</I> we 
 are not sinners of the Gentiles; it is fit indeed that <I>they</I> 
 should be called to repent; but we are Jews, a holy nation, a peculiar 
 people, what is this to us?" Note, The word does us no good, when we 
 will not take it as it is spoken to us, and belonging to us. "Think not 
 that because you are the seed of Abraham, therefore," 

 (1.) "You <I>need not repent,</I> you have nothing to repent of; your 
 relation to Abraham, and your interest in the covenant made with him, 
 denominate you so holy, that there is no occasion for you to change 
 your mind or way." 

 (2.) "That therefore you shall <I>fare well enough,</I> though you do 
 not <I>repent.</I> Think not that this will bring you off in the 
 judgment, and secure you from the wrath to come; that God will connive 
 at your impenitence, because you are Abraham's seed." Note, It is vain 
 presumption to think that our having good relations will save us, 
 though we be not good ourselves. What though we be descended from pious 
 ancestors; have been blessed with a religious education; have our lot 
 cast in families where the fear of God is uppermost; and have good 
 friends to advise us, and pray for us; what will all this avail us, if 
 we do not repent, and live a life of repentance? We have Abraham to our 
 father, and therefore are entitled to the privileges of the covenant 
 made with him; being his seed, we are <I>sons of the church, the temple 
 of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:4">Jer. vii. 4</A>.

 Note, Multitudes, by resting in the honours and advantages of their
 visible church-membership, take up short of heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How foolish and groundless this pretence was; they thought that 
 being the seed of Abraham, they were the only people God had in the 
 world, and therefore that, if they were cut off, he would be at a loss 
 for a church; but John shows them the folly of this conceit; <I>I say 
 unto you</I> (whatever you say within yourselves), that <I>God is able 
 of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</I> He was now 
 baptizing in Jordan at Bethabara 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:28">John i. 28</A>),

 <I>the house of passage,</I> where the children of <I>Israel passed 
 over;</I> and there were the twelve stones, one for each tribe, which 
 Joshua set up for a memorial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+4:20">Josh. iv. 20</A>.

 It is not unlikely that he pointed to those stones, which God could 
 raise to be, more than in representation, the <I>twelve tribes of 
 Israel.</I> Or perhaps he refers to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:1">Isa. li. 1</A>,

 where Abraham is called <I>the rock out of which they were hewn.</I> 
 That God who raised Isaac out of such a rock, can, if there be an 
 occasion, do as much again, for with him <I>nothing is impossible.</I> 
 Some think he pointed to those <I>heathen soldiers</I> that were 
 present, telling the Jews that God would raise up a church for himself 
 among the Gentiles, and entail the blessing of Abraham upon them. Thus 
 when our first parents fell, God could have left them to perish, and 
 out of stones have raised up another Adam and another Eve. Or, take it
 thus, "Stones themselves shall be owned as Abraham's seed, rather than 
 such hard, dry, barren sinners as you are." Note, As it is lowering to 
 the confidence of the sinners in Zion, so it is encouraging to the 
 hopes of the sons of Zion, that, whatever comes of the present 
 generation, God will never want a church in the world; if the Jews fall 
 off, the Gentiles shall be grafted in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:43,Ro+11:12"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 43; Rom. xi. 12</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is a word of terror to the careless and secure Pharisees and 
 Sadducees, and other Jews, that knew not the signs of the times, nor 
 the day of their visitation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 "Now look about you, now that <I>the kingdom of God is at hand,</I> and
 be made sensible."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How strict and short your trial is; <I>Now the axe</I> is carried 
 before you, now it is <I>laid to the root of the tree,</I> now you are 
 upon <I>your good behavior,</I> and are to be so but a <I>while;</I> 
 now you are marked for ruin, and cannot avoid it but by a speedy and 
 sincere repentance. Now you must expect that God will make quicker work 
 with you by his judgments than he did formerly, and that they will 
 <I>begin at the house of God:</I> "where God allows more means, he 
 allows less time." <I>Behold, I come quickly.</I> Now they were put 
 upon their last trial; now or never.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. "How sore and severe your doom will be, if you do not improve this." 
 It is now declared with the axe at the root, to show that God is in 
 earnest in the declaration, that <I>every tree,</I> however <I>high</I> 
 in gifts and honours, however <I>green</I> in external professions and 
 performances, if it <I>bring not forth good fruit,</I> the fruits meet 
 for repentance, is <I>hewn down,</I> disowned as a tree in God's 
 vineyard, unworthy to have room there, and is <I>cast into the fire</I> 
 of God's wrath--the fittest place for barren trees: what else are they
 good for? If not fit for fruit, they are fit for fuel. Probably this 
 refers to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, which was not, as 
 other judgments had been, like the lopping off of the branches, or 
 cutting down of the body of the tree, leaving the root to bud again, 
 but it would be the total, final, and irrecoverable extirpation of that 
 people, in which all those should perish that continued impenitent. Now 
 God would make a full end, wrath was coming on them to the utmost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. A word of instruction concerning Jesus Christ, in whom all John's 
 preaching centered. Christ's ministers preach, not themselves, but him. 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The dignity and pre-eminence of Christ above John. See how meanly he 
 speaks of himself, that he might magnify Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 "<I>I indeed baptize you with water,</I> that is the utmost I can do." 
 Note, Sacraments derive not their efficacy from those who administer 
 them; they can only apply the sign; it is Christ's prerogative to give 
 the thing signified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:6,2Ki+4:31">1 Cor. iii. 6; 2 Kings iv. 31</A>.

 But <I>he that comes after me is mightier than I.</I> Though John had 
 much power, for he came in the <I>spirit and power of Elias,</I> Christ 
 has more; though John was truly great, great in the sight of the Lord 
 (not a greater was born of woman), yet he thinks himself unworthy to be 
 in the meanest place of attendance upon Christ, <I>whose shoes I am not 
 worthy to bear.</I> He sees,

 (1.) How mighty Christ is, in comparison with him. Note, It is a great 
 comfort to the faithful ministers, to think that Jesus Christ is 
 mightier than they, can do that <I>for</I> them, and that <I>by</I> 
 them, which they cannot do; his strength is perfected in their 
 weakness. 

 (2.) How mean he is in comparison with Christ, not worthy to carry his 
 shoes after him! Note, Those whom God puts honour upon, are thereby 
 made very humble and low in their own eyes; willing to be abased, so 
 that Christ may be magnified; to be any thing, to be nothing, so that 
 Christ may be all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The design and intention of Christ's appearing, which they were now 
 speedily to expect. When it was prophesied that John should be sent as 
 Christ's forerunner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1,2">Mal. iii. 1, 2</A>),

 it immediately follows, <I>The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly 
 come,</I> and shall <I>sit as a refiner,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 And after the coming of Elijah, <I>the day comes that shall burn as an 
 oven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:1">Mal. iv. 1</A>),

 to which the Baptist seems here to refer. Christ will come to make a 
 distinction,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) By the powerful working of his grace; <I>He shall baptize you,</I> 
 that is, some of you, <I>with the Holy Ghost and with fire.</I> Note, 
 
 [1.] It is Christ's prerogative to baptize <I>with the Holy Ghost.</I>
 This he did in the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit conferred upon the 
 apostles, to which Christ himself applies these words of John, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:5">Acts i. 5</A>.

 This he does in the graces and comforts of the Spirit given to them 
 that ask him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:13,Joh+7:38,39">Luke xi. 13; John vii. 38, 39</A>;
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:16">Acts xi. 16</A>.

 [2.] They who are baptized with the Holy Ghost are baptized as <I>with
 fire;</I> the seven spirits of God appear as <I>seven lamps of 
 fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:5">Rev. iv. 5</A>.

 Is fire enlightening? So the Spirit is a Spirit of illumination. Is it
 warming? And do not their hearts burn within them? Is it consuming?
 And does not the Spirit of judgment, as a <I>Spirit of burning,</I> 
 consume the dross of their corruptions? Does fire make all it seizes 
 like itself? And does it move upwards? So does the Spirit make the soul 
 holy like itself, and its tendency is heaven-ward. Christ says <I>I am 
 come to send fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:49">Luke xii. 49</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) By the final determinations of his judgment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 <I>Whose fan is in his hand.</I> His ability to distinguish, as the 
 eternal wisdom of the Father, who sees all by a true light, and his 
 authority to distinguish, as the Person to whom all judgment is 
 committed, is the <I>fan</I> that is <I>in his hand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:7">Jer. xv. 7</A>.

 Now he sits as a Refiner. Observe here

 [1.] The visible church is Christ's floor; <I>O my threshing, and the
 corn of my floor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:10">Isa. xxi. 10</A>.

 The temple, a type of church, was built upon a threshing-floor.

 [2.] In this floor there is a mixture of wheat and chaff. True
 believers are as wheat, substantial, useful, and valuable; hypocrites 
 are as chaff, light, and empty, useless and worthless, and carried 
 about with every wind; these are now mixed, good and bad, under the 
 same external profession; and in the same visible communion. 

 [3.] There is a day coming when the floor shall be purged, and the 
 wheat and chaff shall be separated. Something of this kind is often 
 done in this world, when God calls his people out of Babylon, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:4">Rev. xviii. 4</A>.

 But it is the day of the last judgment that will be the great
 winnowing, distinguishing day, which will infallibly determine 
 concerning doctrines and works

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:13">1 Cor. iii. 13</A>),
 
 and concerning persons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:32,33"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 32, 33</A>),

 when saints and sinners shall be parted for ever.

 [4.] Heaven is the garner into which Jesus Christ will shortly gather
 all his wheat, and not a grain of it shall be lost: he will gather them 
 as the ripe fruits were gathered in. Death's scythe is made use of to 
 gather them to their people. In heaven the saints are brought together, 
 and no longer scattered; they are safe, and no longer exposed; 
 separated from corrupt neighbours without, and corrupt affections 
 within, and there is no chaff among them. They are not only gathered 
 into <I>the barn</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:30"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 30</A>),

 but into <I>the garner,</I> where they are thoroughly purified.

 [5.] Hell is the <I>unquenchable fire,</I> which will burn up the
 chaff, which will certainly be the portion and punishment, and 
 everlasting destruction, of hypocrites and unbelievers. So that here 
 are life and death, good and evil, set before us; according as we now 
 are in the <I>field,</I> we shall be then in the <I>floor.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
 baptized of him.
 &nbsp; 14  But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of
 thee, and comest thou to me?
 &nbsp; 15  And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer <I>it to be so</I> now:
 for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
 suffered him.
 &nbsp; 16  And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of
 the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw
 the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:
 &nbsp; 17  And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son,
 in whom I am well pleased.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus, from his childhood till now, when he was almost thirty 
 years of age, had lain hid in Galilee, as it were, buried alive; but 
 now, after a long and dark night, behold, <I>the Sun of 
 righteousness</I> rises in glory. <I>The fulness of time was come</I> 
 that Christ should enter upon his prophetical office; and he chooses to 
 do it, not at Jerusalem (though it is probable that he went thither at 
 the three yearly feasts, as others did), but there <I>where John was 
 baptizing;</I> for to him resorted those who <I>waited for the 
 consolation of Israel,</I> to whom alone he would be welcome. John the 
 Baptist was six months older than our Saviour, and it is supposed that 
 he began to preach and baptize about six months before Christ appeared; 
 so long he was employed in preparing his way, <I>in the region round 
 about Jordan;</I> and more was done towards it in these six months than 
 had been done in several ages before. Christ's coming from Galilee 
 <I>to Jordan, to be baptized,</I> teaches us not to shrink from pain
 and toil, that we may have an opportunity of drawing nigh to God in 
 ordinance. We should be willing to go far, rather than come short of 
 communion with God. Those who will find must seek.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now in this story of Christ's baptism we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How hardly John was persuaded to admit of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 It was an instance of Christ's great humility, that he would offer
 himself <I>to be baptized of John;</I> that he <I>who knew no sin</I> 
 would submit to the baptism of repentance. Note, As soon as ever Christ 
 began to preach, he preached humility, preached it by his example, 
 preached it to all, especially the young ministers. Christ was designed 
 for the highest honours, yet in his first step he thus abases himself. 
 Note, Those who would rise high must begin low. <I>Before honour is 
 humility.</I> It was a great piece of respect done to John, for Christ 
 thus to come to him; and it was a return for the service he did him, in 
 giving notice of his approach. Note, Those that honour God he will 
 honour. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The objection that John made against baptizing Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 <I>John forbade him,</I> as Peter did, when Christ went about to wash
 his feet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:6,8">John xiii. 6, 8</A>.

 Note, Christ's gracious condescensions are so surprising, as to appear
 at first incredible to the strongest believers; so deep and mysterious, 
 that even they who know his mind well cannot soon find out the meaning 
 of them, but, <I>by reason of darkness,</I> start objections against 
 the will of Christ. John's modesty thinks this an honour too great for 
 him to receive, and he expresses himself to Christ, just as his mother 
 had done to Christ's mother

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:43">Luke i. 43</A>);
 
 <I>Whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to 
 me?</I> John had now obtained a great name, and was universally 
 respected: yet see how humble he is still! Note, God has further 
 honours in reserve for those whose spirits continue low when their 
 reputation rises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) John thinks it necessary that he should be baptized of Christ; 
 <I>I have need to be baptized of thee</I> with the baptism of the Holy 
 Ghost, as of fire, for that was Christ's baptism, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 [1.] Though <I>John was filled with the Holy Ghost from the womb</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:15">Luke i. 15</A>),

 yet he acknowledges he had need to be baptized with that baptism. Note, 
 They who have much of the Spirit of God, yet, while here, in this 
 imperfect state, see that they have need of more, and need to apply 
 themselves to Christ for more.

 [2.] <I>John has need to be baptized,</I> though he was the <I>greatest
 that ever was born of woman;</I> yet, being born of a woman, he is 
 polluted, as others of Adam's seed are, and owns he had need of 
 cleansing. Note, The purest souls are most sensible of their own 
 remaining impurity, and seek most earnestly for spiritual washing. 

 [3.] He has <I>need to be baptized of</I> Christ, who can do that for 
 us, which no one else can, and which must be done for us, or we are 
 undone. Note, The best and holiest of men <I>have need</I> of Christ,
 and the better they are, the more they see of that need. 

 [4.] This was said before the multitude, who had a great veneration for 
 John, and were ready to embrace him for the Messiah; yet he publicly 
 owns that he had <I>need to be baptized of</I> Christ. Note, It is no 
 disparagement to the greatest of men, to confess that they are undone 
 without Christ and his grace. 

 [5.] John was Christ's forerunner, and yet owns that he had <I>need to 
 be baptized of</I> him. Note, Even they who were born before Christ in 
 time depended on him, received from him, and had an eye to him. 

 [6.] While John was dealing with others about their souls, observe how 
 feelingly he speaks of the case of his own soul, <I>I have need to be 
 baptized of thee.</I> Note, Ministers, who preach to others, and 
 baptize others, are concerned to look to it that they preach to 
 themselves, and be themselves baptized with the Holy Ghost. Take heed 
 to thyself first; <I>save thyself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:16">1 Tim. iv. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He therefore thinks it very preposterous and absurd, that Christ 
 should be baptized by him; <I>Comest thou to me?</I> Does the holy 
 Jesus, that is separated from sinners, come to be baptized by a sinner, 
 as a sinner, and among sinners? How can this be? Or what account can we 
 give of it? Note, Christ's coming to us may well be wondered at.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The overruling of this objection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 <I>Jesus said, Suffer it to be so now.</I> Christ accepted his 
 humility, but not his refusal; he will have the thing done; and it is 
 fit that Christ should take his own method, though we do not understand 
 it, nor can give a reason for it. See,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How Christ insisted upon it; It must <I>be so now.</I> He does not
 deny that <I>John had need to be baptized of</I> him, yet he will now 
 be <I>baptized of John.</I> <B><I>Aphes arti</I></B>--<I>Let it be yet
 so; suffer it to be so now.</I> Note, Every thing is beautiful in its 
 season. But why <I>now?</I> Why yet? 

 [1.] Christ is <I>now</I> in a state of humiliation: he has emptied 
 himself, and <I>made himself of no reputation.</I> He is not only 
 <I>found in fashion as a man,</I> but is <I>made in the likeness of 
 sinful flesh,</I> and therefore now let him be <I>baptized of John;</I> 
 as if he needed to be washed, though perfectly pure; and thus he <I>was 
 made sin for us,</I> though he <I>knew no sin.</I> 

 [2.] John's baptism is now in reputation, it is that by which God is 
 now doing his work; that is the present dispensation, and therefore 
 Jesus will now be baptized with water; but his baptizing with the Holy 
 Ghost is reserved for hereafter, <I>many days hence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:5">Acts i. 5</A>.
 
 John's baptism has <I>now</I> its day, and therefore honour must
 <I>now</I> be put upon that, and they who attend upon it must be 
 encouraged. Note, They who are of greatest attainments in gifts and 
 graces, should yet, in their place, bear their testimony to instituted 
 ordinances, by a humble and diligent attendance on them, that they may 
 give a good example to others. What we see God owns, and while we see 
 he does so, we must own. John was now increasing, and therefore it
 must be thus yet; shortly he will decrease, and then it will be 
 otherwise. 

 [3.] It must <I>be so now,</I> because now is the time for Christ's 
 appearing in public, and this will be a fair opportunity for it, See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:31-34">John i. 31-34</A>.

 Thus he must be made manifest to Israel, and be signalized by wonders
 from heaven, in that act of his own, which was most condescending and 
 self-abasing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The reason he gives for it; <I>Thus it becomes us to fulfil all 
 righteousness.</I> Note, 

 [1.] There was a propriety in every thing that Christ did for us; it 
 was all graceful 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10,7:26">Heb. ii. 10; vii. 26</A>);

 and we must study to do not only that which behoves us, but that which 
 becomes us; not only that which is indispensably necessary, but that 
 which is <I>lovely, and of good report.</I> 

 [2.] Our Lord Jesus looked upon it as a thing well becoming him, <I>to 
 fulfil all righteousness,</I> that is (as Dr. Whitby explains it), to 
 own every divine institution, and to show his readiness to comply with 
 all God's righteous precepts. <I>Thus it becomes</I> him to justify 
 God, and approve his wisdom, in sending John to prepare his way by the 
 baptism of repentance. <I>Thus it becomes us</I> to countenance and
 encourage every thing that is good, by pattern as well as precept. 
 Christ often mentioned John and his baptism with honour, which that he 
 might do the better, he was himself baptized. Thus Jesus began <I>first 
 to do, and then to teach;</I> and his ministers must take the same 
 method. Thus <I>Christ filled up the righteousness of the ceremonial 
 law,</I> which consisted in divers washings; thus he recommended the 
 gospel-ordinance of baptism to his church, put honour upon it, and 
 showed what virtue he designed to put into it. It became Christ to 
 submit to John's washing with water, because it was a divine 
 appointment; but it became him to oppose the Pharisees' washing with 
 water, because it was a human invention and imposition; and he 
 justified his disciples in refusing to comply with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 With the will of Christ, and this reason for it, John was entirely 
 satisfied, and <I>then he suffered him.</I> The same modesty which made 
 him at first decline the honour Christ offered him, now made him do the 
 service Christ enjoined him. Note, No pretence of humility must make us 
 decline our duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How solemnly Heaven was pleased to grace the baptism of Christ with 
 a special display of glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>);

 <I>Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the
 water.</I> Others that were baptized staid to <I>confess their sins</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 but Christ, having no sins to confess, <I>went up</I> immediately 
 <I>out of the water;</I> so we read it, but not right: for it is 
 <B><I>apo tou hydatos</I></B>--<I>from the water;</I> from the brink of 
 the river, to which he went down to be washed with water, that is, to 
 have his head or face washed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:9">John xiii. 9</A>);

 for here is no mention of the putting off, or putting on, of his 
 clothes, which circumstance would not have omitted, if he had been 
 baptized naked. <I>He went up straightway,</I> as one that entered upon 
 his work with the utmost cheerfulness and resolution; he would lose no 
 time. <I>How was he straitened till it was accomplished!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, when he was coming <I>up out of the water,</I> and all the company 
 had their eye upon him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Lo! the heavens were opened unto him,</I> so as to discover 
 something above and beyond the starry firmament, at least, to him. This 
 was, 

 (1.) To encourage him to go on in his undertaking, with the prospect of 
 the glory and <I>joy that were set before him.</I> Heaven is opened to 
 receive him, when he has finished the work he is now entering upon. 
 
 (2.) To encourage us to receive him, and submit to him. Note, In and
 through Jesus Christ, the heavens are opened to the children of men. 
 Sin shut up heaven, put a stop to all friendly intercourse between God 
 and man; but now Christ <I>has opened the kingdom of heaven to all 
 believers.</I> Divine light and love are darted down upon the children 
 of men, and <I>we have boldness to enter into the holiest.</I> We have 
 receipts of mercy from God, we make returns of duty to God, and all by 
 Jesus Christ, who is the ladder that had its foot on earth and its top 
 in heaven, by whom alone it is that we have any comfortable 
 correspondence with God, or any hope of getting to heaven at last. 
 <I>The heavens were opened</I> when Christ was baptized, to teach us, 
 that when we duly attend on God's ordinances, we may expect communion 
 with him, and communications from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove,</I> or <I>as a 
 dove, and</I> coming or <I>lighting upon him.</I> Christ saw it 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:10">Mark i. 10</A>),
 
 and John saw it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:33,34">John i. 33, 34</A>),

 and it is probable that all the standers-by saw it; for this was 
 intended to be his public inauguration. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>He saw the Spirit of God descended, and lighted on him.</I> In 
 the beginning of the old world, <I>the Spirit of God moved upon the 
 face of the waters</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:2">Gen. i. 2</A>),

 <I>hovered</I> as a bird upon the nest. So here, in the beginning of 
 this new world, Christ, as God, needed not to receive the Holy Ghost, 
 but it was foretold that <I>the Spirit of the Lord should rest upon 
 him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:2,61:1">Isa. xi. 2; lxi. 1</A>),
 
 and here he did so; for,

 [1.] He was to be a Prophet; and prophets always spoke by the Spirit of 
 God, who came upon them. Christ was to execute the prophetic office, 
 not by his divine nature (says Dr. Whitby), but by the afflatus of the
 Holy Spirit. 

 [2.] He was to be the Head of the church; and <I>the Spirit descended 
 upon him,</I> by him to be derived to all believers, in his gifts, 
 graces, and comforts. <I>The ointment on the head ran down to the 
 skirts;</I> Christ <I>received gifts for men,</I> that he might give 
 <I>gifts to men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He <I>descended on him like a dove;</I> whether it was a real, 
 living dove, or, as was usual in visions, the representation or 
 similitude of a dove, is uncertain. If there must be a bodily shape 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:22">Luke iii. 22</A>),

 it must not be that of a man, for the being seen <I>in fashion as a 
 man</I> was peculiar to the second person: none therefore was more fit 
 than the shape of one of the fowls of heaven (heaven being now opened), 
 and of all fowl none was so significant as the dove.

 [1.] The Spirit of Christ is a dove-like spirit; not like <I>a silly 
 dove, without heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:11">Hos. vii. 11</A>),

 but like an innocent dove, without gall. <I>The Spirit descended,</I>
 not in the shape of an eagle, which is, though a royal bird, yet a bird 
 of prey, but <I>in the shape of a dove,</I> than which no creature is 
 more harmless and inoffensive. Such was the Spirit of Christ: <I>He 
 shall not strive, nor cry;</I> such must Christians be, <I>harmless as 
 doves.</I> The dove is remarkable for her eyes; we find that both the 
 eyes of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:12">Cant. v. 12</A>),
 
 and the eyes of the church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:15,4:1">Cant. i. 15; iv. 1</A>),

 are compared to <I>doves' eyes,</I> for they have the same spirit. The 
 dove mourns much 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:14">Isa. xxxviii. 14</A>).

 Christ wept oft; and penitent souls are compared to <I>doves of the 
 valleys.</I>

 [2.] The dove was the only fowl that was offered in sacrifice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:14">Lev. i. 14</A>),

 and Christ by the Spirit, <I>the eternal Spirit, offered himself 
 without spot to God.</I> 

 [3.] The tidings of the decrease of Noah's flood were brought by a 
 dove, with an olive-leaf in her mouth; fitly therefore are the glad 
 tidings of peace with God brought by the Spirit as <I>a dove.</I> It 
 speaks God's <I>good will towards men;</I> that his thoughts towards us 
 are <I>thoughts of good, and not evil.</I> By <I>the voice of the 
 turtle heard in our land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:12">Cant. ii. 12</A>),

 the Chaldee paraphrase understands, <I>the voice of the Holy 
 Spirit.</I> That God is in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, 
 is a joyful message, which comes to us upon the wing, <I>the wings of a 
 dove.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. To explain and complete this solemnity, <I>there came a voice from 
 heaven,</I> which, we have reason to think, was heard by all that were 
 present. The Holy Spirit manifested himself in the likeness of a 
 <I>dove,</I> but God the Father by <I>a voice;</I> for when the law was 
 given they <I>saw no manner of similitude, only they heard a voice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:12">Deut. iv. 12</A>);

 and so this gospel came, and gospel indeed it is, the best news that
 ever came from heaven to earth; for it speaks plainly and fully God's 
 favour to Christ, and us in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) See here how God owns our Lord Jesus; <I>This is my beloved
 Son.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] The relation he stood in to him; He <I>is my Son.</I> Jesus Christ 
 is the Son of God, <I>by eternal generation,</I> as he was <I>begotten
 of the Father before all the worlds</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:15,Heb+1:3">Col. i. 15; Heb. i. 3</A>);

 and by supernatural conception; he was <I>therefore</I> called <I>the 
 Son of God,</I> because he <I>was conceived by the power of the Holy 
 Ghost</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:35">Luke i. 35</A>);

 yet this is not all; he is the Son of God by special designation to the
 work and office of the world's Redeemer. He was sanctified and sealed,
 and sent upon that errand, <I>brought up with</I> the Father for it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>),

 appointed to it; <I>I will make him my First-born,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:27">Ps. lxxxix. 27</A>.

 [2.] The affection the Father had for him; He <I>is my beloved Son;</I>
 his dear Son, <I>the Son of his love</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:13">Col. i. 13</A>);

 he has lain in his bosom from all eternity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18">John i. 18</A>),

 had been <I>always his delight</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>),

 but particularly as Mediator, and in undertaking the work of man's 
 salvation, he was his <I>beloved Son.</I> He is <I>my Elect, in whom my 
 soul delights.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa. xlii. 1</A>.

 Because he consented to the covenant of redemption, and delighted to do
 that <I>will of God, therefore the Father loved him.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:17,Joh+3:35">John x. 17; iii. 35</A>.

 <I>Behold,</I> then, <I>behold,</I> and wonder, <I>what manner of love
 the Father has bestowed on us,</I> that he should deliver up him that 
 was the Son of his love, to suffer and die for those that were the 
 generation of his wrath; nay,and that he <I>therefore</I> loved him, 
 <I>because he laid down his life for the sheep!</I> Now know we that he 
 loved us, <I>seeing he has not withheld his Son, his only Son, his 
 Isaac whom he loved,</I> but <I>gave him to be a sacrifice for our 
 sin.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) See here how ready he is to own us in him: He <I>is my beloved 
 Son,</I> not only <I>with</I> whom, but <I>in</I> whom, I am well 
 pleased. He is pleased with all that are in him, and are united to him 
 by faith. Hitherto God had been displeased with the children of men, 
 but now his anger is turned away, and he has made us <I>accepted in the 
 Beloved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+50:6">Eph. l. 6</A>.

 Let all the world take notice, that this is the Peace-maker, the
 Days-man, who has laid his hand upon us both, and that <I>there is no 
 coming to God</I> as a Father, <I>but by him</I> as Mediator, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:6">John xiv. 6</A>.
 
 <I>In him our spiritual sacrifices are acceptable,</I> for his the
 Altar that <I>sanctifies every gift,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 Out of Christ, God <I>is a consuming Fire,</I> but, in Christ, a
 reconciled Father. This is the sum of the whole gospel; it <I>is a 
 faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that</I> God has 
 declared, <I>by a voice from heaven,</I> that Jesus Christ is his 
 <I>beloved Son, in whom he is well pleased,</I> with which we must by 
 faith cheerfully concur, and say, that he <I>is our beloved</I> 
 Saviour, <I>in whom we are well pleased.</I></P>
