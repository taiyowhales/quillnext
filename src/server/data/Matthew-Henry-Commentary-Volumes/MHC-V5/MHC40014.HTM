 John the Baptist had said concerning Christ, He must increase, but I 
 must decrease, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:30">John iii. 30</A>.

 The morning-star is here disappearing, and the Sun of righteousness
 rising to its meridian lustre. Here is,

 I. The martyrdom of John; his imprisonment for his faithfulness to
 Herod 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>),

 and the beheading of him to please Herodias,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:6-12">ver. 6-12</A>.

 II. The miracles of Christ. 

 1. His feeding five thousand men that came to him to be taught, with
 five loaves and two fishes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:13-21">ver. 13-21</A>.

 2. Christ's walking on the waves to his disciples in a storm,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:22-23">ver. 22-23</A>.

 3. His healing the sick with the touch of the hem of his garment, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:34-36">ver. 34-36</A>.

 Thus he went forth, thus he went on, conquering and to conquer, or 
 rather, curing and to cure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
 &nbsp; 2  And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is
 risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth
 themselves in him.
 &nbsp; 3  For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put <I>him</I>
 in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.
 &nbsp; 4  For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have
 her.
 &nbsp; 5  And when he would have put him to death, he feared the
 multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
 &nbsp; 6  But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias
 danced before them, and pleased Herod.
 &nbsp; 7  Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
 would ask.
 &nbsp; 8  And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me
 here John Baptist's head in a charger.
 &nbsp; 9  And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and
 them which sat with him at meat, he commanded <I>it</I> to be given
 <I>her.</I>
 &nbsp; 10  And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
 &nbsp; 11  And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the
 damsel: and she brought <I>it</I> to her mother.
 &nbsp; 12  And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it,
 and went and told Jesus.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of John's martyrdom. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The occasion of relating this story here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The account brought to Herod of the miracles which Christ wrought. 
 Herod the tetrarch or chief governor of Galilee <I>heard of the fame of 
 Jesus.</I> At that time, when his countrymen slighted him, upon the 
 account of his meanness and obscurity, he began to be famous at court. 
 Note, God will honour those that are despised for his sake. And the 
 gospel, like the sea, gets in one place what it loses in another. 
 Christ had now been preaching and working miracles above two years; 
 yet, it should seem, Herod had not heard of him till now, and now only 
 heard the fame of him. Note, It is the unhappiness of the great ones of 
 the world, that they are most out of the way of hearing the best things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>).

 <I>Which none of the princes of this world knew,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:26">1 Cor. i. 26</A>.
 
 Christ's disciples were now sent abroad to preach, and to work miracles
 in his name, and this spread the fame of him more than ever; which was 
 an indication of the spreading of the gospel by their means after his 
 ascension.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The construction he puts upon this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 <I>He said to his servants</I> that told him of the fame of Jesus, as 
 sure as we are here, <I>this is John the Baptist; he is risen from the 
 dead.</I> Either the leaven of Herod was not Sadducism, <I>for the 
 Sadducees say, There is no resurrection</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:8">Acts xxiii. 8</A>);

 or else Herod's guilty conscience (as is usual with atheists) did at
 this time get the mastery of his opinion, and now he concludes, whether 
 there be a general resurrection or no, that <I>John Baptist is 
 certainly risen,</I> and therefore <I>mighty works do show forth 
 themselves in him.</I> John, while he lived, <I>did no miracle</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:41">John x. 41</A>);

 but Herod concludes, that, being risen from the dead, he is clothed 
 with a greater power than he had while he was living. And he very well 
 calls the miracles he supposed him to work, not <I>his mighty 
 works,</I> but <I>mighty works showing forth themselves in him.</I> 
 Observe here concerning Herod,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How he was disappointed in what he intended by beheading John. He 
 thought if he could get that troublesome fellow out of the way, he 
 might go on in his sins, undisturbed and uncontrolled; yet no sooner is 
 that effected, than he hears of Jesus and his disciples preaching the 
 same pure doctrine that John preached; and, which is more, even the 
 disciples confirming it by miracles in their Master's name. Note, 
 Ministers may be silenced, and imprisoned, and banished, and slain, but 
 the word of God cannot be run down. The prophets <I>live not for ever, 
 but the word takes hold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:5,6">Zech. i. 5, 6</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:9">2 Tim. ii. 9</A>.

 Sometimes God raises up many faithful ministers out of the ashes of
 one. This <I>hope</I> there is of God's trees, <I>though they be cut 
 down,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:7-9">Job xiv. 7-9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How he was filled with causeless fears, merely from the guilt of 
 his own conscience. Thus <I>blood cries,</I> not only <I>from the 
 earth</I> on which it was shed, but from the heart of him that shed it, 
 and makes him <I>Magor-missabib--A terror round about,</I> a terror to
 himself. A guilty conscience suggests every thing that is frightful, 
 and, like a whirlpool, gathers all to itself that comes near it. Thus 
 <I>the wicked flee when none pursue</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:1">Prov. xxviii. 1</A>);

 are in <I>great fear, where no fear is,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:5">Ps. xiv. 5</A>.

 Herod, by a little enquiry, might have found out that this Jesus was in
 being long before John Baptist's death, and therefore could not be 
 <I>Johannes redivivus--John restored to life;</I> and so he might have 
 undeceived himself; but God justly left him to this infatuation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) How, notwithstanding this, he was hardened in his wickedness; for 
 though he was convinced that John was a prophet, and one owned of God, 
 yet he does not express the least remorse or sorrow for his sin in 
 putting him to death. The devils believe and tremble, but they never 
 believe and repent. Note, There may be the terror of strong 
 convictions, where there is not the truth of a saving conversion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The story itself of the imprisonment and martyrdom of John. These 
 extraordinary sufferings of him who was the first preacher of the 
 gospel, plainly show that bonds and afflictions will abide the 
 professors of it. As the first Old-Testament saint, so the first 
 New-Testament minister, died a martyr. And if Christ's forerunner was 
 thus treated, let not his followers expect to be caressed by the world. 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. John's faithfulness in reproving Herod, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 Herod was one of John's hearers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:20">Mark vi. 20</A>),

 and therefore John might be the more bold with him. Note, Ministers, 
 who are reprovers by office, are especially obliged to reprove those 
 that are under their charge, and <I>not to suffer sin upon them;</I> 
 they have the fairest opportunity of dealing with them, and with them 
 may expect the most favourable acceptance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The particular sin he reproved him for was, marrying his brother 
 Philip's wife, not his widow (that had not been so criminal), but his 
 wife. Philip was now living, and Herod inveigled his wife from him, and 
 kept here for his own. Here was a complication of wickedness, adultery, 
 incest, besides the wrong done to Philip, who had had a child by this 
 woman; and it was an aggravation of the wrong, that he was his brother, 
 his half-brother, by the father, but not by the mother. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:20">Ps. l. 20</A>.
 
 For this sin John reproved him; not by tacit and oblique allusions, but
 in plain terms, <I>It is not lawful for thee to have her.</I> He 
 charges it upon him as a sin; not, It is not honourable, or, It is not 
 safe, but, It is not <I>lawful;</I> the <I>sinfulness</I> of sin, as it 
 is the <I>transgression of the law,</I> is the worst thing in it. This 
 was Herod's own iniquity, his beloved sin, and therefore John Baptist 
 tells him of this particularly. Note, 

 (1.) That which by the law of God is unlawful to other people, is by 
 the same law unlawful to princes and the greatest of men. They who rule 
 over men must not forget that they are themselves but men, and subject 
 to God. "<I>It is not lawful for thee,</I> any more than for the 
 meanest subject thou hast, to debauch another man's wife." There is no 
 prerogative, no, not for the greatest and most arbitrary kings, to 
 break the laws of God. 

 (2.) If princes and great men break the law of God, it is very fit they 
 should be told of it by proper persons, and in a proper manner. As
 they are not above the commands of God's word, so they are not above 
 the reproofs of his ministers. <I>It is not fit</I> indeed, <I>to say 
 to a king, Thou art Belial</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:18">Job xxxiv. 18</A>),

 any more than to call a brother <I>Raca,</I> or, <I>Thou fool:</I> it 
 is not fit, while they keep within the sphere of their own authority, 
 to arraign them. But it is fit that, by those whose office it is, they 
 should be told what is unlawful, and told with application, <I>Thou art 
 the man;</I> for it follows there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 that God (whose agents and ambassadors faithful ministers are)
 <I>accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more 
 than the poor.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The imprisonment of John for his faithfulness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 <I>Herod laid hold on John</I> when he was going on to preach and
 baptize, put an end to his work, <I>bound him, and put him in 
 prison;</I> partly to gratify his own revenge, and partly to please 
 Herodias, who of the two seemed to be most incensed against him; it was 
 <I>for her sake</I> that he did it. Note,

 (1.) Faithful reproofs, if they do not profit, usually provoke; if they 
 do not do good, they are resented as affronts, and they that will not 
 bow to the reproof, will fly in the face of the reprover and hate him, 
 as Ahab hated Micaiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:8">1 Kings xxii. 8</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:8,15:10,12">Prov. ix. 8; xv. 10, 12</A>.
 
 <I>Veritas odium parit--Truth produces hatred.</I>

 (2.) It is no new thing for God's ministers to suffer ill for doing
 well. Troubles abide those most that are most diligent and faithful in
 doing their duty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:20">Acts xx. 20</A>.

 Perhaps some of John's friends would blame him as indiscreet in
 reproving Herod, and tell him he had better be silent than provoke 
 Herod, whose character he knew very well, thus to deprive him of his 
 liberty; but away with that discretion that would hinder men from doing 
 their duty as magistrates, ministers, or Christian friends; I believe 
 John's own heart did not reproach him for it, but this testimony of his 
 conscience for him made his bonds easy, that he suffered for 
 well-doing, and not as a <I>busy-body in other men's matters,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:15">1 Pet. iv. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The restraint that Herod lay under from further venting of his rage 
 against John, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He would have put him to death. Perhaps that was not intended at 
 first when he imprisoned him, but his revenge by degrees boiled up to 
 that height. Note, The way of sin, especially the sin of persecution, 
 is down-hill; and when once a respect to Christ's ministers is cast off 
 and broken through in one instance, that is at length done, which the 
 man would sooner have thought himself a dog than to have been guilty 
 of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:13">2 Kings viii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That which hindered him was his <I>fear of the multitude, because 
 they counted John as a prophet.</I> It was not because he feared God 
 (if the fear of God had been before his eyes he would not have 
 imprisoned him), nor because he feared John, though formerly he had had 
 a reverence for him (his lusts had overcome that), but because he 
 feared the people; he was afraid for himself, his own safety, and the 
 safety of his government, his abuse of which he knew had already 
 rendered him odious to the people, whose resentments being so far 
 heated already would be apt, upon such a provocation as the putting of 
 a prophet to death, to break out into a flame. Note, 

 [1.] Tyrants have their fears. Those who are, and affect to be, <I>the
 terror of the mighty,</I> are many times the greatest terror of all to 
 themselves; and when they are most ambitious to be feared by the 
 people, are most afraid of them. 

 [2.] Wicked men are restrained from the most wicked practices, merely
 by their secular interest, and not by any regard to God. A concern for 
 their ease, credit, wealth, and safety, being their reigning principle, 
 as it keeps them from many duties, so it keeps them from many sins, 
 which otherwise they would not be restrained from; and this is one 
 means by which sinners are kept from being overmuch wicked, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:17">Eccl. vii. 17</A>.
 
 The danger of sin that appears to sense, or to fancy only, influences
 men more than that which appears to faith. Herod feared that the 
 putting of John to death might raise a mutiny among the people, which 
 it did not; but he never feared it might raise a mutiny in his own 
 conscience, which it did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Men fear being hanged for that which they do not fear being damned
 for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The contrivance of bringing John to his death. Long he lay in 
 prison; and, against the liberty of the subject (which, blessed be God, 
 is secured to us of this nation by law), might neither be tried nor 
 bailed. It is computed that he lay a year and a half a close prisoner, 
 which was about as much time as he had spent in his public ministry, 
 from his first entrance into it. Now here we have an account of his 
 release, not by any other discharge than death, the period of all a 
 good man's troubles, that brings the prisoners to rest together, so 
 that <I>they hear not the voice of the oppressor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:18">Job iii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Herodias laid the plot; her implacable revenge thirsted after John's 
 blood, and would be satisfied with nothing less. Cross the carnal 
 appetites, and they turn into the most barbarous passions; it was a 
 woman, a whore, and the mother of harlots, that was <I>drunk with the 
 blood of the saints,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:5,6">Rev. xvii. 5, 6</A>.

 Herodias contrived how to bring about the murder of John so
 artificially as to save Herod's credit, and so to pacify the people. A 
 sorry excuse is better than none. But I am apt to think, that if the 
 truth were known, Herod was himself in the plot; and with all his 
 pretences of surprise and sorrow, was privy to the contrivance, and 
 knew before what would be asked. And his pretending his oath, and 
 respect to his guests, was all but sham and grimace. But if he were 
 trepanned into it ere he was aware, yet because it was the thing he 
 might have prevented, and would not, he is justly found guilty of the 
 whole contrivance. Though Jezebel bring Naboth to his end, yet if Ahab 
 take possession, <I>he hath killed.</I> So, though Herodias contrive 
 the beheading of John, yet if Herod consent to it, and take pleasure in 
 it, he is not only an accessary, but a principal murderer. Well, the 
 scene being laid behind the curtain, let us see how it was acted upon 
 the stage, and in what method. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The humouring of Herod by the damsel's dancing upon a birth-day. 
 It seems, Herod's birth-day was kept with some solemnity; in honour of 
 the day, there must needs be, as usual, a ball at court; and, to grace 
 the solemnity, the daughter of Herodias danced before them; who being 
 the queen's daughter, it was more than she ordinarily condescended to 
 do. Note, Times of carnal mirth and jollity are convenient times for 
 carrying on bad designs against God's people. When the king was <I>made 
 sick with bottles of wine, he stretched out his hand with scorners</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:5">Hos. vii. 5</A>),

 for it is part of the <I>sport of a fool</I> to do mischief, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:23">Prov. x. 23</A>.

 The Philistines, when their heart was merry, called for Samson to abuse 
 him. The Parisian massacre was at a wedding. This young lady's dancing
 pleased Herod. We are not told who danced with her, but none pleased 
 Herod like her dancing. Note, A vain and graceless heart is apt to be 
 greatly in love with the lusts of the flesh and of the eye, and when it 
 is so, it is entering into further temptation; for by that Satan gets 
 and keeps possession. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:31-33">Prov. xxiii. 31-33</A>.

 Herod was now in a mirthful mood, and nothing was more agreeable to him
 than that which fed his vanity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The rash and foolish promise which Herod made to this wanton girl, 
 to give her whatsoever she would ask: and this promise confirmed with 
 an oath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It was a very extravagant obligation which Herod here entered into, and
 no way becoming a prudent man that is afraid of being <I>snared in the 
 words of his mouth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:2">Prov. vi. 2</A>),

 much less a good man that fears an oath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:2">Eccl. ix. 2</A>.

 To put this blank into her hand, and enable her to draw upon him at
 pleasure, was too great a recompense for such a sorry piece of merit; 
 and, I am apt to think, Herod would not have been guilty of such an 
 absurdity, if he had not been instructed of Herodias, as well as the 
 damsel. Note, Promissory oaths are ensnaring things, and, when made 
 rashly, are the products of inward corruption, and the occasion of many 
 temptations. Therefore, swear not so at all, lest thou have occasion
 to say, <I>It was an error,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:6">Eccl. v. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The bloody demand the young lady made of John the Baptist's head, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 She was before instructed of her mother. Note, The case of those
 children is very sad, whose parents are <I>their counsellors to do 
 wickedly,</I> as Ahaziah's

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:3">2 Chron. xxii. 3</A>);

 who instruct them and encourage them in sin, and set them bad examples; 
 for the corrupt nature will sooner be quickened by bad instructions 
 than restrained and mortified by good ones. Children ought not to 
 <I>obey their parents</I> against <I>the Lord,</I> but if they command 
 them to sin, must say, as Levi did to <I>father and mother,</I> they 
 <I>have not seen them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Herod having given her her commission, and Herodias her instructions, 
 she requires John the Baptist's head in a charger. Perhaps Herodias 
 feared lest Herod should grow weary of her (as lust useth to nauseate 
 and be cloyed), and then would make John Baptist's reproof a pretence 
 to dismiss her; to prevent which she contrives to harden Herod in it by 
 engaging him in the murder of John. John must be beheaded then; that is 
 the death by which he must glorify God; and because it was <I>his</I> 
 who died first after the beginning of the gospel, though the martyrs 
 died various kinds of deaths, and not so easy and honourable as this, 
 yet this is put for all the rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:4">Rev. xx. 4</A>,

 where we read of <I>the souls of those that were beheaded for the
 witness of Jesus.</I> Yet this is not enough, the thing must be 
 humoured too, and not only a revenge, but a fancy must be gratified; it 
 must be <I>given her here in a charger,</I> served up in blood, as a 
 dish of meat at the feast, or sauce to all the other dishes; it is 
 reserved for the third course, to come up with the rarities. He must 
 have no trial, no public hearing, no forms of law or justice must add 
 solemnity to his death; but he is tried, condemned, and executed, in a 
 breath. It was well for him he was so mortified to the world that death 
 could be no surprise to him, though ever so sudden. It must be given 
 her, and she will reckon it a recompence for her dancing, and desire no

 (4.) Herod's grant of this demand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 <I>The king was sorry,</I> at least took on him to be so, but, <I>for 
 the oath's sake, he commanded it to be given her.</I> Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] A pretended concern for John. <I>The king was sorry.</I> Note, 
 Many a man sins with regret, that never has any true regret for his 
 sin; is sorry to sin, yet is utterly a stranger to godly sorrow; sins 
 with reluctancy, and yet goes on to sin. Dr. Hammond suggests, that
 one reason of Herod's sorrow was, because it was his birth-day 
 festival, and it would be an ill omen to shed blood on that day, which, 
 as other days of joy, used to be graced with acts of clemency; 
 <I>Natalem colimus, tacete lites--We are celebrating the birth-day, let
 there be no contentions.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Here is a pretended conscience of his oath, with a specious show 
 of honour and honesty; he must needs do something, for the oath's sake. 
 Note, It is a great mistake to think that a wicked oath will justify a 
 wicked action. It was implied so necessarily, that it needed not be 
 expressed, that he would do any thing for her that was lawful and 
 honest; and when she demanded what was otherwise, he ought to have 
 declared, and he might have done it honourably, that the oath was null 
 and void, and the obligation of it ceased. No man can lay himself under 
 an obligation to sin, because God has already so strongly obliged every 
 man against sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Here is a real baseness in compliance with wicked companions. 
 Herod yielded, not so much for the sake of the oath, but because it was 
 public, and in compliment to <I>them that sat at meat with him;</I> he 
 granted the demand that he might not seem, before them, to have broken 
 his engagement. Note, A point of honour goes much further with many 
 than a point of conscience. Those who sat at meat with him, probably, 
 were as well pleased with the damsel's dancing as he, and therefore 
 would have her by all means to be gratified in a frolic, and perhaps 
 were as willing as she to see John the Baptist's head off. However, 
 none of them had the honesty to interpose, as they ought to have done, 
 for the preventing of it, as Jehoiakim's princes did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:25">Jer. xxxvi. 25</A>.

 If some of the common people had been here, they would have rescued
 this Jonathan, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:45">1 Sam. xiv. 45</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] Here is a real malice to John at the bottom of this concession, or 
 else he might have found out evasions enough to have got clear of his 
 promise. Note, Though a wicked mind never wants an excuse, yet the 
 truth of the matter is, that <I>every man is tempted when he is drawn 
 aside of his own lust, and enticed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:14">Jam. i. 14</A>.

 Perhaps Herod presently reflecting upon the extravagance of his
 promise, on which she might ground a demand of some vast sum of money, 
 which he loved a great deal better than John the Baptist, was glad to 
 get clear of it so easily; and therefore immediately issues out a 
 warrant for the beheading of John the Baptist, it should seem not in 
 writing, but only by word of mouth; so little account is made of that 
 precious life; <I>he commanded it to be given her.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The execution of John, pursuant to this grant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 <I>He sent and beheaded John in the prison.</I> It is probable the 
 prison was very near, at the gate of the palace; and thither an officer 
 was sent to cut off the head of this great man. He must be beheaded 
 with expedition, to gratify Herodias, who was in a longing condition 
 till it was done. It was done in the night, for it was at supper-time, 
 after supper, it is likely. It was done in the prison, not at the usual 
 place of execution, for fear of an uproar. A great deal of innocent 
 blood, of martyr's blood, has thus been huddled up in corners, which, 
 when God comes to make inquisition for blood, the earth shall disclose, 
 and shall no more cover, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:21,Ps=9:12">Isa. xxvi. 21; Ps. ix. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus was that voice silenced, that burning and shining light 
 extinguished; thus did that prophet, that Elias, of the new Testament, 
 fall a sacrifice to the resentments of an imperious, whorish woman. 
 Thus did he, who was great in the sight of the Lord, <I>die as a fool 
 dieth, his hands were bound, and his feet put into fetters; and as a 
 man falleth before wicked men,</I> so he fell, a true martyr to all 
 intents and purposes: dying, though not for the professions of his 
 faith, yet for the performance of his duty. However, though his work 
 was soon done, <I>it was done and his testimony finished,</I> for till 
 then none of God's witnesses are slain. And God brought this good out 
 of it, that hereby his disciples, who while he lived, though in prison, 
 kept close to him, now after his death heartily closed with Jesus 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The disposal of the poor remains of this blessed saint and martyr. 
 The head and body being separated,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The damsel brought the head in triumph to her mother, as a trophy 
 of the victories of her malice and revenge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 <I>Jerome ad Rufin,</I> relates, that when Herodias had John the
 Baptist's head brought her, she gave herself the barbarous diversion of 
 pricking the tongue with a needle, as Fulvia did Tully's. Note, Bloody 
 minds are pleased with bloody sights, which those of tender spirits 
 shrink and tremble at. Sometimes the insatiable rage of bloody 
 persecutors has fallen upon the dead bodies of the saints, and made 
 sport with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:2">Ps. lxxix. 2</A>.

 When the witnesses are slain, they that <I>dwell on the earth rejoice
 over them, and make merry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10,Ps+14:4,5">Rev. xi. 10; Ps. xiv. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The disciples <I>buried the body,</I> and brought the news in 
 tears to our Lord Jesus. The disciples of John had fasted often whole 
 their master was in prison, their <I>bridegroom was taken away from 
 them,</I> and they prayed earnestly for his deliverance, as the church 
 did for Peter's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:5">Acts xii. 5</A>.

 They had free access to him in prison, which was a comfort to them, but
 they wished to see him at liberty, that he might preach to others; but 
 now on a sudden all their hopes are dashed. Disciples weep and lament, 
 when the world rejoices. Let us see what they did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>They buried the body.</I> Note, There is a respect owing to the 
 servants of Christ, not only while they live, but in their bodies and 
 memories when they are dead. Concerning the first two New-Testament 
 martyrs, it is particularly taken notice of, that they were decently 
 buried, John the Baptist by his disciples, and Stephen by devout men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:2">Acts viii. 2</A>);

 yet there was no enshrining of their bones or other relics, a piece of 
 superstition which sprung up long after, when the enemy had sowed 
 tares. That over-doing, in respect to the bodies of the saints, is
 undoing; though they are not to be vilified, yet they are not to be 
 deified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>They went and told Jesus;</I> not so much that he might shift 
 for his own safety (no doubt he heard it from others, the country rang 
 of it), as they might receive comfort from him, and be taken in among 
 his disciples. Note, <I>First,</I> When any thing ails us at any time, 
 it is our duty and privilege to make Christ acquainted with it. It will 
 be a relief to our burthened spirits to unbosom ourselves to a friend 
 we may be free with. Such a relation dead or unkind, such a comfort 
 lost or embittered, go and tell Jesus who knows already, but will know 
 from us, the trouble of <I>our souls in adversity. Secondly,</I> We 
 must take heed, lest our religion and the profession of it die with our 
 ministers; when John was dead, they did not return every man to his 
 own, but resolved to abide by it still. When the shepherds are smitten, 
 the sheep need not be scattered while they have the great Shepherd of 
 the sheep to go to, who is still the same, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:8,20">Heb. xiii. 8, 20</A>.

 The removal of ministers should bring us nearer to Christ, into a more
 immediate communion with him. <I>Thirdly,</I> Comforts otherwise highly 
 valuable, are sometimes <I>therefore</I> taken from us, because they 
 come between us and Christ, and are apt to carry away that love and 
 esteem which are due to him only: John had long since directed his 
 disciples to Christ, and turned them over to him, but they could not 
 leave their old master while he lived; therefore he is removed that 
 they may go to Jesus, whom they had sometimes emulated and envied for 
 John's sake. It is better to be drawn to Christ by want and loss, than 
 not to come to him at all. If our masters be taken from our head, this 
 is our comfort, we have a Master in heaven, who himself is our 
 Head.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Josephus mentions this story of the death of John the Baptist 
 (<I>Antiq.</I> 18. 116-119), and adds, that a fatal destruction of
 Herod's army in his war with Aretas, king of Petrea (whose daughter was 
 Herod's wife, whom he put away to make room for Herodias), was 
 generally considered by the Jews to be a just judgment upon him, for 
 putting John the Baptist to death. Herod having, at the instigation of 
 Herodias, disobliged the emperor, was deprived of his government, and 
 they were both banished to Lyons in France; which, says Josephus, was 
 his just punishment for hearkening to her solicitations. And, lastly, 
 it is storied of this daughter of Herodias, that going over the ice in 
 winter, the ice broke, and she slipt in up to her neck, which was cut 
 through by the sharpness of the ice. God requiring her head (says Dr. 
 Whitby) for that of the Baptist; which, if true, was a remarkable 
 providence.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  When Jesus heard <I>of it,</I> he departed thence by ship into a
 desert place apart: and when the people had heard <I>thereof,</I> they
 followed him on foot out of the cities.
 &nbsp; 14  And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was
 moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
 &nbsp; 15  And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying,
 This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the
 multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy
 themselves victuals.
 &nbsp; 16  But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them
 to eat.
 &nbsp; 17  And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two
 fishes.
 &nbsp; 18  He said, Bring them hither to me.
 &nbsp; 19  And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and
 took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to
 heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to <I>his</I>
 disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
 &nbsp; 20  And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of
 the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
 &nbsp; 21  And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside
 women and children.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This passage of story, concerning Christ's feeding <I>five thousand men 
 with five loaves and two fishes,</I> is recorded by all the four 
 Evangelists, which very few, if any, of Christ's miracles are: this 
 intimates that there is something in it worthy of special remark. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The great resort of people to Christ, when he was retired <I>into a 
 desert place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He withdrew into privacy when he heard, not of John's death, but of the
 thoughts Herod had concerning him, that he was <I>John the Baptist 
 risen from the dead,</I> and therefore so feared by Herod as to be 
 hated; he departed further off, to get out of Herod's jurisdiction. 
 Note, In times of peril, when God opens a door of escape, it is lawful 
 to flee for our own preservation, unless we have some special call to 
 expose ourselves. Christ's <I>hour was not yet come,</I> and therefore 
 he would not thrust himself upon suffering. He could have secured 
 himself by divine power, but because his life was intended for an 
 example, he did it by human prudence; <I>he departed by ship.</I> But 
 <I>a city on a hill cannot be hid; when the people heard it, they 
 followed him on foot</I> from all parts. Such an interest Christ had in 
 the affections of the multitude, that his withdrawing from them did but 
 draw them after him with so much the more eagerness. Here, as often,
 <I>the scripture was fulfilled,</I> that <I>unto him shall the 
 gathering of the people be.</I> It should seem, there was more crowding 
 to Christ after John's martyrdom than before. Sometimes <I>the 
 suffering of the saints</I> are made to further the gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:12">Phil. i. 12</A>),

 and "the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church." Now John's 
 testimony was finished, it was recollected, and more improved than 
 ever. Note, 

 1. When Christ and his word withdraw from us, it is best for us
 (whatever flesh and blood may object to the contrary) to follow it, 
 preferring opportunities for our souls before any secular advantages 
 whatsoever. <I>When the ark removes, ye shall remove, and go after 
 it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:3">Josh. iii. 3</A>.

 2. <I>Those that truly desire the sincere milk of the word,</I> will
 not stick at the difficulties they may meet with in their attendance on 
 it. The presence of Christ and his gospel makes a desert place not only 
 tolerable, but desirable; it makes the wilderness an Eden,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:3,Isa+41:19,20">Isa. li. 3; xli. 19, 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The tender compassion of our Lord Jesus towards those who thus 
 followed him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 1. He went forth, and appeared publicly among them. Though he retired
 for his own security, and his own repose, yet he went forth from his 
 retirement, when he saw people desirous to hear him, as one willing 
 both to toil himself, and to expose himself, for the good of souls; for 
 <I>even Christ pleased not himself.</I> 

 2. <I>When he saw the multitude, he had compassion on them.</I> Note,
 The sight of a great multitude may justly move compassion. To see a 
 great multitude, and to think how many precious, immortal souls here 
 are, the greatest part of which, we have reason to fear, are neglected 
 and ready to perish, would grieve one to the heart. None like Christ 
 for pity to souls; <I>his compassions fails not.</I> 

 3. He did not only pity them, but he helped them; many of them were
 <I>sick, and he, in compassion to them, healed them;</I> for he came 
 into the world to be the great Healer. After awhile, they were all 
 hungry, <I>and he, in compassion to them, fed them.</I> Note, In all 
 the favours Christ shows to us, he is <I>moved with compassion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9">Isa. lxiii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The motion which the disciples made for the dismissing of the 
 congregation, and Christ's setting aside the motion. 

 1. The <I>evening</I> drawing on, the disciples moved it to Christ to
 send the multitude away; they thought there was a good day's work done, 
 and it was time to disperse. Note, Christ's disciples are often more 
 careful to show their discretion, than to show their zeal; and their 
 abundant affection in the things of God. 

 2. Christ would not dismiss them hungry as they were, nor detain them
 longer without meat, nor put them upon the trouble and charge of buying 
 meat for themselves, but orders his disciples to provide for them. 
 Christ all along expressed more tenderness toward the people than his 
 disciples did; for what are the compassions of the most merciful men, 
 compared with <I>the tender mercies of God in Christ?</I> See how loth 
 Christ is to part with those who are resolved to cleave to him! <I>They 
 need not depart.</I> Note, Those who have Christ have enough, and need 
 not depart to seek a happiness and livelihood in the creature; they 
 that have made sure of <I>the one thing needful,</I> need not be 
 <I>cumbered about much serving:</I> nor will Christ put his willing 
 followers upon a needless expense, but will make their attendance cheap 
 to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But if they be hungry, they have need to depart, for that is a 
 necessity which has no law, therefore, <I>give you them to eat.</I> 
 Note, <I>The Lord is for the body;</I> it is <I>the work of his 
 hands,</I> it is part of his purchase; he was himself clothed with a 
 body, that he might encourage us to depend upon him for the supply of 
 our bodily wants. But he takes a particular care of the body, when it 
 is employed to serve the soul in his more immediate service. If we 
 <I>seek first the kingdom of God,</I> and make that our chief care, we 
 may depend upon God to <I>add other things to us,</I> as far as he sees 
 fit, and may <I>cast all care</I> of them <I>upon him.</I> These 
 followed Christ but for a trial, in a present fit of zeal, and yet 
 Christ took this care of them; much more will he provide for those who 
 follow him fully.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The slender provision that was made for this great multitude; and 
 here we must compare the number of invited guests with the bill of 
 fare.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The number of the guests was <I>five thousand of men, besides women 
 and children;</I> and it is probable the women and children might be as 
 many as the men, if not more. This was a vast auditory that Christ 
 preached to, and we have reason to think an attentive auditory; and, 
 yet it should seem, far the greater part, notwithstanding all this 
 seeming zeal and forwardness, came to nothing; they went off and 
 followed him no more; <I>for many are called, but few are chosen.</I> 
 We would rather perceive the acceptableness of the word by the 
 conversion, than by the crowds, of its hearers; though that also is a 
 good sight and a good sign.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The bill of fare was very disproportionable to the number of the 
 guests, but <I>five loaves and two fishes.</I> This provision the 
 disciples carried about with them for the use of the family, now they 
 <I>were retired into the desert.</I> Christ could have fed them by 
 miracle, but to set us an example of providing for those of our own 
 households, he will have their own camp victualled in an ordinary way. 
 Here is neither plenty, nor variety, nor dainty; a dish of fish was no 
 rarity to them that were fishermen, but it was food convenient for the 
 twelve; two fishes for their supper, and bread to serve them perhaps 
 for a day or two: here was no wine or strong drink; fair water from the 
 rivers in the desert was the best they had to drink with their meat; 
 and yet out of this Christ will have the multitude fed. Note, Those who 
 have but a little, yet when the necessity is urgent, must relieve 
 others out of that little, and that is the way to make it more. <I>Can 
 God furnish a table in the wilderness?</I> Yes, he can, when he 
 pleases, a plentiful table.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The liberal distribution of this provision among the multitude

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>);

 <I>Bring them hither to me.</I> Note, The way to have our creature-like 
 comforts, comforts indeed to us, is to bring them to Christ; for every 
 thing is sanctified by his word, and by prayer to him: that is likely 
 to prosper and do well with us, which we put into the hands of our Lord 
 Jesus, that he may dispose of it as he pleases, and that we may take it 
 back from his hand, and then it will be doubly sweet to us. What we 
 give in charity, we should bring to Christ first, that he may 
 graciously accept it from us, and graciously bless it to those to whom 
 it is given; this is <I>doing it as unto the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now at this miraculous meal we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The seating of the guests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 <I>He commanded them to sit down;</I> which intimates, that while he 
 was preaching to them, they were standing, which is a posture of 
 reverence, and readiness for motion. But what shall we do for chairs 
 for them all? Let them <I>sit down on the grass.</I> When Ahasuerus 
 would <I>show the riches of his glorious kingdom, and the honour of his 
 excellent majesty, in a royal feast for the great men of all his 
 provinces,</I> the beds or couches they sat on <I>were of gold and 
 silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black 
 marble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:6">Esther i. 6</A>.

 Our Lord Jesus did now show, in a divine feast, the riches of a more
 glorious kingdom than that, and the honour of a more excellent majesty, 
 even a dominion over nature itself; but here is not so much as a cloth 
 spread, no plates or napkins laid, no knives or forks, nor so much as a 
 bench to sit down on; but, as if Christ intended indeed to reduce the 
 world to the plainness and simplicity, and so to the innocency and 
 happiness, of Adam in paradise, <I>he commanded them to sit down on the 
 grass.</I> By doing every thing thus, without any pomp or splendour, he 
 plainly showed <I>that his kingdom was not of this world,</I> nor 
 <I>cometh with observation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The craving of a blessing. He did not appoint one of his disciples 
 to be his chaplain, but he himself <I>looked up to heaven, and blessed, 
 and gave thanks;</I> he praised God for the provision they had, and 
 prayed to God to bless it to them. His craving a blessing, was 
 commanding a blessing; for as he preached, so he prayed, <I>like one 
 having authority;</I> and in this prayer and thanksgiving, we may 
 suppose, he had special reference to the multiplying of this food; but 
 herein he has taught us that good duty of craving a blessing and giving 
 thanks at our meals: God's good creatures must be <I>received with 
 thanksgiving,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:4">1 Tim. iv. 4</A>.

 Samuel <I>blessed</I> the feast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:13,Ac+2:46,47,27:24,35">1 Sam. ix. 13;
 Acts ii. 46, 47; xxvii. 34, 35</A>.
 
 This is <I>eating and drinking to the glory of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:31">1 Cor. x. 31</A>);

 <I>giving God thanks</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:6">Rom. xiv. 6</A>);

 <I>eating before God,</I> as Moses, and his father-in-law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:12,15">Exod. xviii. 12, 15</A>.

 When Christ <I>blessed, he looked up to heaven,</I> to teach us, in
 prayer, to eye God as a <I>Father in heaven;</I> and when we receive 
 our creature-comforts to look thitherward, as taking them from God's 
 hand, and depending on him for a blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The carving of the meat. The Master of the feast was himself 
 head-carver, for <I>he brake, and gave the loaves to the disciples, and 
 the disciples to the multitude.</I> Christ intended hereby to put 
 honour upon his disciples, that they might be respected <I>as workers 
 together with him;</I> as also to signify in what way the spiritual 
 food of the word should be dispensed to the world; from Christ, as the 
 original Author, by his ministers. What Christ designed for <I>the 
 churches he signified to his servant John</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:1,4">Rev. i. 1, 4</A>);

 <I>they delivered all that,</I> and that only, <I>which they received 
 from the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:23">1 Cor. xi. 23</A>.

 Ministers can never fill the people's hearts, unless Christ first fill
 their hands: and what he has given to the disciples, they must give to 
 the multitude; for they are <I>stewards, to give to every one his 
 portion of meat,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:45"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 45</A>.

 And, blessed be God, be the multitude ever so great, there is enough
 for all, enough for each.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The increase of the meat. This is taken notice of only in the 
 effect, not in the cause or manner of it; here is no mention of any 
 word that Christ spoke, by which the food was multiplied; the purposes 
 and intentions of his mind and will shall take effect, though they be 
 not spoken out: but this is observable, that the meat was multiplied, 
 not in the heap at first, but in the distribution of it. As the widow's 
 oil increased in the pouring out, so here the bread in the breaking. 
 Thus grace grows by being acted, and, while other things perish in the 
 using, spiritual gifts increase in the using. God ministers seed to the 
 sower, and multiplies not the seed hoarded up, but <I>the seed 
 sown,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:10">2 Cor. ix. 10</A>.

 Thus <I>there is that scattereth and yet increaseth;</I> that
 scattereth, and so increaseth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The plentiful satisfaction of all the guests with this provision. 
 Though the disproportion was so great, yet there was enough and to 
 spare.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There was enough: <I>They did all eat, and were filled.</I> Note, 
 Those whom Christ feeds, he fills; so runs the promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:19">Ps. xxxvii. 19</A>),
 
 <I>They shall be satisfied.</I> As there was enough for all, <I>they 
 did all eat,</I> so there was enough for each, <I>they were filled;</I> 
 though there was but little, there was enough, and that is as good as a 
 feast. Note, The blessing of God can make a little go a great way; as, 
 if God blasts what we have, <I>we eat, and have not enough,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6">Hag. i. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There was to spare; <I>They took up of the fragments that remained, 
 twelve baskets full,</I> one basket for each apostle: thus what they 
 gave they had again, and a great deal more with it; and they were so 
 far from being nice, that they could make this broken meat serve 
 another time, and be thankful. This was to manifest and magnify the 
 miracle, and to show that the provision Christ makes for those who are 
 his is not bare and scanty, but rich and plenteous; <I>bread enough, 
 and to spare</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:17">Luke xv. 17</A>),

 an overflowing fulness. Elisha's multiplying the loaves was somewhat 
 like this, but far short of it; and then it was said, <I>They shall eat 
 and leave,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:43">2 Kings iv. 43</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is the same divine power, though exerted in an ordinary way, which 
 multiplies <I>the seed sown in the ground</I> every year, and makes 
 <I>the earth yield her increase;</I> so that what was brought out by 
 handfuls, is brought home in sheaves. <I>This is the Lord's doing;</I>
 it is <I>by Christ</I> that all natural things consist, and <I>by the 
 word of his power</I> that they are upheld.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into
 a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent
 the multitudes away.
 &nbsp; 23  And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a
 mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was
 there alone.
 &nbsp; 24  But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with
 waves: for the wind was contrary.
 &nbsp; 25  And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,
 walking on the sea.
 &nbsp; 26  And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
 troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
 &nbsp; 27  But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good
 cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
 &nbsp; 28  And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
 come unto thee on the water.
 &nbsp; 29  And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the
 ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
 &nbsp; 30  But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
 beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
 &nbsp; 31  And immediately Jesus stretched forth <I>his</I> hand, and caught
 him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst
 thou doubt?
 &nbsp; 32  And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
 &nbsp; 33  Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him,
 saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of another miracle which Christ wrought for the 
 relief of his friends and followers, his <I>walking upon the water to 
 his disciples.</I> In the foregoing miracle he acted as the Lord of 
 nature, improving its powers for the supply of those who were in want; 
 in this, he acted as the Lord of nature, correcting and controlling its 
 powers for the succour of those who were in danger and distress.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's dismissing of his disciples and <I>the multitude,</I> after 
 he had fed them miraculously. He <I>constrained his disciples to get 
 into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 St. John gives a particular reason for the hasty breaking up of this
 assembly, because the people were so affected with the miracle of the 
 loaves, that they were about <I>to take him by force, and make him a 
 king</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:15">John vi. 15</A>);

 to avoid which, he immediately scattered the people, sent away the 
 disciples, lest they should join with them, and he himself withdrew, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:15">John vi. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When they had <I>sat down to eat and drink, they</I> did not <I>rise up 
 to play,</I> but each went to his business.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ sent the people away. It intimates somewhat of solemnity in 
 the dismissing of them; he sent them away with a blessing, with some 
 parting words of caution, counsel, and comfort, which might abide with 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He <I>constrained the disciples to go into a ship</I> first, for 
 till they were gone the people would not stir. The disciples were loth 
 to go, and would not have gone, if he had not <I>constrained</I> them. 
 They were loth to go to sea without him. <I>If thy presence go not
 with us, carry us not up hence.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:15">Exod. xxxiii. 15</A>.

 They were loth to leave him alone, without any attendance, or any ship
 to wait for him; but they did it in pure obedience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's retirement hereupon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 <I>He went up into a mountain apart to pray.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he was alone; <I>he went apart into a solitary place, and was 
 there all alone.</I> Though he had so much work to do with others, yet 
 he chose sometimes to be alone, to set us an example. Those are not 
 Christ's followers that do not care for being alone; that cannot enjoy 
 themselves in solitude, when they have none else to converse with, none 
 else to enjoy, but God and their own hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he was alone at prayer; that was his business in this solitude, 
 to pray. Though Christ, as God, was Lord of all, and was prayed to, yet 
 Christ, as Man, had <I>the form of a servant,</I> of a beggar, and 
 prayed. Christ has herein set before us an example of secret prayer, 
 and the performance of it secretly, according to the rule he gave, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:6"><I>ch.</I> vi. 6</A>.

 Perhaps in this mountain there was some private oratory or convenience,
 provided for such an occasion; it was usual among the Jews to have 
 such. Observe, When the disciples went to sea, their Master went to
 prayer; when Peter was to be <I>sifted as wheat, Christ prayed for 
 him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he was long alone; <I>there he was when the evening was 
 come,</I> and, for aught that appears, there he was till towards 
 morning, <I>the fourth watch of the night. The night</I> came on, and 
 it was a stormy, tempestuous night, yet he continued <I>instant in 
 prayer.</I> Note, It is good, at least sometimes, upon special 
 occasions, and when we find our hearts enlarged, to continue long in 
 secret prayer, and to take full scope in <I>pouring out our hearts 
 before the Lord.</I> We must not <I>restrain prayer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:4">Job xv. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The condition that the poor disciples were in at this time: 
 <I>Their ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 We may observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they were got into the midst of the sea when the storm rose. We 
 may have fair weather at the beginning of our voyage, and yet meet with 
 storms before we arrive at the port we are bound for. Therefore, <I>let 
 not him that girdeth on the harness boast as he that puts it off,</I> 
 but after a long calm expect some storm or other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The disciples were now where Christ sent them, and yet met with this 
 storm. Had they been flying from their Master, and their work, as Jonah 
 was, when he was arrested by the storm, it had been a dreadful one 
 indeed; but they had a special command from their Master to go to sea 
 at this time, and were going about their work. Note, It is no new thing 
 for Christ's disciples to meet with storms in the way of their duty, 
 and to be sent to sea then when their Master foresees a storm; but let 
 them not take it unkindly; what he does they <I>know not now, but they 
 shall know hereafter,</I> that Christ designs hereby to manifest 
 himself with the more wonderful grace to them and for them. 

 3. It was a great discouragement to them now that they had not Christ
 with them, as they had formerly when they were in a storm; though he 
 was then asleep indeed, yet he was soon awaked

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:24"><I>ch.</I> viii. 24</A>),

 but now he was not with them at all. Thus Christ used his disciples
 first to less difficulties, and then to greater, and so trains them up 
 by degrees to live <I>by faith, and not by sense.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Though <I>the wind was contrary,</I> and they were tossed with 
 waves, yet being ordered by their Master <I>to the other side,</I> they 
 did not tack about and come back again, but made the best of their way 
 forward. Note, Though troubles and difficulties may disturb us in our 
 duty, they must not drive us from it; but through the midst of them we 
 must press forwards.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ's approach to them in this condition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 and in this we have an instance,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Of his goodness, that he went unto them, as one that took cognizance 
 of their case, and was under a concern about them, as a father about 
 his children. Note, The extremity of the church and people of God is 
 Christ's opportunity to visit them and appear for them: but he came not 
 till <I>the fourth watch,</I> toward three o'clock in the morning, for 
 then the fourth watch began. It was <I>in the morning-watch</I> that 
 the Lord appeared for Israel in the Red sea 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:24">Exod. xiv. 24</A>),

 so was this. <I>He that keepeth Israel neither slumbers nor
 sleeps,</I> but, when there is occasion, <I>walks in darkness</I> for 
 their succour; helps, and that right early.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Of his power, that he <I>went unto them, walking on the sea.</I> 
 This is a great instance of Christ's sovereign dominion over all the 
 creatures; they are all under his feet, and at his command; they forget 
 their natures, and change the qualities that we call essential. We need 
 not enquire how this was done, whether by condensing the surface of the 
 water (when God pleases, <I>the depths are congealed in the heart of 
 the sea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:8">Exod. xv. 8</A>),

 or by suspending the gravitation of his body, which was transfigured as
 he pleased; it is sufficient that it proves his divine power, for it is 
 God's prerogative to <I>tread upon the waves of the sea</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:8">Job ix. 8</A>),

 as it is <I>to ride upon the wings of the wind.</I> He <I>that made the 
 waters of the sea a wall for the redeemed of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:10">Isa. li. 10</A>),
 
 here makes them a walk for the Redeemer himself, who, as Lord of all, 
 appears with one foot on the sea and the other on dry land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:2">Rev. x. 2</A>.
 
 The same power that made iron to swim
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:6">2 Kings vi. 6</A>),

 did this. <I>What ailed thee, O thou sea?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:5">Ps. cxiii. 5</A>.

 <I>It was at the presence of the Lord. Thy way, O God, is in the
 sea,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:19">Ps. lxxvii. 19</A>).

 Note, Christ can take what way he pleases to save his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is an account of what passed between Christ and his distressed 
 friends upon his approach.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Between him and all the disciples. We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How their fears were raised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);

 <I>When they saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It 
 is a spirit;</I> <B><I>phantasma esti</I></B>--<I>It is an 
 apparition;</I> so it might much better be rendered. It seems, the
 existence and appearance of spirits were generally believed in by all 
 except the Sadducees, whose doctrine Christ had warned his disciples 
 against; yet, doubtless, many supposed apparitions have been merely the 
 creatures of men's own fear and fancy. These disciples said, <I>It is 
 the Lord;</I> it can be no other. Note, 

 [1.] Even the appearances and approaches of deliverance are sometimes
 the occasions of trouble and perplexity to God's people, who are 
 sometimes most frightened when they are least hurt; nay, when they are 
 most favoured, as the Virgin Mary, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:29,Ex+3:6,7">Luke i. 29; Exod. iii. 6, 7</A>.

 The comforts of <I>the Spirit of adoption</I> are introduced by the
 terrors of <I>the spirit of bondage,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:15">Rom. viii. 15</A>.

 [2.] The appearance of a spirit, or the fancy of it, cannot but be
 frightful, and strike a terror upon us, because of the distance of the 
 world of spirits from us, the just quarrel good spirits have with us, 
 and the inveterate enmity evil spirits have against us: see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:14,15">Job iv. 14, 15</A>.

 The more acquaintance we have with God, the Father of spirits, and the
 more careful we are to keep ourselves in his love, the better able we 
 shall be to deal with those fears.

 [3.] The perplexing, disquieting fears of good people, arise from their
 mistakes and misapprehensions concerning Christ, his person, offices, 
 and undertaking; the more clearly and fully we know his name, with the 
 more assurance we shall trust in him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:10">Ps. ix. 10</A>.

 [4.] A little thing frightens us in a storm. When <I>without are
 fightings,</I> no marvel that <I>within are fears.</I> Perhaps the 
 disciples fancied it was some evil spirit that raised the storm. Note, 
 Most of our danger from outward troubles arises from the occasion they 
 give for inward trouble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How these fears were silenced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He straightway relieved them, by showing them their mistake; when they
 were wrestling <I>with the waves,</I> he delayed his succour for some 
 time; but he hastened his succour against their fright, as much the 
 more dangerous; he straightway laid that storm with his word, <I>Be of 
 good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He rectified their mistake, by making himself known to them, as 
 Joseph to his brethren; <I>It is I.</I> He does not name himself, as he
 did to Paul, <I>I am Jesus;</I> for Paul as yet knew him not: but to 
 these disciples it was enough to say, <I>It is I;</I> they <I>knew his 
 voice, as his sheep</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:4">John x. 4</A>),

 as Mary Magdalene, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:16">John xx. 16</A>.

 They need not ask, <I>Who art thou, Lord? Art thou for us or for our
 adversaries?</I> They could say with the spouse, <I>It is the voice of 
 my beloved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:8,">Cant. ii. 8; v. 2</A>.

 True believers know it by a good token. It was enough to make them
 easy, to understand who it was they saw. Note, A right knowledge opens 
 the door to true comfort, especially the knowledge of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He encouraged them against their fright; <I>It is I,</I> and
 therefore, <I>First, Be of good cheer;</I> 
 <B><I>tharseite</I></B>--"<I>Be courageous;</I> pluck up your spirits,
 and be courageous." If Christ's disciples be not cheerful in a storm, 
 it is their own fault, he would have them so. <I>Secondly, Be not 
 afraid;</I> 

 1. "Be not afraid of me, now that you know it is I; surely you will not
 fear, for you know I mean you no hurt." Note, Christ will not be a 
 terror to those to whom he manifests himself; when they come to 
 understand him aright, the terror will be over. 

 2. "<I>Be not afraid</I> of the tempest, of the winds and waves, though
 noisy and very threatening; fear them not, while I am so near you. I am 
 he that concerns himself for you, and will not stand by and see you 
 perish." Note, Nothing needs be a terror to those that have Christ near 
 them, and know he is theirs; no, not death itself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Between him and Peter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:28-31">
 <I>v.</I> 28-31</A>,
 
 where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Peter's courage, and Christ's countenancing that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] It was very bold in Peter, that he would venture to come to Christ 
 <I>upon the water</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);

 <I>Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee.</I> Courage was Peter's 
 master grace; and that made him so forward above the rest to express 
 his love to Christ, though others perhaps loved him as well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> It is an instance of Peter's affection to Christ, that he 
 desired to come to him. When he sees Christ, whom, doubtless, during 
 the storm, he had many a time wished for, he is impatient to be with 
 him. He does not say, <I>Bid me walk on the waters,</I> as desiring it 
 for the miracle sake; but, <I>Bid me come to thee,</I> as desiring it 
 for Christ's sake; "Let me come to thee, no matter how." Note, True 
 love will break through fire and water, if duly called to it, to come 
 to Christ. Christ was coming to them, to succour and deliver them.
 <I>Lord,</I> said Peter, <I>bid me come to thee.</I> Note, When Christ 
 is coming towards us in a way of mercy, we must go forth to meet him in 
 a way of duty; and herein we must be willing and bold to venture with 
 him and venture for him. Those that would have benefit by Christ as a 
 Saviour, must thus by faith come to him. Christ had been now, for some 
 time, absent, and hereby it appears why he absented himself; it was to 
 endear himself so much the more to his disciples at his return, to make 
 it highly seasonable and doubly acceptable. Note, When, for a small 
 amount, Christ has forsaken his people, his returns are welcome, and 
 most affectionately embraced; when gracious souls, after long seeking, 
 find their Beloved at last, they <I>hold him, and will not let him 
 go,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:4">Cant. iii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> It is an instance of Peter's caution and due 
 observance of the will of Christ, that he would not come without a 
 warrant. Not, "If it be thou, I will come;" but <I>If it be thou, bid 
 me come.</I> Note, The boldest spirits must wait for a call to 
 hazardous enterprizes, and we must not rashly and presumptuously thrust 
 ourselves upon them. Our will to services and sufferings is 
 interpreted, not willingness, but wilfulness, if it have not a regard 
 to the will of Christ, and be not regulated by his call and command. 
 Such extraordinary warrants as this to Peter we are not now to expect, 
 but must have recourse to the general rules of the word, in the 
 application of which to particular cases, with the help of providential 
 hints, <I>wisdom is profitable to direct.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> It is an instance of Peter's faith and resolution, that
 he ventured upon the water when Christ bid him. To quit the safety of 
 the ship, and throw himself into the jaws of death, to despise the 
 threatening waves he so lately dreaded, argued a very strong dependence 
 upon the power and word of Christ. What difficulty or danger could 
 stand before such a faith and such a zeal?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It was very kind and condescending in Christ, that he was pleased 
 to own him in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 He might have condemned the proposal as foolish and rash; nay, and as
 proud and assuming; "Shall Peter pretend to do as his Master does?" But 
 Christ knew that it came from a sincere and zealous affection to him, 
 and graciously accepted of it. Note, Christ is well pleased with the 
 expressions of his people's love, though mixed with manifold 
 infirmities, and makes the best of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He bid him <I>come.</I> When the Pharisees asked a sign, 
 they had not only a repulse, but a reproof, for it, because they did it 
 with a design to tempt Christ; when Peter asked a sign, he had it, 
 because he did it with a resolution to trust Christ. The gospel call 
 is, "<I>Come, come,</I> to Christ; venture all in his hand, and commit 
 the keeping of your souls to him; venture through a stormy sea, a 
 troublesome world, to Jesus Christ."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He bore him out when he did come; Peter <I>walked upon 
 the water.</I> The communion of true believers with Christ is
 represented by their being <I>quickened with him, raised up with him,
 made to sit with him,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:5,6">Eph. ii. 5, 6</A>),

 and being <I>crucified with him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:20">Gal. ii. 20</A>.

 Now, methinks, it is represented in this story by their <I>walking with
 him on the water.</I> Through the strength of Christ we are borne up
 above the world, enabled to trample upon it, kept from sinking into it,
 from being overwhelmed by it, obtain a victory over it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:4">1 John v. 4</A>),

 by faith in Christ's victory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:33">John xvi. 33</A>),

 and with him are <I>crucified to it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:14">Gal. vi. 14</A>.

 See blessed Paul walking upon the water with Jesus, and <I>more than a
 conqueror through him,</I> and treading upon all the threatening waves, 
 as <I>not able to separate him from the love of Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:35">Rom. viii. 35</A>,

 &c. Thus the sea of the world is become like a sea of glass, congealed
 so as to bear; and they that have gotten the victory, stand upon it and
 sing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+15:2,3">Rev. xv. 2, 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He walked upon the water, not for diversion or ostentation, but to go 
 to Jesus; and in that he was thus wonderfully borne up. Note, When 
 <I>our souls are following hard after God,</I> then it is that his 
 <I>right hand upholds us;</I> it was David's experience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:8">Ps. lxiii. 8</A>.
 
 Special supports are promised, and are to be expected, only in
 spiritual pursuits. When God bears his Israel upon eagles' wings, it is 
 <I>to bring them to himself</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:4">Exod. xix. 4</A>);

 nor can we ever come to Jesus, unless we be upheld by his power; it is 
 in his own strength that we wrestle with him, that we reach after him, 
 that we <I>press forward toward the mark,</I> being <I>kept by the 
 power of God,</I> which power we must depend upon, as Peter when he 
 <I>walked upon the water:</I> and there is no danger of sinking while 
 <I>underneath are the everlasting arms.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is Peter's cowardice, and Christ's reproving him and 
 succouring him. Christ bid him come, not only that he might walk upon 
 the water, and so know Christ's power, but that he might sink, and so 
 know his own weakness; for as he would encourage his faith, so he would 
 check his confidence, and make him ashamed of it. Observe then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Peter's great fear 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>);

 <I>He was afraid.</I> The strongest faith and the greatest courage have 
 a mixture of fear. Those that can say, <I>Lord, I believe;</I> must 
 say, <I>Lord, help my unbelief.</I> Nothing but <I>perfect love</I> 
 will quite <I>cast out fear.</I> Good men often fail in those graces 
 which they are most eminent for, and which they have then in exercise; 
 to show that they have not yet attained. Peter was very stout at first, 
 but afterwards his heart failed him. The lengthening out of a trial 
 discovers the weakness of faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, <I>First,</I> The cause of this fear; <I>He saw the wind 
 boisterous.</I> While Peter kept his eye fixed upon Christ, and upon 
 his word and power, he <I>walked upon the water</I> well enough; but 
 when he took notice withal of the danger he was in, and observed how 
 <I>the floods lift up their waves,</I> then he feared. Note, Looking at 
 difficulties with an eye of sense more than at precepts and promises 
 with an eye of faith is at the bottom of all our inordinate fears, both 
 as to public and personal concerns. Abraham was strong in faith, 
 because he <I>considered not his own body</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:19">Rom. iv. 19</A>);

 he minded not the discouraging improbabilities which the promise lay 
 under, but kept his eye on God's power; and so, <I>against hope, 
 believed in hope,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Peter, <I>when he saw the wind boisterous,</I> should have remembered
 what he had seen

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:27"><I>ch.</I> viii. 27</A>),

 when the winds and the sea obeyed Christ; but <I>therefore we fear
 continually every day,</I> because <I>we forget the Lord our Maker,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12,13">Isa. li. 12, 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The effect of this fear; <I>He began to sink.</I> 
 While faith kept up, he kept up above water: but when faith staggered, 
 <I>he began to sink.</I> Note, The sinking of our spirits is owing to 
 the weakness of our faith; we are upheld (but it is as we are saved) 
 <I>through faith</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:5">1 Pet. i. 5</A>);

 and therefore, when our <I>souls are cast down and disquieted,</I> the 
 sovereign remedy is, <I>to hope in God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+43:5">Ps. xliii. 5</A>.

 It is probable that Peter, being bred a fisherman, could swim very well

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:7">John xxi. 7</A>);
 
 and perhaps he trusted in part to that, when he cast himself into the 
 sea; if he could not walk, he could swim; but Christ let him begin to 
 sink, to show him that it <I>was Christ's right hand and his holy 
 arm,</I> not any skill of his own, that was his security. It was 
 Christ's great mercy to him, that, upon the failing of his faith, he 
 did not leave him to sink outright, to sink to the <I>bottom as a 
 stone</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:5">Exod. xv. 5</A>),

 but gave him time to cry, <I>Lord, save me.</I> Such is the care of 
 Christ concerning true believers; though weak, they do but begin to 
 sink! A man is never sunk, never undone, till he is in hell. Peter 
 <I>walked</I> as he <I>believed;</I> to him, as to others, the rule 
 held good, <I>According to your faith be it unto you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> The remedy he had recourse to in this distress, the
 old, tried, approved remedy, and that was prayer: he cried, <I>Lord, 
 save me.</I> Observe,

 1. The manner of his praying; it is fervent and importunate; <I>He
 cried.</I> Note, When faith is weak, prayer should be strong. Our Lord 
 Jesus has taught us in the day of our fear to <I>offer up strong 
 cries,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>.

 Sense of danger will make us cry, sense of duty and dependence on God
 should make us cry to him.

 2. The matter of his prayer was pertinent and to the purpose; <I>He
 cried, Lord, save me.</I> Christ is the great Saviour, he came to save; 
 those that would be saved, must not only <I>come</I> to him, but 
 <I>cry</I> to him for salvation; but we are never brought to this, till 
 we find ourselves sinking; sense of need will drive us to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Christ's great favour to Peter, in this fright. Though there was a 
 mixture of presumption with Peter's faith in his first adventure, and 
 of unbelief with his faith in his after-fainting, yet Christ did not 
 cast him off; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He saved him; <I>he answered him with the saving strength 
 of his right hand</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:6">Ps. xx. 6</A>),

 for immediately <I>he stretched forth his hand, and caught him.</I> 
 Note, Christ's time to save is, when we sink 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:4-7">Ps. xviii. 4-7</A>):

 he helps at a dead lift. Christ's hand is still stretched out to all 
 believers, to keep them from sinking. Those whom he hath once 
 apprehended as his own, and hath snatched as <I>brands out of the 
 burning,</I> he will catch out of the water too. Though he may seem to 
 have left his hold, he doth but seem to do so, for they shall <I>never 
 perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of his hand,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:28">John x. 28</A>.

 Never fear, he will hold his own. Our deliverance from our own fears,
 which else would overwhelm us, is owing to the hand of his power and 
 grace,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:4">Ps. xxxiv. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He rebuked him; for as many as he loves and saves, he 
 reproves and chides; <I>O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou 
 doubt?</I> Note, 

 1. Faith may be true, and yet weak; at first, like a grain of
 mustard-seed. Peter had faith enough to bring him upon the water, yet, 
 because not enough to carry him through, Christ tells him he had but 
 <I>little.</I> 

 2. Our discouraging doubts and fears are all owing to the weakness of
 our faith: <I>therefore we doubt,</I> because we are but <I>of little 
 faith.</I> It is the business of faith to resolve doubts, the doubts of 
 sense, in a stormy day, so as even then to keep the head above water. 
 Could we but believe more, we should doubt less.

 3. The weakness of our faith, and the prevalence of our doubts, are
 very displeasing to our Lord Jesus. It is true, he doth not cast off 
 weak believers, but it is as true, that he is not pleased with weak 
 faith, no, not in those that are nearest to him. <I>Wherefore didst 
 thou doubt?</I> What reason was there for it? Note, Our doubts and 
 fears would soon vanish before a strict enquiry into the cause of them; 
 for, all things considered, there is no good reason why Christ's 
 disciples should be of a doubtful mind, no, not in a stormy day, 
 because he is ready to them <I>a very present Help.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The <I>ceasing of the storm,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 When Christ was come into the ship, they were presently at the shore.
 Christ <I>walked upon the water</I> till he came to the ship, and then 
 went into that, when he could easily have walked to the shore; but when 
 ordinary means are to be had, miracles are not to be expected. Though 
 Christ needs not instruments for the doing of his work, he is pleased 
 to use them. Observe, when Christ came into the ship, Peter came in
 with him. Companions with Christ in his patience, shall be companions
 in his kingdoms, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:9">Rev. i. 9</A>.

 Those that walk with him shall reign with him; those that are exposed,
 and that suffer with him, shall triumph with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>When they were come into the ship, immediately the storm ceased,</I> 
 for it had done its work, its trying work. He that has <I>gathered the 
 winds into his fists, and bound the waters in a garment,</I> is the 
 same that <I>ascended and descended;</I> and <I>his word</I> even 
 <I>stormy winds fulfil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:8">Ps. cxlviii. 8</A>.

 When Christ comes into a soul, he makes winds and storms to cease
 there, and commands peace. Welcome Christ, and the <I>noise of her 
 waves will soon be quelled.</I> The way to be still is, to know that he 
 is God, that he is the <I>Lord with us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The adoration paid to Christ hereupon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 <I>They that were in the ship came and worshipped him, and said, Of a 
 truth, thou art the Son of God.</I> Two good uses they made of this 
 distress, and this deliverance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was a confirmation of their faith in Christ, and abundantly 
 convinced them that <I>the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in him;</I> for 
 none but the world's Creator could multiply the loaves, none but its 
 Governor could tread upon the waters of the sea; they therefore yield 
 to the evidence, and make confession of their faith; <I>Thou truly art 
 the Son of God.</I> They knew before that he was the Son of God, but 
 now they know it better. Faith, after a conflict with unbelief, is 
 sometimes the more active, and gets to greater degrees of strength by 
 being exercised. Now they <I>know it of a truth.</I> Note, It is good 
 for us to know more and more of <I>the certainty of those things 
 wherein we have been instructed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:4">Luke i. 4</A>.

 Faith <I>then</I> grows, when it arrives at a full assurance, when it
 sees clearly, and saith, <I>Of a truth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They took occasion from it to <I>give him the glory due unto his 
 name.</I> They not only owned that great truth, but were suitable 
 affected by it; <I>they worshiped Christ.</I> Note, When Christ 
 manifests his glory for us, we ought to return it to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:15">Ps. l. 15</A>);
 
 <I>I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</I> Their worship 
 and adoration of Christ were thus expressed, <I>Of a truth thou art the 
 Son of God.</I> Note, The matter of our creed may and must be made the 
 matter of our praise. Faith is the proper principle of worship, and
 worship the genuine product of faith. <I>He that comes to God must 
 believe;</I> and he that <I>believes</I> in God, will come,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>34  And when they were gone over, they came into the land of
 Gennesaret.
 &nbsp; 35  And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they
 sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him
 all that were diseased;
 &nbsp; 36  And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his
 garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of miracles by wholesale, which Christ wrought 
 on the other side of the water, in the land of Gennesaret. 
 Whithersoever Christ went, he was doing good. Gennesaret was a tract of 
 land that lay between Bethsaida and Capernaum, and either gave the name 
 to, or took the name from, this sea, which is called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:1">Luke v. 1</A>)

 <I>The Lake of Gennesaret;</I> it signifies the valley of branches. 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The forwardness and faith of <I>the men of that place.</I> These 
 were more noble than the Gergesenes, their neighbours, who were 
 borderers upon the same lake. Those <I>besought Christ to depart</I> 
 from them, they had no occasion for him; these besought him to help 
 them, they had need of him. Christ reckons it the greatest honour we 
 can do him, to make use of him. Now here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How <I>the men of that place</I> were brought to Christ; they <I>had 
 knowledge of him.</I> It is probable that his miraculous passage over 
 the sea, which they that were in the ship would industriously spread 
 the report of, might help to make way for his entertainment in those 
 parts; and perhaps it was one thing Christ intended in it, for he has 
 great reaches in what he does. This they had knowledge of, and of the 
 other miracles Christ had wrought, and therefore they flocked to him. 
 Note, They that know Christ's name, will make their application to him: 
 if Christ were better known, he would not be neglected as he is; he is 
 trusted as far as he is known.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 They <I>had knowledge of him,</I> that is, of his being among them, and 
 that he would be put awhile among them. Note, The discerning of the day 
 of our opportunities is a good step toward the improvement of it. This 
 was <I>the condemnation of the world,</I> that Christ <I>was in the 
 world, and the world knew him not</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:10">John i. 10</A>);

 Jerusalem knew him not 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:42">Luke xix. 42</A>),

 but there were some who, when he was among them, <I>had knowledge of 
 him.</I> It is better to know that there <I>is</I> a prophet among us 
 than that there <I>has been</I> one, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:5">Ezek. ii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How they brought others to Christ, by giving notice to their 
 neighbours of Christ's being come into those parts; <I>They sent out 
 into all that country.</I> Note, those that have got the knowledge of 
 Christ themselves, should do all they can to bring others acquainted 
 with him too. We must not eat these spiritual morsels alone; there is 
 in Christ enough for us all, so that there is nothing got by
 monopolizing. When we have opportunities of getting good to our souls, 
 we should bring as many as we can to share with us. More than we think 
 of would close with opportunities, if they were but called upon and 
 invited to them. <I>They sent into their own country,</I> because it 
 was their own, and they desired the welfare of it. Note, We can no 
 better testify our love to our country than by promoting and 
 propagating the knowledge of Christ in it. Neighbourhood is an 
 advantage of doing good which must be improved. Those that are near to 
 us, we should contrive to do something for, at least by our example, to 
 bring them near to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What their business was with Christ; not only, perhaps not chiefly, 
 if at all, to be taught, but to have their sick healed; <I>They brought 
 unto him all that were diseased.</I> If love to Christ and his doctrine 
 will not bring them to him, yet self-love would. Did we but rightly 
 seek our own things, the things of our own peace and welfare, we should 
 seek the things of Christ. We should do him honour, and please him, by 
 deriving grace and righteousness from him. Note, Christ is the proper 
 Person to bring the diseased to; whither should they go but to the 
 Physician, to <I>the Sun of Righteousness, that hath healing under his 
 wings?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. How they made their application to him; <I>They besought him that 
 they might only touch the hem of his garment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 They applied themselves to him,

 (1.) With great importunity; they besought him. Well may we beseech to 
 be healed, when God by his ministers beseecheth us that we will be 
 healed. Note, The greatest favours and blessings are to be obtained 
 from Christ by entreaty; <I>Ask, and it shall be given.</I> 

 (2.) With great humility; they came to him as those that were sensible 
 of their distance, humbly beseeching him to help them; and their 
 desiring to touch the hem of his garment, intimates that they thought 
 themselves unworthy that he should take any particular notice of them, 
 that he should so much as speak to their case, much less touch them for 
 their cure; but they will look upon it as a great favour, if he will 
 give them leave to <I>touch the hem of his garment.</I> The eastern 
 nations show respect to their princes, by kissing their sleeve, or 
 skirt. 

 (3.) With great assurance of the all-sufficiency of his power, not 
 doubting but that they should be healed, even by touching the hem of 
 his garment; that they should receive abundant communications from him 
 by the smallest token of symbol of communion with him. They did not 
 expect the formality of striking his hand over the place or persons 
 diseased, as Naaman did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:11">2 Kings v. 11</A>);

 but they were sure that there was in him such an overflowing fulness of 
 healing virtue, that <I>they</I> could not fail of a cure, who were but 
 admitted near him. It was in this country and neighbourhood that the
 woman with the bloody issue was cured by <I>touching the hem of his 
 garment,</I> and was commended for her faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:20-22"><I>ch.</I> ix. 20-22</A>);

 and thence, probably, they took occasion to ask this. Note, The
 experiences of others in their attendance upon Christ may be of use 
 both to direct and to encourage us in our attendance on him. It is good 
 using those means and methods which others before us have sped well in 
 the use of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The fruit and success of this their application to Christ. It was 
 not in vain that these seed of Jacob sought him, for as <I>many as 
 touched, were made perfectly whole.</I> Note, 

 1. Christ's cures are perfect cures. Those that he heals, he heals
 perfectly. He doth not do his work by halves. Though spiritual healing 
 be not perfected at first, yet, doubtless, <I>he that has begun the 
 good work will perform it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:6">Phil. i. 6</A>.

 2. There is an abundance of healing virtue in Christ for all that apply
 themselves to him, be they ever so many. That <I>precious ointment</I> 
 which was poured on his head, <I>ran down to the skirts of his 
 garment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+133:2">Ps. cxxxiii. 2</A>.

 The least of Christ's institutions, like the hem of his garment, is
 replenished with the overflowing fulness of his grace, and he is able 
 to <I>save to the uttermost.</I> 

 3. The healing virtue that is in Christ, is put forth for the benefit
 of those that by a true and lively faith touch him. Christ is in 
 heaven, but his word is nigh us, and he himself in that word. When we 
 mix faith with the word, apply it to ourselves, depend upon it, and 
 submit to its influences and commands, then we touch the hem of 
 Christ's garment. It is but thus touching, and we are made whole. On 
 such easy terms are spiritual cures offered by him, that he may truly 
 be said to heal <I>freely;</I> so that if our souls die of their 
 wounds, it is not owing to our Physician, it is not for want of skill 
 or will in him; but it is purely owing to ourselves. He <I>could</I>
 have healed us, he <I>would</I> have healed us, but we <I>would not be 
 healed;</I> so that our blood will lie upon our own heads.</P>
