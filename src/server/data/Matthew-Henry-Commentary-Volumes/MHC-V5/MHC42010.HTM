 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The ample commission which Christ gave to the seventy disciples to
 preach the gospel, and to confirm it by miracles; and the full 
 instructions he gave them how to manage themselves in the execution of 
 their commissions, and great encouragements therein, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:1-16">ver. 1-16</A>.

 II. The report which the seventy disciples made to their Master of the
 success of their negotiation, and his discourse thereupon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:17-24">ver. 17-24</A>.
 
 III. Christ's discourse with a lawyer concerning the way to heaven,
 and the instructions Christ gave him by a parable to look upon every
 one as his neighbour whom he had occasion to show kindness to, or
 receive kindness from,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and
 sent them two and two before his face into every city and place,
 whither he himself would come.
 &nbsp; 2 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly <I>is</I> great,
 but the labourers <I>are</I> few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the
 harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.
 &nbsp; 3 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
 &nbsp; 4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man
 by the way.
 &nbsp; 5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace <I>be</I> to
 this house.
 &nbsp; 6 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon
 it: if not, it shall turn to you again.
 &nbsp; 7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things
 as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from
 house to house.
 &nbsp; 8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat
 such things as are set before you:
 &nbsp; 9 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The
 kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
 &nbsp; 10 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not,
 go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,
 &nbsp; 11 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do
 wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that
 the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
 &nbsp; 12 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that
 day for Sodom, than for that city.
 &nbsp; 13 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if
 the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been
 done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in
 sackcloth and ashes.
 &nbsp; 14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the
 judgment, than for you.
 &nbsp; 15 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be
 thrust down to hell.
 &nbsp; 16 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you
 despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent
 me.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the sending forth of seventy disciples, two and two, into 
 divers parts of the country, to preach the gospel, and to work miracles 
 in those places which Christ himself designed to visit, to make way for 
 his entertainment. This is not taken notice of by the other 
 evangelists: but the instructions here given them are much the same 
 with those given to the twelve. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their number: they were seventy. As in the choice of twelve apostles 
 Christ had an eye to the twelve patriarchs, the twelve tribes, and the 
 twelve princes of those tribes, so here he seems to have an eye to the 
 <I>seventy</I> elders of Israel. So many went up with Moses and Aaron 
 to the mount, and <I>saw the glory of the God of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:1,9">Exod. xxiv. 1, 9</A>),

 and so many were afterwards chosen to assist Moses in the government,
 in order to which the Spirit of prophecy came unto them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:24,25">Num. xi. 24, 25</A>.

 The <I>twelve wells of water</I> and the <I>seventy palm-trees</I> that
 were at Elim were a figure of the <I>twelve apostles</I> and the
 <I>seventy disciples,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:27">Exod. xv. 27</A>.

 They were seventy elders of the Jews that were employed by Ptolemy king 
 of Egypt in turning the Old Testament into Greek, whose translation is 
 thence called the <I>Septuagint.</I> The great sanhedrim consisted of 
 this number. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We are glad to find that Christ had so many followers fit to be sent 
 forth; his labour was not altogether in vain, though he met with much 
 opposition. Note, Christ's interest is a <I>growing</I> interest, and 
 his followers, like Israel in Egypt, though <I>afflicted</I> shall 
 <I>multiply.</I> These <I>seventy,</I> though they did not attend him 
 so closely and constantly as the <I>twelve</I> did, were nevertheless 
 the constant hearers of his doctrine, and witnesses of his miracles, 
 and believed in him. Those three mentioned in the close of the 
 foregoing chapter might have been of these seventy, if they would have 
 applied themselves in good earnest to their business. These seventy are 
 those of whom Peter speaks as "<I>the men who companied with us all the 
 time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</I>" and were part 
 of the one hundred and twenty there spoken of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:15,21">Acts i. 15, 21</A>.

 Many of those that were the companions of the apostles, whom we read of
 in the Acts and the Epistles, we may suppose, were of these seventy 
 disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We are glad to find there was work for so many ministers, hearers 
 for so many preachers: thus the grain of mustard-seed began to 
 <I>grow,</I> and the savour of the leaven to diffuse itself in the 
 meal, in order to the leavening of the whole.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their work and business: He sent them <I>two and two,</I> that they 
 might strengthen and encourage one another. <I>If one fall, the other 
 will help to raise him up.</I> He sent them, not to all the cities of 
 Israel, as he did the <I>twelve,</I> but only <I>to every city and 
 place whither he himself would come</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 as his harbingers; and we must suppose, though it is not recorded, that 
 Christ soon after went to all those places whither he now sent them, 
 though he could stay but a little while in a place. Two things they 
 were ordered to do, the same that Christ did wherever he came:--

 1. They must <I>heal the sick</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 heal them <I>in the name of Jesus,</I> which would make people long to 
 see this Jesus, and ready to entertain him whose name was so powerful. 
 
 2. They must publish the approach of the kingdom of God, its approach
 <I>to them:</I> "Tell them this, <I>The kingdom of God is come nigh to 
 you,</I> and you now stand fair for an admission into it, if you will 
 but look about you. Now is the <I>day of your visitation,</I> know and
 understand it." It is good to be made sensible of our advantages and 
 opportunities, that we may lay hold of them. When the <I>kingdom of God 
 comes nigh us,</I> it concerns us to go forth to meet it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The instructions he gives them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They must set out with prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 and, in prayer, 

 (1.) They must be duly affected with the necessities of the souls of 
 men, which called for their help. They must <I>look about,</I> and see 
 how <I>great the harvest was,</I> what abundance of people there were 
 that wanted to have the gospel preached to them and were willing to 
 receive it, nay, that had at this time their expectations raised of the 
 coming of the Messiah and of his kingdom. There was corn ready to shed
 and be lost for want of hands to gather it in. Note, Ministers should 
 apply themselves to their work under a deep concern for <I>precious 
 souls,</I> looking upon them as the riches of this world, which ought 
 to be secured for Christ. They must likewise be concerned that the 
 <I>labourers were so few.</I> The Jewish teachers were indeed many, but 
 they were not labourers; they did not gather in souls to God's kingdom, 
 but to their own interest and party. Note, Those that are good 
 ministers themselves wish that there were more good ministers, for 
 there is work for more. It is common for tradesmen not to care how few 
 there are of their own trade; but Christ would have the labourers in 
 his vineyard reckon it a matter of complaint when the <I>labourers are 
 few.</I> 

 (2.) They must earnestly desire to receive their mission from God, that 
 <I>he</I> would send them forth as <I>labourers into his harvest</I> 
 who is the <I>Lord of the harvest,</I> and that he would send others 
 forth; for, if God send them forth, they may hope he will go along with 
 them and give them success. Let them therefore say, as the prophet
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:8">Isa. vi. 8</A>),

 <I>Here I am, send me.</I> It is desirable to receive our commission 
 from God, and then we may go on boldly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They must set out with an expectation of trouble and persecution: 
 "<I>Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves;</I> but <I>go your 
 ways,</I> and resolve to make the best of it. Your enemies will be as 
 <I>wolves,</I> bloody and cruel, and ready to pull you to pieces; in 
 their threatenings and revilings, they will be as <I>howling</I> wolves 
 to <I>terrify</I> you; in their persecutions of you, they will be as 
 <I>ravening</I> wolves to <I>tear</I> you. But you must be as 
 <I>lambs,</I> peaceable and patient, though made an easy prey of." It 
 would have been very hard thus to be sent forth as <I>sheep among 
 wolves,</I> if he had not endued them with his spirit and courage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They must not encumber themselves with a load of provisions, as if 
 they were going a long voyage, but depend upon God and their friends to 
 provide what was convenient for them: "Carry neither a <I>purse</I> for 
 money, nor a <I>scrip</I> or knapsack for clothes or victuals, nor new 
 <I>shoes</I> (as before to the twelve, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:3"><I>ch.</I> ix. 3</A>);

 and <I>salute no man by the way.</I>" This command Elisha gave to his
 servant, when he sent him to see the Shunamite's dead child, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:29">2 Kings iv. 29</A>.

 Not that Christ would have his ministers to be rude, morose, and 
 unmannerly; but,

 (1.) They must go as men <I>in haste,</I> that had their particular
 places assigned them, where they must deliver their message, and in 
 their way directly to those places must not hinder or retard themselves 
 with needless ceremonies or compliments. 

 (2.) They must go as <I>men of business,</I> business that relates to 
 another world, which they must be intent in, and intent upon, and 
 therefore must not entangle themselves with conversation about secular 
 affairs. <I>Minister verbi est; hoc age--You are a minister of the
 word; attend to your office.</I> 

 (3.) They must go as <I>serious</I> men, and <I>men in sorrow.</I> It 
 was the custom of mourners, during the first seven days of their 
 mourning, not to <I>salute any,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:13">Job ii. 13</A>.

 Christ was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and it was fit
 that by this and other signs his messengers should resemble him, and 
 likewise show themselves affected with the calamities of mankind which 
 they came to relieve, and touched with a feeling of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They must show, not only <I>their goodwill,</I> but <I>God's 
 good-will,</I> to all to whom they came, and leave the issue and 
 success to him that knows the heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The charge given them was, Whatsoever <I>house</I> they <I>entered 
 into,</I> they must say, <I>Peace be to this house.</I> Here, 

 [1.] They are supposed to enter into <I>private houses;</I> for, being 
 not admitted into the synagogues, they were forced to preach where they 
 could have liberty. And, as their public preaching was driven into 
 houses, so thither they carried it. Like their Master, wherever they 
 <I>visited,</I> they <I>preached from house to house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:42,20:20">Acts v. 42; xx. 20</A>.

 Christ's church was at first very much <I>a church in the house.</I>

 [2.] They are instructed to say, "<I>Peace be to this house,</I> to all 
 under this roof, to this family, and to all that belong to it." 
 <I>Peace be to you</I> was the common form of salutation among the 
 Jews. They must not use it in <I>formality,</I> according to custom, to 
 those they met on the way, because they must use it with 
 <I>solemnity</I> to those whose houses they entered into: "<I>Salute no 
 man by the way</I> in compliment, but to those into whose house ye 
 enter, say, <I>Peace be to you,</I> with seriousness and in reality; 
 for this is intended to be more than a compliment." Christ's ministers 
 go into all the world, to say, in Christ's name, <I>Peace be to 
 you.</I> <I>First,</I> We are to <I>propose</I> peace to all, to 
 <I>preach peace by Jesus Christ,</I> to proclaim the gospel of peace, 
 the covenant of peace, <I>peace on earth,</I> and to invite the 
 children of men to come and take the benefit of it. <I>Secondly,</I> We 
 are to <I>pray</I> for peace to all. We must earnestly desire the 
 salvation of the souls of those we preach to, and offer up those 
 desires to God in prayer; and it may be well to let them know that we 
 do thus pray for them, and bless them in the name of the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The success was to be different, according to the different 
 dispositions of those whom they preached to and prayed for. According 
 as the inhabitants were sons of peace or not, so their peace should or 
 should not <I>rest upon the house. Recipitur ad modum recipientis--The 
 quality of the receiver determines the nature of the reception.</I> 
 
 [1.] "You will meet with some that are the <I>sons of peace,</I> that 
 by the operations of divine grace, pursuant to the designations of the 
 divine counsel, are ready to admit the word of the gospel in the light 
 and love of it, and have their hearts made as soft wax to receive the 
 impressions of it. Those are qualified to receive the comforts of the 
 gospel in whom there is a good work of grace wrought. And, as to those, 
 <I>your peace</I> shall find them out and <I>rest upon them;</I> your 
 prayers for them shall be heard, the promises of the gospel shall be 
 <I>confirmed</I> to them, the privileges of it <I>conferred</I> on 
 them, and the fruit of both shall remain and continue with them--a good 
 part that shall not be <I>taken away.</I>" 

 [2.] "You will meet with others that are no ways disposed to hear or 
 heed your message, whole houses that have not one <I>son of peace</I> 
 in them." Now it is certain that our peace shall <I>not come</I> upon 
 <I>them,</I> they have no part nor lot in the matter; the blessing that 
 rests upon the <I>sons of peace</I> shall never come upon the sons of 
 Belial, nor can any expect the blessings of the covenant that will not 
 come under the bonds of it. But it shall <I>return to us again;</I> 
 that is, we shall have the comfort of having done our duty to God and 
 discharged our trust. Our prayers like David's shall return <I>into our 
 own bosom</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:13">Ps. xxxv. 13</A>)

 and we shall have commission to go on in the work. Our peace shall 
 return to us again, not only to be enjoyed by ourselves, but to be 
 communicated to others, to the next we meet with, them that are <I>sons 
 of peace.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They must <I>receive</I> the kindnesses of those that should 
 <I>entertain</I> them and <I>bid them welcome,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 "Those that receive the gospel will receive you that preach it, and 
 give you entertainment; you must not think to raise estates, but you 
 may depend upon a subsistence; and,"

 (1.) "Be not <I>shy;</I> do not suspect our welcome, nor be afraid of 
 being troublesome, but <I>eat and drink</I> heartily <I>such things as 
 they give;</I> for, whatever kindness they show you, it is but a small 
 return for the kindness you do them in bringing the glad tidings of 
 <I>peace.</I> You will deserve it, for <I>the labourer is worthy of his 
 hire,</I> the labourer in the work of the ministry is so, if he be 
 indeed a <I>labourer;</I> and it is not an act of charity, but of 
 justice, in those who are <I>taught in the word to communicate to those 
 that teach them</I>" 

 (2.) "Be not <I>nice</I> and <I>curious</I> in your diet: <I>Eat and 
 drink such things as they give</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>such things as are set before you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Be thankful for plain food, and do not find fault, though it be not 
 dressed according to art." It ill becomes Christ's disciples to be 
 <I>desirous of dainties.</I> As he has not tied them up to the 
 Pharisees' superstitious fasts, so he has not allowed the luxurious 
 feasts of the Epicureans. Probably, Christ here refers to the 
 traditions of the elders about their meat which were so many that those 
 who observed them were extremely critical, you could hardly set a dish 
 of meat before them, but there was some scruple or other concerning it; 
 but Christ would not have them to regard those things, but eat what was 
 given them, <I>asking no question for conscience' sake.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. They must <I>denounce</I> the judgments of God against those who 
 should <I>reject</I> them and their <I>message:</I> "If you <I>enter 
 into a city,</I> and they <I>do not receive you,</I> if there be none 
 there disposed to hearken to your doctrine, leave them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 If they will not <I>give you welcome</I> into their houses, do you 
 <I>give them warning</I> in their streets." He orders them to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:5"><I>ch.</I> ix. 5</A>)

 do as he had ordered the apostles to do: "Say to them, not with rage,
 or scorn, or resentment, but with compassion to their poor perishing 
 souls, and a holy dread of the ruin which they are bringing upon 
 themselves, <I>Even the dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do 
 wipe off against you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 From them do not receive any kindnesses at all, be not beholden to 
 them. It cost that prophet of the Lord dear who accepted a meal's meat 
 with a prophet in Bethel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:21,22">1 Kings xiii. 21, 22</A>.

 Tell them that you will not carry with you the dust of their city; let
 them take it to themselves, for <I>dust they are.</I>" It shall be a 
 witness for Christ's messengers that they had been there according to 
 their Master's order; <I>tender</I> and <I>refusal</I> were a discharge 
 of their trust. But it shall be a witness against the recusants that 
 they would not give Christ's messengers any entertainment, no, not so 
 much as water to wash their feet with, but they were forced to wipe off 
 the dust. "But tell them plainly, and bid them <I>be sure</I> of it, 
 <I>The kingdom of God is come nigh to you.</I> Here is a fair offer 
 made you; if you have not the benefit of it, it is your own fault. The 
 gospel is brought to your doors; if you shut your doors against it, 
 your blood is upon your own head. Now that the <I>kingdom of God is 
 come nigh to you,</I> if you will not come up to it, and come into it, 
 your sin will be inexcusable, and your condemnation intolerable." Note, 
 The fairer offers we have of grace and life by Christ, the more we 
 shall have to answer for another day, if we slight these offers: <I>It 
 shall be more tolerable for Sodom than for that city,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The Sodomites indeed rejected the warning given them by Lot; but 
 rejecting the gospel is a more heinous crime, and will be punished 
 accordingly <I>in that day.</I> He means the day of judgment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 but calls it, by way of emphasis, <I>that day,</I> because it is the 
 last and great day, the day when we must account for all the <I>days of 
 time,</I> and have our state determined for the <I>days of 
 eternity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Upon this occasion, the evangelist repeats,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The particular doom of those cities wherein most of Christ's 
 mighty works were done, which we had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:20">Matt. xi. 20</A>,

 &c. Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, all bordering upon the sea of
 Galilee, where Christ was most conversant, are the places here 
 mentioned. 

 [1.] They enjoyed greater privileges. Christ's <I>mighty works were 
 done in them,</I> and they were all gracious works, works of mercy. 
 They were hereby <I>exalted to heaven,</I> not only dignified and 
 honoured, but put into a fair way of being happy; they were brought as 
 near heaven as external means could bring them.

 [2.] God's design in favouring them thus was to bring them to 
 <I>repentance</I> and <I>reformation</I> of life, <I>to sit in 
 sackcloth and ashes,</I> both in humiliation for the sins they had 
 committed, and in humility and a meek subjection to God's government.

 [3.] Their frustrating this design, and their receiving the grace of 
 God therein in vain. It is implied that they <I>repented not;</I> they 
 were not wrought upon by all the miracles of Christ to think the better 
 of him, or the worse of sin; they did not bring forth fruits agreeable 
 to the advantages they enjoyed.

 [4.] There was reason to think, morally speaking, that, if Christ had 
 gone to Tyre and Sidon, Gentile cities, and had preached the same 
 doctrine to them and wrought the same miracles among them that he did 
 in these cities of Israel, they would have repented <I>long ago,</I> so 
 speedy would their repentance have been, and that in <I>sackcloth and 
 ashes,</I> so deep would it have been. Now to understand the wisdom of 
 God, in <I>giving</I> the means of grace to those who would not improve 
 them, and <I>denying</I> them to those that would, we must wait for the 
 great day of discovery.

 [5.] The doom of those who thus receive the grace of God in vain will 
 be very fearful. They that were <I>thus exalted,</I> not making use of
 their elevation, will be <I>thrust down to hell,</I> thrust down with 
 disgrace and dishonour. They will thrust in to get into heaven, in the 
 crowd of professors, but in vain; they shall be <I>thrust down,</I> to 
 their everlasting grief and disappointment, into the lowest hell, and 
 hell will be hell indeed to them.

 [6.] In the day of judgment Tyre and Sidon will fare better, and it 
 will be more tolerable for them than for these cities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The general rule which Christ would go by, as to those to whom he 
 sent his ministers: He will reckon himself treated according as they 
 treated his ministers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 What is done to the ambassador is done, as it were, to the prince that 
 sends him.

 [1.] "<I>He that hearest you,</I> and regardeth what you say, 
 <I>heareth me,</I> and herein doeth me honour. But,"

 [2.] "He that <I>despiseth you</I> doth in effect <I>despise me,</I> 
 and shall be reckoned with as having put an affront upon me; nay, he 
 <I>despiseth him that sent me.</I>" Note, Those who contemn the 
 Christian religion do in effect put a slight upon natural religion, 
 which it is perfective of. And they who <I>despise</I> the faithful 
 ministers of Christ, who, though they do not hate and persecute them, 
 yet think meanly of them, look scornfully upon them, and turn their 
 backs upon their ministry, will be reckoned with as despisers of God 
 and Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even
 the devils are subject unto us through thy name.
 &nbsp; 18 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
 heaven.
 &nbsp; 19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and
 scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall
 by any means hurt you.
 &nbsp; 20 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
 subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are
 written in heaven.
 &nbsp; 21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank
 thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid
 these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them
 unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.
 &nbsp; 22 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man
 knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is,
 but the Son, and <I>he</I> to whom the Son will reveal <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 23 And he turned him unto <I>his</I> disciples, and said privately,
 Blessed <I>are</I> the eyes which see the things that ye see:
 &nbsp; 24 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to
 see those things which ye see, and have not seen <I>them;</I> and to
 hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard <I>them.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ sent forth the seventy disciples as he was going up to Jerusalem 
 to the <I>feast of tabernacles,</I> when he <I>went up, not openly,</I> 
 but <I>as it were in secret</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:10">John vii. 10</A>),

 having sent abroad so great a part of his ordinary retinue; and Dr. 
 Lightfoot thinks it was before his return from that feast, and while he 
 was yet at Jerusalem, or Bethany, which was hard by (for there he was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 that they, or at least some of them, returned to him. Now here we are 
 told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What account they gave him of the success of their expedition: 
 <I>They returned again with joy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 not complaining of the fatigue of their journeys, nor of the opposition 
 and discouragement they met with, but rejoicing in their success, 
 especially in casting out unclean spirits: <I>Lord, even the devils are 
 subject unto us through thy name.</I> Though only the <I>healing of the 
 sick</I> was mentioned in their commission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 yet no doubt the <I>casting out</I> of devils was included, and in this 
 they had wonderful success.

 1. They give Christ the glory of this: It is <I>through thy name.</I>
 Note, all our victories over Satan are obtained by power derived from 
 Jesus Christ. We must <I>in his name</I> enter the lists with our 
 spiritual enemies, and, whatever advantages we gain, he must have all 
 the praise; if the work be done <I>in</I> his name, the honour is due 
 <I>to</I> his name. 

 2. They entertain themselves with the comfort of it; they speak of it
 with an air of exultation: <I>Even the devils,</I> those potent 
 enemies, are <I>subject to us.</I> Note, the saints have no greater joy 
 or satisfaction in any of their triumphs than in those over Satan. If 
 devils are <I>subject to us,</I> what can stand before us?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What acceptance they found with him, and how he received this 
 account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He confirmed what they said, as agreeing with his own observation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "My heart and eye went along with you; I took notice of the success you 
 had, and I <I>saw Satan fall as lightning from heaven.</I>" Note, Satan 
 and his kingdom fell before the preaching of the gospel. "I see how it 
 is," saith Christ, "as you get ground the devil loseth ground." He 
 falls <I>as lightning falls from heaven,</I> so suddenly, so 
 irrecoverably, so visibly, that all may perceive it, and say, "See how 
 Satan's kingdom totters, see how it tumbles." They triumphed in casting 
 devils out of the bodies of people; but Christ sees and rejoices in the 
 fall of the devil from the interest he has in the souls of men, which 
 is called his power <I>in high places,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:12">Eph. vi. 12</A>.

 He foresees this to be but an earnest of what should now be shortly
 done and was already begun--the destroying of Satan's kingdom in the 
 world by the extirpating of idolatry and the turning of the nations to 
 the faith of Christ. Satan <I>falls from heaven</I> when he falls from 
 the throne in men's hearts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:18">Acts xxvi. 18</A>.

 And Christ foresaw that the preaching of the gospel, which would <I>fly
 like lightning</I> through the world, would wherever it went pull down 
 Satan's kingdom. <I>Now is the prince of this world cast out.</I> Some 
 have given another sense of this, as looking back to the fall of the 
 angels, and designed for a caution to these disciples, lest their 
 success should puff them up with pride: "I saw angels turned into 
 devils by <I>pride:</I> that was the sin for which Satan was <I>cast 
 down from heaven,</I> where he had been an angel of light I saw it, and 
 give you an intimation of it lest you, being <I>lifted up with pride 
 should fall into that condemnation of the devil,</I> who fell by 
 pride,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:6">1 Tim. iii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He repeated, ratified, and enlarged their commission: <I>Behold I 
 give you power to tread on serpents,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Note, To him that hath, and useth well what he hath, more shall be 
 given. They had employed their power vigorously against Satan, and now 
 Christ entrusts them with greater power.

 (1.) An <I>offensive</I> power, power to <I>tread on serpents and 
 scorpions,</I> devils and malignant spirits, the old serpent: "You 
 shall <I>bruise their heads</I> in my name," according to the first 
 promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>.

 Come, <I>set your feet</I> on <I>the necks</I> of these enemies; you
 shall tread upon these <I>lions</I> and <I>adders</I> wherever you meet 
 with them; you shall <I>trample them under foot,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:13">Ps. xci. 13</A>.

 You shall <I>tread upon all the power of the enemy,</I> and the kingdom
 of the Messiah shall be every where set up upon the ruins of the 
 devil's kingdom. As the devils have now been <I>subject to you,</I> so 
 they shall still be.

 (2.) A <I>defensive</I> power: "<I>Nothing shall by any means hurt 
 you;</I> not <I>serpents</I> nor <I>scorpions,</I> if you should be 
 chastised with them or thrown into prisons and dungeons among them; you 
 shall be unhurt by the most venomous creatures," as St. Paul was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:5">Acts xxviii. 5</A>),
 
 and as is promised in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:18">Mark xvi. 18</A>.

 "If wicked men be as <I>serpents</I> to you, and you <I>dwell</I> among 
 those <I>scorpions</I> (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:6">Ezek. ii. 6</A>),

 you may despise their rage, and <I>tread</I> upon it; <I>it</I> need 
 not disturb you, for they have no power against you but what is 
 <I>given them from above;</I> they may <I>hiss,</I> but they cannot 
 <I>hurt.</I>" You may play upon the hole of the asp, for <I>death 
 itself shall not hurt nor destroy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:8,19,25:8">Isa. xi. 8, 19; xxv. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He directed them to turn their joy into the right channel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 
 "<I>Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject 
 unto you,</I> that they have been so, and shall be still so. Do not 
 rejoice in this merely as it is your honour, and a confirmation of your 
 mission, and as it sets you a degree above other good people; do not 
 rejoice in this <I>only,</I> or in this <I>chiefly,</I> but <I>rather 
 rejoice because your names are written in heaven,</I> because you are 
 chosen of God to eternal life, and are the children of God through 
 faith." Christ, who knew the counsels of God, could tell them that 
 their <I>names were written in heaven,</I> for it is the <I>Lamb's book 
 of life</I> that they are written in. All believers are through grace, 
 entitled to the inheritance of sons, and have received the adoption of 
 sons, and the Spirit of adoption, which is the earnest of that 
 inheritance and so are enrolled among his family; now this is matter of 
 joy, greater joy than casting out devils. Note, Power to become the
 children of God is to be valued more than a power to work miracles; for 
 we read of those who did <I>in Christ's name cast out devils,</I> as 
 Judas did, and yet will be disowned by Christ in the great day. But 
 they whose <I>names are written in heaven</I> shall never perish; they 
 are <I>Christ's sheep,</I> to whom he will <I>give eternal life.</I> 
 Saving graces are more to be rejoiced in than spiritual gifts; holy 
 love is <I>a more excellent way</I> than speaking with tongues.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He offered up a solemn thanksgiving to his Father, for employing 
 such mean people as his disciples were in such high and honourable 
 service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.
 
 This we had before
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:25-27">Matt. xi. 25-27</A>),

 only here it is prefixed that <I>in that hour Jesus rejoiced.</I> It 
 was fit that particular notice should be taken of <I>that</I> hour, 
 because there were so few such, for he was a <I>man of sorrows.</I> In 
 <I>that hour</I> in which he saw Satan fall, and heard of the good 
 success of his ministers, <I>in that hour he rejoiced.</I> Note, 
 Nothing rejoices the heart of the Lord Jesus so much as the progress of 
 the gospel, and its getting ground of Satan, by the conversion of souls 
 to Christ. Christ's joy was a solid substantial joy, an inward joy:
 <I>he rejoiced in spirit;</I> but his joy, like deep waters, made no 
 noise; it was a joy that a stranger did not intermeddle with. Before he 
 applied himself to <I>thank his Father,</I> he stirred up himself to 
 <I>rejoice;</I> for, as <I>thankful praise</I> is the genuine language 
 of <I>holy joy,</I> so <I>holy joy</I> is the root and spring of 
 <I>thankful praise.</I> Two things he gives thanks for:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) For what was <I>revealed</I> by the <I>Father</I> through the 
 <I>Son: I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 In all our adorations of God, we must have an eye to him, both as the 
 Maker of heaven and earth and as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
 and in him our Father. Now that which he gives thanks for is,

 [1.] That the counsels of God concerning man's reconciliation to 
 himself were <I>revealed</I> to some of the children of men, who might 
 be fit also to <I>teach others,</I> and it is God that <I>by his 
 Son</I> has spoken these things <I>to us</I> and by his Spirit has 
 revealed them <I>in us; he</I> has <I>revealed</I> that which had been 
 <I>kept secret</I> from the beginning of the world.

 [2.] That they were revealed to <I>babes,</I> to those who were of mean 
 parts and capacities, whose extraction and education had nothing in 
 them promising, who were but <I>children in understanding,</I> till God 
 by his Spirit elevated their faculties, and furnished them with this 
 knowledge, and an ability to communicate it. We have reason to thank 
 God, not so much for the honour he has hereby put upon babes, as for 
 the honour he has hereby done himself in perfecting strength <I>out of 
 weakness.</I>

 [3.] That, at the same time when he revealed them unto babes, he <I>hid 
 them from the wise and prudent,</I> the Gentile philosophers, the 
 Jewish rabbin. He <I>did not reveal</I> the things of the gospel to 
 them, nor employ them in preaching up his kingdom. Thanks be to God 
 that the apostles were not fetched from their schools; for, 
 <I>First,</I> they would have been apt to mingle their notions with the 
 doctrine of Christ, which would have corrupted it, as afterwards it 
 proved. For Christianity was much corrupted by the Platonic philosophy 
 in the first ages of it, by the Peripatetic in its latter ages, and by 
 the Judaizing teachers at the first planting of it. <I>Secondly,</I> If 
 rabbin and philosophers had been made apostles, the success of the 
 gospel would have been ascribed to their learning and wit and the force 
 of their reasonings and eloquence; and therefore they must not be 
 employed, lest they should have taken too much to themselves, and 
 others should have attributed too much to them. They were passed by for 
 the same reason that Gideon's army was reduced: <I>The people are yet 
 too many,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:4">Judges vii. 4</A>.

 Paul indeed was bred a scholar among the wise and prudent; but he
 became a <I>babe</I> when he became an apostle, and laid aside the 
 <I>enticing words of man's wisdom,</I> forgot them all, and made 
 neither show nor use of any other knowledge than that of <I>Christ and 
 him crucified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:2,4">1 Cor. ii. 2, 4</A>.

 [4.] That God herein acted by way of sovereignty: <I>Even so, Father,
 for so it seemed good in thy sight.</I> If God gives his grace and the 
 knowledge of his son to some that are less likely, and does not give it 
 to others whom we should think better able to deliver it with 
 advantage, this must satisfy: so it pleases God, whose thoughts are 
 infinitely above ours. He chooses to entrust the dispensing of his 
 gospel in the hands of those who with a <I>divine energy</I> will give 
 it the <I>setting on,</I> rather than in theirs who with <I>human 
 art</I> will give it the <I>setting off.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) For what was <I>secret</I> between the <I>Father</I> and <I>the 
 Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 [1.] The vast <I>confidence</I> that the Father <I>puts</I> in the Son: 
 <I>All things are delivered to me of my Father,</I> all wisdom and 
 knowledge, all power and authority, all the grace and comfort which are 
 intended for the chosen remnant; it is all delivered into the hands of 
 the Lord Jesus; in him all fulness must <I>dwell,</I> and from him it 
 must be <I>derived:</I> he is the great <I>trustee</I> that manages all 
 the concerns of God's kingdom.

 [2.] The good understanding that there is between the Father and the 
 Son, and their <I>mutual consciousness,</I> such as no creature can be 
 admitted to: <I>No man knows who the Son is,</I> nor what his mind is, 
 <I>but the Father,</I> who <I>possessed him in the beginning of his 
 ways, before his works of old</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:22">Prov. viii. 22</A>),

 nor <I>who the Father is,</I> and what his counsels are, <I>but the 
 Son,</I> who lay in his bosom from eternity, was <I>by him as one 
 brought up with him, and was daily his delight</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>),

 <I>and he to whom the Son</I> by the Spirit <I>will reveal him.</I> The 
 gospel is the revelation of Jesus Christ, to him we owe all the 
 discoveries made to us of the will of God for our salvation; and here 
 he speaks of being entrusted with it as that which was a great pleasure 
 to himself and for which he was very thankful to his Father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He told his disciples how well it was for them that they had these 
 things revealed to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 Having addressed himself to his Father, he <I>turned to his 
 disciples,</I> designing to make them sensible how much it was for 
 their happiness, as well as for the glory and honour of God, that they 
 knew the mysteries of the kingdom and were employed to lead others into 
 the knowledge of them, considering,

 (1.) What a step it is <I>towards</I> something better. Though the bare 
 knowledge of these things is not saving, yet it puts us in the way of 
 salvation: <I>Blessed are the eyes which see the things which we 
 see.</I> God therein blesseth them, and, if it be not their own fault 
 it will be an eternal blessedness to them. 

 (2.) What a step it is <I>above</I> those that went before them, even 
 the greatest saints, and those that were most the favourites of Heaven: 
 "<I>Many prophets and righteous men</I>" (so it is in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:17">Matt. xiii. 17</A>),
 
 <I>many prophets and kings</I> (so it is here), "have <I>desired</I> to
 see and hear those things which you are daily and intimately conversant 
 with, and <I>have not seen</I> and <I>heard</I> them." The honour and 
 happiness of the New-Testament saints far exceed those even of the 
 <I>prophets</I> and <I>kings</I> of the Old Testament, though they also 
 were <I>highly favoured.</I> The general ideas which the Old-Testament 
 saints had, according to the intimations given them, of the graces and 
 glories of the Messiah's kingdom, made them wish a thousand times that 
 their lot had been reserved for those blessed days, and that they might 
 see the substance of those things of which they had faint shadows. 
 Note, The consideration of the great advantages which we have in the 
 New-Testament light, above what they had who lived in Old-Testament 
 times, should awaken our diligence in the improvement of it; for, if it 
 do not, it will aggravate our condemnation for the non-improvement of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him,
 saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
 &nbsp; 26 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest
 thou?
 &nbsp; 27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
 all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength,
 and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.
 &nbsp; 28 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and
 thou shalt live.
 &nbsp; 29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who
 is my neighbour?
 &nbsp; 30 And Jesus answering said, A certain <I>man</I> went down from
 Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him
 of his raiment, and wounded <I>him,</I> and departed, leaving <I>him</I>
 half dead.
 &nbsp; 31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and
 when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
 &nbsp; 32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and
 looked <I>on him,</I> and passed by on the other side.
 &nbsp; 33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was:
 and when he saw him, he had compassion <I>on him,</I>
 &nbsp; 34 And went to <I>him,</I> and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil
 and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an
 inn, and took care of him.
 &nbsp; 35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence,
 and gave <I>them</I> to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him;
 and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will
 repay thee.
 &nbsp; 36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto
 him that fell among the thieves?
 &nbsp; 37 And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus
 unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's discourse with a lawyer about some points of 
 conscience, which we are all concerned to be rightly informed in and 
 are so here from Christ though the questions were proposed with no good 
 intention.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are concerned to know what that good is which we should do in 
 <I>this</I> life, in order to our attaining <I>eternal life.</I> A 
 question to this purport was proposed to our Saviour by a <I>certain 
 lawyer,</I> or <I>scribe,</I> only with a design to <I>try</I> him, not 
 with a desire to be instructed by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 The lawyer <I>stood up,</I> and <I>asked him, Master, what shall I do 
 to inherit eternal life?</I> If Christ had any thing peculiar to 
 prescribe, by this question he would get it out of him, and perhaps 
 expose him for it; if not, he would expose his doctrine as needless, 
 since it would give no other direction for obtaining happiness than 
 what they had already received; or, perhaps, he had no malicious design 
 against Christ, as some of the scribes had, only he was willing to have 
 a little talk with him, just as people go to church to hear what the 
 minister will say. This was a good question: <I>What shall I do to
 inherit eternal life?</I> But it lost all its goodness when it was 
 proposed with an ill design, or a very mean one. Note, It is not enough 
 to speak of the things of God, and to enquire about them, but we must 
 do it with a suitable concern. If we speak of <I>eternal life,</I> and 
 <I>the way</I> to it, in a careless manner, merely as matter of 
 discourse, especially as matter of dispute, we do but take the name of 
 God in vain, as the lawyer here did. Now this question being started, 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How Christ turned him over to the divine law, and bade him follow 
 the direction of that. Though he knew the thoughts and intents of his 
 heart, he did not answer him according to the folly of that, but 
 according to the wisdom and goodness of the question he asked. He 
 answered him with a question: <I>What is written in the law? How 
 readest thou?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 He came to catechize Christ, and to know him; but Christ will catechize 
 him, and make him know himself. He talks to him as a lawyer, as one 
 conversant in the law: the studies of his profession would inform him; 
 let him practise according to his knowledge, and he should not come 
 short of <I>eternal life.</I> Note, It will be of great use to us, in 
 our way to heaven, to consider <I>what is written in the law,</I> and 
 <I>what we read</I> there. We must have recourse to our bibles, to the 
 law, as it is now in the hand of Christ and walk in the way that is 
 shown us there. It is a great mercy that we have the law 
 <I>written,</I> that we have it thereby reduced to certainty, and that 
 thereby it is capable of spreading the <I>further,</I> and lasting the 
 <I>longer.</I> Having it <I>written,</I> it is our duty to read it, to 
 read it with understanding, and to treasure up what we read, so that 
 when there is occasion, we may be able to tell <I>what is written in 
 the law,</I> and <I>how we read.</I> To this we must appeal; by this we 
 must try doctrines and end disputes; this must be our oracle, our 
 touchstone, our rule, our guide. What is written in the law? How do we
 read? if there be light in us, it will have regard to this light.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What a good account he gave of the law, of the principal 
 commandments of the law, to the observance of which we must bind 
 ourselves if we would inherit eternal life. He did not, like a 
 Pharisee, refer himself to the tradition of the elders, but, like a 
 good textuary, fastened upon the two first and great commandments of 
 the law, as those which he thought must be most strictly observed in 
 order to the obtaining of <I>eternal life,</I> and which included all 
 the rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 (1.) We must <I>love God with all our hearts,</I> must look upon him as 
 the best of beings, in himself most amiable, and infinitely perfect and 
 excellent; as one whom we lie under the greatest obligations to, both 
 in gratitude and interest. We must prize him, and value ourselves by 
 our elation to him; must please ourselves in him, and devote ourselves 
 entirely to him. Our love to him must be sincere, hearty, and fervent; 
 it must be a superlative love, a love that is as strong as death, but 
 an intelligent love, and such as we can give a good account of the 
 grounds and reasons of. It must be an <I>entire</I> love; he must have 
 our <I>whole</I> souls, and must be served with <I>all that is within 
 us.</I> We must love nothing <I>besides him,</I> but what we love 
 <I>for him</I> and in subordination to him. 

 (2.) We must love our neighbours as <I>ourselves,</I> which we shall 
 easily do, if we, as we ought to do, love God <I>better than 
 ourselves.</I> We must wish well to all and ill to none; must do all 
 the good we can in the world and no hurt, and must fix it as a rule to 
 ourselves to do to others as we would they should do to us; and this is 
 to love our neighbour <I>as ourselves.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ's approbation of what he said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Though he came to tempt him, yet what he said that was good Christ 
 commended: <I>Thou hast answered right.</I> Christ himself fastened 
 upon these as the two great commandments of the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:37">Matt. xxii. 37</A>):

 both sides agreed in this. Those who do well shall have praise of the 
 same, and so should those have that speak well. So far is right; but he 
 hardest part of this work yet remains: "<I>This do, and thou shalt 
 live;</I> thou shalt <I>inherit eternal life.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. His care to avoid the conviction which was now ready to fasten upon 
 him. When Christ said, <I>This do, and thou shalt live,</I> he began to 
 be aware that Christ intended to draw from him an acknowledgment that 
 he <I>had not done this,</I> and therefore an enquiry what he should 
 do, which way he should look, to get his sins pardoned; an 
 acknowledgment also that he <I>could not do this</I> perfectly for the 
 future by any strength of his own, and therefore an enquiry which way 
 he might fetch in strength to enable him to do it: but he was 
 <I>willing to justify himself,</I> and therefore cared not for carrying 
 on that discourse, but saith, in effect, as another did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:20">Matt. xix. 20</A>),
 
 <I>All these things have I kept from my youth up.</I> Note, Many ask 
 good questions with a design rather to <I>justify themselves</I> than 
 to <I>inform themselves,</I> rather proudly to show what is good in 
 them than humbly to see what is bad in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are concerned to know who is our neighbour, whom by the second 
 great commandment we are obliged to love. This is another of this 
 lawyer's queries, which he started only that he might <I>drop</I> the 
 former, lest Christ should have forced him, in the prosecution of it, 
 to <I>condemn himself,</I> when he was resolved to <I>justify</I> 
 himself. As to loving God, he was willing to say no more of it; but, as 
 to his <I>neighbour,</I> he was sure that there he had come up to the 
 rule, for he had always been very kind and respectful to all about him. 
 Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was the corrupt notion of the Jewish teachers in this matter. 
 Dr. Lightfoot quotes their own words to this purport: "Where he saith, 
 <I>Thou shalt love thy neighbour, he excepts all Gentiles,</I> for they 
 are not <I>our neighbours,</I> but those only that are of our own 
 nation and religion." They would not put an Israelite to death for 
 killing a Gentile, for he was not his <I>neighbour:</I> they indeed say 
 that they ought not to kill a Gentile whom they were not at war with; 
 but, if they saw a Gentile in <I>danger of death,</I> they thought 
 themselves under no obligation to help to <I>save his life.</I> Such 
 wicked inferences did they draw from that holy covenant of peculiarity 
 by which God had distinguished them, and by abusing it thus they had 
 forfeited it; God justly took the forfeiture, and transferred 
 covenant-favours to the Gentile world, to whom they brutishly denied 
 common favours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How Christ corrected this inhuman notion, and showed, by a parable, 
 that whomsoever we <I>have need</I> to receive kindness <I>from,</I> 
 and <I>find ready</I> to show us the kindness <I>we need,</I> we cannot 
 but look upon as <I>our neighbour;</I> and therefore ought to look upon 
 all those as such who need our kindness, and to show them kindness 
 accordingly, though they be not of our own nation and religion. Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The parable itself, which represents to us a poor Jew in 
 distressed circumstances, succoured and relieved by a good Samaritan. 
 Let us see here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] How he was <I>abused</I> by his <I>enemies.</I> The honest man was 
 traveling peaceably upon his lawful business in the road, and it was a 
 great road that led from Jerusalem to Jericho, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 The mentioning of those places intimates that it was matter of fact, 
 and not a parable; probably it happened lately, just as it is here 
 related. The occurrences of Providence would yield us many good 
 instructions, if we would carefully observe and improve them, and would 
 be equivalent to parables framed on purpose for instruction, and be 
 more <I>affecting.</I> This poor man <I>fell among thieves.</I> Whether 
 they were Arabians, plunderers, that lived by spoil, or some profligate 
 wretches of his own nation, or some of the Roman soldiers, who, 
 notwithstanding the strict discipline of their army, did this villany, 
 does not appear; but they were very <I>barbarous;</I> they not only 
 took his money, but stripped him of his clothes, and, that he might not 
 be able to pursue them, or only to gratify a cruel disposition (for 
 otherwise <I>what profit was there in his blood?</I>) they <I>wounded 
 him,</I> and left him <I>half dead,</I> ready to die of his wounds. We 
 may here conceive a just indignation at <I>highwaymen,</I> that have 
 divested themselves of all humanity, and are as natural brute beasts, 
 beasts of prey, made to be <I>taken and destroyed;</I> and at the same 
 time we cannot but think with compassion on those that fall into the 
 hands of such wicked and unreasonable men, and be ready, when it is in 
 our power, to help them. What reason have we to thank God for our 
 preservation from perils by robbers!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] How he was <I>slighted</I> by those who should have been his 
 friends, who were not only men of his own nation and religion, but one 
 a priest and the other a Levite, men of a public character and station; 
 nay, they were men of professed sanctity, whose offices obliged them to 
 tenderness and compassion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:2">Heb. v. 2</A>),

 who ought to have taught others their duty in such a case as this, 
 which was to <I>deliver them that were drawn unto death;</I> yet they 
 would not themselves do it. Dr. Lightfoot tells us that many of the
 courses of the priests had their residence in Jericho, and thence came 
 up to Jerusalem, when it was their turn to officiate there, and so back 
 again, which occasioned abundance of <I>passing</I> and 
 <I>repassing</I> of priests that way, and Levites their attendants. 
 They came <I>this way,</I> and saw the poor wounded man. It is probable 
 that they heard his groans, and could not but perceive that if he were 
 not helped he must quickly perish. The Levite not only saw him, but 
 <I>came and looked on him</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 But they <I>passed by on the other side;</I> when they saw his case, 
 they got as far off him as ever they could, as if they would have had a 
 pretence to say, <I>Behold, we knew it not.</I> It is sad when those 
 who should be examples of charity are prodigies of cruelty, and when 
 those who should by displaying the mercies of God, open the bowels of 
 compassion in others, shut up their own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] How he was <I>succoured</I> and <I>relieved</I> by a 
 <I>stranger,</I> a <I>certain Samaritan,</I> of that nation which of 
 all others the Jews most despised and detested and would have no 
 dealings with. This man had some humanity in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 The priest had his heart hardened against one of <I>his own people,</I> 
 but the Samaritan had his opened towards one of <I>another</I> people. 
 <I>When he saw him he had compassion on him,</I> and never took into 
 consideration what country he was of. Though he was a Jew, he was a 
 man, and a man in <I>misery,</I> and the Samaritan has learned to 
 honour all men; he knows not how soon this poor man's case may be his 
 own, and therefore pities him, as he himself would desire and expect to 
 be pitied in the like case. That such great love should be found in a 
 Samaritan was perhaps thought as wonderful as that great faith which 
 Christ admired in a Roman, and in a woman of Canaan; but really it was 
 not so, for pity is the work of a man, but faith is the work of divine 
 <I>grace.</I> The <I>compassion</I> of this Samaritan was not an idle 
 compassion; he did not think it enough to say, "Be healed, be helped"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:16">Jam. ii. 16</A>);

 but, when he <I>drew out his soul,</I> he <I>reached forth his hand</I> 
 also to this poor <I>needy</I> creature, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:7,Pr+31:20">Isa. lviii. 7, 10; Prov. xxxi. 20</A>.
 
 See how friendly this good Samaritan was. <I>First,</I> He <I>went 
 to</I> the poor man, whom the priest and Levite kept at a distance 
 from; he enquired, no doubt, how he came into this deplorable 
 condition, and condoled with him. <I>Secondly,</I> He did the surgeon's 
 part, for want of a better. He <I>bound up his wounds,</I> making use 
 of his own linen, it is likely, for that purpose; and poured <I>in oil 
 and wine,</I> which perhaps he had with him; wine to wash the wound, 
 and oil to mollify it, and close it up. He did all he could to ease the 
 pain, and prevent the peril, of his wounds, as one whose heart bled 
 with him. <I>Thirdly,</I> He <I>set him on his own beast,</I> and went 
 on foot himself, and <I>brought him to an inn.</I> A great mercy it is 
 to have inns upon the road, where we may be furnished for our money 
 with all the conveniences for food and rest. Perhaps the Samaritan, if 
 he had not met with this hindrance, would have got that night to his 
 journey's end; but, in compassion to that poor man, he takes up short 
 at an inn. Some think that the priest and Levite pretended they could 
 not stay to help the poor man, because they were in haste to go and 
 attend the temple-service at Jerusalem. We suppose the Samaritan went 
 upon business; but he understood that both his own business and God's 
 sacrifice too must give place to such an act of mercy as this.
 <I>Fourthly,</I> He <I>took care of him</I> in the inn, got him to bed, 
 had food for him that was proper, and due attendance, and, it may be, 
 prayed with him. Nay, <I>Fifthly,</I> As if he had been his own child, 
 or one he was obliged to look after, when he left him next morning, he 
 left money with the landlord, to be laid out for his use, and passed 
 his word for what he should spend more. <I>Twopence</I> of their money 
 was about fifteen pence of ours, which, according to the rate of things 
 then, would go a great way; however, here it was an earnest of 
 satisfaction to the full of all demands. All this was kind and 
 generous, and as much as one could have expected from a friend or a 
 brother; and yet here it is done by a stranger and foreigner.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this parable is applicable to another purpose than that for which 
 it was intended; and does excellently set forth the kindness and love 
 of God our Saviour towards sinful miserable man. We were like this poor 
 distressed traveller. Satan, our enemy, had <I>robbed</I> us, 
 <I>stripped</I> us, <I>wounded</I> us; such is the mischief that sin 
 had done us. We were by nature more than <I>half dead,</I> twice dead, 
 in trespasses and sins; utterly unable to help ourselves, for we were 
 without strength. The law of Moses, like the priest and Levite, the 
 ministers of the law, <I>looks upon us,</I> but has no compassion on 
 us, gives us no relief, <I>passes by on the other side,</I> as having 
 neither pity nor power to help us; but then comes the blessed Jesus, 
 that good Samaritan (and they said of him, by way of reproach, <I>he is 
 a Samaritan</I>), he has compassion on us, he binds up our bleeding 
 wounds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:3,Isa+61:1">Ps. cxlvii. 3; Isa. lxi. 1</A>),

 pours in, not <I>oil and wine,</I> but that which is infinitely more 
 precious, <I>his own blood.</I> He takes care of us, and bids us put 
 all the expenses of our cure upon his account; and all this though he 
 was none of us, till he was pleased by his voluntary condescension to 
 make himself so, but infinitely above us. This magnifies the riches of 
 his love, and obliges us all to say, "How much are we indebted, and 
 what shall we render?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The application of the parable. 

 [1.] The truth contained in it is extorted from the lawyer's own mouth. 
 "Now tell me," saith Christ, "<I>which of these three was neighbour to 
 him that fell among thieves</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 the priest, the Levite, or the Samaritan? Which of these did the 
 neighbour's part?" To this the lawyer would not answer, as he ought to 
 have done, "Doubtless, the Samaritan was;" but, "<I>He that showed 
 mercy on him;</I> doubtless, he was a good neighbour to him, and very 
 neighbourly, and I cannot but say that it was a good work thus to save 
 an honest Jew from perishing." 

 [2.] The duty inferred from it is pressed home upon the lawyer's own 
 conscience: <I>Go, and do thou likewise.</I> The duty of relations is 
 mutual and reciprocal; the titles of friends, brethren, neighbours, 
 are, as Grotius here speaks <B><I>ton pros ti</I></B>--<I>equally 
 binding on both sides:</I> if one side be bound, the other cannot be 
 loose, as is agreed in all contracts. If a Samaritan does well that 
 helps a distressed Jew, certainly a Jew does not well if he refuses in 
 like manner to help a distressed Samaritan. <I>Petimusque damusque 
 vicissim--These kind offices are to be reciprocated.</I> "And therefore 
 <I>go thou</I> and do as the Samaritan did, whenever occasion offers: 
 show mercy to those that need thy help, and do it freely, and with 
 concern and compassion, though they be not of thy own nation and thy 
 own profession, or of thy own opinion and communion in religion. Let 
 thy charity be thus extensive, before thou boastest of having conformed 
 thyself to that great commandment of <I>loving thy neighbour.</I>" This 
 lawyer valued himself much upon his learning and his knowledge of the 
 laws, and in that he thought to have puzzled Christ himself; but Christ 
 sends him to school to a Samaritan, to learn his duty: "Go, and do like 
 him." Note, It is the duty of every one of us, in our places, and 
 according to our ability, to succour, help, and relieve all that are in 
 distress and necessity, and of lawyers particularly; and herein we must 
 study to excel many that are proud of their being priests and 
 Levites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>38  Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a
 certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him
 into her house.
 &nbsp; 39 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus'
 feet, and heard his word.
 &nbsp; 40 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him,
 and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to
 serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.
 &nbsp; 41 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou
 art careful and troubled about many things:
 &nbsp; 42 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good
 part, which shall not be taken away from her.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe in this story,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The entertainment which Martha gave to Christ and his disciples at 
 her house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ's coming to the village where Martha lived: <I>As they 
 went</I> (Christ and his disciples together), he and they with him 
 <I>entered into a certain village.</I> This village was <I>Bethany,</I> 
 nigh to Jerusalem, whither Christ was now going up, and he took this in 
 his way. Note 

 (1.) Our Lord Jesus went about doing good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:38">Acts x. 38</A>),

 scattering his benign beams and influences as the true light of the 
 world. 
 
 (2.) Wherever Christ went his disciples went along with him.
 
 (3.) Christ honoured the country-villages with his presence and favour, 
 and not the great and populous cities only; for, as he <I>chose 
 privacy,</I> so he <I>countenanced poverty.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His reception at Martha's house: <I>A certain woman, named Martha, 
 received him into her house,</I> and made him welcome, for she was the 
 housekeeper. Note, 

 (1.) Our Lord Jesus, when he was here upon earth, was so poor that he 
 was necessitated to be beholden to his friends for a subsistence. 
 Though he was Zion's King, he had no house of his own either in 
 Jerusalem or near it. 

 (2.) There were some who were Christ's particular friends, whom he 
 loved more than his other friends, and them he visited most frequently. 
 He <I>loved</I> this family 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:5">John xi. 5</A>),

 and often invited himself to them. Christ's visits are the tokens of 
 his love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:23">John xiv. 23</A>.

 (3.) There were those who kindly received Christ into their houses when 
 he was here upon earth. It is called Martha's house, for, probably, she 
 was a widow, and was the housekeeper. Though it was expensive to 
 entertain Christ for he did not come alone, but brought his disciples 
 with him, yet she would not regard the cost of it. (How can we spend 
 what we have better than in Christ's service!) Nay, though at this time 
 it was grown dangerous to entertain him especially so near Jerusalem, 
 yet she cared not what hazard she ran for his name's sake. Though
 there were many that rejected him, and would not entertain him, yet 
 there was one that would bid him welcome. Though Christ is every where 
 spoken against, yet there is a remnant to whom he is dear, and who are 
 dear to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The attendance which Mary, the sister of Martha, gave upon the word 
 of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 1. She <I>heard his word.</I> It seems, our Lord Jesus, as soon as he 
 came into Martha's house, even before entertainment was made for him, 
 addressed himself to his great work of preaching the gospel. He 
 presently took the chair with solemnity; for Mary sat to hear him, 
 which intimates that it was a continued discourse. Note, A good sermon 
 is never the worse for being preached in a house; and the visits of our 
 friends should be so managed as to make them turn to a spiritual 
 advantage. Mary, having this price put into her hands, sat herself to 
 improve it, not knowing when she should have such another. Since Christ 
 is forward to speak, we should be <I>swift to hear.</I> 

 2. She <I>sat</I> to hear, which denotes a close attention. Her mind
 was composed, and she resolved to abide by it: not to catch a word now 
 and then, but to receive all that Christ delivered. She <I>sat at his
 feet,</I> as scholars at the feet of their tutors when they read their 
 lectures; hence Paul is said to be <I>brought up at the feet of 
 Gamaliel.</I> Our sitting at Christ's feet, when we hear his word, 
 signifies a readiness to receive it, and a submission and entire 
 resignation of ourselves to the guidance of it. We must either sit at 
 Christ's feet or be made his footstool; but, if we sit with him at his 
 feet now, we shall sit with him on his throne shortly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The care of Martha about her domestic affairs: But Martha <I>was 
 cumbered about much serving</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 and that was the reason why she was not where Mary was--sitting at 
 Christ's feet, to hear his word. She was providing for the
 entertainment of Christ and those that came with him. Perhaps she had 
 no notice before of his coming, and she was unprovided, but was in care 
 to have every thing handsome upon this occasion; she had not such 
 guests every day. Housekeepers know what care and bustle there must be 
 when a great entertainment is to be made. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Something <I>commendable,</I> which must not be overlooked. 

 (1.) Here was a commendable <I>respect to our Lord Jesus;</I> for we 
 have reason to think it was not for ostentation, but purely to testify 
 her good-will to him, that she made this entertainment. Note, Those who 
 truly love Christ will think that well bestowed that is laid out for 
 his honour. 

 (2.) Here was a commendable <I>care of her household affairs.</I> It
 appears, from the respect shown to this family among the Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:19">John xi. 19</A>),

 that they were persons of some quality and distinction; and yet Martha 
 herself did not think it a disparagement to her to lay her hand even to 
 the <I>service</I> of the family, when there was occasion for it. Note, 
 It is the duty of those who have the charge of families to <I>look well 
 to the ways of their household.</I> The affectation of state and the 
 love of ease make many families neglected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here was something <I>culpable,</I> which we must take notice of 
 too. 

 (1.) She was for <I>much serving.</I> Her heart was upon it, to have a 
 very sumptuous and splendid entertainment; great plenty, great variety, 
 and great exactness, according to the fashion of the place. She was in
 care, <B><I>peri pollen diakonian</I></B>--<I>concerning much 
 attendance.</I> Note, It does not become the disciples of Christ to 
 affect <I>much serving,</I> to affect varieties, dainties, and 
 superfluities in eating and drinking; what need is there of <I>much 
 serving,</I> when much less will serve? 

 (2.) She was <I>cumbered</I> about it; <B><I>periespato</I></B>--she 
 was just <I>distracted</I> with it. Note, Whatever cares the providence 
 of God casts upon us we must not be <I>cumbered</I> with them, nor be 
 disquieted and perplexed by them. <I>Care</I> is good and duty; but 
 <I>cumber</I> is sin and folly.

 (2.) She was <I>then cumbered about much serving</I> when she should 
 have been with her sister, sitting at Christ's feet to hear his word.
 Note, Worldly business is <I>then</I> a snare to us when it hinders us 
 from serving God and getting good to our souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The <I>complaint</I> which Martha made to Christ against her sister 
 Mary, for not <I>assisting</I> her, upon this occasion, in the 
 <I>business of the house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 "<I>Lord, dost thou not care that my sister,</I> who is concerned as 
 well as I in having things done well, <I>has left me to serve 
 alone?</I> Therefore dismiss her from attending thee, and bid her come 
 and help me." Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This complaint of Martha's may be considered as a <I>discovery</I> 
 of her <I>worldliness:</I> it was the language of her inordinate care 
 and cumber. She speaks as one in a mighty passion with her sister, else 
 she would not have troubled Christ with the matter. Note, The 
 inordinacy of worldly cares and pursuits is often the occasion of 
 disturbance in families and of strife and contention among relations. 
 Moreover, those that are eager upon the world themselves are apt to 
 blame and censure those that are not so too; and while they justify 
 themselves in their worldliness, and judge of others by their 
 serviceableness to them in their worldly pursuits, they are ready to 
 condemn those that addict themselves to the exercises of religion, as 
 if they neglected the <I>main chance,</I> as they call it. Martha, 
 being angry at her sister, appealed to Christ, and would have him say 
 that she <I>did well to be angry. Lord, doest not thou care that my 
 sister has let me to serve alone?</I> It should seem as if Christ had 
 sometimes expressed himself tenderly concerned for her, and her ease 
 and comfort, and would not have her go through so much toil and 
 trouble, and she expected that he should now bid her sister take her 
 share in it. When Martha was caring, she must have Mary, and Christ and 
 all, to <I>care</I> too, or else she is not pleased. Note, Those are 
 not always in the right that are most forward to appeal to God; we must 
 therefore take heed, lest at any time we expect that Christ should 
 espouse our unjust and groundless quarrels. The cares which he cast 
 upon us we may cheerfully cast upon him, but not those which we 
 foolishly draw upon ourselves. He will be the patron of the poor and 
 injured, but not of the turbulent and injurious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It may be considered as a discouragement of Mary's piety and 
 devotion. Her sister should have <I>commended</I> her for it, should 
 have told her that she was in the right; but, instead of this, she 
 <I>condemns</I> her as wanting in her duty. Note, It is no strange 
 thing for those that are zealous in religion to meet with hindrances 
 and discouragements from those that are about them; not only with 
 opposition from enemies, but with blame and censure from their friends. 
 David's <I>fasting,</I> and his dancing <I>before the ark,</I> were 
 turned <I>to his reproach.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The reproof which Christ gave to Martha for her inordinate care, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 She appealed to him, and he gives judgment against her: <I>Martha, 
 Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things,</I> whereas 
 but <I>one thing is needful.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He reproved her, though he was at this time her guest. Her fault was 
 her over-solicitude to entertain him, and she expected he should 
 justify her in it, yet he publicly checked her for it. Note, <I>As many 
 as Christ loves he rebukes and chastens.</I> Even those that are dear 
 to Christ, if any thing be amiss in them, shall be sure to hear of it. 
 <I>Nevertheless I have something against thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When he reproved her, he called her by her name, <I>Martha;</I> for 
 reproofs are <I>then</I> most likely to do good when they are 
 <I>particular,</I> applied to particular persons and cases, as Nathan's 
 to David, <I>Thou art the man.</I> He repeated her name, <I>Martha, 
 Martha;</I> he speaks as one in earnest, and deeply concerned for her 
 welfare. Those that are <I>entangled</I> in the cares of this life are 
 not easily <I>disentangled.</I> To them we must call again and again, 
 <I>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That which he reproved her for was her being <I>careful and troubled 
 about many things.</I> He was not <I>pleased</I> that she should think 
 to <I>please him</I> with a rich and splendid entertainment, and with 
 perplexing herself to prepare it for him; whereas he would teach us, as 
 not to be <I>sensual</I> in using such things, so not to be 
 <I>selfish</I> in being willing that others should be <I>troubled,</I> 
 no matter who or how many, so we may be gratified. Christ reproves her, 
 both for the <I>intenseness</I> of her care ("Thou art <I>careful and 
 troubled, divided</I> and <I>disturbed</I> by thy care"), and for the
 <I>extensiveness of it,</I> "about <I>many things;</I> thou dost 
 <I>grasp</I> at many <I>enjoyments,</I> and so art troubled at many 
 <I>disappointments.</I> Poor Martha, thou hast many things to fret at, 
 and this puts thee out of humour, whereas less ado would serve." Note, 
 Inordinate care or trouble about many things in this world is a common 
 fault among Christ's disciples; it is very displeasing to Christ, and 
 that for which they often come under the rebukes of Providence. If they 
 fret for no just cause, it is just with him to order them something to 
 fret at.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That which aggravated the sin and folly of her care was that <I>but 
 one thing is needful.</I> It is a <I>low</I> construction which some 
 put upon this, that, whereas Martha was in care to provide <I>many</I> 
 dishes of meat, there was occasion but for one, one would be enough. 
 <I>There is need but of one thing</I>--<B><I>henos de esti 
 chreia</I></B>. If we take it so, it furnishes us with a rule of
 <I>temperance,</I> not to affect varieties and dainties, but to be 
 content to sit down to <I>one</I> dish of meat, to <I>half on one,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:1-3">Prov. xxiii. 1-3</A>.

 It is a <I>forced</I> construction which some of the ancients put upon 
 it: <I>But oneness is needful,</I> in opposition to distractions. There 
 is need of <I>one heart</I> to attend upon the word, not divided and 
 hurried to and fro, as Martha's was at this time. <I>The one thing
 needful</I> is certainly meant of that which Mary made her 
 choice--<I>sitting at</I> Christ's feet, to hear his word. She was 
 troubled about <I>many things,</I> when she should have applied herself 
 to one; godliness <I>unites</I> the heart, which the world had 
 <I>divided.</I> The <I>many things</I> she was troubled about were 
 <I>needless,</I> while the <I>one thing</I> she neglected was 
 <I>needful.</I> Martha's care and work were good in their proper season 
 and place; but now she had something else to do, which was unspeakably 
 more needful, and therefore should be done first, and most minded. She 
 expected Christ to have blamed Mary for not doing as she did, but he 
 blamed her for not doing as Mary did; and we are sure the <I>judgment 
 of Christ</I> is <I>according to truth.</I> The day will come when 
 Martha will wish she had set where Mary did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Christ's approbation and commendation of Mary for her serious 
 piety: <I>Mary hath chosen the good part.</I> Mary said nothing in her 
 own defence; but, since Martha has appealed to the Master, to him she 
 is willing to refer it, and will abide by his award; and here we have 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She had justly given the preference to that which best deserved it; 
 for <I>one thing is needful,</I> this one thing that she has done, to 
 give up herself to the guidance of Christ, and <I>receive the law</I> 
 from his mouth. Note, Serious godliness is a <I>needful</I> thing, it 
 is the <I>one thing needful;</I> for nothing without this will do us 
 any real good in this world, and nothing but this will go with us into 
 another world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She had herein wisely done well for herself. Christ <I>justified 
 Mary</I> against her sister's clamours. However we may be censured and 
 condemned by men for our piety and zeal, our Lord Jesus will take our 
 part: <I>But thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.</I> Let us not then 
 condemn the pious zeal of any, lest we set Christ <I>against us;</I> 
 and let us never be discouraged if we be censured for our pious zeal, 
 for we have Christ for us. Note, Sooner or later, Mary's choice will be 
 justified, and all those who make that choice, and abide by it. But 
 this was not all; he <I>applauded</I> her for her wisdom: <I>She hath 
 chosen the good part;</I> for she chose to be with Christ, to take her 
 part with him; she chose the better business, and the better happiness, 
 and took a better way of <I>honouring</I> Christ and of <I>pleasing</I> 
 him, by receiving his word into her heart, than Martha did by providing
 for his entertainment in her house. Note, 

 (1.) A <I>part with Christ</I> is a <I>good part;</I> it is a part for 
 the soul and eternity, the part Christ gives to his favourites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:38">John xiii. 8</A>),
 
 who are partakers <I>of Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:14">Heb. iii. 14</A>),

 and partakers <I>with Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:17">Rom. viii. 17</A>.

 (2.) It is a part that shall <I>never be taken away from those that 
 have it.</I> A portion in this life will certainly be <I>taken away</I> 
 from us, at the furthest, when we shall be taken away from it; but 
 <I>nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ,</I> and our part 
 in that love. Men and devils <I>cannot</I> take it away from us, and 
 God and Christ <I>will not.</I> 

 (3.) It is the wisdom and duty of every one of us to choose this 
 <I>good part,</I> to choose the service of God for our business, and 
 the favour of God for our happiness, and an interest in Christ, in 
 order to both. In particular cases we must choose that which has a 
 tendency to religion, and reckon that best for us that is best for our 
 souls. Mary was at her choice whether she would partake with Martha in 
 her care, and get the reputation of a fine <I>housekeeper,</I> or sit 
 at the feet of Christ and approve herself a <I>zealous disciple;</I> 
 and, by her choice in this particular, Christ judges of her general 
 choice. 

 (4.) Those who <I>choose this good part</I> shall not only have what 
 they choose, but shall have their choice commended in the great 
 day.</P>
