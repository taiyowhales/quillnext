 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And again he entered into Capernaum after <I>some</I> days; and it
 was noised that he was in the house.
 &nbsp; 2  And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that
 there was no room to receive <I>them,</I> no, not so much as about the
 door: and he preached the word unto them.
 &nbsp; 3  And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which
 was borne of four.
 &nbsp; 4  And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press,
 they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken
 <I>it</I> up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.
 &nbsp; 5  When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the
 palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.
 &nbsp; 6  But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and
 reasoning in their hearts,
 &nbsp; 7  Why doth this <I>man</I> thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive
 sins but God only?
 &nbsp; 8  And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they
 so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye
 these things in your hearts?
 &nbsp; 9  Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, <I>Thy</I>
 sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and
 walk?
 &nbsp; 10  But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
 to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)
 &nbsp; 11  I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way
 into thine house.
 &nbsp; 12  And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth
 before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and
 glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ, having been for some time preaching about in the country, here 
 returns to Capernaum his head-quarters, and makes his appearance there, 
 in hopes that by this time the talk and crowd would be somewhat abated. 
 Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The great resort there was to him. Though he was <I>in the 
 house,</I> wither Peter's house, or some lodgings of his own which he 
 had taken, yet people came to him as soon as it was <I>noised</I> that 
 he was in town; they did not stay till he appeared in the synagogue, 
 which they might be sure he would do on the <I>sabbath day,</I> but 
 <I>straightway many were gathered together to him.</I> Where the king 
 is, there is the court; where Shiloh is, there <I>shall the gathering 
 of the people be.</I> In improving opportunities for our souls, we must 
 take care not to <I>lose time.</I> One invited another (Come, let us go
 see Jesus), so that his house could not contain his visitants. <I>There 
 was no room to receive them,</I> they were so numerous, <I>no not so 
 much as about the door.</I> A blessed sight, to see people thus flying 
 like a cloud to Christ's house, though it was but a poor one, and <I>as 
 the doves to their windows!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The good entertainment Christ gave them, the best his house would 
 afford, and better than any other could; he <I>preached the word unto 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Many of them perhaps came only for cures, and many perhaps only for 
 curiosity, to get a sight of him; but when he had them together he 
 <I>preached to them.</I> Though the synagogue-door was open to him at 
 proper times, he thought it not at all amiss to preach in a house, on a 
 week day; though some might reckon it both an improper place and an 
 improper time. <I>Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:20">Isa. xxxii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The presenting of a poor cripple to him, to be helped by him. The 
 patient was one <I>sick of the palsy,</I> it should seem not as that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:6">Matt. viii. 6</A>,

 <I>grievously tormented,</I> but perfectly disabled, so that he was
 <I>borne of four,</I> was carried upon <I>a bed,</I> as if he had been 
 upon <I>a bier,</I> by four persons. It was his misery, that he needed 
 to be so carried, and bespeaks the calamitous state of human life; it 
 was their charity, who did so carry him, and bespeaks the compassion 
 that it is justly expected should be in the children of men toward 
 their fellow-creatures in distress, because we know not how soon the 
 distress may be <I>our own.</I> These kind relations or neighbours 
 thought, if they could but carry this poor man once to Christ, they 
 should not need to carry him any more; and therefore made hard shift to 
 get him to him; and when they could not otherwise get to him, they 
 <I>uncovered the roof where he was,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 I see no necessity to conclude that Christ was preaching in an <I>upper 
 room,</I> though in such the Jews that had stately houses, had their 
 oratories; for then to what purpose should the crowd stand <I>before 
 the door,</I> as wisdom's clients used to do?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:34">Prov. viii. 34</A>.

 But I rather conjecture that the house he was in, was so little and
 mean (agreeable to his present state), that it had no <I>upper 
 room,</I> but the <I>ground-floor</I> was open to the roof: and these 
 petitioners for the poor paralytic, resolving not to be disappointed, 
 when they could not get through the crowd at the door, got their friend 
 by some means or other to the roof of the house, took off some of the 
 tiles, and so let him down upon his bed with cords into the house where 
 Christ was preaching. This bespoke both their <I>faith</I> and their 
 <I>fervency</I> in this address to Christ. Hereby it appeared that
 they were in earnest, and would not go away, nor <I>let Christ go 
 without a blessing.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:26">Gen. xxxii. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The kind word Christ said to this poor patient; <I>He saw their 
 faith;</I> perhaps not so much his, for his distemper hindered him from 
 the exercise of faith, but <I>theirs</I> that brought him. In curing 
 the centurion's servant, Christ took notice of it as an instance of 
 <I>his faith,</I> that he did not bring him to Christ, but believed he 
 could cure him at a distance; here he commended <I>their faith,</I> 
 because they did bring their friend through so much difficulty. Note, 
 True faith and strong faith may work variously, conquering sometimes 
 the objections of reason, sometimes those of sense; but, however 
 manifested, it shall be accepted and approved by Jesus Christ. Christ 
 said, <I>Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</I> The <I>compellation</I> is 
 very <I>tender-Son;</I> intimating a fatherly <I>care</I> of him and 
 <I>concern</I> for him. Christ owns true believers as his sons: <I>a 
 son,</I> and yet sick of the palsy. Herein God <I>deals with you as 
 with sons.</I> The <I>cordial</I> is very rich; <I>Thy sins are 
 forgiven thee.</I> Note, 

 1. Sin is the procuring cause of all our pains and sicknesses. The word
 of Christ was to take his thoughts off from the disease, which was the 
 effect, and to lead them to the sin, the cause, that he might be more 
 concerned about that, to get that pardoned. 

 2. God doth <I>then</I> graciously take away the sting and malignity of
 sickness, when he forgives sin; recovery from sickness is <I>then</I> a 
 mercy indeed, when way is made for it by the pardon of sin. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:17,Ps+103:3">Isa. xxxviii. 17; Ps. ciii. 3</A>.

 The way to remove the effect, is, to take away the cause. Pardon of sin
 strikes at the root of all diseases, and either cures them, or alters 
 their property.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The cavil of the scribes at that which Christ said, and a 
 demonstration of the unreasonableness of their cavil. They were 
 expositors of the law, and their doctrine was <I>true</I>--that it is
 blasphemy for any creature to undertake the pardon of sin, and that it 
 is God's prerogative, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:25">Isa. xliii. 25</A>.

 But, as is usual with such teachers, their application was
 <I>false,</I> and was the effect of their ignorance and enmity to 
 Christ. It is <I>true, None can forgive sins but God only;</I> but it 
 is false that therefore Christ cannot, who had abundantly proved 
 himself to have a divine power. But Christ <I>perceived in his spirit 
 that they so reasoned within themselves;</I> this proves him to be God, 
 and therefore confirmed what was to be proved, that he had authority to 
 <I>forgive sins;</I> for he <I>searched</I> the heart, and knew <I>what 
 was in man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:23">Rev. ii. 23</A>.
 
 God's royalties are inseparable, and he that could <I>know 
 thoughts,</I> could <I>forgive sins.</I> This magnifies the grace of 
 Christ, in <I>pardoning sin,</I> that he knew men's thoughts, and 
 therefore knows more than any other can know, both of the sinfulness of 
 their sins and the particulars of them, and yet is ready to pardon. Now 
 he proves his power to <I>forgive sin,</I> by demonstrating his power 
 to cure the <I>man sick of the palsy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 He would not have pretended to do <I>the one,</I> if he could not have 
 done <I>the other; that ye may know that the Son of man,</I> the 
 Messiah, <I>has power on earth to forgive sin,</I> that I have that 
 power, <I>Thou that art</I> sick of the palsy, <I>arise, take up thy 
 bed.</I> Now, 

 1. This was a <I>suitable</I> argument in itself. He could not have
 cured the disease, which was the effect, if he could not have taken 
 away the sin, which was the cause. And besides, his curing diseases was 
 a figure of his pardoning sin, for sin is the disease of the soul; when 
 it is pardoned, it is healed. He that could by a word accomplish the 
 sign, could doubtless perform the thing signified, 

 2. It was suited to them. These carnal scribes would be more affected
 with such a suitable effect of a pardon as the cure of the disease, and 
 be sooner convinced by it, than by any other more spiritual 
 consequences; therefore it was proper enough to appeal, whether it is 
 easier to say, <I>Thy sins are forgiven thee,</I> or to say, <I>Arise, 
 and walk?</I> The removing of the punishment as such, was the remitting 
 of the sin; he that could go so far in the cure, no doubt could perfect 
 it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:24">Isa. xxxiii. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The cure of the sick man, and the impression it made upon the 
 people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He not only <I>arise</I> out of his bed, perfectly well, but, to show 
 that he had perfect strength restored to him, <I>he took up his 
 bed,</I> because it lay in the way, <I>and went forth before them 
 all;</I> and <I>they were all amazed,</I> as well they might, and 
 <I>glorified God,</I> as indeed they ought; saying, "<I>We never saw it 
 on this fashion;</I> never were such wonders as these done before in 
 our time." Note, Christ's works were without precedent. When we see 
 what he does in healing souls, we must own that we <I>never saw the 
 like.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the
 multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
 &nbsp; 14  And as he passed by, he saw Levi the <I>son</I> of Alph&aelig;us
 sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me.
 And he arose and followed him.
 &nbsp; 15  And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his
 house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus
 and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.
 &nbsp; 16  And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with
 publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it
 that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?
 &nbsp; 17  When Jesus heard <I>it,</I> he saith unto them, They that are
 whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I
 came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ preaching by the <I>sea-side</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 whither he went <I>for room,</I> because he found, upon second trial, 
 no house or street large enough to contain his auditory; but upon the 
 strand there might come as many as would. It should seem by this, that 
 our Lord Jesus had a strong voice, and could and did speak loud; for 
 <I>wisdom crieth without</I> in the <I>places of concourse.</I> 
 Wherever he goes, though it be to the sea-side, <I>multitudes resort to 
 him.</I> Wherever the doctrine of Christ is faithfully preached, though 
 it be driven into corners or into deserts, we must follow it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His calling Levi; the same with Matthew, who had a place in the 
 custom-house at Capernaum, from which he was denominated a 
 <I>publican;</I> his place fixed him by the water-side, and thither 
 Christ went to meet with him, and to give him an effectual call. This 
 Levi is here said to be <I>the son of Alpheus</I> or <I>Cleophas,</I> 
 husband to that Mary who was sister or near kinswoman to the virgin 
 Mary and if so, he was own brother to James the less, and Jude, and 
 Simon the Canaanite, so that there were four brothers of them apostles, 
 It is probable that Matthew was but a loose extravagant young man, or 
 else, being a Jew, he would never have been a publican. However, Christ 
 called him to <I>follow him.</I> Paul, though a Pharisee, had been one 
 of the chief of sinners, and yet was called to be an apostle. With God, 
 through Christ, there is mercy to pardon the greatest sins, and grace 
 to sanctify the greatest sinners. Matthew, that had been a publican, 
 became an evangelist, the <I>first</I> that put pen to paper, and the 
 <I>fullest</I> in writing the life of Christ. Great sin and scandal 
 before conversion, are no bar to great gifts, graces, and advancements, 
 after; nay, God may be the more glorified. Christ prevented him with 
 this call; in bodily cures, ordinarily, he was <I>sought unto,</I> but 
 in these spiritual cures, he was <I>found of them that sought him 
 not.</I> For this is the great evil and peril of the disease of sin, 
 that those who are under it, desire not to be <I>made whole.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His familiar converse with <I>publicans and sinners,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 We are here told, 

 1. That Christ <I>sat at meat in Levi's house,</I> who invited <I>him 
 and his disciples</I> to the farewell-feast he made to his friends, 
 when he left all to attend on Christ: such a feast he made, as Elisha 
 did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:21">1 Kings xix. 21</A>),

 to show, not only with what cheerfulness in himself, but with what 
 thankfulness to God, he quitted all, in compliance with Christ's call. 
 Fitly did he make the <I>day of his espousals</I> to Christ a festival 
 day. This was also to testify his respect to Christ, and the grateful 
 sense he had of his kindness, in snatching him from the receipt of 
 custom as a brand out of the burning. 

 2. That <I>many publicans and sinners</I> sat with Christ in Levi's
 house (for <I>there were many</I> belonging to that custom-house); and 
 <I>they followed him.</I> They followed Levi; so some understand it, 
 supposing that, like Zaccheus, he was <I>chief among the publicans,</I> 
 and was <I>rich;</I> and for that reason, the inferior sort of them 
 attended him for what they could get. I rather take it, that they
 <I>followed Jesus</I> because of the report they had heard of him. They 
 did not <I>for conscience-sake</I> leave all to follow him, but <I>for 
 curiosity-sake</I> they came to Levi's feast, to see him; whatever 
 brought them thither, they were sitting with <I>Jesus and his 
 disciples.</I> The publicans are here and elsewhere ranked with 
 <I>sinners,</I> the worst of <I>sinners.</I>

 (1.) Because commonly they <I>were such;</I> so general were the 
 corruptions in the execution of that office, oppressing, exacting, and 
 taking bribes or fees to extortion, and <I>accusing falsely,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:13,14">Luke iii. 13, 14</A>.

 A faithful fair-dealing publican was so rare, even at Rome, that one
 Sabinus, who kept a clean reputation in that office, was, after his 
 death, honoured with this inscription, <B><I>Kalos 
 telonesanti</I></B>--<I>Here lies an honest publican.</I>

 (2.) Because the Jews had a particular antipathy to them and their 
 office, as an affront to the liberty of their nation and a badge of 
 their slavery, and therefore put them into an ill name, and thought it 
 scandalous to be seen in their company. Such as these our blessed Lord 
 was pleased to converse with, when he appeared <I>in the likeness of 
 sinful flesh.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The <I>offence</I> which the scribes and Pharisees took at this, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 They would not come to hear him preach, which they might have been 
 convinced the edified by; but they would come themselves to <I>see 
 him</I> sit with publicans and sinners, which they would be provoked 
 by. They endeavoured to put the disciples out of conceit with their 
 Master, as a man not of such sanctity and severe morals as became his 
 character; and therefore put the question to them. <I>How is it, that 
 he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</I> Note, It is no 
 new thing for that which is both well-<I>done,</I> and 
 well-<I>designed,</I> to be misrepresented, and turned to the reproach 
 of the wisest and best of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Christ's justification of himself in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He stood to what he did, and would not withdraw, though the Pharisees
 were offended, as Peter afterwards did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:12">Gal. ii. 12</A>.

 Note, Those are too tender of their own <I>good name,</I> who, to 
 preserve it with some nice people, will decline a <I>good work.</I> 
 Christ would not do so. They thought the publicans were to be
 <I>hated.</I> "No," saith Christ, "they are to be <I>pitied,</I> they 
 are <I>sick</I> and <I>need a physician;</I> they are sinners, and need 
 a Saviour." They thought Christ's character should separate him from 
 them; "No," saith Christ, "my commission directs me to them; <I>I came 
 not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</I> If the world 
 had been <I>righteous,</I> there had been no occasion for my coming, 
 either to <I>preach</I> repentance, or to <I>purchase</I> remission. It 
 is to a <I>sinful world</I> that I am sent, and therefore my business 
 lies most with those that are the greatest sinners in it." Or thus; 
 "<I>I am not come to call the righteous,</I> the proud Pharisees that 
 think themselves righteous, that ask, <I>Wherein shall we return?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:7">Mal. iii. 7</A>),

 Of what shall we repent? But poor publicans, that own themselves to be 
 sinners, and are glad to be invited and encouraged to repent." It is 
 good dealing with those that there is hope of; now there is <I>more 
 hope of a fool</I> than of one that is <I>wise in his own conceit,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast:
 and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and
 of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
 &nbsp; 19  And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the
 bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as
 they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
 &nbsp; 20  But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken
 away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
 &nbsp; 21  No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment:
 else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old,
 and the rent is made worse.

 wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the
 bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new

 when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with
 him?

 the high priest, and did eat the showbread, which is not lawful
 to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with
 him?
 &nbsp; 27  And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not
 man for the sabbath:
 &nbsp; 28  Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ had been put to <I>justify</I> himself in conversing with 
 <I>publicans and sinners:</I> here he is put to justify his disciples; 
 and in what they do according to his will he will justify them, and 
 bear them out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He justifies them in their <I>not fasting,</I> which was turned to 
 their reproach by the Pharisees. Why do the Pharisees and the disciples 
 of John fast? They <I>used to fast,</I> the Pharisees fasted <I>twice 
 in the week</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:12">Luke xviii. 12</A>),

 and probably the disciples of John did so too; and, it should seem, 
 this very day, when Christ and his disciples were feasting in Levi's 
 house, was their <I>fast-day,</I> for the word is 
 <B><I>nesteuousi</I></B>--<I>they do fast,</I> or <I>are fasting,</I> 
 which aggravated the offence. Thus apt are strict professors to make 
 their own practice a standard, and to censure and condemn all that do 
 not fully come up to it. They invidiously suggest that if Christ went 
 among sinners to do them <I>good,</I> as he had pleaded, yet the 
 disciples went to indulge their appetites, for they never knew what it 
 was to fast, or to deny themselves. Note, Ill-will always suspects the 
 worst.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things Christ pleads in excuse of his disciples <I>not 
 fasting.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That these were <I>easy days</I> with them, and fasting was not so 
 <I>seasonable</I> now as it would be hereafter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 There is a time for all things. Those that enter into the married 
 state, must expect care and <I>trouble in the flesh,</I> and yet, 
 during the nuptial solemnity, they are merry, and think it becomes them 
 to be so; it was very absurd for Samson's bride to <I>weep before</I> 
 him, <I>during the days that the feast lasted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+14:17">Judg. xiv. 17</A>.

 Christ and his disciples were but newly married, the bridegroom was
 <I>yet with them,</I> the nuptials were yet in the celebrating 
 (Matthew's particularly); when the bridegroom should be removed from 
 them to the far country, about his business, then would be a proper 
 time to sit as a widow, in solitude and fasting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That these were <I>early days</I> with them, and they were not so 
 able for the severe exercises of religion as hereafter they would be. 
 The Pharisees had long accustomed themselves to such austerities; and 
 John Baptist himself came neither eating nor drinking. His disciples 
 from the first inured themselves to hardships, and thus found it easier 
 to bear strict and frequent fasting, but it was not so with Christ's 
 disciples; their Master came <I>eating and drinking,</I> and had not 
 bred them up to the difficult services of religion as yet, for it was 
 all in good time. To put them upon such frequent fasting at first, 
 would be a discouragement to them, and perhaps drive them off from 
 following Christ; it would be of as ill consequence as <I>putting new 
 wine into old casks,</I> or sewing <I>new cloth</I> to that which is 
 worn thin and threadbare, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 Note, God graciously <I>considers the frame</I> of young Christians, 
 that are <I>weak</I> and <I>tender,</I> and so must we; nor must we 
 expect more than the <I>work of the day in its day,</I> and that day 
 according to the strength, because it is not in our hands to give 
 strength according to the day. Many contract an antipathy to some kind
 of food, otherwise good, by being surfeited with it when they are 
 young; so, many entertain prejudices against the exercises of devotion 
 by being burthened with them, and <I>made to serve with an 
 offering,</I> at their setting out. Weak Christians must take heed of
 <I>over-tasking</I> themselves, and of making the yoke of Christ 
 otherwise than as it is, easy, and sweet, and pleasant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He justifies them in <I>plucking the ears of corn on the sabbath 
 day,</I> which, I will warrant you, a disciples of the Pharisees would 
 not dare to have done; for it was contrary to an express tradition of 
 their elders. In this instance, as in that before, they reflect upon 
 the discipline of Christ's school, as if it were not so strict as that 
 of theirs: so common it is for those who deny the <I>power of 
 godliness,</I> to be jealous for the <I>form,</I> and censorious of 
 those who affect not <I>their</I> form.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. What a poor breakfast Christ's disciples had on a sabbath-day 
 morning, when they were going to church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 they <I>plucked the ears of corn,</I> and that was the best they had. 
 They were so intent upon spiritual dainties, that they forgot even 
 their <I>necessary food;</I> and the word of Christ was to them instead 
 of that; and their zeal for it even <I>ate them up.</I> The Jews made 
 it a piece of religion, to eat dainty food on sabbath days, but the 
 disciples were content with any thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How even this was <I>grudged them</I> by the Pharisees, upon 
 supposition that it was not lawful to <I>pluck the ears of corn</I> on 
 the sabbath day, that that was as much a servile work as <I>reaping</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 <I>Why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</I> Note, 
 If Christ's disciples do that which is unlawful, Christ will be 
 reflected upon, and upbraided with it, as he was here, and dishonour 
 will redound to his name. It is observable, that when the Pharisees 
 thought Christ did amiss, they told the disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 and now when they thought the disciples did amiss, they spoke to 
 Christ, as make-bates, that did what they could to sow discord between 
 Christ and his disciples, and make a breach in the family.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How Christ defended them in what they did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) By example. They had a good precedent for it in David's eating the 
 <I>show-bread,</I> when he was hungry, and there was no other bread to 
 be had 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>);

 <I>Have ye never read?</I> Note, Many of our mistakes would be 
 rectified, and our unjust censures of others corrected, if we would but 
 recollect what <I>we have read</I> in the scripture; appeals to that 
 are most convincing. "You have read that David, the man after God's own 
 heart, <I>when he was hungry,</I> made no difficulty of eating <I>the 
 show-bread,</I> which by the law none might eat of but the priests and 
 their families." Note, Ritual observances must give way to moral 
 obligations; and that may be done in a case of necessity, which 
 otherwise may not be done. This, it is said, David did in the days of 
 <I>Abiathar the High-Priest;</I> or <I>just before</I> the days of 
 Abiathar, who immediately succeeded Abimelech his father in the 
 pontificate, and, it is probable, was at that time his father's deputy, 
 or assistant, in the office; and he it was that escaped the massacre, 
 and brought the ephod to David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) By argument. To reconcile them to the disciples' <I>plucking the 
 ears of corn,</I> let them consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Whom the sabbath was <I>made for</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 <I>it was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.</I> This we had 
 not in Matthew. The sabbath is a sacred and divine institution; but we 
 must receive and embrace it as a privilege and a benefit, not as a task 
 and a drudgery. <I>First,</I> God never designed it to be an
 <I>imposition</I> upon us, and therefore we must not make it so to 
 ourselves. <I>Man was not made for the sabbath,</I> for he was made a 
 day before the sabbath was instituted. Man was made <I>for God,</I> and 
 for his honour and service, and he just rather die than deny him; but 
 he was not <I>made for the sabbath,</I> so as to be tied up by the law 
 of it, from that which is necessary to the support of his life. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> God did design it to be an <I>advantage</I> to us, and 
 so we must make it, and improve it. He made if <I>for man.</I> 

 1. He had <I>some</I> regard to our <I>bodies</I> in the institution,
 that they might rest, and not be tired out with the constant business 
 of this world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:14">Deut. v. 14</A>);

 <I>that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest.</I> Now he that 
 intended the <I>sabbath-rest</I> for the <I>repose</I> of our bodies, 
 certainly never intended it should restrain us, in a case of necessity, 
 from fetching in the necessary <I>supports</I> of the body; it must be 
 construed so as not to contradict itself--for <I>edification,</I> and 
 not for <I>destruction.</I> 

 2. He had <I>much more</I> regard to our <I>souls.</I> The
 <I>sabbath</I> was made a day of rest, only in order to its being a day 
 of holy work, a day of communion with God, a day of praise and 
 thanksgiving; and the rest from worldly business is <I>therefore</I> 
 necessary, that we may closely apply ourselves to this work, and spend 
 the whole time in it, in public and in private; but then time is 
 allowed us for that which is necessary to the fitting of our bodies for 
 the service of our souls in God's service, and the enabling of them to 
 <I>keep pace</I> with them in that work. See here,

 (1.) What a <I>good Master</I> we serve, all whose institutions are for 
 our own benefit, and if we be so wise as to observe them, we are 
 <I>wise for ourselves;</I> it is not he, but we, that are gainers by 
 our service. 

 (2.) What we should aim at in our <I>sabbath work,</I> even the good of 
 our own souls. If the sabbath was made for man, we should then ask 
 ourselves at night, "What am I the better for this sabbath day?" 

 (3.) What care we ought to take not to make those exercises of religion 
 burthens to ourselves or others, which God ordained to be blessings; 
 neither adding to the command by unreasonable strictness, nor indulging 
 those corruptions which are adverse to the command, for thereby we make 
 those devout exercises a penance to ourselves, which otherwise would be 
 a pleasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Whom the sabbath was <I>made by</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);

 "<I>The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath;</I> and therefore he 
 will not see the kind intentions of the institution of it frustrated by 
 your impositions." Note, The sabbath days are <I>days of the Son of 
 man;</I> he is the Lord of the day, and to his honour it must be 
 observed; by him God made the worlds, and so it was by him that the 
 sabbath was first instituted; by him God gave the law at mount Sinai, 
 and so the <I>fourth</I> commandment was <I>his law;</I> and that 
 little alteration that was shortly to be made, by the shifting of it 
 one day forward to the first day of the week, was to be in remembrance 
 of <I>his</I> resurrection, and therefore the Christian sabbath was to 
 be called <I>the Lord's day</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:10">Rev. i. 10</A>),

 the Lord Christ's day; and the <I>Son of man,</I> Christ, as Mediator, 
 is always to be looked upon as Lord of the sabbath. This argument he 
 largely insists upon in his own justification, when he was charged with 
 having broken the sabbath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:16">John v. 16</A>.</P>
