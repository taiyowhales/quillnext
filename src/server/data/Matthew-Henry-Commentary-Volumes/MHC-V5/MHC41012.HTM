 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And he began to speak unto them by parables. A <I>certain</I> man
 planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about <I>it,</I> and digged <I>a
 place for</I> the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to
 husbandmen, and went into a far country.
 &nbsp; 2  And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that
 he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the
 vineyard.
 &nbsp; 3  And they caught <I>him,</I> and beat him, and sent <I>him</I> away
 empty.
 &nbsp; 4  And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they
 cast stones, and wounded <I>him</I> in the head, and sent <I>him</I> away
 shamefully handled.
 &nbsp; 5  And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many
 others; beating some, and killing some.
 &nbsp; 6  Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him
 also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.
 &nbsp; 7  But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;
 come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.
 &nbsp; 8  And they took him, and killed <I>him,</I> and cast <I>him</I> out of
 the vineyard.
 &nbsp; 9  What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will
 come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto
 others.
 &nbsp; 10  And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the
 builders rejected is become the head of the corner:
 &nbsp; 11  This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
 &nbsp; 12  And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people:
 for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and
 they left him, and went their way.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ had formerly in parables showed how he designed to set up the 
 gospel church; now he begins in parables to show how he would lay aside 
 the Jewish church, which it might have been grafted into the <I>stock 
 of,</I> but was built upon the <I>ruins of.</I> This parable we had 
 just as we have it here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:33">Matt. xxi. 33</A>.

 We may observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They that enjoy the privileges of the visible church, have a 
 vineyard let out to them, which is capable of great improvement, and 
 from the occupiers of which rent is justly expected. When God <I>showed 
 his word unto Jacob, his statutes and judgments unto Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:19">Ps. cxlvii. 19</A>),

 when he set up his temple among them, his priesthood, and his 
 ordinances, then he <I>let out</I> to them the <I>vineyard</I> he had 
 <I>planted;</I> which he <I>hedged,</I> and in which he <I>built a 
 tower,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Members of the church are God's tenants, and they have both a good 
 Landlord and a good bargain, and may live well upon it, if it be not 
 their own fault.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Those whom God lets out his vineyard to, he sends his servants to, 
 to put them in mind of his just expectations from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He was not <I>hasty</I> in his demands, nor <I>high,</I> for he did not 
 send for the rent till they could make it, <I>at the season;</I> nor 
 did he put them to the trouble of making money of it, but was willing 
 to take it <I>in specie.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is sad to think what base usage God's faithful ministers have 
 met with, in all ages, from those that have enjoyed the privileges of 
 the church, and have not brought forth fruit answerable. The 
 Old-Testament prophets were persecuted even by those that went under 
 the name of the Old-Testament church. They <I>beat them,</I> and 
 <I>sent them empty away</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 that was bad: they <I>wounded them,</I> and <I>sent them away 
 shamefully entreated</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 that was worse: nay, at length, they came to such a pitch of
 wickedness, that they <I>killed</I> them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. It was no wonder if those who abused the prophets, abused Christ 
 himself. God did at length send them his Son, his <I>well-beloved;</I> 
 it was therefore so much the greater kindness in him to send him; as in 
 Jacob to send Joseph to visit his brethren, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:14">Gen. xxxvii. 14</A>.
 
 And it might be
 expected that he whom their Master <I>loved,</I> they also should 
 respect and love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 "<I>They will reverence my son,</I> and, in reverence to him, will pay 
 their rent." But, instead of <I>reverencing</I> him because he was the 
 son and heir, they <I>therefore</I> hated him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Because Christ, in calling to repentance and reformation, made his 
 demands with more authority than the prophets had done, they were the 
 more enraged against him, and determined to put him to death, that they 
 might engross all church power to themselves, and that all the respect 
 and obedience of the people might be paid to them only; "<I>The 
 inheritance shall be ours,</I> we will be lords paramount, and bear all 
 the sway." There is an <I>inheritance,</I> which, if they had duly 
 <I>reverenced the Son,</I> might have been theirs, a heavenly 
 inheritance; but they slighted that, and would have their inheritance 
 in the wealth, and pomp, and powers, of this world. So they <I>took 
 him, and killed him;</I> they had not done it yet, but they would do it 
 in a little time; and they <I>cast him out of the vineyard,</I> they 
 refused to admit his gospel when he was gone; it would by no means 
 agree with their scheme, and so they threw it out with disdain and 
 detestation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. For such sinful and shameful doings nothing can be expected but a 
 fearful doom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 <I>What shall therefore the Lord of the vineyard do?</I> It is easy to 
 say what, for nothing could be done more provoking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He will <I>come, and destroy the husbandmen,</I> whom he would have 
 saved. When they only denied the fruit, he did not <I>distrain</I> upon 
 them for rent, nor <I>disseize</I> them and <I>dispossess</I> them for 
 <I>non-payment;</I> but when they killed his servants, and his Son, he 
 determined to <I>destroy</I> them; and this was fulfilled when 
 Jerusalem was laid waste, and the Jewish nation extirpated and made a 
 desolation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He will <I>give the vineyards to others.</I> If he have not the rent 
 from them, he will have it from another people, for God will be no 
 loser by any. This was fulfilled in the taking in of the Gentiles, and 
 the abundance of fruit which the <I>gospel brought forth in all the 
 world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:6">Col. i. 6</A>.

 If some from whom we expected well, prove bad, it doth not follow but 
 that others will be better. Christ encouraged himself with this in his 
 undertaking; <I>Though Israel be not gathered,</I> not gathered to him, 
 but gathered against him, <I>yet shall I be glorious</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:5,6">Isa. xlix. 5, 6</A>),

 as a <I>Light to lighten the Gentiles.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their opposition to Christ's exaltation shall be no obstruction to 
 it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>);

 <I>The stone which the builders rejected,</I> notwithstanding that, is 
 become <I>the Head of the corner,</I> is highly advanced as the 
 <I>Head-stone,</I> and of necessary use and influence as the 
 <I>Corner-stone.</I> God will set Christ as <I>his King,</I> upon his 
 <I>holy hill of Zion,</I> in spite of <I>their</I> project, who would 
 <I>break his bands asunder.</I> And all the world shall see and own 
 this to <I>be the Lord's doing,</I> in justice to the Jews, and in 
 compassion to the Gentiles. The exaltation of Christ <I>was the Lord's 
 doing,</I> and it is <I>his doing</I> to exalt him in our hearts, and 
 to set up his throne there; and if it be done, it cannot but be 
 marvellous in our eyes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now what effect had this parable upon the chief priests and scribes, 
 whose conviction was designed by it? They knew <I>he spoke this parable 
 against them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They could not but see their own faces in the glass of it; and one 
 would think it showed them their sin so very heinous, and their ruin so 
 certain and great, that it should have frightened them into a 
 compliance with Christ and his gospel, should have prevailed to bring 
 them to repentance, at least to make them desist from their malicious 
 purpose against him: but, instead of that,

 (1.) They <I>sought to lay hold on him,</I> and make him their prisoner 
 immediately, and so to fulfil what he had just now said they would do 
 to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 (2.) Nothing restrained them from it but the awe they stood in of the 
 people; they did not <I>reverence</I> Christ, nor had an <I>fear of</I> 
 God before their eyes, but were afraid, if they should publicly lay 
 hold on Christ, the mob would rise, and lay hold on them, and rescue 
 them. 

 (3.) They <I>left him, and went their way;</I> if they could not do 
 hurt to him, they resolved he should not do good to them, and therefore 
 they got out of the hearing of his powerful preaching, <I>lest they 
 should be converted and healed.</I> Note, If men's prejudices be not 
 conquered by the evidence of truth, they are but confirmed; and if the 
 corruptions of the heart be not subdued by faithful reproofs, they are 
 but enraged and exasperated. If the gospel be not a <I>savour of life 
 unto life,</I> it will be a <I>savour of death unto death.</I></P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
 Herodians, to catch him in <I>his</I> words.
 &nbsp; 14  And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know
 that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not
 the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it
 lawful to give tribute to C&aelig;sar, or not?
 &nbsp; 15  Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their
 hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny,
 that I may see <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 16  And they brought <I>it.</I> And he saith unto them, Whose <I>is</I>
 this image and superscription? And they said unto him, C&aelig;sar's.
 &nbsp; 17  And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to C&aelig;sar the
 things that are C&aelig;sar's, and to God the things that are God's.
 And they marvelled at him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When the enemies of Christ, who thirsted for his blood, could not find 
 occasion against him from what he said against them, they tried to 
 ensnare him by putting questions to him. Here we have him tempted, or 
 <I>at</I>tempted rather, with a question about the lawfulness of paying 
 tribute to C&aelig;sar. We had this narrative, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:15">Matt. xxii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The persons they employed were the <I>Pharisees</I> and the 
 <I>Herodians,</I> men that in this matter were contrary to one another, 
 and yet concurred against Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The Pharisees were great sticklers for the liberty of the Jews, and, if 
 he should say, It is lawful to give tribute to C&aelig;sar, they would 
 incense the common people against him, and the Herodians would, 
 underhand, assist them in it. The Herodians were great sticklers for 
 the Roman power, and, if he should discountenance the paying of tribute 
 to C&aelig;sar, they would incense the governor against hum, yea, and 
 the Pharisees, against their own principles, would join with them in 
 it. It is no new thing for those that are at variance in other things, 
 to join in a confederacy against Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The pretence they made was, that they desired him to resolve them a 
 case of conscience, which was of great importance in the present 
 juncture; and they take on them to have a high opinion of his ability 
 to resolve it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They complimented him at a high rate, called him <I>Master,</I> owned 
 him for a Teacher of the <I>way of God,</I> a Teacher of it <I>in 
 truth,</I> one who taught what was good, and upon principles of truth, 
 who would not be brought by smiles or frowns to depart a step from the 
 rules of equity and goodness; "<I>Thou carest for no man,</I> nor 
 <I>regardest the person of men,</I> thou art not afraid of offending 
 either the jealous prince on one hand, or the jealous people on the 
 other; <I>thou art right,</I> and always in the right, and dost in a 
 right manner declare good and evil, truth and falsehood." If they spoke 
 as they thought concerning Christ, when they said, <I>We know that thou 
 art right,</I> their persecuting him, and putting him to death, as a 
 deceiver, was sin against knowledge; they knew him, and yet crucified 
 him. However, a man's testimony shall be taken most strongly against 
 himself, and <I>out of their own mouths are they judged;</I> they knew 
 that he taught the way of God in truth, and yet rejected the counsel of 
 God against themselves. The professions and pretences of hypocrites 
 will be produced in evidence against them, and they will be 
 self-condemned. But if they did not know or believe it, they <I>lied 
 unto God with their mouth, and flattered him with their tongue.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The question they put was, <I>Is it lawful to give tribute to 
 C&aelig;sar, or not?</I> They would be thought desirous to know their
 duty. <I>As a nation that did righteousness, they ask of God the
 ordinances of justice,</I> when really they desired nothing but to know 
 what he would say, in hopes that, which side soever he took of the 
 question, they might take occasion from it to accuse him. Nothing is 
 more likely to ensnare ministers, than bringing them to meddle with 
 controversies about civil rights, and to settle land-marks between the 
 prince and the subject, which it is fit should be done, while it is not 
 at all fit that they should have the doing of it. They seemed to refer 
 the determining of this matter to Christ; and he indeed was fit to 
 determine it, for <I>by him kings reign, and princes decree 
 justice;</I> they put the question fairly, <I>Shall we give, or shall 
 we not give?</I> They seemed resolved to stand to his award; "If thou 
 sayest that we must pay tribute, we will do it, thou we be made beggars 
 by it. If thou sayest that we must not, we will not, though we be made 
 traitors for it." Many seemed desirous to do it; as those proud men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+42:20">Jer. xlii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ determined the question, and evaded the snare, by referring 
 them to their national concessions already made, by which they were 
 precluded from disputing this matter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.

 He <I>knew their hypocrisy,</I> the malice that was in their hearts 
 against him, while <I>with their mouth they showed all this love.</I> 
 Hypocrisy, though ever so artfully managed, cannot be concealed from 
 the Lord Jesus. He sees the <I>potsherd</I> that is <I>covered</I> with 
 the <I>silver dross.</I> He knew they intended to ensnare him, and 
 therefore contrived the matter so as to ensnare them, and to oblige 
 them by their own words to do what they were unwilling to do, which 
 was, to pay their taxes honestly and quietly, and yet at the same time 
 to screen himself against their exceptions. He made them acknowledge 
 that the current money of their nation was Roman money, had the 
 emperor's image on one side, and his <I>superscription</I> on the 
 reverse; and if so,

 1. C&aelig;sar might command their money for the public benefit,
 because he had the custody and conduct of the state, wherein he ought 
 to have his charges borne; <I>Render to C&aelig;sar the things that are 
 C&aelig;sar's.</I> The circulation of the money is from him as the 
 fountain, and therefore it must return to him. As far as it is 
 <I>his,</I> so far it must be rendered to him; and how far it is 
 <I>his,</I> and may be commanded by him, is to be judged by the 
 constitution of the government, according as it is, and hath settled 
 the prerogative of the prince and the property of the subject.

 2. C&aelig;sar might not command their consciences, nor did he pretend
 to it; he offered not to make any alteration in their religion. "Pay 
 your tribute, therefore, without murmuring or disputing, but be sure to 
 <I>render to God the things that are God's.</I>" Perhaps he referred to 
 the parable he had just now put forth, in which he had condemned them 
 for not <I>rendering</I> the fruits to the Lord of the vineyard, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Many that seem careful to give to men their due, are in no care to give 
 God <I>the glory due to his name;</I> whereas our hearts and best 
 affections are as much due to him as ever rent was to a landlord, or 
 tribute to a prince. All that heard Christ, <I>marvelled</I> at the 
 discretion of his answer, and how ingenuously he avoided the snare; but 
 I doubt none were brought by it, as they ought to be, to render to God 
 themselves and their devotions. Many will commend the wit of a sermon,
 that will not be commanded by the divine laws of a sermon.</P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
 resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
 &nbsp; 19  Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and
 leave <I>his</I> wife <I>behind him,</I> and leave no children, that his
 brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
 &nbsp; 20  Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife,
 and dying left no seed.
 &nbsp; 21  And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed:
 and the third likewise.
 &nbsp; 22  And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the
 woman died also.
 &nbsp; 23  In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose
 wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
 &nbsp; 24  And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,
 because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?
 &nbsp; 25  For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry,
 nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in
 heaven.
 &nbsp; 26  And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read
 in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying,
 I <I>am</I> the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
 Jacob?
 &nbsp; 27  He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye
 therefore do greatly err.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Sadducees, who were the deists of that age, here attack our Lord 
 Jesus, it should seem, not as the scribes, and Pharisees, and 
 chief-priests, with any malicious design upon his person; they were not 
 bigots and persecutors, but sceptics and infidels, and their design was 
 upon his doctrine, to hinder the spreading of that: they denied that
 there was any resurrection, and world of spirits, any state of rewards 
 and punishments on the other side of death: now those great and 
 fundamental truths which they denied, Christ had made it his business 
 to establish and prove, and had carried the notion of them much further 
 that ever it was before carried; and therefore they set themselves to 
 perplex his doctrine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See here the method they take to entangle it; they quote the ancient 
 law, by which, if a man died without issue, his brother was obliged to 
 marry his widow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They suppose a case to happen that, according to that law, seven 
 brothers were, successively, the husbands of one woman, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 Probably, these Sadducees, according to their wonted profaneness, 
 intended hereby to ridicule that law, and so to bring the whole frame 
 of the Mosaic institution into contempt, as absurd and inconvenient in 
 the practice of it. Those who deny divine truths, commonly set 
 themselves to disparage divine laws and ordinances. But this was only 
 by the by; their design was to expose the doctrine of the resurrection; 
 for they suppose that if there be a future state, it must be such a one 
 as this, and then the doctrine, they think, is clogged either with this 
 invincible absurdity, that a woman in that state must have seven 
 husbands, or else with this insolvable difficulty, whose wife must she 
 be. See with what subtlety these heretics <I>undermine</I> the truth; 
 they do not <I>deny</I> it, nor say, <I>There can be</I> no 
 resurrection; nay, they do not seem to doubt of it, nor say, <I>If 
 there be a resurrection,</I> whose wife shall she be? as the devil to 
 Christ, <I>If thou be the Son of God.</I> But, as though these beasts 
 of the field were more subtle than the serpent himself, they pretend to 
 own the truth, as if they were not Sadducees, no not they; who said 
 that they denied the resurrection? They take it for granted that there 
 is a resurrection, and would be thought to desire instruction 
 concerning it, when really they are designing to give a fatal stab, and 
 think that they shall do it. Note, It is the common artifice of 
 heretics and Sadducees to perplex and entangle the truth, which they 
 have not the impudence to deny.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See here the method Christ takes to clear and establish this truth, 
 which they attempted to darken, and give a shock to. This was a matter 
 of moment, and therefore Christ does not pass it over lightly, but 
 enlarges upon it, that, if they should not be reclaimed, yet others 
 might be confirmed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He charges the Sadducees with <I>error,</I> and charges that upon 
 their <I>ignorance.</I> They who banter the doctrine of the 
 resurrection as some do in our age, would be thought the only knowing 
 men, because the only <I>free thinkers,</I> when really they are the 
 fools in Israel, and the most <I>enslaved</I> and, prejudiced thinkers 
 in the world. <I>Do ye not therefore err?</I> Ye cannot but be sensible 
 of it yourselves, and that the cause of your error is, 

 (1.) Because ye do not <I>know the scriptures.</I> Not but that the 
 Sadducees had read the scriptures, and perhaps were ready in them; yet 
 they might be truly said not to <I>know the scriptures,</I> because 
 they did not know the sense and meaning of them, but put false 
 constructions upon them; or they did not receive the scriptures as the 
 word of God, but set up their own corrupt reasonings in opposition to 
 the scripture, and would believe nothing but what they could see. Note, 
 A right knowledge of the scripture, as the fountain whence all revealed 
 religion now flows, and the foundation on which it is built, is the 
 best preservative against error. Keep the truth, the scripture-truth, 
 and it shall keep thee.

 (2.) Because ye <I>know not the power of God.</I> They could not but 
 know that God is almighty, but they would not apply that doctrine to 
 this matter, but gave up the truth to the objections of the 
 impossibility of it, which would all have been answered, if they had 
 but stuck to the doctrine of God's omnipotence, to which <I>nothing is 
 impossible.</I> This therefore which God hath spoken once, we are 
 concerned to hear twice, to hear and believe, to hear and apply--that 
 <I>power belongs to God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:11,Ro+4:19-21">Ps. lxii. 11; Rom. iv. 19-21</A>.

 The same power that made soul and body and preserved them while they
 were together, can preserve the body safe, and the soul active, when 
 they are parted, and can unite them together again; for <I>behold, the 
 Lord's arm is not shortened.</I> The power of God, seen in the return 
 of the spring

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:30">Ps. civ. 30</A>),

 in the reviving of the corn 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:24">John xii. 24</A>),

 in the restoring of an abject people to their prosperity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:12-14">Ezek. xxxvii. 12-14</A>),

 in the raising of so many to life, miraculously, both in the Old 
 Testament and in the New, and especially in the resurrection of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:19,20">Eph. i. 19, 20</A>),

 are all earnests of our resurrection by the same power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:21">Phil. iii. 21</A>);
 
 <I>according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all 
 things to himself.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He sets aside all the force of their objection, by setting the 
 doctrine of the future state in a true light 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 <I>When they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are 
 given in marriage.</I> It is a folly to ask, <I>Whose wife shall she be 
 of the seven?</I> For the relation between husband and wife, though 
 instituted in the earthly paradise, will not be known in the heavenly 
 one. Turks and infidels expect sensual pleasures in their fools' 
 paradise, but Christians <I>know</I> better things--that <I>flesh and 
 blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:50">1 Cor. xv. 50</A>);

 and <I>expect</I> better things--even a full satisfaction in God's love 
 and likeness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:15">Ps. xvii. 15</A>);

 they are <I>as the angels of God in heaven,</I> and we know that they 
 have neither wives nor children. It is no wonder if we confound 
 ourselves with endless absurdities, when we measure our ideas of the 
 world of spirits by the affairs of this world of sense.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He builds the doctrine of the future state, and of the blessedness 
 of the righteous in that state, upon the covenant of God with Abraham, 
 which God was pleased to own, being after Abraham's death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.
 
 He appeals to the scriptures; <I>Have ye not read in the book of 
 Moses?</I> We have some advantage in dealing with those that have 
 <I>read the scriptures,</I> though many that have read them, <I>wrest 
 them,</I> as these Sadducees did, to <I>their own destruction.</I> Now 
 that which he refers them to is, what God says to Moses at the bush, 
 <I>I am the God of Abraham;</I> not only, I <I>was</I> so, but I 
 <I>am</I> so; I am the portion and happiness of Abraham, a God 
 all-sufficient to him. Note, It is absurd to think that God's relation 
 to Abraham should be continued, and thus solemnly recognised, if 
 Abraham was annihilated, or that the <I>living God</I> should be the 
 portion and happiness of a man that is dead, and must be for ever so; 
 and therefore you must conclude, 

 1. That Abraham's soul exists and acts as a state of separation from
 the body. 

 2. That therefore, some time or other, the body must rise again; for
 there is such an innate inclination in a human soul towards its body, 
 as would make a total and everlasting separation inconsistent with the 
 ease and repose, much more with the bliss and joy of those souls that 
 have the Lord for their God. Upon the whole matter, he concludes,
 <I>Ye therefore do greatly err.</I> Those that deny the resurrection, 
 greatly err, and ought to be told so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
 together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked
 him, Which is the first commandment of all?
 &nbsp; 29  And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments
 <I>is,</I> Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
 &nbsp; 30  And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
 with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy
 strength: this <I>is</I> the first commandment.
 &nbsp; 31  And the second <I>is</I> like, <I>namely</I> this, Thou shalt love thy
 neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater
 than these.
 &nbsp; 32  And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said
 the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
 &nbsp; 33  And to love him with all the heart, and with all the
 understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength,
 and to love <I>his</I> neighbour as himself, is more than all whole
 burnt offerings and sacrifices.
 &nbsp; 34  And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto
 him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after
 that durst ask him <I>any question.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scribes and Pharisees were (however bad otherwise) enemies to the 
 Sadducees; now one would have expected that, when they heard Christ 
 argue so well against the Sadducees, they would have countenanced him, 
 as they did Paul when he appeared against the Sadducees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:9">Acts xxiii. 9</A>);
 
 but it had not the effect: because he did not fall in with them in the 
 ceremonials of religion, he agreeing with them in the essentials, 
 gained him no manner of respect with them. Only we have here an account 
 of <I>one</I> of them, a scribe, who had so much civility in him as to 
 take notice of Christ's answer to the Sadducees, and to own that he had 
 <I>answered well,</I> and much to the purpose 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);

 and we have reason to hope that he did not join with the other scribes 
 in persecuting Christ; for here we have his application to Christ for 
 instruction, and it was such as became him; not tempting Christ, but 
 desiring to improve his acquaintance with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He enquired, <I>Which is the first commandment of all?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 He doth not mean the first in <I>order,</I> but the first in 
 <I>weight</I> and <I>dignity;</I> "Which is that command which we ought 
 to have in a special manner an eye to, and our obedience to which will 
 lay a foundation for our obedience to all the rest?" Not that any 
 commandment of God is little (they are all the commands of a great 
 God), but some are greater than others, moral precepts than rituals, 
 and of some we may say, They are the <I>greatest of all.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ gave him a direct answer to this enquiry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:29-31"><I>v.</I> 29-31</A>.

 Those that sincerely desire to be instructed concerning their duty, 
 Christ will <I>guide in judgment,</I> and <I>teach his way.</I> He 
 tells him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the great commandment of all, which is indeed inclusive of all, 
 is, that of <I>loving God with all our hearts.</I> 

 (1.) Where there is a commanding principle in the soul, there is a 
 disposition to every other duty. Love is the leading affection of the 
 soul; the love of God is the leading grace in the renewed soul. 

 (2.) Where this is not, nothing else that is good is done, or done 
 aright, or accepted, or done long. Loving God with all our heart, will 
 effectually take us off from, and arm us against, all those things that 
 are rivals with him for the throne in our souls, and will engage us to 
 every thing by which he may be honoured, and with which he will be 
 pleased; and no commandment will be grievous where this principle 
 commands, and has the ascendant. Now here in, Mark, our Saviour 
 prefixes to this command the great doctrinal truth upon which it is 
 built 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>);

 <I>Hear, O Israel, The Lord our God is one Lord;</I> if we firmly 
 believe this, it will follow, that we shall love him <I>with all our 
 heart.</I> He is Jehovah, who has all amiable perfections in himself; 
 he is <I>our God,</I> to whom we stand related and obliged; and 
 therefore we ought to <I>love him,</I> to set our affections on him, 
 let out own desire toward him, and take a delight in him; and he is 
 <I>one Lord,</I> therefore he must be loved with our <I>whole 
 heart;</I> he has the sole <I>right to us,</I> and therefore ought to 
 have the sole <I>possession of us.</I> If he be one, our hearts must be 
 one with him, and since there is no God besides, no rival must be 
 admitted with him upon the throne.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That the second great commandment is, to <I>love our neighbour as 
 ourselves</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 as truly and sincerely as we love ourselves, and in the same instances, 
 and we must show it by <I>doing as we would be done by.</I> As we must 
 therefore love God better than ourselves, because he is Jehovah, a 
 being infinitely better than we are, and must love him with <I>all our 
 heart,</I> because he is <I>one Lord,</I> and there is no other like 
 him; so we must <I>love our neighbour as ourselves,</I> because he is 
 of the same nature with ourselves; our hearts are fashioned alike, and 
 my neighbour and myself are of one body, of one society, that of the 
 world of mankind; and if a fellow-Christian, and of the same sacred 
 society, the obligation is the stronger. <I>Hath not one God created
 us?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:10">Mal. ii. 10</A>.

 Has not one Christ redeemed us? Well might Christ say, <I>There is no
 other commandment greater than these;</I> for in these all the law is 
 fulfilled, and if we make conscience of obedience to these, all other 
 instances of obedience will follow of course.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The scribe consented to what Christ said, and descanted upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 1. He commends Christ's decision of this question; <I>Well, Master, 
 thou hast said the truth.</I> Christ's assertions needed not the 
 scribe's attestations; but this scribe, being a man in authority, 
 thought it would put some reputation upon what Christ said, to have it 
 commended by him; and it shall be brought in evidence against those who 
 persecuted Christ, as a deceiver, that one of themselves, even a scribe 
 of their own, confessed that he <I>said the truth,</I> and said it 
 <I>well.</I> And thus must we subscribe to Christ's sayings, must set 
 to our seal that they are true. 

 2. He comments upon it. Christ had quoted that great doctrine, that
 <I>the Lord our God is one Lord;</I> and this he not only assented to, 
 but added, "<I>There is none other but he;</I> and therefore we must 
 have no other God besides." This excludes all rivals with him, and 
 secures the throne in the heart entire for him. Christ had laid down 
 that great law, of loving God <I>with all our hearts;</I> and this also 
 he explains--that it is loving him <I>with the understanding,</I> as 
 those that know what abundant reason we have to love him. Our love to 
 God, as it must be an <I>entire,</I> so it must be an 
 <I>intelligent,</I> love; we must love him with <I>all</I> the 
 understanding, <B><I>ex holes tes syneseos</I></B>--<I>out of the whole 
 understanding;</I> our rational powers and faculties must all be set on 
 work to lead out the affections of our souls toward God. Christ has 
 said, "To love God and our neighbour is the greatest commandment of 
 all;" "Yea," saith the scribe, "it is better, it is <I>more than all 
 whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifices,</I> more acceptable to God, and 
 will turn to a better account to ourselves." There were those who held, 
 that the law of <I>sacrifices</I> was the <I>greatest commandment</I> 
 of all; but this scribe readily agreed with our Saviour in this--that 
 the law of love to God and our neighbour is greater than that of 
 <I>sacrifice,</I> even than that of <I>whole-burnt-offerings,</I> which 
 were intended purely for the honour of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ approved of what he said, and encouraged him to proceed in 
 his enquiries of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 1. He owned that he understood well, as far as he went; so far, so 
 good. <I>Jesus saw that he answered discreetly,</I> and was the more 
 pleased with it, because he had of late met with so many even of the 
 scribes, men of letters, that answered <I>indiscreetly,</I> as those 
 that had <I>no understanding,</I> nor desired to have any. He answered 
 <B><I>nounechos</I></B>--<I>as one that had a mind;</I> as a rational 
 intelligent man, as one that had his wits about him; as one whose 
 reason was not blinded, whose judgment was not biassed, and whose 
 forethought was not fettered, by the prejudices which other scribes 
 were so much under the power of. He answered as one that allowed 
 himself liberty and leisure to consider, as one that had considered. 

 2. He owned that he stood fair for a further advance; "<I>Thou art not
 far from the kingdom of God,</I> the kingdom of grace and glory; thou 
 art in a likely way to be a Christian, a disciple of Christ. For the 
 doctrine of Christ insists most upon these things, and is designed, and 
 has a tendency direct, to bring thee to this." Note, There is hope of 
 those who make a good use of the light they have, and go as far as that 
 will carry them, that by the grace of God they will be led further, by 
 the clearer discoveries God has to make to them. What became of this 
 scribe we are not told, but would willingly hope that he took the hint 
 Christ hereby gave him, and that, having been told by him, so much to 
 his satisfaction, what was the great commandment of the law, he 
 proceeded to enquire of him, or his apostles, what was the great 
 commandment of the gospel too. Yet, if he did not, but took, up here, 
 and went no further, we are not to think it strange; for there are many 
 who are <I>not far from the kingdom of God,</I> and yet never come 
 thither. Now, one would think, this should have invited many to consult 
 him: but it had a contrary effect; <I>No man, after that, durst ask him 
 any question;</I> every thing he said, was spoken with such authority 
 and majesty, that every one stood in awe of him; those that desired to 
 <I>learn,</I> were <I>ashamed</I> to ask, and those that designed to 
 <I>cavil,</I> were <I>afraid</I> to ask.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>35  And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple,
 How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?
 &nbsp; 36  For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said to
 my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy
 footstool.
 &nbsp; 37  David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he
 <I>then</I> his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
 &nbsp; 38  And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the
 scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and <I>love</I>
 salutations in the marketplaces,
 &nbsp; 39  And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost
 rooms at feasts:
 &nbsp; 40  Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long
 prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Christ shows the people how weak and defective the scribes were in 
 their preaching, and how unable to solve the difficulties that occurred 
 in the scriptures of the Old Testament, which they undertook to 
 expound. Of this he gives an instance, which is not so fully related 
 here as it was in Matthew. Christ was <I>teaching in the temple:</I> 
 many things he said, which were not written; but notice is taken of 
 this, because it will stir us up to enquire <I>concerning Christ,</I> 
 and to enquire <I>of him;</I> for none can have the right knowledge of 
 him but <I>from himself;</I> it is not to be had from <I>the 
 scribes,</I> for they will soon be run aground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They told the people that the Messiah was to be the <I>Son of 
 David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 and they were in the right; he was not only to descend from his loins, 
 but to fill his throne 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32">Luke i. 32</A>);

 <I>The Lord shall give him the throne of his father David.</I> The 
 scripture said it often, but the people took it as what the scribes 
 said; whereas the truths of God should rather be quoted from our Bibles 
 than from our ministers, for there is the original of them. <I>Dulcius 
 ex ipso fonte bibuntur aqu&aelig;--The waters are sweetest when drawn 
 immediately from their source.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Yet they could not tell them how, notwithstanding that it was very 
 proper for David, in spirit, the spirit of prophecy, to call him <I>his 
 Lord,</I> as he doth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>.

 They had taught the people that concerning the Messiah, which would be
 for the honour of their nation--that he should be a branch of their 
 royal family; but they had not taken care to teach them that which was 
 for the honour of the Messiah himself--that he should be the Son of 
 God, and, as such, and not otherwise, <I>David's Lord.</I> Thus they 
 <I>held the truth in unrighteousness,</I> and were <I>partial</I> in 
 the gospel, as well as in the law, of the Old Testament. They were able 
 to say it, and prove it--that Christ was to be David's son; but if any 
 should object, <I>How then doth David himself call him Lord?</I> they 
 would not know how to avoid the force of the objection. Note, Those are 
 unworthy to sit in Moses's seat, who, though they are able to preach 
 the truth, are not in some measure able to defend it when they have 
 preached it, and to convince gainsayers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this galled the scribes, to have their ignorance thus exposed, and, 
 no doubt, incensed them more against Christ; but the <I>common people 
 heard him gladly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 What he preached was surprising and affecting; and though it reflected 
 upon the scribes, it was instructive to them, and they had never heard 
 such preaching. Probably there was something more than ordinarily 
 commanding and charming in his voice and way of delivery, which 
 recommended him to the affections of the common people; for we do not 
 find that any were wrought upon to <I>believe</I> in him, and to 
 <I>follow</I> him, but he was to them as a <I>lovely song of one that 
 could play well on an instrument;</I> as Ezekiel was to his hearers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:32">Ezek. xxxiii. 32</A>.

 And perhaps some of these cried, <I>Crucify him,</I> as Herod heard
 John Baptist gladly, and yet cut off his head.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He cautions the people to take heed of suffering themselves to be 
 imposed upon by the scribes, and of being infected with their pride and 
 hypocrisy; <I>He said unto them in his doctrine, "Beware of the 
 scribes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>);

 stand upon your guard, that you neither imbibe their peculiar opinions, 
 nor the opinions of the people concerning them." The charge is long as 
 drawn up against them in the parallel place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:1-39">Matt. xxiii.</A>);

 it is here contracted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They affect to appear <I>very great;</I> for they go in <I>long 
 clothing,</I> with vestures <I>down to their feet,</I> and in those 
 they walk <I>about the streets,</I> as princes, or judges, or gentlemen 
 of the long robe. Their going in such clothing was not sinful, but 
 their <I>loving</I> to go in it, priding themselves in it, valuing 
 themselves on it, commanding respect by it, saying to their long 
 clothes, as Saul to Samuel, <I>Honour me now before this people,</I> 
 this was a product of pride. Christ would have his disciples go with
 <I>their loins girt.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They affect to appear <I>very good;</I> for they pray, they make 
 <I>long prayers,</I> as if they were very intimate with heaven, and had 
 a deal of business there. They took care it should be known that they 
 prayed, that they prayed long, which, some think, intimates that they 
 prayed not for themselves only, but for others, and therein were very 
 particular and very large; this they did <I>for a pretence,</I> that 
 they might seem to love prayer, not only for God's sake, whom hereby 
 they pretended to glorify, but for their neighbour's sake, whom hereby 
 they pretended to be serviceable to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They here aimed to <I>advance</I> themselves: they coveted applause, 
 and were fond of it; they loved <I>salutations in the marketplaces,</I> 
 and the <I>chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at 
 feasts;</I> these pleased a vain fancy; to have these given them, they 
 thought, expressed the value <I>they</I> had for them, who did know 
 them, and gained them respect for those who did not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They herein aimed to <I>enrich</I> themselves. They <I>devoured 
 widows' houses,</I> made themselves masters of their estates by some 
 trick or other; it was to screen themselves from the suspicion of 
 dishonesty, that they put on the mask of piety; and that they might not 
 be thought as bad as the worst, they were studious to seem as good as 
 the best. Let fraud and oppression be thought the worse of for their 
 having <I>profaned</I> and <I>disgraced</I> long prayers; but let not 
 prayers, no nor <I>long prayers,</I> be thought the worse of, if made 
 in humility and sincerity, for their having been by some thus abused. 
 But as iniquity, thus disguised with a show of piety, is <I>double</I> 
 iniquity, so its doom will be doubly heavy; <I>These shall receive 
 great damnation;</I> greater than those that live without prayer, 
 greater than they would have received for the wrong done to the poor 
 widows, if it had not been thus disguised. Note, The damnation of 
 hypocrites will be of all others the greatest damnation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>41  And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the
 people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast
 in much.
 &nbsp; 42  And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two
 mites, which make a farthing.
 &nbsp; 43  And he called <I>unto him</I> his disciples, and saith unto them,
 Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in,
 than all they which have cast into the treasury:
 &nbsp; 44  For all <I>they</I> did cast in of their abundance; but she of
 her want did cast in all that she had, <I>even</I> all her living.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This passage of story was not in Matthew, but is here and in Luke; it 
 is Christ's commendation of the poor widow, that cast <I>two mites</I> 
 into the treasury, which our Saviour, busy as he was in preaching, 
 found leisure to take notice of. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. There was a <I>public fund</I> for charity, into which contributions 
 were brought, and out of which distributions were made; a poor's-box, 
 and this in <I>the temple;</I> for works of charity and works of piety 
 very fitly go together; where God is honoured by our worship, it is 
 proper he should be honoured by the relief of his poor; and we often 
 find <I>prayers</I> and <I>alms</I> in conjunction, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:2,4">Acts x. 2, 4</A>.

 It is good to erect public receptacles of charity for the inviting and
 directing of private hands in giving to the poor; nay it is good for 
 those who are of ability to have funds of their own, to <I>lay by as 
 God has prospered them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:2">1 Cor. xvi. 2</A>),

 that they might have something ready to give when an object of charity 
 offers itself, which is before dedicated to such uses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jesus Christ had <I>an eye</I> upon it;<I> He sat over against the 
 treasury, and beheld now the people cast money into it;</I> not 
 grudging either that he had none to cast in, or had not the disposal of 
 that which was cast in, but observing what was cast in. Note, Our Lord 
 Jesus takes notice of what we contribute to pious and charitable uses; 
 whether we give liberally or sparingly; whether cheerfully or with 
 reluctance and ill-will; nay, he looks at the heart; he observes what 
 principles we act upon, and what our views are, in giving alms; and 
 whether we do it as unto the Lord, or only to be seen of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He saw <I>many that were rich cast in much:</I> and it was a good 
 sight to see rich people charitable, to see <I>many</I> rich people so, 
 and to see them not only cast in, but cast in <I>much.</I> Note, Those 
 that are rich, ought to give richly; if God give abundantly to us, he 
 expects we should give abundantly to the poor; and it is not enough for 
 those that are rich, to say, that they give as much as others do, who 
 perhaps have much less of the world than they have, but they must give 
 in proportion to their estates; and if objects of charity do not 
 present themselves, that require so much, they ought to enquire them 
 out, and to <I>devise liberal things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. There was a <I>poor widow that cast in two mites, which make a 
 farthing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>);

 and our Lord Jesus highly commended her; <I>called his disciples</I> to 
 him, and bid them take notice of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>);

 told them that she could very ill spare that which she gave, she had 
 scarcely enough for herself, it was <I>all her living,</I> all she had 
 to live upon for that day, and perhaps a great part of what she had 
 earned by her labour the day before; and that forasmuch as he knew she 
 did it from a truly charitable disposition, he reckoned it more than 
 all that put together, which the rich people threw in; for they did 
 <I>cast in of their abundance, but she of her want,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+12:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 Now many would have been ready to censure this <I>poor widow,</I> and 
 to think she did ill; why should she give to others, when she had 
 little enough for herself? Charity begins at home; or, if she would
 give it, why did she not bestow it upon some poor body that she knew? 
 What occasion was there for her bringing it to the <I>treasury</I> to 
 be disposed of by the chief priests, who, we have reason to fear, were 
 partial in the disposal of it? It is so rare a thing to find any that 
 would not blame this widow, that we cannot expect to find any that will 
 imitate her; and yet our Saviour commends her, and therefore we are 
 sure that she did very well and wisely. If Christ saith, 
 <I>Well-done,</I> no matter who saith otherwise; and we must hence 
 learn, 

 1. That <I>giving alms,</I> is an excellent good thing, and highly
 pleasing to the Lord Jesus; and if we be humble and sincere in it, he 
 will graciously accept of it, though in some circumstances there may 
 not be all the discretion in the world. 

 2. Those that have but a <I>little,</I> ought to give alms out of
 <I>their little.</I> Those that live by their labour, from hand to 
 mouth, must <I>give to those that need,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:28">Eph. iv. 28</A>.

 3. It is very good for us to straiten and deny ourselves, that we may
 be able to give the more to the poor; to deny ourselves not only 
 superfluities, but even conveniences, for the sake of charity. We 
 should in many cases pinch ourselves, that we may supply the 
 necessities of others; this is loving our neighbours as ourselves. 

 4. Public charities should be encouraged, for they bring upon a nation
 public blessings; and though there may be some mismanagement of them, 
 yet that is not a good reason why we should not bring in our 
 <I>quota</I> to them. 

 5. Though we can give but a <I>little</I> in charity, yet if it be
 according to our ability, and be given with an upright heart, it shall 
 be accepted of Christ, who requires <I>according to what a man has, and 
 not according to what he has not;</I> two mites shall be put upon the 
 score, and brought to account, if given in a right manner, as if they 
 had been two pounds. 

 6. It is much to the praise of charity, when we give not only <I>to
 our power,</I> but <I>beyond our power,</I> as the Macedonian churches, 
 whose <I>deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:2,3">2 Cor. viii. 2, 3</A>.

 When we can cheerfully provide for others, out of our own necessary
 provision, as the widow of Sarepta for Elijah, and Christ for his five 
 thousand guests, and trust God to provide for us some other way, 
 <I>this is thank-worthy.</I></P>
