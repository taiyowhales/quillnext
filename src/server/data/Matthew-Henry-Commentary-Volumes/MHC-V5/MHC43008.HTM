 at him, and sought occasion against him, and made every thing he said a
 matter of controversy.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
 &nbsp; 2  And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and
 all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
 &nbsp; 3  And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken
 in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
 &nbsp; 4  They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery,
 in the very act.
 &nbsp; 5  Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be
 stoned: but what sayest thou?
 &nbsp; 6  This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse
 him. But Jesus stooped down, and with <I>his</I> finger wrote on the
 ground, <I>as though he heard them not.</I>
 &nbsp; 7  So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and
 said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first
 cast a stone at her.
 &nbsp; 8  And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
 &nbsp; 9  And they which heard <I>it,</I> being convicted by <I>their own</I>
 conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, <I>even</I>
 unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing
 in the midst.
 &nbsp; 10  When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the
 woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers?
 hath no man condemned thee?
 &nbsp; 11  She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do
 I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though Christ was basely abused in the foregoing chapter, both by the 
 rulers and by the people, yet here we have him still at Jerusalem, 
 still in the temple. <I>How often would he have gathered them!</I> 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His retirement in the evening out of the town 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>He went unto the mount of olives;</I> whether to some friend's 
 house, or to some booth pitched there, now at the feast of tabernacles, 
 is not certain; whether he rested there, or, as some think, continued 
 all night in prayer to God, we are not told. But he went out of 
 Jerusalem, perhaps because he had no friend there that had either 
 kindness or courage enough to give him a night's lodging; while his 
 persecutors had <I>houses</I> of their own to go to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:53"><I>ch.</I> vii. 53</A>),

 he could not so much as borrow a place to lay his head on, but what he
 must go a mile or two out of town for. He retired (as some think)
 because he would not expose himself to the peril of a popular tumult in
 the night. It is prudent to go out of the way of danger whenever we can
 do it without going out of the way of duty. In the day-time, when he
 had work to do in the temple, he willingly exposed himself, and was
 under special protection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:2">Isa. xlix. 2</A>.

 But in the night, when he had not work to do, he withdrew into the
 country, and sheltered himself there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His return in the morning to the temple, and to his work there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What a diligent preacher Christ was: <I>Early in the morning he came 
 again, and taught.</I> Though he had been teaching the day before, he 
 taught again to-day. Christ was a constant preacher, in season and out 
 of season. Three things were taken notice of here concerning Christ's 
 preaching. 

 (1.) The time: <I>Early in the morning.</I> Though he lodged out of 
 town, and perhaps had spent much of the night in secret prayer, yet he 
 came <I>early.</I> When a day's work is to be done for God and souls it 
 is good to begin betimes, and take the day before us. 

 (2.) The place: <I>In the temple;</I> not so much because it was a 
 <I>consecrated</I> place (for then he would have chosen it at other 
 times) as because it was now a <I>place of concourse;</I> and he would 
 hereby countenance solemn assemblies for religious worship, and 
 encourage people to come up to the temple, for he had not yet left it 
 desolate. 

 (3.) His posture: <I>He sat down,</I> and taught, as one having 
 authority, and as one that intended to abide by it for some time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How diligently his preaching was attended upon: <I>All the people 
 came unto him;</I> and perhaps many of them were the country-people, 
 who were this day to return home from the feast, and were desirous to 
 hear one sermon more from the mouth of Christ before they returned. 
 They came to him, though he came early. They that <I>seek him early 
 shall find him.</I> Though the rulers were displeased at those that 
 came to hear him, yet they would come; and <I>he taught them,</I> 
 though they were angry at <I>him</I> too. Though there were few or none 
 among them that were persons of any figure, yet Christ bade them 
 welcome, and taught them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His dealing with those that brought to him the <I>woman taken in 
 adultery, tempting</I> him. The scribes and Pharisees would not only 
 not hear Christ patiently themselves, but they disturbed him when the 
 people were attending on him. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The case proposed to him by the scribes and Pharisees, who herein 
 contrived to pick a quarrel with him, and bring him into a snare, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:3-6"><I>v.</I> 3-6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They set the prisoner to the bar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 they brought him <I>a woman taken in adultery,</I> perhaps now lately 
 taken, during the time of the feast of tabernacles, when, it may be, 
 their dwelling in booths, and their feasting and joy, might, by wicked 
 minds, which corrupt the best things, be made occasions of sin. Those 
 that were <I>taken in adultery</I> were by the Jewish law to be put to 
 death, which the Roman powers allowed them the execution of, and 
 therefore she was brought before the ecclesiastical court. Observe, She 
 <I>was taken in her adultery.</I> Though adultery is a work of 
 darkness, which the criminals commonly take all the care they can to 
 conceal, yet sometimes it is strangely brought to light. Those that 
 promise themselves secrecy in sin deceive themselves. The scribes and 
 Pharisees bring her to Christ, and set her in the midst of the 
 assembly, as if they would leave her wholly to the judgment of Christ, 
 he having <I>sat down,</I> as a judge upon the bench.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They prefer an indictment against her: <I>Master, this woman was 
 taken in adultery,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Here they call him <I>Master</I> whom but the day before they had 
 called a <I>deceiver,</I> in hopes with their flatteries to have 
 ensnared him, as those, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:20">Luke xx. 20</A>.

 But, though men may be imposed upon with compliments, he that searches
 the heart cannot.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The crime for which the prisoner stands indicted is no less than 
 adultery, which even in the patriarchal age, before the law of Moses, 
 was looked upon as <I>an iniquity to be punished by the judges,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:9-11,Ge+38:24">Job xxxi. 9-11; Gen. xxxviii. 24</A>.

 The Pharisees, by their vigorous prosecution of this offender, seemed
 to have a great zeal against the sin, when it appeared afterwards that 
 they themselves were not free from it; nay, they were within <I>full of 
 all uncleanness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:27,28">Matt. xxiii. 27, 28</A>.

 Note, It is common for those that are indulgent to their own sin to be
 severe against the sins of others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The proof of the crime was from the notorious evidence of the
 fact, an incontestable proof; she was <I>taken in the act,</I> so that 
 there was no room left to plead not guilty. Had she not been taken in 
 this act, she might have gone on to another, till her heart had been 
 perfectly hardened; but sometimes it proves a mercy to sinners to have 
 their sin brought to light, that they may <I>do no more 
 presumptuously.</I> Better our sin should <I>shame</I> us than 
 <I>damn</I> us, and be set in order before us for our conviction than 
 for our condemnation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They produce the statute in this case made and provided, and upon 
 which she was indicted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Moses in the law commanded <I>that such should be stoned.</I> Moses 
 commanded that they should be <I>put to death</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:10,De+22:22">Lev. xx. 10; Deut. xxii. 22</A>),

 but not that they should be stoned, unless the adulteress was espoused, 
 not married, or was a priest's daughter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+22:21">Deut. xxii. 21</A>.

 Note, Adultery is an exceedingly sinful sin, for it is the rebellion of 
 a vile lust, not only against the command, but against the covenant, of 
 our God. It is the violation of a divine institution in innocency, by 
 the indulgence of one of the basest lusts of man in his degeneracy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) They pray his judgment in the case: "<I>But what sayest thou,</I> 
 who pretendest to be a teacher come from God to repeal old laws and 
 enact new ones? What hast thou to say in this case?" If they had asked 
 this question in sincerity, with a humble desire to know his mind, it 
 had been very commendable. Those that are entrusted with the 
 administration of justice should look up to Christ for direction; but 
 <I>this they said tempting him, that they might have to accuse him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 [1.] If he should confirm the sentence of the law, and let it take its
 course, they would censure him as inconsistent with himself (he having 
 received publicans and harlots) and with the character of the Messiah, 
 who should be meek, and have salvation, and proclaim a year of release; 
 and perhaps they would accuse him to the Roman governor, for 
 countenancing the Jews in the exercise of a judicial power. But, 

 [2.] If he should acquit her, and give his opinion that the sentence 
 should not be executed (as they expected he would), they would 
 represent him, <I>First,</I> As an enemy to the law of Moses, and as 
 one that usurped an authority to correct and control it, and would 
 confirm that prejudice against him which his enemies were so 
 industrious to propagate, that he came to <I>destroy the law and the 
 prophets. Secondly,</I> As a friend to sinners, and, consequently, a
 favourer of sin; if he should seem to connive at such wickedness, and 
 let it go unpunished, they would represent him as countenancing it, and 
 being a patron of offences, if he was a protector of offenders, than 
 which no reflection could be more invidious upon one that professed the 
 strictness, purity, and business of a prophet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The method he took to resolve this case, and so to break this 
 snare.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He seemed to slight it, and turned a deaf ear to it: He <I>stooped 
 down, and wrote on the ground.</I> It is impossible to tell, and 
 therefore needless to ask, what he wrote; but this is the only mention 
 made in the gospels of Christ's writing. Eusebius indeed speaks of his
 writing to Abgarus, king of Edessa. Some think they have a liberty of 
 conjecture as to what he wrote here. Grotius says, It was some grave 
 weighty saying, and that it was usual for wise men, when they were very 
 thoughtful concerning any thing, to do so. Jerome and Ambrose suppose 
 he wrote, <I>Let the names of these wicked men be written in the 
 dust.</I> Others this, <I>The earth accuses the earth, but the judgment 
 is mine.</I> Christ by this teaches us to be slow to speak when 
 difficult cases are proposed to us, not quickly to shoot our bolt; and 
 when provocations are given us, or we are bantered, to pause and 
 consider before we reply; think twice before we speak once: <I>The 
 heart of the wise studies to answer.</I> Our translation from some 
 Greek copies, which add, <B><I>me prospoioumenos</I></B> (though most 
 copies have it not), give this account of the reason of his writing on 
 the ground, <I>as though he heard them not.</I> He did as it were look 
 another way, to show that he was not willing to take notice of their 
 address, saying, in effect, <I>Who made me a judge or a divider?</I> It 
 is safe in many cases to be deaf to that which it is not safe to 
 answer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:13">Ps. xxxviii. 13</A>.

 Christ would not have his ministers to be entangled in secular affairs.
 Let them rather employ themselves in any lawful studies, and fill up 
 their time in writing on the ground (which nobody will heed), than busy 
 themselves in that which does not belong to them. But, when Christ
 seemed as though he heard them not, he made it appear that he not only 
 heard their words, but knew their thoughts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) When they importunately, or rather impertinently, pressed him for 
 an answer, he turned the conviction of the prisoner upon the 
 prosecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They <I>continued asking him,</I> and his seeming not to take 
 notice of them made them the more vehement; for now they thought sure 
 enough that they had run him aground, and that he could not avoid the 
 imputation of contradicting either the law of Moses, if he should 
 acquit the prisoner, or his own doctrine of mercy and pardon, if he 
 should condemn her; and therefore they pushed on their appeal to him 
 with vigour; whereas they should have construed his disregard of them 
 as a check to their design, and an intimation to them to desist, as 
 they tendered their own reputation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] At last he put them all to shame and silence with one word: <I>He 
 lifted up himself,</I> awaking as one out of sleep 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:65">Ps. lxxviii. 65</A>),

 and <I>said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first 
 cast a stone at her.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Here Christ avoided the snare which they had laid for 
 him, and effectually saved his own reputation. He neither reflected 
 upon the law nor excused the prisoner's guilt, nor did he on the other 
 hand encourage the prosecution or countenance their heat; see the good 
 effect of consideration. When we cannot make our point by steering a 
 direct course, it is good to fetch a compass.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly, In the net which they spread is their own foot taken.</I> 
 They came with design to accuse him, but they were forced to accuse 
 themselves. Christ owns it was fit the prisoner should be prosecuted, 
 but appeals to their consciences whether they were fit to be the 
 prosecutors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> He here refers to that rule which the law of Moses prescribed 
 in the execution of criminals, that the <I>hand of the witnesses must 
 be first upon them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:7">Deut. xvii. 7</A>),

 as in the stoning of Stephen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:58">Acts vii. 58</A>.

 The scribes and Pharisees were the witnesses against this woman. Now
 Christ puts it to them whether, according to their own law, they would 
 dare to be the executioners. Durst they take away that life with their
 hands which they were now taking away with their tongues? would not 
 their own consciences fly in their faces if they did?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> He builds upon an uncontested maxim in morality, that it is 
 very absurd for men to be zealous in punishing the offences of others, 
 while they are every whit as guilty themselves, and they are not better 
 than self-condemned who judge others, and yet themselves do the same 
 thing: "If there be any of you who is <I>without sin,</I> without sin 
 of this nature, that has not some time or other been guilty of 
 fornication or adultery, let him cast the first stone at her." Not that 
 magistrates, who are conscious of guilt themselves, should therefore 
 connive at others' guilt. But therefore, 

 (<I>a.</I>) Whenever we find fault with others, we ought to reflect 
 upon ourselves, and to be more severe against sin in ourselves than in 
 others. 

 (<I>b.</I>) We ought to be favourable, though not to the sins, yet to 
 the persons, of those that offend, and to restore them with a <I>spirit 
 of meekness,</I> considering ourselves and our own corrupt nature. 
 <I>Aut sumus, aut fuimus, vel possumus esse quod hic est--We either 
 are, or have been, or may be, what he is.</I> Let this restrain us from 
 <I>throwing stones</I> at our brethren, and proclaiming their faults. 
 <I>Let him that is without sin</I> begin such discourse as this, and 
 then those that are truly humbled for their own sins will blush at it, 
 and be glad to <I>let it drop.</I> 

 (<I>c.</I>) Those that are any way obliged to animadvert upon the 
 faults of others are concerned to look well to themselves, and keep 
 themselves pure 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:5">Matt. vii. 5</A>),

 <I>Qui alterum incusat probri, ipsum se intueri oportet.</I> The 
 snuffers of the tabernacle were of <I>pure gold.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>c.</I> Perhaps he refers to the trial of the suspected wife by the
 jealous husband with the waters of jealousy. The man was to bring her 
 to the priest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+5:15">Num. v. 15</A>),

 as the scribes and Pharisees brought this woman to Christ. Now it was a 
 received opinion among the Jews, and confirmed by experience, that if 
 the husband who brought his wife to that trial had himself been at any 
 time guilty of adultery, <I>Aqu&aelig; non explorant ejus uxorem--The 
 bitter water had no effect upon the wife.</I> "Come then," saith 
 Christ, "according to your own tradition will I judge you; if you are 
 without sin, stand to the charge, and let the adulteress be executed; 
 but if not, though she be guilty, while you that present her are 
 equally so, according to your own rule she shall be free."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>d.</I> In this he attended to the great work which he came into the 
 world about, and that was to bring sinners to repentance; not to 
 destroy, but to save. He aimed to bring, not only the prisoner to 
 repentance, by showing her his mercy, but the prosecutors too, by 
 showing them their sins. They sought to ensnare him; he sought to 
 convince and convert them. Thus <I>the blood-thirsty hate the upright, 
 but the just seek his soul.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Having given them this startling word, he left them to consider of 
 it, <I>and again stooped down, and wrote on the ground,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 As when they made their address he seemed to slight their question, so 
 now that he had given them an answer he slighted their resentment of 
 it, not caring what they said to it; nay, they needed not to make any 
 reply; the matter was lodged in their own breasts, let them make the 
 best of it there. Or, he would not seem to wait for an answer, lest 
 they should on a sudden justify themselves, and then think themselves 
 bound in honour to persist in it; but gives them time to pause, and to 
 commune with their own hearts. God saith, <I>I hearkened and heard,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:6">Jer. viii. 6</A>.

 Some Greek copies here read, He <I>wrote on the ground,</I> <B><I>enos 
 hekastou auton tas hamartias</I></B>--<I>the sins of every one of 
 them;</I> this he could do, for he <I>sets our iniquities before 
 him;</I> and this he will do, for he will <I>set them in order</I> 
 before us too; he <I>seals up our transgressions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:17">Job xiv. 17</A>.

 But he does not write men's sins <I>in the sand;</I> no, they are 
 written as with a <I>pen of iron</I> and the <I>point of a diamond</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:1">Jer. xvii. 1</A>),
 
 never to be forgotten till they are forgiven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] The scribes and Pharisees were so strangely thunderstruck with the 
 words of Christ that they let fall their persecution of Christ, whom 
 they durst no further tempt, and their prosecution of the woman, whom 
 they durst no longer accuse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>They went out one by one.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Perhaps his writing on the ground frightened them, as the
 hand-writing on the wall frightened Belshazzar. They concluded he was 
 writing bitter things against them, writing their doom. Happy they who 
 have no reason to be afraid of Christ's writing!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> What he said frightened them by sending them to their 
 own consciences; he had <I>shown them to themselves,</I> and they were 
 afraid if they should stay till he lifted up himself again his next 
 word would show them to the world, and shame them before men, and 
 therefore they thought it best to withdraw. They went out <I>one by 
 one,</I> that they might go out <I>softly,</I> and not by a noisy 
 flight disturb Christ; they went away by <I>stealth,</I> as <I>people 
 being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:3">2 Sam. xix. 3</A>.

 The order of their departure is taken notice of, <I>beginning at the
 eldest,</I> either because they were most guilty, or first aware of the 
 danger they were in of being put to the blush; and if the eldest quit 
 the field, and retreat ingloriously, no marvel if the younger follow 
 them. Now see here, 

 1. The <I>force</I> of the word of Christ for the conviction of 
 sinners: <I>They who heard it were convicted by their own 
 consciences.</I> Conscience is God's deputy in the soul, and one word 
 from him will set it on work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12">Heb. iv. 12</A>.

 Those that had been old in adulteries, and long fixed in a proud 
 opinion of themselves, were here, even the oldest of them, startled by 
 the word of Christ; even scribes and Pharisees, who were most conceited 
 of themselves, are by the power of Christ's word made to retire with 
 shame.

 2. The <I>folly</I> of sinners under these convictions, which appears 
 in these scribes and Pharisees.

 (1.) It is folly for those that are under convictions to make it their 
 principal care to <I>avoid shame,</I> as Judah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+38:23">Gen. xxxviii. 23</A>),

 <I>lest we be shamed.</I> Our care should be more to save our souls 
 than to save our credit. Saul evidenced his hypocrisy when he said, 
 <I>I have sinned, yet now honour me, I pray thee.</I> There is no way 
 to get the honour and comfort of penitents, but by taking the shame of 
 penitents.

 (2.) It is folly for those that are under convictions to contrive how 
 to <I>shift off</I> their convictions, and to get rid of them. The 
 scribes and Pharisees had the wound <I>opened,</I> and now they should 
 have been desirous to have it <I>searched,</I> and then it might have 
 been <I>healed,</I> but this was the thing they <I>dreaded</I> and 
 <I>declined.</I> 

 (3.) It is folly for those that are under convictions to <I>get away 
 from Jesus Christ,</I> as these here did, for he is the only one that 
 can heal the wounds of conscience, and speak peace to us. Those that
 are convicted by their consciences will be condemned by their Judge, if 
 they be not justified by their Redeemer; and will they then go from 
 him? To whom will they go?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [5.] When the <I>self-conceited</I> prosecutors quitted the field, and 
 <I>fled for the same,</I> the <I>self-condemned</I> prisoner stood her 
 ground, with a resolution to abide by the judgment of our Lord Jesus: 
 <I>Jesus was left alone</I> from the company of the scribes and 
 Pharisees, free from their molestations, <I>and the woman standing in 
 the midst</I> of the assembly that were attending on Christ's 
 preaching, where they set her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 She did not seek to make her escape, though she had opportunity for it; 
 but her prosecutors had appealed unto Jesus, and to him she would go, 
 on him she would wait for her doom. Note, Those whose cause is brought 
 before our Lord Jesus will never have occasion to remove it into any 
 other court, for he is the refuge of penitents. The law which accuses 
 us, and calls for judgment against us, is by the gospel of Christ made 
 to withdraw; its demands are answered, and its clamours silenced, by 
 the blood of Jesus. Our cause is lodged in the gospel court; we are 
 <I>left with Jesus alone,</I> it is with him only that we have now to 
 deal, for to him all judgment is committed; let us therefore secure our 
 interest in him, and we are made for ever. Let his gospel <I>rule 
 us,</I> and it will infallibly <I>save us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [6.] Here is the conclusion of the trial, and the issue it was brought 
 to: <I>Jesus lifted up himself, and he saw none but the woman,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 Though Christ may seem to take no notice of what is said and done, but 
 leave it to the <I>contending</I> sons of men to <I>deal it out among 
 themselves,</I> yet, when the hour of his judgment is come, he will no 
 longer keep silence. When David had appealed to God, he prayed, <I>Lift 
 up thyself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:6,94:2">Ps. vii. 6, and xciv. 2</A>.

 The woman, it is likely, stood trembling at the bar, as one doubtful of
 the issue. Christ was <I>without sin,</I> and might cast the first
 stone; but though none more severe than he against sin, for he is 
 infinitely just and holy, none more compassionate than he to sinners, 
 for he is infinitely gracious and merciful, and this poor malefactor 
 finds him so, now that she <I>stands upon her deliverance.</I> Here is 
 the method of courts of judicature observed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The prosecutors are called: <I>Where are those thine 
 accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?</I> Not but that Christ knew 
 where they were; but he asked, that he might shame them, who declined 
 his judgment, and encourage her who resolved to abide by it. St. Paul's 
 challenge is like this, <I>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of 
 God's elect?</I> Where are those their accusers? The <I>accuser of the 
 brethren shall</I> be fairly <I>cast out,</I> and all indictments 
 legally and regularly quashed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> They do not appear when the question is asked: <I>Hath 
 no man condemned thee?</I> She said, <I>No man, Lord.</I> She speaks 
 respectfully to Christ, calls him <I>Lord,</I> but is silent concerning 
 her prosecutors, says nothing in answer to that question which 
 concerned them, <I>Where are those thine accusers?</I> She does not 
 triumph in their retreat nor insult over them as witnesses against 
 themselves, not against her. If we hope to be forgiven by our Judge, we 
 must forgive our accusers; and if their accusations, how invidious 
 soever, were the happy occasion of awakening our consciences, we may 
 easily <I>forgive them this wrong.</I> But she answered the question 
 which concerned herself, <I>Has no man condemned thee?</I> True 
 penitents find it enough to give an account of themselves to God, and 
 will not undertake to give an account of other people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> The prisoner is therefore discharged: <I>Neither do I 
 condemn thee; go, and sin no more.</I> Consider this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) As her discharge from the temporal punishment: "If they do
 not condemn thee to be <I>stoned to death,</I> neither <I>do I.</I>"
 Not that Christ came to disarm the magistrate of his sword of justice,
 nor that it is his will that capital punishments should not be
 inflicted on malefactors; so far from this, the administration of
 public justice is established by the gospel, and made subservient to
 Christ's kingdom: <I>By me kings reign.</I> But Christ would not
 condemn this woman,

 (<I>a.</I>) Because it was <I>none of his business;</I> he was no judge
 nor divider, and therefore would not intermeddle in secular affairs.
 His <I>kingdom</I> was <I>not of this world. Tractent fabrilia
 fabri--Let every one act in his own province.</I>

 (<I>b.</I>) Because she was prosecuted by those that were more guilty
 than she and could not for shame insist upon their demand of justice 
 against her. The law appointed the hands of the witnesses to be first 
 upon the criminal, and afterwards the hands of all the people, so that 
 if they fly off, and do not condemn her, the prosecution drops. The
 justice of God, in inflicting temporal judgments, sometimes takes 
 notice of a <I>comparative righteousness,</I> and spares those who are 
 otherwise obnoxious when the punishing of them would gratify those that 
 are worse than they,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:26,27">Deut. xxxii. 26, 27</A>.

 But, when Christ dismissed her, it was with this caution, <I>Go, and
 sin no more.</I> Impunity emboldens malefactors, and therefore those 
 who are guilty, and yet have found means to escape the edge of the law, 
 need to double their watch, <I>lest Satan get advantage;</I> for the 
 fairer the escape was, the fairer the warning was to go and sin no 
 more. Those who help to save the life of a criminal should, as Christ 
 here, help to save the soul with this caution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) As her discharge from the eternal punishment. For Christ to 
 say, <I>I do not condemn thee</I> is, in effect, to say, <I>I do 
 forgive thee;</I> and the <I>Son of man had power on earth to forgive 
 sins,</I> and could upon good grounds give this absolution; for as he 
 knew the hardness and impenitent hearts of the prosecutors, and 
 therefore said that which would confound them, so he knew the 
 tenderness and sincere repentance of the prisoner, and therefore said 
 that which would comfort her, as he did to that woman who was a sinner, 
 such a sinner as this, who was likewise looked upon with disdain by a 
 Pharisee 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:48,50">Luke vii. 48, 50</A>):

 <I>Thy sins are forgiven thee, go in peace.</I> So here, <I>Neither do 
 I condemn thee.</I> Note, 

 (<I>a.</I>) Those are truly happy whom Christ <I>doth not condemn,</I> 
 for his discharge is a sufficient answer to all other challenges; they 
 are all <I>coram non judice--before an unauthorized judge.</I> 
 
 (<I>b.</I>) Christ will not condemn those who, though they have sinned, 
 will <I>go and sin no more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:8,Isa+55:7">Ps. lxxxv. 8; Isa. lv. 7</A>.

 He will not take the advantage he has against us for our former
 rebellions, if we will but lay down our arms and return to our 
 allegiance.

 (<I>c.</I>) Christ's favour to us in the remission of the sins that are 
 past should be a prevailing argument with us to <I>go and sin no 
 more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:1,2">Rom. vi. 1, 2</A>.

 Will not Christ condemn thee? Go then and sin no more.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of
 the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but
 shall have the light of life.
 &nbsp; 13  The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record
 of thyself; thy record is not true.
 &nbsp; 14  Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of
 myself, <I>yet</I> my record is true: for I know whence I came, and
 whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.
 &nbsp; 15  Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
 &nbsp; 16  And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone,
 but I and the Father that sent me.
 &nbsp; 17  It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two
 men is true.
 &nbsp; 18  I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that
 sent me beareth witness of me.
 &nbsp; 19  Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus
 answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me,
 ye should have known my Father also.
 &nbsp; 20  These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the
 temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet
 come.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The rest of the chapter is taken up with debates between Christ and 
 contradicting sinners, who cavilled at the most gracious words that 
 proceeded out of his mouth. It is not certain whether these disputes 
 were the same day that the adulteress was discharged; it is probable 
 they were, for the evangelist mentions no other day, and takes notice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 how early Christ began that day's work. Though those Pharisees that 
 accused the woman had absconded, yet there were other Pharisees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)
 
 to confront Christ, who had brass enough in their foreheads to keep 
 them in countenance, though some of their party were put to such a 
 shameful retreat; nay perhaps that made them the more industrious to 
 pick quarrels with him, to retrieve, if possible, the reputation of 
 their baffled party. In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A great doctrine laid down, with the application of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The doctrine is, <I>That Christ is the light of the world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Then spoke Jesus again unto them;</I> though he had spoken a great 
 deal to them to little purpose, and what he had said was opposed, yet 
 he <I>spoke again,</I> for he <I>speaketh once, yea, twice.</I> They 
 had turned a deaf ear to what he said, and yet he <I>spoke again to 
 them,</I> saying, <I>I am the light of the world.</I> Note, Jesus 
 Christ is the light of the world. One of the rabbies saith, 
 <I>Light</I> is the name of the Messiah, as it is written, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:22">Dan. ii. 22</A>,

 <I>And light dwelleth with him.</I> God is light, and Christ is <I>the
 image of the invisible God;</I> God of gods, Light of lights. He was
 expected to be a <I>light to enlighten the Gentiles</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:32">Luke ii. 32</A>),

 and so the <I>light of the world,</I> and not of the Jewish church
 only. The visible light of the world is the sun, and Christ is the
 <I>Sun of righteousness.</I> One sun enlightens the whole world, so 
 does one Christ, and there needs no more. Christ in calling himself the 
 light expresses, 

 (1.) What he is in himself--most excellent and glorious.

 (2.) What he is to the world--the fountain of light, enlightening every 
 man. What a dungeon would the world be without the sun! So would it be 
 without Christ by whom <I>light came into the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:19"><I>ch.</I> iii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The inference from this doctrine is, <I>He that followeth me,</I> as 
 a traveller follows the light in a dark night, <I>shall not walk in 
 darkness,</I> but <I>shall have the light of life.</I> If Christ be the 
 light, then, 

 (1.) It is our duty to <I>follow him,</I> to submit ourselves to his 
 guidance, and in every thing take directions from him, in the way that 
 leads to happiness. Many follow <I>false lights--ignes fatui,</I> that 
 lead them to destruction; but Christ is the <I>true light.</I> It is 
 not enough to <I>look at</I> this light, and to <I>gaze</I> upon it, 
 but we must follow it, believe in it, and walk in it, for it is a light 
 to <I>our feet,</I> not <I>our eyes</I> only.

 (2.) It is the happiness of those who follow Christ that they <I>shall 
 not walk in darkness.</I> They shall not be left destitute of those 
 instructions in the way of truth which are necessary to keep them from 
 destroying error, and those directions in the way of duty which are 
 necessary to keep them from damning sin. They shall have the <I>light 
 of life,</I> that knowledge and enjoyment of God which will be to them 
 the light of spiritual life in this world and of everlasting life in 
 the other world, where there will be no death nor darkness. Follow 
 Christ, and we shall undoubtedly be happy in both worlds. Follow 
 Christ, and we shall follow him to heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The objection which the Pharisees made against this doctrine, and 
 it was very trifling and frivolous: <I>Thou bearest record of thyself; 
 thy record is not true,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 In this objection they went upon the suspicion which we commonly have 
 of men's self-condemnation, which is concluded to be the native 
 language of self-love, such as we are all ready to condemn in others, 
 but few are willing to own in themselves. But in this case the
 objection was very unjust, for, 

 1. They made that his crime, and a diminution to the credibility of his 
 doctrine, which in the case of one who introduced a divine revelation 
 was necessary and unavoidable. Did not Moses and all the prophets bear 
 witness of themselves when they avouched themselves to be God's 
 messengers? Did not the Pharisees ask John Baptist, <I>What sayest thou 
 of thyself?</I> 

 2. They overlooked the testimony of all the other witnesses, which 
 corroborated the testimony he bore of himself. Had he only borne record 
 of himself, his testimony had indeed been <I>suspicious,</I> and the 
 belief of it might have been <I>suspended;</I> but his doctrine was 
 attested by more than <I>two or three</I> credible <I>witnesses,</I> 
 enough to <I>establish every word</I> of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's reply to this objection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He does not retort upon them as he might ("You profess yourselves to be 
 devout and good men, but your witness is not <I>true</I>"), but
 plainly vindicates himself; and, though he had waived his own testimony

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:31"><I>ch.</I> v. 31</A>),

 yet here he abides by it, that it did not derogate from the credibility
 of his other proofs, but was necessary to show the force of them. He is 
 the light of the world, and it is the property of light to be 
 self-evidencing. First principles prove themselves. He urges three 
 things to prove that his testimony, though of himself, was true and 
 cogent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he was conscious to himself of his own authority, and 
 abundantly satisfied in himself concerning it. He did not speak as one 
 at uncertainty, nor propose a disputable notion, about which he himself 
 hesitated, but <I>declared a decree,</I> and gave such an account of 
 himself as he would <I>abide by: I know whence I came, and whither I 
 go.</I> He was fully apprised of his own undertaking from first to 
 last; knew whose errand he went upon, and what his success would be. He 
 knew what he <I>was</I> before his manifestation to the world, and what 
 he <I>should be</I> after; that he came <I>from the Father,</I> and was 
 going <I>to him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:28"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 28</A>),

 came <I>from glory,</I> and was going <I>to glory,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:5"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 5</A>).

 This is the satisfaction of all good Christians, that though the world
 know them not, as it knew him not, yet they know whence their spiritual 
 life comes, and whither it tends, and go upon sure grounds.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they are very incompetent judges of him, and of his doctrine, 
 and not to be regarded. 

 (1.) Because they were <I>ignorant,</I> willingly and resolvedly 
 <I>ignorant: You cannot tell whence I came, and whither I go.</I> To 
 what purpose is it to talk with those who know nothing of the matter, 
 nor desire to know? He had told them of his coming from heaven and 
 returning to heaven, but it was <I>foolishness to them,</I> they 
 <I>received it not;</I> it was what the <I>brutish man knows not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:6">Ps. xcii. 6</A>.

 They took upon them to judge of that which they did not understand,
 which lay quite out of the road of their acquaintance. Those that
 despise Christ's dominions and dignities speak evil of what they 
 <I>know not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:8,10">Jude, <I>v.</I> 8, 10</A>.

 (2.) Because they were <I>partial</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>You judge after the flesh.</I> When fleshly wisdom gives the rule of 
 judgment, and outward appearances only are given in evidence, and the 
 case decided according to them, then men <I>judge after the flesh;</I> 
 and when the consideration of a secular interest turns the scale in 
 judging of spiritual matters, when we judge in favour of that which 
 pleases the carnal mind, and recommends us to a carnal world, we judge 
 after the flesh; and the judgment cannot be right when the rule is 
 wrong. The Jews judged of Christ and his gospel by outward appearances, 
 and, because he appeared so mean, thought it impossible he should be 
 the light of the world; as if the sun under a cloud were no sun. 

 (3.) Because they were <I>unjust</I> and <I>unfair</I> towards him, 
 intimated in this: "<I>I judge no man;</I> I neither make nor meddle 
 with your political affairs, nor does my doctrine or practice at all 
 intrench upon, or interfere with, your civil rights or secular powers." 
 He thus <I>judged no man.</I> Now, if he did not <I>war after the 
 flesh,</I> it was very unreasonable for them to <I>judge him after the 
 flesh,</I> and to treat him as an offender against the civil 
 government. Or, "<I>I judge no man,</I>" that is, "not now in my first 
 coming, that is deferred till I come again,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:17"><I>ch.</I> iii. 17</A>.

 <I>Prima dispensatio Christi medicinalis est, non judicialis--The first
 coming of Christ was for the purpose of administering, not justice, but 
 medicine.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That his testimony of himself was sufficiently supported and 
 corroborated by the testimony of his Father <I>with him and for him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>And yet, if I judge, my judgment is true.</I> He did in his doctrine 
 judge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:39"><I>ch.</I> ix. 39</A>),

 though not <I>politically.</I> Consider him then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As a judge, and his own judgment was valid: "<I>If I judge,</I> I 
 who have authority to execute judgments, I to whom all things are 
 delivered, I who am the Son of God, and have the Spirit of God, if I 
 judge, <I>my judgment is true,</I> of incontestable rectitude and 
 uncontrollable authority, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:2">Rom. ii. 2</A>.

 <I>If</I> I <I>should judge,</I> my judgment must be true, and then you
 would be condemned; but the judgment-day is not yet come, you are not 
 yet to be condemned, but spared, and therefore now <I>I judge no 
 man;</I>" so Chrysostom. Now that which makes his judgment 
 unexceptionable is,

 [1.] His Father's concurrence with him: <I>I am not alone, but I and 
 the Father.</I> He has the Father's concurring <I>counsels</I> to 
 <I>direct;</I> as he was with the Father before the world in forming 
 the counsels, so the Father was with him in the world in prosecuting 
 and executing those counsels, and never left him <I>inops 
 consilii--without advice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:2">Isa. xi. 2</A>.

 All the <I>counsels of peace</I> (and of war too) <I>were between them 
 both,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:13">Zech. vi. 13</A>.

 He had also the Father's concurring power to authorize and confirm what 
 he did; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:21,Isa+42:1">Ps. lxxxix. 21, &c.; Isa. xlii. 1</A>.

 He did not act <I>separately,</I> but in his own name and his Father's, 
 and <I>by the authority aforesaid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:17,14:9,10"><I>ch.</I> v. 17, and xiv. 9, 10</A>.

 [2.] His Father's commission to him: "It is the Father that <I>sent
 me.</I>" Note, God will go along with those that he sends; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:10,12">Exod. iii. 10, 12</A>:

 <I>Come, and I will send thee,</I> and <I>certainly I will be with
 thee.</I> Now, if Christ had a <I>commission</I> from the Father, and 
 the Father's <I>presence</I> with him in all his administrations, no 
 doubt his <I>judgment</I> was <I>true</I> and valid; no exception lay 
 <I>against</I> it, no appeal lay <I>from</I> it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Look upon him as <I>a witness,</I> and now he appeared no 
 otherwise (having not as yet taken the throne of judgment), and as such 
 his testimony was true and unexceptionable; this he shows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>,

 where,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He quotes a maxim of the Jewish law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 That <I>the testimony of two men is true.</I> Not as if it were always 
 true <I>in itself,</I> for many a time hand has been joined in hand to 
 bear a <I>false</I> testimony,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:10">1 Kings xxi. 10</A>.

 But it is allowed as sufficient evidence upon which to ground a verdict
 (<I>verum dictum</I>), and if nothing appear to the contrary it is 
 taken for granted to be <I>true.</I> Reference is here had to that law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:6">Deut. xvii. 6</A>),

 <I>At the mouth of two witnesses shall he that is worthy of death be
 put to death.</I> And see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:15,Nu+35:30">Deut. ix. 15; Num. xxxv. 30</A>.

 It was in <I>favour of life</I> that in capital cases two witnesses wee
 required, as with us in case of treason. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:18">Heb. vi. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He applies this to the case in hand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me 
 bears witness of me.</I> Behold two witnesses! Though in human courts, 
 where two witnesses are required, the criminal or candidate is not 
 admitted to be a witness for himself; yet in a matter purely divine, 
 which can be proved only by a divine testimony, and God himself must be 
 the witness, if the formality of two or three witnesses be insisted on, 
 there can be no other than the eternal Father, the eternal Son of the 
 Father, and the eternal Spirit. Now if the testimony of two distinct 
 persons, that are <I>men,</I> and therefore may deceive or be deceived, 
 is conclusive, much more ought the testimony of the Son of God 
 concerning himself, backed with the testimony of his Father concerning 
 him, to command assent; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7,9-11">1 John v. 7, 9-11</A>.

 Now this proves not only that the Father and the Son are two distinct 
 persons (for their respective testimonies are here spoken of as the 
 testimonies of two several persons), but that these two are one, not
 only one in their testimony, but equal in power and glory, and 
 therefore the same in substance. St. Austin here takes occasion to 
 caution his hearers against Sabellianism on the one hand, which 
 confounded the persons in the Godhead, and Arianism on the other, which 
 denied the Godhead of the Son and Spirit. <I>Alius est filius, et alius 
 pater, non tamed aliud, sed hoc ipsum est et pater, et filius, scilicet 
 unus Deus est--The Son is one Person, and the Father is another; they 
 do not, however, constitute two Beings, but the Father is the same 
 Being that the Son is, that is, the only true God.</I> Tract. 36,
 <I>in</I> Joann. Christ here speaks of himself and the Father as 
 witnesses to the world, giving in evidence to the reason and conscience 
 of the children of men, whom he deals with as men. And these witnesses 
 <I>to</I> the world now will in the great day be witnesses 
 <I>against</I> those that persist in unbelief, and <I>their</I> word 
 will judge men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This was the sum of the first conference between Christ and these 
 carnal Jews, in the conclusion of which we are told how their tongues 
 were let loose, and their hands tied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> How their tongues were let loose (such was the malice of 
 hell) to cavil at his discourse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Though in what he said there appeared nothing of human policy or 
 artifice, but a divine security, yet they set themselves to <I>cross 
 questions</I> with him. None so incurably <I>blind</I> as those that 
 resolve they <I>will not see.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> How they evaded the <I>conviction</I> with a <I>cavil: Then 
 said they unto him, Where is thy Father?</I> They might easily have 
 understood, by the tenour of this and his other discourses, that when 
 he spoke of his <I>Father</I> he meant no other than God himself; yet 
 they pretend to understand him of a common person, and, since he 
 appeals to his testimony, they bid him <I>call his witness,</I> and 
 challenge him, if he can, to produce him: <I>Where is thy Father?</I> 
 Thus, as Christ said of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 they <I>judge after the flesh.</I> Perhaps they hereby intend a 
 reflection upon the meanness and obscurity of his family: <I>Where is 
 thy Father,</I> that he should be fit to give evidence in such a case 
 as this? Thus they turned it off with a taunt, when they <I>could not 
 resist the wisdom and spirit with which he spoke.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> How he evaded the <I>cavil</I> with a further
 <I>conviction;</I> he did not tell them where his Father was, but 
 charged them with wilful ignorance: "<I>You neither know me nor my 
 Father.</I> It is to no purpose to discourse to you about divine 
 things, who talk of them as blind men do of colours. Poor creatures! 
 you know nothing of the matter."

 (<I>a.</I>) He charges them with ignorance of God: "<I>You know not my 
 Father.</I>" In Judah was God known 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:1">Ps. lxxvi. 1</A>);

 they had some knowledge of him as the God that made the world, but 
 their eyes were darkened that they could not see the light of his glory 
 shining <I>in the face of Jesus Christ.</I> The <I>little children</I> 
 of the Christian church <I>know the Father,</I> know him as a Father 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:13">1 John ii. 13</A>);

 but these rulers of the Jews did not, because they would not so know 
 him.

 (<I>b.</I>) He shows them the true cause of their ignorance of God: 
 <I>If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.</I> The 
 reason why men are ignorant of God is because they are unacquainted 
 with Jesus Christ. Did we know Christ,

 [<I>a.</I>] In knowing him we should know the Father, of whose person 
 he is the express image,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:9"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 9</A>.

 Chrysostom proves hence the Godhead of Christ, and his equality with
 his Father. We cannot say, "He that knows a man knows an angel," or, 
 "He that knows a creature knows the Creator;" but he that knows Christ 
 knows the Father. 

 [<I>b.</I>] By him we should be instructed in the knowledge of God, and 
 introduced into an acquaintance with him. If we <I>knew Christ</I> 
 better, we should <I>know the Father</I> better; but, where the 
 Christian religion is slighted and opposed, natural religion will soon 
 be lost and laid aside. Deism makes way for atheism. Those become vain
 in their imaginations concerning God that will not learn of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> See how their hands were tied, though their tongues 
 were thus let loose; such was the power of Heaven to restrain the 
 malice of hell. <I>These words spoke Jesus,</I> these bold words, these 
 words of conviction and reproof, <I>in the treasury,</I> an apartment 
 of the temple, where, to be sure, the chief priests, whose gain was 
 their godliness, were mostly resident, attending the business of the 
 revenue. Christ <I>taught in the temple,</I> sometimes in one part, 
 sometimes in another, as he saw occasion. Now the priests who had so 
 great a concern in the temple, and looked upon it as their 
 <I>demesne,</I> might easily, with the assistance of the janizaries 
 that were at their beck, either have seized him and exposed him to the 
 rage of the mob, and that punishment which they called the <I>beating 
 of the rebels;</I> or, at least, have <I>silenced</I> him, and stopped 
 his mouth there, as Amos, though tolerated in the land of Judah, was 
 forbidden to prophesy in the king's chapel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+7:12,13">Amos, vii. 12, 13</A>.

 Yet even <I>in the temple,</I> where they had him in their reach, <I>no
 man laid hands on him,</I> for <I>his hour was not yet come.</I> See 
 here,

 1. The restraint laid upon his persecutors by an invisible power; none
 of them durst meddle with him. God can set bounds to the wrath of men, 
 as he does to the waves of the sea. Let us not therefore fear danger in 
 the way of duty; for God hath Satan and all his instruments in a chain.

 2. The reason of this restraint: <I>His hour was not yet come.</I> The 
 frequent mention of this intimates how much the time of our departure 
 out of the world depends upon the fixed counsel and decree of God. It 
 <I>will</I> come, it is coming; not yet come, but it is at hand. Our 
 enemies cannot hasten it any sooner, nor our friends delay it any 
 longer, than the time appointed of the Father, which is very 
 comfortable to every good man, who can look up and say with pleasure, 
 <I>My times are in thy hands;</I> and better there than in our own. His 
 hour was not yet come, because his work was not done, nor his testimony 
 finished. To all God's purposes <I>there is a time.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall
 seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot
 come.
 &nbsp; 22  Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,
 Whither I go, ye cannot come.
 &nbsp; 23  And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above:
 ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
 &nbsp; 24  I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins:
 for if ye believe not that I am <I>he,</I> ye shall die in your sins.
 &nbsp; 25  Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto
 them, Even <I>the same</I> that I said unto you from the beginning.
 &nbsp; 26  I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that
 sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I
 have heard of him.
 &nbsp; 27  They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
 &nbsp; 28  Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of
 man, then shall ye know that I am <I>he,</I> and <I>that</I> I do nothing
 of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
 &nbsp; 29  And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me
 alone; for I do always those things that please him.
 &nbsp; 30  As he spake these words, many believed on him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ here gives fair warning to the careless unbelieving Jews to 
 consider what would be the consequence of their infidelity, that they 
 might prevent it before it was too late; for he spoke words of terror 
 as well as words of grace. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The wrath threatened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Jesus said again unto them</I> that which might be likely to do them 
 good. He continued to teach, in kindness to those few who received his 
 doctrine, though there were many that resisted it, which is an example 
 to ministers to go on with their work, notwithstanding opposition, 
 because a remnant shall be saved. Here Christ changes his voice; he
 had <I>piped to them</I> in the offers of his grace, and they <I>had 
 not danced;</I> now he mourns to them in the denunciations of his 
 wrath, to try if they would lament. He said, <I>I go my way, and you 
 shall seek me, and shall die in your sins. Whither I go you cannot 
 come.</I> Every word is terrible, and bespeaks spiritual judgments, 
 which are the sorest of all judgments; worse than war, pestilence, and 
 captivity, which the Old-Testament prophets denounced. Four things are 
 here threatened against the Jews.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ's departure from them: <I>I go my way,</I> that is, "It shall 
 not be long before I go; you need not take so much pains to drive me 
 from you, I shall go of myself." They said to him, <I>Depart from us, 
 we desire not the knowledge of thy ways;</I> and he takes them at their 
 word; but woe to those from whom Christ departs. Ichabod, the glory is 
 gone, our defence is departed, when Christ goes. Christ frequently 
 warned them of his departure before he left them: he <I>bade often 
 farewell,</I> as one <I>loth to depart,</I> and willing to be invited, 
 and that would have them <I>stir up themselves to take hold on 
 him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their enmity to the true Messiah, and their fruitless and infatuated 
 enquiries after another Messiah when he was gone away, which were both 
 their sin and their punishment: <I>You shall seek me,</I> which 
 intimates either, 

 (1.) Their <I>enmity</I> to the <I>true Christ:</I> "You shall seek to 
 ruin my interest, by persecuting my doctrine and followers, with a 
 fruitless design to root them out." This was a continual vexation and 
 torment to themselves, made them incurably <I>ill-natured,</I> and 
 brought <I>wrath upon them</I> (God's and their own) <I>to the 
 uttermost.</I> Or, 

 (2.) Their <I>enquiries</I> after <I>false Christs:</I> "You shall 
 continue your expectations of the Messiah, and be the self-perplexing 
 seekers of a Christ to come, when he is already come;" like the 
 Sodomites, who, being struck with blindness, wearied themselves to find 
 the door. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:31,32">Rom. ix. 31, 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their final impenitency: <I>You shall die in your sins.</I> Here is 
 an error in all our English Bibles, even the old bishops' translation, 
 and that of Geneva (the Rhemists only excepted), for all the Greek 
 copies have it in the singular number, <B><I>en te hamartia 
 hymon</I></B>--<I>in your sin,</I> so all the Latin versions; and 
 Calvin has a note upon the difference between this and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>,

 where it is plural, <B><I>tais hamartiais</I></B>, that here it is 
 meant especially of the sin of unbelief, <I>in hoc peccato vestro--in 
 this sin of yours.</I> Note, Those that live in unbelief are for ever 
 undone if they die in unbelief. Or, it may be understood in general, 
 <I>You shall die in your iniquity,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:19,33:9">Ezek. iii. 19, and xxxiii. 9</A>.

 Many that have long lived in sin are, through grace, saved by a timely
 repentance from <I>dying in sin;</I> but for those who go out of this 
 world of probation into that of retribution under the guilt of sin 
 unpardoned, and the power of sin unbroken, there remaineth no relief: 
 salvation itself cannot save them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:11,Eze+32:27">Job xx. 11; Ezek. xxxii. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Their eternal separation from Christ and all happiness in him: 
 <I>Whither I go you cannot come.</I> When Christ left the world, he 
 went to a state of perfect happiness; he went to paradise. Thither he 
 took the penitent thief with him, that did not die in his sins; but the 
 impenitent not only <I>shall not</I> come to him, but they 
 <I>cannot;</I> it is morally impossible, for heaven would not be heaven 
 to those that die unsanctified and unmeet for it. You cannot come, 
 because you have <I>no right</I> to enter into that Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:14">Rev. xxii. 14</A>.

 <I>Whither I go you cannot come,</I> to fetch me thence, so Dr.
 Whitby; and the same is the comfort of all good Christians, that, when 
 they get to heaven, they will be out of the reach of their enemies' 
 malice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The jest they made of this threatening. Instead of trembling at 
 this word, they bantered it, and turned it into ridicule 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 
 <I>Will he kill himself?</I> See here, 

 1. What slight thoughts they had of Christ's threatenings; they could 
 make themselves and one another merry with them, as those that mocked 
 the messengers of the Lord, and turned the <I>burden of the word of the 
 Lord</I> into a <I>by-word,</I> and <I>precept upon precept, line upon 
 line,</I> into a merry song,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:13">Isa. xxviii. 13</A>.

 But <I>be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong.</I>

 2. What ill thoughts they had of Christ's meaning, as if he had an
 inhuman design upon his own life, to avoid the indignities done him, 
 like Saul. This is indeed (say they) to go whither we cannot follow 
 him, for we will never <I>kill ourselves.</I> Thus they make him not 
 only such a one as themselves, but worse; yet in the calamities brought 
 by the Romans upon the Jews many of them in discontent and despair did 
 kill themselves. They had put a much more favourable construction upon 
 this word of his

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:34,35"><I>ch.</I> vii. 34, 35</A>):

 <I>Will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles?</I> But see how
 indulged malice grows more and more malicious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The confirmation of what he had said.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He had said, <I>Whither I go you cannot come,</I> and here he gives 
 the reason for this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>You are from beneath, I am from above; you are of this world, I am 
 not of this world.</I> You are <B><I>ek ton kato</I></B>--<I>of those 
 things which are beneath;</I> noting, not so much their rise from 
 beneath as their affection to these lower things: "You are <I>in with 
 these things,</I> as those that belong to them; how can you come where 
 I go, when your spirit and disposition are so directly contrary to 
 mine?" See here, 

 (1.) What the <I>spirit of the Lord Jesus</I> was--not of <I>this 
 world,</I> but from <I>above.</I> He was perfectly dead to the wealth 
 of the world, the ease of the body, and the praise of men, and was 
 wholly taken up with divine and heavenly things; and none shall be with 
 him but those who are <I>born from above</I> and have their 
 <I>conversation in heaven.</I> 

 (2.) How contrary to this <I>their</I> spirit was: "<I>You are from 
 beneath,</I> and of this world." The Pharisees were of a carnal worldly 
 spirit; and what communion could Christ have with them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He had said, <I>You shall die in your sins,</I> and here he stand to 
 it: "Therefore I said, You shall die in your sins, because <I>you are 
 from beneath;</I>" and he gives this further reason for it, <I>If you 
 believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 See here,

 (1.) What we are required to believe: <I>that I am he,</I> <B><I>hoti 
 ego eimi</I></B>--<I>that I am,</I> which is one of God's names, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:14">Exod. iii. 14</A>.

 It was the Son of God that there said, <I>Ehejeh asher Ehejeh--I will
 be what I will be;</I> for the deliverance of Israel was but a figure 
 of good things to come, but now he saith, "<I>I am he;</I> he that 
 should come, he that you expect the Messias to be, that you would have 
 me to be to you. I am more than the bare name of the Messiah; I do not 
 only call myself so, but I <I>am he.</I>" True faith does not 
 <I>amuse</I> the soul with an empty sound of words, but <I>affects</I> 
 it with the doctrine of Christ's mediation, as a real thing that has 
 real effects.

 (2.) How necessary it is that we believe this. If we have not this 
 faith, <I>we shall die in our sins;</I> for the matter is so settled 
 that without this faith,

 [1.] We cannot be saved from the power of sin while we live, and 
 therefore shall certainly continue in it to the last. Nothing but the 
 <I>doctrine</I> of Christ's grace will be an argument powerful enough, 
 and none but the <I>Spirit</I> of Christ's grace will be an agent 
 powerful enough, to turn us from sin to God; and that Spirit is given, 
 and that doctrine given, to be effectual to those only who believe in 
 Christ: so that, if Satan be not by faith dispossessed, he has a lease 
 of the soul for its life; if Christ do not cure us, our case is 
 desperate, and we shall <I>die in our sins.</I> 

 [2.] Without faith we cannot be saved from the punishment of sin when 
 we die, for the <I>wrath of God remains</I> upon them that believe not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:16">Mark xvi. 16</A>.

 Unbelief is the damning sin; it is a sin against the remedy. Now this
 implies the great gospel promise: <I>If we believe that Christ is 
 he,</I> and receive him accordingly, <I>we shall not die in our 
 sins.</I> The law saith absolutely to all, as Christ said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 <I>You shall die in your sins,</I> for we are all guilty before God; 
 but the gospel is a defeasance of the obligation upon condition of 
 believing. The curse of the law is vacated and annulled to all that 
 submit to the grace of the gospel. Believers die in Christ, in his 
 love, in his arms, and so are saved from dying <I>in their 
 sins.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is a further discourse concerning <I>himself,</I> occasioned 
 by his requiring faith in himself as the condition of salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:25-29"><I>v.</I> 25-29</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The question which the Jews put to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>Who art thou?</I> This they asked tauntingly, and not with any 
 desire to be instructed. He had said, You must believe that <I>I am
 he.</I> By his not saying expressly who he was, he plainly intimated 
 that in his person he was such a one as could not be <I>described</I> 
 by any, and in his office such a one as was <I>expected</I> by all that 
 looked for redemption in Israel; yet this awful manner of speaking, 
 which had so much significancy in it, they turned to his reproach, as 
 if he knew not what to say of himself: "<I>Who art thou,</I> that we 
 must with an implicit faith believe in thee, that thou art some mighty 
 HE, we know not <I>who</I> or <I>what,</I> nor are <I>worthy to 
 know?</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His answer to this question, wherein he directs them three ways for 
 information:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He refers them to <I>what he had said</I> all along: "Do you ask 
 who I am? <I>Even the same that I said unto you from the 
 beginning.</I>" The original here is a little intricate, <B><I>ten 
 archen ho ti kai lalo hymin</I></B> which some read thus: <I>I am the 
 beginning, which also I speak unto you.</I> So Austin takes it. Christ 
 is called <B><I>Arche</I></B>--<I>the beginning</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:18,Re+1:8,21:6,Re+3:14">Col. i. 18; Rev. i. 8; xxi. 6; iii. 14</A>),
 
 and so it agrees with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>,

 <I>I am he.</I> Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:4">Isa. xli. 4</A>:

 <I>I am the first, I am he.</I> Those who object that it is the 
 accusative case, and therefore not properly answering to <B><I>tis 
 ei</I></B>, must undertake to construe by grammar rules that parallel 
 expression, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:8">Rev. i. 8</A>,

 <B><I>ho en</I></B>. But most interpreters agree with our version, Do
 you ask <I>who I am?</I>

 [1.] I am <I>the same that I said to you from the beginning</I> of time 
 in the scriptures of the Old-Testament, the same that from the 
 beginning was said to be <I>the Seed of the woman, that should break 
 the serpent's head,</I> the same that in all the ages of the church was 
 the Mediator of the covenant, and the faith of the patriarchs. 

 [2.] <I>From the beginning</I> of my public ministry. The account he 
 had already given of himself he resolved to <I>abide by;</I> he had 
 declared himself to be the <I>Son of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:17"><I>ch.</I> v. 17</A>),
 
 to be the Christ
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:26"><I>ch.</I> iv. 26</A>),

 and the bread of life, and had proposed himself as the object of that
 faith which is necessary to salvation, and to this he refers them for 
 an answer to their question. Christ is <I>one with himself;</I> what he 
 had said from the beginning, he saith still. His is an <I>everlasting 
 gospel.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He refers them to his Father's judgment, and the instructions he 
 had from him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>I have many things,</I> more than you think of, <I>to say, and</I> 
 in them <I>to judge of you.</I> But why should I trouble myself any 
 further with you? I know very well that <I>he who sent me is true,</I> 
 and will stand by me, and bear me out, for <I>I speak to the world</I> 
 (to which I am sent as an ambassador) <I>those things,</I> all those 
 and those only, <I>which I have heard of him.</I>" Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He suppresses his accusation of them. He had <I>many things</I> to 
 charge them with, and many evidences to produce against them; but for 
 the present he had said enough. Note, Whatever discoveries of sin are 
 made to us, he that searches the heart has still more to judge of us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:20">1 John iii. 20</A>.

 How much soever God reckons with sinners in this world there is still a
 further reckoning yet behind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:34">Deut. xxxii. 34</A>.

 Let us learn hence not to be forward to say all we can say, even
 against the worst of men; we may have many things to say, by way of 
 censure, which yet it is better to leave <I>unsaid,</I> for what is it 
 to us?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He enters his appeal against them to his Father: <I>He that sent 
 me.</I> Here two things comfort him:--<I>First,</I> That he had been 
 <I>true to his Father,</I> and to the trust reposed in him: <I>I speak 
 to the world</I> (for his gospel was to be preached to every creature) 
 <I>those things which I have heard of him.</I> Being given for a 
 <I>witness to the people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:4">Isa. lv. 4</A>),

 he was <I>Amen,</I> a <I>faithful witness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:14">Rev. iii. 14</A>.

 He did not <I>conceal</I> his doctrine, but spoke it <I>to the 
 world</I> (being of common concern, it was to be of common notice); nor 
 did he change or alter it, nor vary from the instructions he received 
 from him that sent him. <I>Secondly,</I> That his Father would be
 <I>true to him;</I> true to the promise that he would <I>make his mouth 
 like a sharp sword;</I> true to his purpose concerning him, which was a 
 <I>decree</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7">Ps. ii. 7</A>);

 true to the threatenings of his wrath against those that should reject 
 him. Though he should not <I>accuse</I> them to his Father, yet the 
 Father, who sent him, would undoubtedly reckon with them, and would be 
 <I>true</I> to what he had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:19">Deut. xviii. 19</A>),

 that whosoever would not hearken to that prophet whom God would raise 
 up <I>he would require it of him.</I> Christ would not accuse them; 
 "for," saith he, "he that sent me is true, and will pass judgment on 
 them, though I should not demand judgment against them." Thus, when he 
 <I>lets fall</I> the present prosecution, he <I>binds them over</I> to 
 the judgment-day, when it will be too late to dispute what they will 
 not now be persuaded to believe. <I>I, as a deaf man, heard not; for 
 thou wilt hear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:13,15">Ps. xxxviii. 13, 15</A>.

 Upon this part of our Saviour's discourse the evangelist has a 
 melancholy remark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.</I> See
 here, 

 1. The power of Satan to blind the minds of those who believe not.
 Though Christ spoke so plainly of God as his Father in heaven, yet they 
 did not understand whom he meant, but thought he spoke of some father 
 he had in Galilee. Thus the plainest things are riddles and parables to 
 those who are resolved to hold fast their prejudices; day and night are 
 alike to the blind. 

 2. The reason why the threatenings of the word make so little 
 impression upon the minds of sinners; it is because they understand not 
 whose the wrath is that is revealed in them. When Christ told them of 
 the truth of him that sent him, as a warning to them to prepare for his 
 judgment, which is <I>according to truth,</I> they slighted the 
 warning, because they understood not to whose judgment it was that they 
 made themselves obnoxious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He refers them to <I>their own convictions</I> hereafter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.

 He finds they will not understand him, and therefore adjourns the trial 
 till further evidence should come in; they that <I>will not see shall 
 see,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:11">Isa. xxvi. 11</A>.
 
 Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>What</I> they should ere long be <I>convinced of: "You shall 
 know that I am he,</I> that Jesus is the true Messiah. Whether you will 
 own it or no before men, you shall be made to know it in your own 
 consciences, the convictions of which, though you may <I>stifle,</I> 
 yet you cannot <I>baffle: that I am he,</I> not that you represent me 
 to be, but he that I preach myself to be, he that should come!" Two 
 things they should be convinced of, in order to this:--<I>First,</I> 
 That he did nothing <I>of himself,</I> not of himself as man, of 
 himself alone, of himself without the Father, with whom he was 
 <I>one.</I> He does not hereby derogate from his own inherent power, 
 but only denies their charge against him as a <I>false prophet;</I> for 
 of false prophets it is said that they prophesied <I>out of their own 
 hearts,</I> and followed <I>their own spirits. Secondly,</I> That as 
 <I>his Father taught him</I> so he <I>spoke these things,</I> that he 
 was not <B><I>autodidaktos</I></B>--<I>self-taught,</I> but 
 <B><I>Theodidaktos</I></B>--<I>taught of God.</I> The doctrine he 
 preached was the counterpart of the counsels of God, with which he was 
 intimately acquainted; <B><I>kathos edidaxe, tauta lalo</I></B>--I
 speak those things, not only <I>which</I> he taught me, but <I>as</I> 
 he taught me, with the same divine power and authority.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>When</I> they should be convinced of this: <I>When you have 
 lifted up the Son of man,</I> lifted him up upon the cross, as the 
 brazen serpent upon the pole 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:14"><I>ch.</I> iii. 14</A>),

 as the sacrifices under the law (for Christ is the great sacrifice),
 which, when they were offered, were said to be <I>elevated,</I> or 
 <I>lifted up;</I> hence the burnt-offerings, the most ancient and 
 honourable of all, were called <I>elevations</I> (<I>Gnoloth</I> from 
 <I>Gnolah, asendit--he ascended</I>), and in many other offerings they 
 used the significant ceremony of <I>heaving</I> the sacrifice up, and 
 <I>moving</I> it before the Lord; thus was Christ <I>lifted up.</I> Or 
 the expression denotes that his death was his exaltation. They that put 
 him to death thought thereby for ever to have <I>sunk</I> him and his 
 interest, but it proved to be the advancement of both,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:24"><I>ch.</I> xii. 24</A>.

 When the Son of man was <I>crucified,</I> the Son of man was
 <I>glorified.</I> Christ had called his dying his <I>going away;</I> 
 here he calls it his being lifted <I>up;</I> thus the death of the 
 saints, as it is their departure out of this world, so it is their 
 advancement to a better. Observe, He speaks of those he is now talking
 with as the <I>instruments</I> of his death: when <I>you have lifted up 
 the Son of man;</I> not that they were to be the <I>priests</I> to 
 offer him up (no, that was his own act, he <I>offered up himself</I>), 
 but they would be his betrayers and murderers; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>.

 They <I>lifted him up</I> to the cross, but then he lifted up himself 
 to his Father. Observe with what tenderness and mildness Christ here
 speaks to those who he certainly knew would put him to death, to teach 
 us not to hate or seek the hurt of any, though we may have reason to 
 think they hate us and seek our hurt. Now, Christ speaks of his death 
 as that which would be a powerful conviction of the infidelity of the 
 Jews. <I>When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you
 know</I> this. And why then? <I>First,</I> Because careless and 
 unthinking people are often taught the worth of mercies by the want of 
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:22">Luke xvii. 22</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> The guilt of their sin in putting Christ to death
 would so awaken their consciences that they would be put upon serious 
 enquiries after a Saviour, and then would know that Jesus was he who 
 alone could save them. And so it proved, when, being told that with 
 wicked hands they had <I>crucified and slain</I> the Son of God, they 
 cried out, <I>What shall we do?</I> and were made to know assuredly 
 that this Jesus was <I>Lord and Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:36">Acts ii. 36</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> There would be such signs and wonders attending his 
 death, and the <I>lifting of him up</I> from death in his resurrection, 
 as would give a stronger proof of his being the Messiah than any that 
 had been yet given: and multitudes were hereby brought to believe that 
 Jesus is the Christ, who had before contradicted and opposed him.
 <I>Fourthly,</I> By the death of Christ the pouring out of the Spirit 
 was purchased, who would convince the world that <I>Jesus is he,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:7,8"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 7, 8</A>.
 
 <I>Fifthly,</I> The judgments which the Jews brought upon themselves,
 by putting Christ to death, which filled up the measure of their 
 iniquity, were a sensible conviction to the most hardened among them 
 that <I>Jesus was he.</I> Christ had often foretold that desolation as 
 the just punishment of their invincible unbelief, and <I>when it came 
 to pass (lo, it did come</I>) they could not but know that the great 
 <I>prophet had been among them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:33">Ezek. xxxiii. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] What supported our Lord Jesus in the mean time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>He that sent me is with me,</I> in my whole undertaking; <I>for the 
 Father</I> (the fountain and first spring of this affair, from whom as 
 its great cause and author it is derived) <I>hath not left me 
 alone,</I> to manage it myself, hath not deserted the business nor me 
 in the prosecution of it, for <I>do I always those things that please 
 him.</I> Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The assurance which Christ had of his Father's 
 <I>presence</I> with him, which includes both a divine <I>power</I> 
 going along with him to <I>enable</I> him for his work, and a divine 
 <I>favour</I> manifested to him to <I>encourage</I> him in it. <I>He 
 that sent me is with me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1,Ps+89:21">Isa. xlii. 1; Ps. lxxxix. 21</A>.

 This greatly <I>emboldens</I> our faith in Christ and our reliance upon 
 his word that he had, and knew he had, his Father with him, to 
 <I>confirm the word of his servant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xliv. 26</A>.

 The King of kings accompanied his own ambassador, to attest his mission 
 and assist his management, and <I>never left him alone,</I> either 
 solitary or weak; it also <I>aggravated</I> the wickedness of those 
 that opposed him, and was an intimation to them of the <I>premunire</I> 
 they ran themselves into by resisting him, for thereby they were found 
 <I>fighters against God.</I> How easily soever they might think to 
 crush him and run him down, let them know he had one to back him with 
 whom it is the greatest madness that can be to <I>contend.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The ground of this assurance: <I>For I do always those
 things that please him.</I> That is,

 1. That great affair in which our Lord Jesus was <I>continually</I> 
 engaged was an affair which the <I>Father that sent him</I> was highly 
 <I>well pleased with.</I> His whole undertaking is called the 
 <I>pleasure of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10">Isa. liii. 10</A>),
 
 because of the counsels of the eternal mind about it, and the 
 complacency of the eternal mind in it. 

 2. His management of that affair was in nothing <I>displeasing</I> to 
 his Father; in executing his commission he punctually observed all his 
 instructions, and did in nothing vary from them. No mere man since the 
 fall could say such a word as this (for <I>in many things we offend 
 all</I>) but our Lord Jesus never offended his Father in any thing, 
 but, as became him, he <I>fulfilled all righteousness.</I> This was 
 necessary to the validity and value of the sacrifice he was to offer 
 up; for if he had in any thing <I>displeased</I> the Father himself, 
 and so had had any sin of his own to answer for, the Father could not 
 have been pleased with him as a propitiation for our sins; but such a 
 priest and such a sacrifice became us as was perfectly pure and 
 spotless. We may likewise learn hence that God's servants may 
 <I>then</I> expect God's presence with them when they <I>choose</I> and 
 do <I>those things that please him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:4,5">Isa. lxvi. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is the good effect which this discourse of Christ's had upon 
 some of his hearers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>As he spoke these words many believed on him.</I> Note, 

 1. Though multitudes perish in their unbelief, yet there is a remnant 
 according to the election of grace, who <I>believe to the saving of the 
 soul.</I> If Israel, the whole body of the people, <I>be not 
 gathered,</I> yet there are those of them in whom Christ will be 
 <I>glorious,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:5">Isa. xlix. 5</A>.

 This the apostle insists upon, to reconcile the Jews' rejection with 
 the <I>promises made unto their fathers.</I> There is a remnant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:5">Rom. xi. 5</A>.

 2. The words of Christ, and particularly his <I>threatening</I> words,
 are made effectual by the grace of God to bring in poor souls to 
 believe in him. When Christ told them that if they <I>believed not</I> 
 they should <I>die in their sins,</I> and never get to heaven, they 
 thought it was time to look about them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:16,18">Rom. i. 16, 18</A>.

 3. Sometimes there is a <I>wide door opened,</I> and an
 <I>effectual</I> one, even where they are <I>many adversaries.</I> 
 Christ will carry on his work, though <I>the heathen rage.</I> The 
 gospel sometimes gains great victories where it meets with great 
 opposition. Let this encourage God's ministers to preach the gospel, 
 though it be with <I>much contention,</I> for they shall not <I>labour 
 in vain.</I> Many may be <I>secretly</I> brought home to God by those 
 endeavours which are openly contradicted and cavilled at by men of 
 corrupt minds. Austin has an affectionate ejaculation in his lecture 
 upon these words: <I>Utinam et, me loquenti, multi credant; non in me, 
 sed mecum in eo--I wish that when I speak, many may believe, not on me, 
 but with me on him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A comfortable doctrine laid down concerning the <I>spiritual 
 liberty</I> of Christ's disciples, intended for the encouragement of 
 <I>those</I> Jews <I>that believed.</I> Christ, knowing that his 
 doctrine began to work upon some of his hearers, and perceiving that 
 virtue had gone out of him, turned his discourse from the proud 
 Pharisees, and addressed himself to those <I>weak</I> believers. When 
 he had denounced wrath against those that were hardened in unbelief, 
 then he spoke comfort to those few feeble <I>Jews that believed in 
 him.</I> See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How graciously the Lord Jesus looks to those that <I>tremble at his 
 word,</I> and are ready to receive it; he has something to say to those 
 who have hearing ears, and will not pass by those who set themselves in 
 his way, without speaking to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How carefully he cherishes the beginnings of grace, and meets those 
 that are coming towards him. These <I>Jews that believed</I> were yet 
 but <I>weak;</I> but Christ did not therefore cast them off, for he 
 <I>gathers the lambs in his arms.</I> When faith is in its infancy, he 
 has <I>knees</I> to <I>prevent it, breasts</I> for it to <I>suck,</I> 
 that it may not <I>die from the womb.</I> In what he said to them, we 
 have two things, which he saith to all that should at any time 
 believe:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The character of a true disciple of Christ: <I>If you continue in 
 my word, then are you my disciples indeed.</I> When they <I>believed on 
 him,</I> as the great prophet, they gave up themselves to be <I>his 
 disciples.</I> Now, at their entrance into his school, he lays down 
 this for a settled rule, that he would own none for his disciples but 
 those that <I>continued in his word.</I> 

 [1.] It is implied that there are many who profess themselves Christ's 
 disciples who are not his <I>disciples indeed,</I> but only in show and 
 name. 

 [2.] It highly concerns those that are not <I>strong in faith</I> to 
 see to it that they be <I>sound in the faith,</I> that, though not 
 disciples of the highest form, they are nevertheless <I>disciples 
 indeed.</I> 

 [3.] Those who seem willing to be Christ's disciples ought to be told 
 that they had as good never come to him, unless they come with a 
 resolution by his grace to abide by him. Let those who have thoughts of 
 covenanting with Christ have no thoughts of reserving a power of 
 revocation. Children are sent to school, and bound apprentices, only
 for a <I>few years;</I> but those only are Christ's who are willing to 
 be bound to him <I>for the term of life.</I> 

 [4.] Those only that <I>continue in Christ's word</I> shall be accepted 
 as his <I>disciples indeed,</I> that adhere to his word in every 
 instance without partiality, and abide by it to the end without 
 apostasy. It is <B><I>menein</I></B>--<I>to dwell</I> in Christ's word, 
 as a man does at home, which is his centre, and rest, and refuge. Our 
 converse with the word and conformity to it must be constant. If we 
 continue disciples to the last, then, and not otherwise, we approve 
 ourselves <I>disciples indeed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The privilege of a true disciple of Christ. Here are two precious 
 promises made to those who thus approve themselves disciples indeed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] "<I>You shall know the truth,</I> shall know all that truth which 
 it is needful and profitable for you to know, and shall be more 
 confirmed in the belief of it, shall know the certainty of it." Note, 
 <I>First,</I> Even those who are true believers, and disciples indeed, 
 yet may be, and are, much in the dark concerning many things which they 
 should know. God's children are but children, and understand and speak 
 as children. Did we not need to be taught, we should not need to be 
 disciples. <I>Secondly,</I> It is a very great privilege to <I>know
 the truth,</I> to know the particular truths which we are to believe, 
 in their mutual dependences and connections, and the grounds and 
 reasons of our belief,--to know what is truth and what proves it to be 
 so. <I>Thirdly,</I> It is a gracious promise of Christ, to all who 
 continue in his word, that they shall know the truth as far as is 
 needful and profitable for them. Christ's scholars are sure to be well 
 taught.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>The truth shall make you free;</I> that is, <I>First,</I> The 
 truth which Christ teaches tends to make men free, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1">Isa. lxi. 1</A>.
 
 Justification makes us free from the guilt of sin, by which we were 
 <I>bound over</I> to the judgment of God, and <I>bound under</I> 
 amazing fears; sanctification makes us free from the bondage of 
 corruption, by which we were <I>restrained</I> from that service which 
 is perfect freedom, and <I>constrained</I> to that which is perfect 
 slavery. Gospel truth frees us from the yoke of the ceremonial law, and 
 the more grievous burdens of the traditions of the elders. It makes us 
 <I>free from</I> our spiritual enemies, free <I>in</I> the service of 
 God, free <I>to</I> the privileges of sons, and free <I>of</I> the 
 Jerusalem which is from above, which is free. <I>Secondly,</I> The 
 knowing, entertaining, and believing, of this truth does actually 
 <I>make us free,</I> free from prejudices, mistakes, and false notions, 
 than which nothing more <I>enslaves</I> and <I>entangles</I> the soul, 
 free from the dominion of lust and passion; and restores the soul to 
 the government of itself, by reducing it into obedience to its Creator. 
 The mind, by admitting the truth of Christ in the light and power, is 
 vastly enlarged, and has scope and compass given it, is greatly 
 elevated and raised above things of sense, and never acts with so true 
 a liberty as when it acts under a divine command, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:17">2 Cor. iii. 17</A>.

 The enemies of Christianity pretend to <I>free thinking,</I> whereas
 really those are the freest reasonings that are guided by faith, and 
 those are men of <I>free thought</I> whose thoughts are captivated and 
 brought into obedience to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The offence which the carnal Jews took at this doctrine, and their 
 objection against it. Though it was a doctrine that brought glad 
 tidings of liberty to the captives, yet they cavilled at it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 The Pharisees grudged this comfortable word to those that believed, the 
 standers by, who had <I>no part nor lot in this matter;</I> they 
 thought themselves reflected upon and affronted by the gracious charter 
 of liberty granted to those that believed, and therefore with a great 
 deal of pride and envy they answered him, "<I>We Jews are Abraham's 
 seed,</I> and therefore are <I>free-born,</I> and have not lost our 
 birthright-freedom; <I>we were never in bondage to any man; how sayest 
 thou then,</I> to us <I>Jews, You shall be made free?</I>" See 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What it was that they were grieved at; it was an <I>innuendo</I> in 
 those words, <I>You shall be made free,</I> as if the Jewish church and 
 nation were in some sort of bondage, which reflected on the Jews in 
 general, and as if all that did not believe in Christ continued in that 
 bondage, which reflected on the Pharisees in particular. Note, The 
 privileges of the faithful are the envy and vexation of unbelievers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:10">Ps. cxii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What it was that they alleged against it; whereas Christ intimated 
 that they needed to be made free, they urge, 

 (1.) "We are Abraham's seed, and Abraham was a <I>prince and a great 
 man;</I> though we live in Canaan, we are not descended from Canaan, 
 nor under his doom, <I>a servant of servants shall he be;</I> we hold 
 in <I>frank-almoign--free alms,</I> and not in <I>villenage--by a 
 servile tenure.</I>" It is common for a sinking decaying family to 
 boast of the glory and dignity of its ancestors, and to borrow honour 
 from that name to which they repay disgrace; so the Jews here did. But 
 this was not all. Abraham was in covenant with God, and his children by 
 his right, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:28">Rom. xi. 28</A>.

 Now that covenant, no doubt, was a free charter, and invested them with
 privileges not consistent with a state of slavery,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Rom. ix. 4</A>.

 And therefore they thought they had no occasion with so <I>great a
 sum</I> as they reckoned faith in Christ to be <I>to obtain this 
 freedom,</I> when they were thus free-born. Note, It is the common 
 fault and folly of those that have pious parentage and education to 
 trust to their privilege and boast of it, as if it would atone for the 
 want of real holiness. They were Abraham's seed, but what would this 
 avail them, when we find one in hell that could call Abraham father? 
 Saving benefits are not, like common privileges, conveyed by 
 <I>entail</I> to us and our issue, nor can a title to heaven be made by 
 <I>descent,</I> nor may we claim as <I>heirs at law,</I> by making out 
 our pedigree; our title is purely by purchase, not our own but our 
 Redeemer's for us, under certain provisos and limitations, which if we 
 do not observe it will not avail us to be Abraham's seed. Thus many, 
 when they are pressed with the necessity of regeneration, turn it off 
 with this, <I>We are the church's children;</I> but they are not all 
 Israel that are of Israel.

 (2.) <I>We were never in bondage to any man.</I> Now observe,

 [1.] How false this allegation was. I wonder how they could have the 
 assurance to say a thing in the face of a congregation which was so 
 notoriously <I>untrue.</I> Were not the seed of Abraham in bondage to 
 the Egyptians? Were they not often in bondage to the neighbouring 
 nations in the time of the judges? Were they not seventy years captives 
 in Babylon? Nay, were they not at this time tributaries to the Romans, 
 and, though not in a <I>personal,</I> yet in a <I>national</I> bondage 
 to them, and groaning to be made free? And yet, to confront Christ, 
 they have the impudence to say, <I>We were never in bondage.</I> Thus 
 they would expose Christ to the ill-will both of the Jews, who were 
 very jealous for the honour of their liberty, and of the Romans, who 
 would not be thought to enslave the nations they conquered.

 [2.] How foolish the application was. Christ had spoken of a liberty 
 wherewith the <I>truth</I> would make them free, which must be meant of 
 a <I>spiritual</I> liberty, for truth as it is the <I>enriching,</I> so 
 it is the <I>enfranchising</I> of the mind, and the <I>enlarging</I> of 
 that from the captivity of error and prejudice; and yet they plead 
 against the offer of <I>spiritual</I> liberty that they were never in 
 <I>corporal</I> thraldom, as if, because they were never in bondage to 
 any <I>man,</I> they were never in bondage to any <I>lust.</I> Note, 
 Carnal hearts are sensible of no other grievances than those that 
 molest the body and injure their secular affairs. Talk to them of 
 encroachments upon their civil liberty and property,--tell them of 
 waste committed upon their lands, or damage done to their houses,--and 
 they understand you very well, and can give you a sensible answer; the 
 thing touches them and affects them. But discourse to them of the 
 bondage of sin, a captivity to Satan, and a liberty by Christ,--tell 
 them of wrong done to their precious souls, and the hazard of their 
 eternal welfare,--and <I>you bring certain strange things to their 
 ears;</I> they say of it (as those did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:49">Ezek. xx. 49</A>),

 <I>Doth he not speak parables?</I> This was much like the blunder 
 Nicodemus made about being <I>born again.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Our Saviour's vindication of his doctrine from these objections, 
 and the further explication of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:34-37"><I>v.</I> 34-37</A>,

 where he does these four things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He shows that, notwithstanding their civil liberties and their
 visible church-membership, yet it was possible that they might be in a
 state of bondage 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>Whosoever commits sin,</I> though he be of Abraham's seed, and was 
 never in bondage to any man, is the servant of sin. Observe, Christ 
 does not upbraid them with the falsehood of their plea, or their 
 present bondage, but further explains what he had said for their 
 edification. Thus ministers should with meekness instruct those that 
 oppose them, that they may <I>recover themselves,</I> not with passion 
 provoke them to entangle themselves yet more. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The preface is very solemn: <I>Verily, verily, I say unto you;</I> 
 an awful asseveration, which our Saviour often used, to command a 
 reverent attention and a ready assent. The style of the prophets was, 
 <I>Thus saith the Lord,</I> for they were <I>faithful as servants;</I> 
 but Christ, being a Son, speaks in his own name: <I>I say unto you,</I> 
 I the <I>Amen,</I> the faithful witness; he pawns his veracity upon it. 
 "I say it to you, who boast of your relation to Abraham, as if that 
 would save you."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The truth is of universal concern, though here delivered upon a 
 particular occasion: <I>Whosoever commits sin is the servant of 
 sin,</I> and sadly needs to be made free. A state of sin is a state of 
 bondage. 

 [1.] See who it is on whom this brand is fastened--on him that 
 <I>commits sin,</I> <B><I>pas ho poion hamartian</I></B>--<I>every one 
 that makes sin.</I> There is not a <I>just man</I> upon earth, that 
 <I>lives, and sins not;</I> yet every one that sins is not a servant of 
 sin, for then God would have no servants; but he that <I>makes sin,</I> 
 that <I>makes choice</I> of sin, prefers the way of wickedness before 
 the way of holiness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:16,17">Jer. xliv. 16, 17</A>),--

 that <I>makes a covenant</I> with sin, enters into league with it, and 
 <I>makes a marriage</I> with it,--that <I>makes contrivances</I> of 
 sin, <I>makes provision</I> for the flesh, and devises iniquity,--and 
 that <I>makes a custom</I> of sin, who walks after the flesh, and 
 <I>makes a trade</I> of sin.

 [2.] See what the brand is which Christ fastens upon those that thus 
 <I>commit sin.</I> He stigmatizes them, gives them a mark of servitude.
 They are <I>servants of sin,</I> imprisoned under the guilt of sin, 
 under an arrest, in hold for it, <I>concluded under sin,</I> and they 
 are subject to the power of sin. He is a <I>servant of sin,</I> that 
 is, he makes himself so, and is so accounted; he has <I>sold himself to 
 work wickedness;</I> his lusts give law to him, he is at their beck, 
 and is not his own master. He does the work of sin, supports its 
 interest, and accepts its wages, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:16">Rom. vi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He shows them that, being in a state of bondage, their having a 
 place in the house of God would not entitle them to the inheritance of 
 sons; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>)

 <I>the servant,</I> though he be in the house for awhile, yet, being 
 but a <I>servant, abideth not in the house for ever.</I> Services (we 
 say) are no inheritances, they are but <I>temporary,</I> and not for a 
 <I>perpetuity; but the son</I> of the family abideth ever. Now, 

 (1.) This points primarily at the rejection of the Jewish church and 
 nation. Israel had been <I>God's son,</I> his <I>first-born;</I> but
 they wretchedly degenerated into a <I>servile</I> disposition, were 
 enslaved to the world and the flesh, and therefore, though by virtue of 
 their birthright they thought themselves secure of their church 
 membership, Christ tells them that having thus made themselves servants 
 they should not <I>abide in the house for ever.</I> Jerusalem, by 
 opposing the gospel of Christ, which proclaimed liberty, and adhering 
 to the Sinai-covenant, which gendered to bondage, after its term was 
 <I>expired</I> came to be <I>in bondage with her children</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:24,25">Gal. iv. 24, 25</A>),

 and therefore was unchurched and disfranchised, her charter seized and 
 taken away, and she was cast out as the son of the bond-woman, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:14">Gen. xxi. 14</A>.

 Chrysostom gives this sense of this place: "Think not to be made free
 from sin by the rites and ceremonies of the law of Moses, for Moses was 
 but a servant, and had not that perpetual authority in the church which 
 the Son had; but, if the Son make you free, it is well,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.
 
 But,

 (2.) It looks further, to the rejection of all that are the <I>servants
 of sin,</I> and receive not the <I>adoption</I> of the <I>sons of 
 God;</I> though those unprofitable servants may be in God's house 
 awhile, as retainers to his family, yet there is a day coming when the 
 children of the <I>bond-woman</I> and of the <I>free</I> shall be 
 distinguished. True believers only, who are the children of the promise 
 and of the covenant, are accounted free, and shall abide for ever in 
 the house, as Isaac: they shall have a <I>nail</I> in the holy place on 
 earth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:8">Ezra ix. 8</A>)
 
 and <I>mansions</I> in the holy place in heaven,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:2"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He shows them the way of deliverance out of the state of bondage 
 into the <I>glorious liberty of the children of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:21">Rom. viii. 21</A>.

 The case of those that are the servants of sin is sad, but thanks be to
 God it is not helpless, it is not hopeless. As it is the privilege of 
 all the sons of the family, and their dignity above the servants, that 
 they abide in the house for ever; so he who is <I>the Son,</I> the 
 first-born among many brethren, and the heir of all things, has a power 
 both of manumission and of adoption

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.</I> 
 Note,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Jesus Christ in the gospel offers us <I>our freedom;</I> he has 
 authority and power to <I>make free.</I> 

 [1.] To <I>discharge prisoners;</I> this he does <I>in 
 justification,</I> by making satisfaction for <I>our guilt</I> (on 
 which the gospel offer is grounded, which is to all a conditional 
 <I>act of indemnity,</I> and to all true believers, upon their 
 believing, an absolute <I>charter of pardon</I>), and for <I>our 
 debts,</I> for which we were by the law arrested and in execution. 
 Christ, as our surety, or rather our <I>bail</I> (for he was not 
 originally bound <I>with us,</I> but upon our insolvency bound <I>for 
 us</I>), compounds with the creditor, answers the demands of injured 
 justice with more than an <I>equivalent,</I> takes the <I>bond</I> and 
 <I>judgment</I> into his own hands, and gives them up <I>cancelled</I> 
 to all that by faith and repentance give him (if I may so say) a 
 <I>counter-security</I> to save his honour harmless, and so they are 
 <I>made free;</I> and from the debt, and every part thereof, they are 
 for ever acquitted, exonerated, and discharged, and a general release 
 is sealed of all actions and claims; while against those who refuse to 
 come up to these terms the securities lie still in the Redeemer's 
 hands, in full force. 

 [2.] He has a power to rescue <I>bond-slaves,</I> and this he does in 
 <I>sanctification;</I> by the powerful arguments of his gospel, and the 
 powerful operations of his Spirit, he breaks the power of corruption in 
 the soul, rallies the scattered forces of reason and virtue, and 
 fortifies God's interest against sin and Satan, and so the soul is made 
 free. 

 [3.] He has a power to <I>naturalize strangers and foreigners,</I> and 
 this he does in <I>adoption.</I> This is a further act of grace; we are 
 not only forgiven and healed, but <I>preferred;</I> there is a charter 
 of privileges as well as pardon; and thus the Son makes us free 
 <I>denizens</I> of the kingdom of priests, the holy nation, the new 
 Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Those whom Christ makes free are <I>free indeed.</I> It is not 
 <B><I>alethos</I></B>, the word used 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>)

 for disciples <I>indeed, but</I> <B><I>ontos</I></B>--<I>really.</I> It 
 denotes,

 [1.] The truth and certainty of the promise, the liberty which the Jews 
 boasted of was an <I>imaginary</I> liberty; they boasted of a <I>false 
 gift;</I> but the liberty which Christ gives is a certain thing, it is 
 real, and has real effects. The servants of sin promise themselves 
 liberty, and fancy themselves free, when they have broken religion's 
 bands asunder; but they cheat themselves. None are <I>free indeed</I> 
 but those whom Christ <I>makes free.</I> 

 [2.] It denotes the singular excellency of the freedom promised; it is 
 a freedom that deserves the name, in comparison with which all other 
 liberties are no better than slaveries, so much does it turn to the 
 honour and advantage of those that are <I>made free</I> by it. It is a 
 <I>glorious</I> liberty. It is that which <I>is</I> (so 
 <B><I>ontos</I></B> signifies); it is <I>substance</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:21">Prov. viii. 21</A>);
 
 while the things of the world are shadows, things that <I>are 
 not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He applies this to these unbelieving cavilling Jews, in answer to 
 their boasts of relation to Abraham 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 "<I>I know</I> very well <I>that you are Abraham's seed, but now you 
 seek to kill me,</I> and therefore have forfeited the honour of your 
 relation to Abraham, <I>because my word hath no place in you.</I>" 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The dignity of their extraction admitted: "<I>I know that you are 
 Abraham's seed,</I> every one knows it, and it is your honour." He 
 grants them what was true, and in what they said that was false (that 
 they were <I>never</I> in bondage to any) he does not <I>contradict</I> 
 them, for he studied to <I>profit</I> them, and not to <I>provoke</I> 
 them, and therefore said that which would please them: <I>I know that 
 you are Abraham's seed.</I> They boasted of their descent from 
 <I>Abraham,</I> as that which <I>aggrandized</I> their names, and made 
 them exceedingly honourable; whereas really it did but <I>aggravate</I> 
 their crimes, and make them exceedingly sinful. Out of their own mouths 
 will he judge vain-glorious hypocrites, who boast of their parentage 
 and education: "Are you Abraham's seed? Why then did you not tread in 
 the steps of his faith and obedience?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The inconsistency of their practice with this dignity: <I>But you 
 seek to kill me.</I> They had attempted it several times, and were now 
 designing it, which quickly appeared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>),

 when they <I>took up stones to cast at him.</I> Christ knows all the 
 wickedness, not only which men do, but which they seek, and design, and 
 endeavour to do. To seek to kill any innocent man is a crime black 
 enough, but to <I>compass and imagine</I> the death of him that was 
 King of kings was a crime the heinousness of which we want words to 
 express.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The reason of this inconsistency. Why were they that were 
 Abraham's seed so very inveterate against Abraham's promised seed, in 
 whom they and <I>all the families of the earth</I> should be 
 <I>blessed?</I> Our Saviour here tells them, It is because <I>my word 
 hath no place in you,</I> <B><I>ou chorei en hymin</I></B>, <I>Non 
 capit in vobis,</I> so the Vulgate. "My word <I>does not take with 
 you,</I> you have no inclination to it, no relish of it, other things 
 are more taking, more pleasing." Or, "It does not <I>take hold of 
 you,</I> it has no power over you, makes no impression upon you." Some 
 of the critics read it, <I>My word does not penetrate into you;</I> it 
 descended as the rain, but it came upon them as the rain upon the rock, 
 which it runs off, and did not soak into their hearts, as the rain upon 
 the ploughed ground. The Syriac reads it, "<I>Because you do not 
 acquiesce in my word;</I> you are not persuaded of the truth of it, nor 
 pleased with the goodness of it." Our translation is very significant: 
 <I>It has no place in you.</I> They <I>sought to kill him,</I> and so 
 effectually to <I>silence</I> him, not because he had done they any 
 harm, but because they could not bear the convincing, commanding power 
 of his word. Note, 

 [1.] The words of Christ ought to have a place in us, the innermost and 
 uppermost place,--a <I>dwelling</I> place, as a man at home, and not as 
 a stranger or sojourner,--a <I>working</I> place; it must have room to 
 operate, to work sin out of us, and to work grace in us; it must have a 
 <I>ruling</I> place, its place must be <I>upon the throne,</I> it must 
 dwell in us richly. 

 [2.] There are many that make a profession of religion in whom <I>the 
 word of</I> Christ has no place; they will not <I>allow</I> it a place, 
 for they do not like it; Satan does all he can to <I>displace</I> it; 
 and other things possess the place it should have in us. 

 [3.] Where the word of God has no place no good is to be expected, for 
 room is left there for all wickedness. If the unclean spirit find the 
 heart empty of Christ's word, he <I>enters in, and dwells 
 there.</I></P>

 that which ye have seen with your father.
 &nbsp; 39  They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father.
 Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do
 the works of Abraham.
 &nbsp; 40  But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the
 truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.
 &nbsp; 41  Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be
 not born of fornication; we have one Father, <I>even</I> God.
 &nbsp; 42  Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love
 me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of
 myself, but he sent me.
 &nbsp; 43  Why do ye not understand my speech? <I>even</I> because ye cannot
 hear my word.
 &nbsp; 44  Ye are of <I>your</I> father the devil, and the lusts of your
 father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and
 abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he
 speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the
 father of it.
 &nbsp; 45  And because I tell <I>you</I> the truth, ye believe me not.
 &nbsp; 46  Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth,
 why do ye not believe me?

 Here Christ and the Jews are still at issue; he sets himself to
 convince and convert them, while they still set themselves to
 contradict and oppose him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He here traces the difference between his sentiments and theirs to a 
 different rise and origin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>I speak that which I have seen with my Father,</I> and <I>you</I> do 
 <I>what you have seen with your father.</I> Here are two fathers spoken 
 of, according to the two families into which the sons of men are 
 divided--God and the devil, and without controversy these are contrary 
 the one to the other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ's <I>doctrine</I> was from <I>heaven;</I> it was 
 <I>copied</I> out of the <I>counsels</I> of infinite wisdom, and the 
 kind intentions of eternal love. 

 (1.) <I>I speak that which I have seen.</I> The discoveries Christ has 
 made to us of God and another world are not grounded upon guess and 
 hearsay, but upon ocular inspection; so that he was thoroughly 
 <I>apprized</I> of the nature, and <I>assured</I> of the truth, of all 
 he said. He that is given to be a witness to the people is an 
 eye-witness, and therefore unexceptionable. 

 (2.) It is what I have seen <I>with my Father.</I> The doctrine of 
 Christ is not a plausible hypothesis, supported by probable arguments, 
 but it is an exact counterpart of the incontestable truths lodged in 
 the eternal mind. It was not only what he had <I>heard from</I> his 
 Father, but what he had <I>seen with him</I> when <I>the counsel of 
 peace was between them both.</I> Moses spoke what he heard from God, 
 but he might not see the face of God; Paul had been in the third 
 heaven, but what he had seen there he could not, he must not, utter; 
 for it was Christ's prerogative to have <I>seen</I> what he 
 <I>spoke,</I> and to <I>speak</I> what he had <I>seen.</I></P>

 2. Their <I>doings</I> were from hell: "<I>You do that which you have 
 seen with your father.</I> You do, by your own works, father 
 yourselves, for it is evident whom you resemble, and therefore easy to 
 find out your origin." As a child that is trained up with his father 
 learns his father's words and fashions, and grows like him by an 
 affected imitation as well as by a natural image, so these Jews, by 
 their malicious opposition to Christ and the gospel, made themselves as 
 like the devil as if they had industriously set him before them for 
 their pattern.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He takes off and answers their vain-glorious boasts of relation to 
 Abraham and to God as their fathers, and shows the vanity and falsehood 
 of their pretensions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They pleaded relation to Abraham, and he replies to this plea. 
 <I>They said, Abraham is our father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 In this they intended,

 (1.) To do honour to themselves, and to make themselves look great.
 They had forgotten the mortification given them by that acknowledgement 
 prescribed them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:5">Deut. xxvi. 5</A>),

 <I>A Syrian ready to perish was my father;</I> and the charge exhibited 
 against their degenerate ancestors (whose steps they trod in, and not 
 those of the first founder of the family), <I>Thy father was an 
 Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:3">Ezek. xvi. 3</A>.

 As it is common for those families that are sinking and going to decay
 to boast most of their pedigree, so it is common for those churches 
 that are corrupt and depraved to value themselves upon their antiquity 
 and the eminence of their first planters. <I>Fuimus Troes, fuit 
 Ilium--We have been Trojans, and there once was Troy.</I>

 (2.) They designed to cast an odium upon Christ as if he reflected upon 
 the patriarch Abraham, in speaking of their father as one they had 
 learned evil from. See how they sought an occasion to quarrel with him.
 Now Christ overthrows this plea, and exposes the vanity of it by a 
 plain and cogent argument: "Abraham's children will do the works of 
 Abraham, but you do not do Abraham's works, therefore you are not 
 Abraham's children."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The proposition is plain: "<I>If you were Abraham's children,</I> 
 such children of Abraham as could claim an interest in the covenant 
 made with him and his seed, which would indeed put an honour upon you, 
 then you would <I>do the works of Abraham,</I> for to those only of 
 Abraham's house who <I>kept the way of the Lord,</I> as Abraham did, 
 would God <I>perform what he had spoken,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:19">Gen. xviii. 19</A>.

 Those only are reckoned the seed of Abraham, to whom the promise
 belongs, who <I>tread in the steps</I> of his faith and obedience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:12">Rom. iv. 12</A>.

 Though the Jews had their genealogies, and kept them exact, yet they
 could not by them make out their relation to Abraham, so as to take the 
 benefit of the old entail (<I>performam doni--according to the form of 
 the gift</I>), unless they walked in the same spirit; good women's 
 relation to Sarah is proved only by this--<I>whose daughters you are as 
 long as you do well,</I> and no longer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:6">1 Pet. iii. 6</A>.

 Note, Those who would approve themselves Abraham's seed must not only
 be of Abraham's faith, but do Abraham's works

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:21,22">James ii. 21, 22</A>),--

 must come at God's call, as he did,--must resign their dearest comforts 
 to him,--must be strangers and sojourners in this world,--must keep up 
 the worship of God in their families, and always walk before God in 
 their uprightness; for these were the works of Abraham.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The assumption is evident likewise: <I>But you do not do</I> the 
 works of Abraham, for <I>you seek to kill me, a man that has told you 
 the truth, which I have heard of God; this did not Abraham,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He shows them what their work was, their present work, 
 which they were now about; they <I>sought to kill him;</I> and three 
 things are intimated as an aggravation of their intention:--

 1. They were so <I>unnatural</I> as to seek the life of <I>a man,</I> a
 man like themselves, bone of their bone, and flesh of their flesh, who 
 had done them no harm, nor given them any provocation. You <I>imagine 
 mischief against a man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:3">Ps. lxii. 3</A>.

 2. They were so <I>ungrateful</I> as to seek the life of one who had
 <I>told them the truth,</I> had not only done them no injury, but had
 done them the greatest kindness that could be; had not only not imposed
 upon them with a lie, but had instructed them in the most necessary and
 important truths; <I>was he therefore become their enemy?</I> 

 3. They were so <I>ungodly</I> as to seek the life of one who told them
 the truth <I>which he had heard from God,</I> who was a messenger sent 
 from God to them, so that their attempt against him was <I>quasi 
 deicidium--an act of malice against God.</I> This was their work, and 
 they persisted in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He shows them that this did not become the children of 
 Abraham; for <I>this did not Abraham.</I> 

 1. "He did nothing like this." He was famous for his humanity, witness 
 his rescue of the captives; and for his piety, witness his obedience to 
 the heavenly vision in many instances, and some tender ones. Abraham 
 believed God; they were obstinate in unbelief: Abraham followed God; 
 they fought against him; so that he would be <I>ignorant of them, and 
 would not acknowledge them,</I> they were so unlike him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:16">Isa. lxiii. 16</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:15-17">Jer. xxii. 15-17</A>.

 2. "He would not have done thus if he had lived now, or I had lived
 then." <I>Hoc Abraham non fecisset--He would not have done this;</I> so 
 some read it. We should thus reason ourselves out of any way of 
 wickedness; would Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob have done so? We cannot 
 expect to be <I>ever with them,</I> if we be <I>never like 
 them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The conclusion follows of course 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 "Whatever your boasts and pretensions be, you are not Abraham's 
 children, but father yourselves upon another family 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>);

 there is <I>a father whose deeds you do,</I> whose spirit you are of, 
 and whom you resemble." He does not <I>yet</I> say plainly that he 
 means the devil, till they by their continued cavils forced him so to 
 explain himself, which teaches us to treat even bad men with civility 
 and respect, and not to be forward to say that <I>of</I> them, or 
 <I>to</I> them, which, though <I>true,</I> sounds <I>harsh.</I> He 
 tried whether they would suffer their own consciences to infer from 
 what he said that they were the devil's children; and it is better to 
 hear it from them now that we are called to <I>repent,</I> that is, to 
 change our father and change our family, by changing our spirit and 
 way, than to hear it from Christ in the great day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. So far were they from owning their unworthiness of relation to 
 Abraham that they pleaded relation to God himself as their Father: "We 
 are <I>not born of fornication,</I> we are not bastards, but legitimate 
 sons; <I>we have one Father, even God.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Some understand this literally. They were not the sons of the 
 bondwoman, as the Ishmaelites were; nor begotten in incest, as the 
 Moabites and Ammonites were 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:3">Deut. xxiii. 3</A>);

 nor were they a spurious brood in Abraham's family, but Hebrews of the 
 Hebrews; and, being born in <I>lawful</I> wedlock, they might call God 
 <I>Father,</I> who instituted that honourable estate in innocency; for 
 a legitimate seed, not tainted with divorces nor the plurality of 
 wives, is called a <I>seed of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:15">Mal. ii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Others take it figuratively. They begin to be aware now that 
 Christ spoke of a <I>spiritual</I> not a <I>carnal</I> father, of the 
 father of their religion; and so,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They deny themselves to be a generation of idolaters: "We are 
 <I>not born of fornication,</I> are not the children of idolatrous 
 parents, nor have been bred up in idolatrous worships." Idolatry is 
 often spoken of as spiritual <I>whoredom,</I> and idolaters as 
 <I>children of whoredoms,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:4,Isa+57:3">Hosea ii. 4; Isa. lvii. 3</A>.

 Now, if they meant that they were not the posterity of idolaters, the 
 allegation was false, for no nation was more addicted to idolatry than 
 the Jews before the captivity; if they meant no more than that they 
 themselves were not idolaters, what then? A man may be free from 
 idolatry, and yet perish in another iniquity, and be shut out of 
 Abraham's covenant. <I>If thou commit no idolatry</I> (apply it to this 
 spiritual fornication), yet if thou kill thou art become a 
 <I>transgressor</I> of the covenant. A rebellious prodigal son will be 
 disinherited, though he be not <I>born of fornication.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] They boast themselves to be true worshippers of the true God. We 
 have not many fathers, as the heathens had, <I>gods many and lords 
 many,</I> and yet were without God, as <I>filius populi--a son of the 
 people,</I> has many fathers and yet none certain; no, <I>the Lord our 
 God is one Lord</I> and <I>one Father,</I> and therefore it is well 
 with us. Note, Those flatter themselves, and put a damning cheat upon 
 their own souls, who imagine that their professing the true religion 
 and worshipping the true God will save them, though they worship not 
 God in spirit and in truth, nor are true to their profession. Now our 
 Saviour gives a full answer to this fallacious plea 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:42,43"><I>v.</I> 42, 43</A>),

 and proves, by two arguments, that they had no right to call God 
 Father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> They did not love Christ: <I>If God were your Father, you 
 would love me.</I> He had disproved their relation to Abraham by their 
 going about to kill him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 but here he disproves their relation to God by their not loving and 
 owning him. A man may pass for a <I>child</I> of Abraham if he do not 
 appear an enemy to Christ by gross sin; but he cannot approve himself a 
 child of God unless he be a faithful friend and follower of Christ. 
 Note, All that have God for their Father have a true love to Jesus 
 Christ, and esteem of his person, a grateful sense of his love, a 
 sincere affection to his cause and kingdom, a complacency in the 
 salvation wrought out by him and in the method and terms of it, and a 
 care to keep his commandments, which is the surest evidence of our love 
 to him. We are here in a state of probation, upon our trial how we will 
 conduct ourselves towards our Maker, and accordingly it will be with us 
 in the state of retribution. God has taken various methods to prove
 us, and this was one: he sent his Son into the world, with sufficient 
 proofs of his sonship and mission, concluding that all that called him 
 Father would <I>kiss his Son,</I> and bid <I>him</I> welcome who was 
 the first-born among many brethren; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:1">1 John v. 1</A>.

 By this our adoption will be proved or disproved--Did we love Christ,
 or no? <I>If any man do not,</I> he is so far from being a child of God 
 that he is <I>anathema,</I> accursed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+16:22">1 Cor. xvi. 22</A>.

 Now our Saviour proves that if they were God's children they would
 <I>love him;</I> for, saith he, I proceeded <I>forth and came from
 God.</I> They will love him; for, 

 1. He was the <I>Son of God: I proceeded forth from God.</I>
 <B><I>Exelthon</I></B> this means his divine <B><I>exeleusis</I></B>, 
 or origin from the Father, by the communication of the divine essence, 
 and also the union of the divine <B><I>logos</I></B> to his human 
 nature; so Dr. Whitby. Now this could not but recommend him to the 
 affections of all that were <I>born of God.</I> Christ is called the 
 <I>beloved,</I> because, being the beloved of the Father, he is 
 certainly the beloved of all the saints,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:6">Eph. i. 6</A>.

 2. He was <I>sent of God,</I> came from him as an ambassador to the
 world of mankind. He did not <I>come of himself,</I> as the false
 prophets, who had not either their <I>mission</I> or their 
 <I>message</I> from God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:21">Jer. xxiii. 21</A>.

 Observe the emphasis he lays upon this: <I>I came from God; neither
 came I of myself, but he sent me.</I> He had both his credentials and 
 his instructions from God; he came to <I>gather together in one the 
 children of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:51"><I>ch.</I> xi. 51</A>),
 
 to bring <I>many sons to glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10">Heb. ii. 10</A>.

 And would not all God's children embrace with both arms a messenger
 sent from their Father on <I>such</I> errands? But these Jews made it 
 appear that they were nothing akin to God, by their want of affection 
 to Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> They did not understand him. It was a sign they did 
 not belong to God's family that they did not understand the language 
 and dialect of the family: <I>You do not understand my speech</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>),

 <B><I>ten lalian ten emen</I></B>. Christ's speech was divine and 
 heavenly, but intelligible enough to those that were acquainted with 
 the voice of Christ in the Old Testament. Those that had made the word 
 of the Creator familiar to them needed no other key to the dialect of 
 the Redeemer; and yet these Jews make strange of the doctrine of 
 Christ, and find knots in it, and I know not what stumbling stones.
 Could a Galilean be known by his speech? An Ephraimite by his 
 <I>sibboleth?</I> And would any have the confidence to call God Father 
 to whom the Son of God was a barbarian, even when he spoke the will of 
 God in the words of the Spirit of God? Note, Those who are not 
 acquainted with the divine speech have reason to fear that they are 
 strangers to the divine nature. Christ spoke the words of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:34"><I>ch.</I> iii. 34</A>)

 in the dialect of the kingdom of God; and yet they, who pretended to
 belong to the kingdom, understood not the idioms and properties of it, 
 but like strangers, and rude ones too, ridiculed it. And the reason why 
 they did not understand Christ's speech made the matter much worse: 
 <I>Even because you cannot hear my word,</I> that is, "You cannot 
 persuade yourselves to hear it attentively, impartially, and without 
 prejudice, as it should be heard." The meaning of this <I>cannot</I> is 
 an obstinate <I>will not;</I> as the Jews could not hear Stephen 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:57">Acts vii. 57</A>)
 
 nor Paul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:22">Acts xxiii. 22</A>.

 Note, The rooted antipathy of men's corrupt hearts to the doctrine of 
 Christ is the true reason of their ignorance of it, and of their errors 
 and mistakes about it. They do not like it nor love it, and therefore 
 they will not understand it; like Peter, who pretended he <I>knew not 
 what the damsel said</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:70">Matt. xxvi. 70</A>),

 when in truth he knew not what to say to it. <I>You cannot hear my 
 words,</I> for you have <I>stopped your ears</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:4,5">Ps. lviii. 4, 5</A>),

 and God, in a way of righteous judgment, <I>has made your ears
 heavy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:10">Isa. vi. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Having thus disproved their relation both to Abraham and to God, 
 he comes next to tell them plainly whose children they were: <I>You are 
 of your father the devil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 If they were not God's children, they were the devil's, for God and 
 Satan divide the world of mankind; the devil is <I>therefore</I> said 
 to <I>work in the children of disobedience,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:2">Eph. ii. 2</A>.

 All wicked people are the devil's children, <I>children of Belial</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:15">2 Cor. vi. 15</A>),

 the serpent's seed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>),

 children of the wicked one,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:38">Matt. xiii. 38</A>.

 They partake of his nature, bear his image, obey his commands, and
 follow his example. Idolaters <I>said to a stock, Thou art our 
 father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:27">Jer. ii. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a high charge, and sounds very harsh and horrid, that any of 
 the children of men, especially the church's children, should be called 
 <I>children of the devil,</I> and therefore our Saviour fully proves 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By a general argument: <I>The lusts of your father you will do,</I> 
 <B><I>thelete poiein</I></B>. 

 (1.) "You <I>do</I> the devil's lusts, the lusts which he would have 
 you to fulfil; you gratify and please him, and comply with his 
 temptation, and are <I>led captive by him at his will:</I> nay, you do 
 those lusts which the devil himself fulfils." Fleshly lusts and worldly 
 lusts the devil tempts men to; but, being a spirit, he cannot fulfil 
 them himself. The peculiar lusts of the devil are <I>spiritual 
 wickedness;</I> the lusts of the intellectual powers, and their corrupt 
 reasonings; pride and envy, and wrath and malice; enmity to that which 
 is good, and enticing others to that which is evil; these are lusts 
 which the devil fulfils, and those who are under the dominion of these 
 lusts resemble the devil, as the child does the parent. The more there 
 is of contemplation, and contrivance, and secret complacency, in sin, 
 the more it resembles the <I>lusts of the devil.</I> 

 (2.) You <I>will do</I> the devil's lusts. The more there is of the 
 <I>will</I> in these lusts, the more there is of the devil in them. 
 When sin is committed <I>of choice</I> and not by surprise, with 
 <I>pleasure</I> and not with reluctancy, when it is persisted in with a 
 daring presumption and a desperate resolution, like theirs that said, 
 <I>We have loved strangers and after them we will go,</I> then the 
 sinner <I>will</I> do the devil's lusts. "The lusts of your father you 
 <I>delight to do;</I>" so Dr. Hammond; they are rolled under the tongue 
 as a sweet morsel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By two particular instances, wherein they manifestly resembled the 
 devil--<I>murder</I> and <I>lying.</I> The devil is an enemy to life, 
 because God is the God of life and life is the happiness of man; and an 
 enemy to truth, because God is the God of truth and truth is the bond 
 of human society.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He was <I>a murderer from the beginning,</I> not from his own 
 beginning, for he was created an angel of light, and had a first estate 
 which was pure and good, but from the beginning of his apostasy, which 
 was soon after the creation of man. He was 
 <B><I>anthropoktonos</I></B>--<I>homicida, a man-slayer.</I> 

 [1.] He was a <I>hater of man,</I> and so in affection an disposition a 
 murderer of him. He has his name, <I>Satan,</I> from 
 <I>sitnah--hatred.</I> He maligned God's image upon man, envied his 
 happiness, and earnestly desired his ruin, was an avowed enemy to the 
 whole race. 

 [2.] He was man's tempter to <I>that</I> sin which brought death into 
 the world, and so he was effectually the murderer of all mankind, which 
 in Adam had but <I>one neck.</I> He was a murderer of souls, 
 <I>deceived</I> them into sin, and by it <I>slew them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:11">Rom. vii. 11</A>),
 
 poisoned man with the forbidden fruit, and, to aggravate the matter, 
 made him his own murderer. Thus he was not only <I>at</I> the 
 beginning, but <I>from</I> the beginning, which intimates that thus he 
 <I>has been</I> ever since; as he began, so he continues, the murderer 
 of men by his temptations. The great tempter is the great destroyer.
 The Jews called the devil <I>the angel of death.</I> 

 [3.] He was the first wheel in the first murder that ever was committed 
 by Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:12">1 John iii. 12</A>.
 
 If the devil had not been very strong in Cain, he could not have done
 such an unnatural thing as to kill his own brother. Cain killing his 
 brother by the instigation of the devil, the devil is called the 
 <I>murderer,</I> which does not speak Cain's personal guilt the less, 
 but the devil's the more, whose torments, we have reason to think, will 
 be the greater, when the time comes, for all that wickedness into which 
 he has drawn men. See what reason we have to <I>stand</I> upon our 
 guard <I>against the wiles of the devil,</I> and never to hearken to 
 him (for he is a murderer, and certainly aims to do us mischief, even 
 when he <I>speaks fair</I>), and to wonder that he who is the murderer 
 of the children of men should yet be, by their own consent, so much 
 their master. Now herein these Jews were followers of him, and were 
 murderers, like him; murderers of souls, which they led blindfold into 
 the ditch, and made the <I>children of hell;</I> sworn enemies of 
 Christ, and now ready to be his betrayers and murderers, for the same 
 reason that Cain killed Abel. These Jews were that <I>seed of the 
 serpent</I> that were to <I>bruise the heel</I> of the <I>seed of the 
 woman; Now you seek to kill me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He was <I>a liar.</I> A lie is opposed to truth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:21">1 John ii. 21</A>),

 and accordingly the devil is here described to be,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] An enemy to truth, and therefore to Christ. <I>First,</I> He is a 
 <I>deserter,</I> from the truth; he <I>abode not in the truth,</I> did 
 not continue in the purity and rectitude of his nature wherein he was 
 created, but left his first state; when he degenerated from goodness, 
 he departed from truth, for his apostasy was founded in a lie. The 
 angels were the <I>hosts of the Lord;</I> those that fell were not 
 <I>true</I> to their commander and sovereign, they were not to be 
 <I>trusted,</I> being charged with folly and defection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:18">Job iv. 18</A>.

 By <I>the truth</I> here we may understand the revealed will of God 
 concerning the salvation of man by Jesus Christ, the truth which Christ 
 was now preaching, and which the Jews opposed; herein they did <I>like 
 their father the devil,</I> who, <I>seeing</I> the honour put upon the 
 human nature in the <I>first Adam,</I> and <I>foreseeing</I> the much 
 greater honour intended in the <I>second Adam,</I> would not be 
 reconciled to that counsel of God, nor <I>stand in the truth</I> 
 concerning it, but, from a spirit of pride and envy, set himself to 
 resist it, and to thwart the designs of it; and so did these Jews here, 
 as his children and agents. <I>Secondly,</I> He is <I>destitute</I> of 
 the truth: <I>There is no truth in him.</I> His interest in the world 
 is supported by lies and falsehoods, and there is no truth, nothing you 
 can confide in, in him, nor in any thing he says or does. The notions 
 he propagates concerning good and evil are false and erroneous, his 
 proofs are lying wonders, his temptations are all cheats; he has great 
 knowledge of the truth, but having no affection to it, but on the 
 contrary being a sworn enemy to it, he is said to have <I>no truth in 
 him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He is a friend and patron of lying: <I>When he speaketh a lie he 
 speaketh of his own.</I> Three things are here said of the devil with 
 reference to the sin of lying:--<I>First,</I> That he is <I>a liar;</I> 
 his oracles were lying oracles, his prophets lying prophets, and the 
 images in which he was worshipped <I>teachers of lies.</I> He tempted 
 our first parents with a downright lie. All his temptations are carried 
 on by lies, calling <I>evil good and good evil,</I> and promising 
 impunity in sin; he knows them to be lies, and suggests them with an 
 intention to deceive, and so to destroy. When he now 
 <I>contradicted</I> the gospel, in the scribes and Pharisees, it was by 
 lies; and when afterwards he <I>corrupted it,</I> in the <I>man of 
 sin,</I> it was by strong delusions, and a great complicated lie. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> That when he <I>speaks a lie</I> he <I>speaks of his 
 own,</I> <B><I>ek ton idion</I></B>. It is the proper <I>idiom</I> of 
 his language; of <I>his own,</I> not of God; his Creator never put it 
 into him. When men speak a lie they borrow it from the devil, <I>Satan 
 fills their hearts to lie</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:3">Acts v. 3</A>);

 but when the devil speaks a lie the <I>model</I> of it is of his own 
 framing, the motives to it are from himself, which bespeaks the 
 desperate depth of wickedness into which those apostate spirits are 
 sunk; as in their first defection they had no tempter, so their 
 sinfulness is still their own. <I>Thirdly,</I> That he is the <I>father 
 of it,</I> <B><I>autou</I></B>. 

 1. He is the father of every <I>lie;</I> not only of the lies which he 
 himself suggests, but of those which others speak; he is the author and 
 founder of all lies. When men speak lies, they speak from him, and as
 his mouth; they come originally from him, and bear his image. 

 2. He is the father of <I>every liar;</I> so it may be understood. God 
 made men with a disposition to truth. It is congruous to reason and 
 natural light, to the order of our faculties and the laws of society, 
 that we should speak truth; but the devil, the author of sin, the 
 spirit that works in the children of disobedience, has so corrupted the 
 nature of man that the wicked are said to be <I>estranged from the 
 womb, speaking lies</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:3">Ps. lviii. 3</A>);
 
 he has taught them <I>with their tongues to use deceit,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:13">Rom. iii. 13</A>.

 He is the father of liars, who begat them, who trained them up in the 
 <I>way of lying,</I> whom they resemble and obey, and with whom all 
 <I>liars</I> shall have their portion for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ, having thus proved all murderers and all liars to be the 
 devil's children, leaves it to the consciences of his hearers to say, 
 <I>Thou art the man.</I> But he comes in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:45-58">following verses</A>

 to assist them in the application of it to themselves; he does not call
 them <I>liars,</I> but shows them that they were <I>no friends to 
 truth,</I> and therein resembled him who <I>abode not in the truth, 
 because there is no truth in him.</I> Two things he charges upon 
 them:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they would not <I>believe the word of truth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>),
 
 <B><I>hoti ten aletheian lego, ou pisteuete moi</I></B>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Two ways it may be taken;--

 [1.] "Though I tell you the truth, yet you will not believe me 
 (<B><I>hoti</I></B>), <I>that I do so.</I>" Though he gave abundant 
 proof of his commission from God, and his affection to the children of 
 men, yet they would not believe that he told them the truth. Now was 
 <I>truth fallen in the street,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:14,15">Isa. lix. 14, 15</A>.

 The greatest truths with some gained not the least credit; for they 
 <I>rebelled against the light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:13">Job xxiv. 13</A>.
 
 Or,

 [2.] <I>Because I tell you the truth</I> (so we read it) therefore 
 <I>you believe me not.</I> They would not receive him, nor entertain 
 him as a prophet, because he told them some unpleasing truths which 
 they did not care to hear, told them the truth concerning themselves 
 and their own case, showed them their faces in a glass that would not 
 flatter them; therefore they would not believe a word he said. 
 Miserable is the case of those to whom the light of divine truth is 
 become a torment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Now, to show them the unreasonableness of their infidelity, he 
 condescends to put the matter to this fair issue, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.

 He and they being contrary, either he was in an error or they were. Now 
 take it either way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] If <I>he</I> were in an error, why did they not convince him? The 
 falsehood of <I>pretended</I> prophets was discovered either by the 
 <I>ill tendency</I> of their doctrines 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:2">Deut. xiii. 2</A>),

 or by the <I>ill tenour</I> of their conversation: <I>You shall know 
 them by their fruits;</I> but (saith Christ) <I>which of you,</I> you 
 of the sanhedrim, that take upon you to judge of prophets, <I>which of 
 you convinceth me of sin?</I> They accused him of some of the worst of 
 crimes--gluttony, drunkenness, blasphemy, sabbath-breaking, confederacy 
 with Satan, and what not. But their accusations were malicious 
 groundless calumnies, and such as every one that knew him knew to be 
 <I>utterly false.</I> When they had done their utmost by trick and 
 artifice, subornation and perjury, to prove some crime upon him, the 
 very judge that condemned him owned he <I>found no fault in him.</I> 
 The <I>sin</I> he here challenges them to convict him of is, 
 <I>First,</I> An inconsistent doctrine. They had heard his testimony; 
 could they show any thing in it absurd or unworthy to be believed, any 
 contradiction either of himself or of the scriptures, or any corruption 
 of truth or manners insinuated by his doctrine?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:20"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 20</A>.

 Or, <I>Secondly,</I> An incongruous conversation: "Which of you can
 justly charge me with any thing, in word or deed, unbecoming a 
 prophet?" See the wonderful condescension of our Lord Jesus, that he 
 demanded not credit any further than the allowed motives of credibility 
 supported his demands. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:5,31,Mic+6:3">Jer. ii. 5, 31; Mic. vi. 3</A>.

 Ministers may hence learn, 

 1. To <I>walk</I> so <I>circumspectly</I> as that it may not be in the
 power of their most strict observers to convince them of sin, <I>that 
 the ministry be not blamed.</I> The only way not to be convicted of sin 
 is not to sin. 

 2. To be willing to <I>admit a scrutiny;</I> though we are confident in 
 many things that we are in the right, yet we should be willing to have 
 it tried whether we be not in the wrong. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:24">Job vi. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] If <I>they</I> were in an error, why were they not convinced by 
 him? "<I>If I say the truth, why do you not believe me?</I> If you 
 cannot convince me of error, you must own that I <I>say the truth,</I> 
 and why do you not then <I>give me credit?</I> Why will you not deal 
 with me upon trust?" Note, If men would but enquire into the reason of 
 their infidelity, and examine why they do not believe that which they 
 cannot gainsay, they would find themselves reduced to such absurdities 
 as they could not but be ashamed of; for it will be found that the 
 reason why we believe not in Jesus Christ is because we are not willing 
 to part with our sins, and deny ourselves, and serve God faithfully; 
 that we are not of the Christian religion, because we would not indeed 
 be of any, and unbelief of our Redeemer resolves itself into a 
 downright rebellion against our Creator.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Another thing charged upon them is that they would not hear the 
 words of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>),

 which further shows how groundless their claim of relation to God was. 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A doctrine laid down: <I>He that is of God heareth God's 
 words;</I> that is, 

 [1.] He is <I>willing</I> and <I>ready</I> to hear them, is sincerely 
 desirous to know what the mind of God is, and cheerfully embraces 
 whatever he knows to be so. God's words have such an authority over, 
 and such an agreeableness with all that are born of God, that they meet 
 them, as the child Samuel did, with, <I>Speak, Lord, for thy servant 
 heareth.</I> Let the word of the Lord come. 

 [2.] He <I>apprehends</I> and <I>discerns</I> them, he so hears them as 
 to perceive the <I>voice of God</I> in them, which the natural man does 
 not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:14">1 Cor. ii. 14</A>.

 He that is of God is <I>soon aware</I> of the discoveries he makes of
 himself of the <I>nearness of his name</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:1">Ps. lxxv. 1</A>),

 as they of the family know the master's tread, and the master's knock, 
 and <I>open to him immediately</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:36">Luke xii. 36</A>),

 as the sheep know the voice of their shepherd from that of a stranger,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:4,5,So+2:8"><I>ch.</I> x. 4, 5; Cant. ii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The application of this doctrine, for the conviction of these 
 unbelieving Jews: <I>You therefore hear them not;</I> that is, "You 
 heed not, you understand not, you believe not, the words of God, nor 
 care to hear them, <I>because you are not of God.</I> Your being thus 
 deaf and dead to the words of God is a plain evidence that you are 
 <I>not of God.</I>" It is in his word that God manifests himself and is 
 present among us; we are therefore reckoned to be well or ill affected 
 to his word; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:4,1Jo+4:6">2 Cor. iv. 4; 1 John iv. 6</A>.

 Or, their not being of God was the reason why they did not profitably
 <I>hear the words of God,</I> which Christ spoke; they did not 
 understand and believe him, not because the things themselves were 
 obscure or wanted evidence, but because the hearers were <I>not of 
 God,</I> were not born again. If the word of the kingdom do not bring 
 forth fruit, the blame is to be laid upon the soil, not upon the seed, 
 as appears by the parable of the sower, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:3">Matt. xiii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. The malice of hell breaking out in the base language which 
 the unbelieving Jews gave to our Lord Jesus. Hitherto they had cavilled 
 at his doctrine, and had made invidious remarks upon it; but, having 
 shown themselves uneasy when he complained 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:43,47"><I>v.</I> 43, 47</A>)

 that they would not hear him, now at length they fall to downright 
 railing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.

 They were not the common people, but, as it should seem, the scribes 
 and Pharisees, the men of consequence, who, when they saw themselves 
 convicted of an obstinate infidelity, scornfully turned off the 
 conviction with this: <I>Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and 
 hast a devil?</I> See here, see it and wonder, see it and tremble,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was the blasphemous character commonly given of our Lord Jesus 
 among the wicked Jews, to which they refer. 

 (1.) That he was a Samaritan, that is, that he was an enemy to their 
 church and nation, one that they hated and could not endure. Thus they 
 exposed him to the ill will of the people, with whom you could not put 
 a man into a worse name than to call him <I>a Samaritan.</I> If he had 
 been a Samaritan, he had been punishable, by the <I>beating of the 
 rebels</I> (as they called it), for coming into the temple. They had 
 often enough called him <I>a Galilean--a mean man;</I> but as if that 
 were not enough, though it contradicted the other, they will have him a 
 <I>Samaritan--a bad man.</I> The Jews to this day call the Christians, 
 in reproach, <I>Cuth&aelig;i-Samaritans.</I> Note, Great endeavours 
 have in all ages been used to make good people odious by putting them 
 under black characters, and it is easy to run that down with a crowd 
 and a cry which is once put into an ill name. Perhaps because Christ 
 justly inveighed against the pride and tyranny of the priests and 
 elders, they hereby suggest that he aimed at the ruin of their church, 
 in aiming at its reformation, and was <I>falling away</I> to the 
 Samaritans. 
 
 (2.) That <I>he had a devil.</I> Either,

 [1.] That he was <I>in league with the devil.</I> Having reproached his 
 doctrine as tending to Samaritanism, here they reflect upon his 
 miracles as done in combination with Beelzebub. Or, rather 

 [2.] That he was possessed with a devil, that he was a melancholy man, 
 whose brain was <I>clouded,</I> or a mad man, whose brain was 
 <I>heated,</I> and that which he said was no more to be believed than 
 the extravagant rambles of a distracted man, or one in a delirium. Thus 
 the divine revelation of those things which are above the discovery of 
 reason have been often branded with the charge of enthusiasm, and the 
 prophet was called a <I>mad fellow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:11,Ho+9:7">2 Kings ix. 11; Hosea ix. 7</A>.

 The inspiration of the Pagan oracles and prophets was indeed a frenzy,
 and those that had it were for the time beside themselves; but that 
 which was truly <I>divine</I> was not so. <I>Wisdom is justified of her 
 children,</I> as wisdom indeed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How they undertook to justify this character, and applied it to the 
 present occasion: <I>Say we not well that thou art so?</I> One would 
 think that his excellent discourses should have altered their opinion 
 of him, and have made them recant; but, instead of this, their hearts 
 were more hardened and their prejudices confirmed. They value 
 themselves on their enmity to Christ, as if they had never spoken 
 <I>better</I> than when they spoke the worst they could of Jesus 
 Christ. Those have arrived at the highest pitch of wickedness who avow 
 their impiety, repeat what they should retract, and justify themselves 
 in that for which they ought to condemn themselves. It is bad to say 
 and do ill, but it is worse to <I>stand to it;</I> I do <I>well to be 
 angry.</I> When Christ spoke with so much boldness against the sins of 
 the great men, and thereby incensed them against him, those who were 
 sensible of no interest but what is secular and sensual concluded him 
 <I>beside himself,</I> for they thought none but a madman would lose 
 his preferment, and hazard his life, for his religion and 
 conscience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The meekness and mercifulness of Heaven shining in Christ's reply 
 to this vile calumny, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:49,50"><I>v.</I> 49, 50</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He denies their charge against him: <I>I have not a devil;</I> as 
 Paul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:25">Acts xxvi. 25</A>),

 <I>I am not mad.</I> The imputation is unjust; "I am neither actuated 
 by a devil, nor in compact with one;" and this he evidenced by what he 
 did against the devil's kingdom. He takes no notice of their calling 
 him a <I>Samaritan,</I> because it was a calumny that disproved itself, 
 it was a personal reflection, and not worth taking notice of: but 
 saying he had a devil reflected on his commission, and therefore he 
 answered that. St. Augustine gives this gloss upon his not saying any 
 thing to their calling him a Samaritan--that he was indeed that good 
 Samaritan spoken of in the parable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:33">Luke x. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He asserts the sincerity of his own intentions: But <I>I honour my 
 Father.</I> They suggested that he took undue honours to himself, and 
 derogated from the honour due to God only, both which he <I>denies</I> 
 here, in saying that he made it his business to honour his Father, and 
 him only. It also proves that he <I>had not a devil;</I> for, if he 
 had, he would not honour God. Note, Those who can truly way that they 
 make it their constant care to honour God are sufficiently armed 
 against the censures and reproaches of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He complains of the wrong they did him by their calumnies: <I>You do 
 dishonour me.</I> By this it appears that, as man, he had a tender 
 sense of the disgrace and indignity done him; reproach was a sword in 
 his bones, and yet he underwent it for our salvation. It is the will of 
 God that <I>all men should honour the Son,</I> yet there are many that 
 <I>dishonour him;</I> such a contradiction is there in the carnal mind 
 to the will of God. Christ honoured his Father so as never man did, and 
 yet was himself dishonoured so as never man was; for, though God has 
 promised that those who honour him he will honour, he never promised 
 that men should honour them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He clears himself from the imputation of vain glory, in saying this 
 concerning himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>.
 
 See here,

 (1.) His <I>contempt</I> of worldly honour: <I>I seek not mine own 
 glory.</I> He did not aim at this in what he had said of himself or 
 against his persecutors; he did not court the applause of men, nor 
 covet preferment in the world, but industriously declined both. He did 
 not <I>seek his own glory</I> distinct from his Father's, nor had any 
 separate interest of his own. For men to <I>search their own glory</I>
 is <I>not glory</I> indeed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:27">Prov. xxv. 27</A>),

 but rather their shame to be so much <I>out in their aim.</I> This 
 comes in here as a reason why Christ made so light of their reproaches: 
 "<I>You do dishonour me,</I> but cannot disturb me, shall not disquiet 
 me, for I <I>seek not my own glory.</I>" Note, Those who are dead to 
 men's praise can safely bear their contempt. 

 (2.) His <I>comfort</I> under worldly dishonour: <I>There is one that 
 seeketh and judgeth.</I> In two things Christ made it appear that he 
 <I>sought not his own glory;</I> and here he tells us what satisfied 
 him as to both.

 [1.] He did not <I>court</I> men's respect, but was indifferent to it, 
 and in reference to this he saith, "<I>There is one that seeketh,</I> 
 that will secure and advance, my interest in the esteem and affections 
 of the people, while I am in no care about it." Note, God will seek 
 <I>their</I> honour that do not seek <I>their own;</I> for before 
 honour is humility. 

 [2.] He did not <I>revenge</I> men's affronts, but was unconcerned at 
 them, and in reference to this he saith, "<I>There is one that 
 judgeth,</I> that will vindicate my honour, and severely reckon with 
 those that trample upon it." Probably he refers here to the judgments 
 that were coming upon the nation of the Jews for the indignities they 
 did to the Lord Jesus. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13-15">Ps. xxxvii. 13-15</A>.

 <I>I heard not, for thou wilt hear.</I> If we undertake to judge for
 ourselves, whatever damage we sustain, our recompence is in our own 
 hands; but if we be, as we ought to be, humble appellants and patient 
 expectants, we shall find, to our comfort, <I>there is one that 
 judgeth.</I></P>

 himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of

 we must not only <I>receive,</I> but <I>keep;</I> not only <I>have,</I> 
 but <I>hold.</I> We must keep it in mind and memory, keep it in love 
 and affection, so keep it as in nothing to violate it or go contrary to 
 it, keep it <I>without spot</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:14">1 Tim. vi. 14</A>),

 keep it as a trust committed to us, keep in it as our way, keep to it 
 as our rule. 

 2. The <I>privilege</I> of a believer: <I>He shall by no means see 
 death for ever;</I> so it is in the original. Not as if the bodies of 
 believers were secured from the stroke of death. No, even the 
 <I>children of the Most High</I> must <I>die like men,</I> and the 
 followers of Christ have been, more than other men, in deaths often, 
 and <I>killed all the day long;</I> how then is this promise made good 
 that they <I>shall not see death?</I> Answer,

 (1.) The property of death is so altered to them that they do not see 
 it as death, they do not see the terror of death, it is quite taken 
 off; their sight does not <I>terminate</I> in death, as theirs does who 
 <I>live by sense;</I> no, they look so clearly, so comfortably, through 
 death, and beyond death, and are so taken up with their state on the 
 other side death, that they overlook death, and <I>see it not.</I> 

 (2.) The power of death is so broken that though there is no remedy, 
 but they must see <I>death,</I> yet they shall not see death <I>for 
 ever,</I> shall not be always shut up under its arrests, the day will 
 come when <I>death shall be swallowed up in victory.</I> 

 (3.) They are perfectly delivered from <I>eternal death,</I> shall not 
 be <I>hurt of the second death.</I> That is the death especially meant 
 here, that death which is <I>for ever,</I> which is opposed to 
 everlasting life; this they shall never see, for they shall <I>never 
 come into condemnation;</I> they shall have their everlasting lot where 
 there will be <I>no more death,</I> where they <I>cannot die any 
 more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:36">Luke xx. 36</A>.

 Though now they cannot avoid seeing death, and tasting it too, yet they
 shall shortly be there where it will be <I>seen no more for ever,</I>

 II. The Jews cavil at this doctrine. Instead of laying hold of this 
 precious promise of immortality, which the nature of man has an 
 ambition of (who is there that does not love life, and dread the sight 
 of death?) they lay hold of this occasion to reproach him that makes 
 them so kind an offer: <I>Now we know that thou hast a devil.</I> 
 Abraham <I>is dead.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their <I>railing: "Now we know that thou hast a devil,</I> that thou 
 art a madman; thou ravest, and sayest thou knowest not what." See how 
 these swine trample underfoot the precious pearls of gospel promises. 
 If now at last they had evidence to prove him <I>mad,</I> why did they 
 say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>),

 before they had that proof, <I>Thou hast a devil?</I> But this is the 
 method of malice, first to <I>fasten</I> an invidious charge, and then 
 to <I>fish</I> for evidence of it: <I>Now we know that thou hast a 
 devil.</I> If he had not abundantly proved himself a <I>teacher come 
 from God,</I> his promises of immortality to his credulous followers 
 might justly have been ridiculed, and charity itself would have imputed 
 them to a crazed fancy; but his doctrine was evidently divine, his 
 miracles confirmed it, and the Jews' religion taught them to expect 
 such a prophet, and to believe in him; for them therefore thus to 
 reject him was to abandon that promise to which their <I>twelve tribes 
 hoped to come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:27">Acts xxvi. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their <I>reasoning,</I> and the colour they had to <I>run him 
 down</I> thus. In short, they look upon him as guilty of an 
 insufferable piece of arrogance, in making himself greater than 
 <I>Abraham and the prophets: Abraham is dead,</I> and <I>the 
 prophets,</I> they are dead too; very true, by the same token that 
 these Jews were the genuine offspring of those that killed them. Now, 
 
 (1.) It is true that Abraham and the prophets were great men, great in 
 the favour of God, and great in the esteem of all good men. 

 (2.) It is true that they <I>kept God's sayings,</I> and were obedient 
 to them; and yet, 

 (3.) It is true that they <I>died;</I> they never pretended to 
 <I>have,</I> much less to <I>give,</I> immortality, but every one in 
 his own order was <I>gathered to his people.</I> It was their honour 
 that they <I>died in faith,</I> but die they must. Why should a good 
 man be afraid to die, when Abraham is dead, and the prophets are dead?
 They have <I>tracked</I> the way through that darksome valley, which 
 should reconcile us to death and help to take off the terror of it. Now 
 they think Christ talks madly, when he saith, <I>If a man keep my 
 sayings, he shall never taste death. Tasting</I> death means the same 
 thing with <I>seeing</I> it; and well may death be represented as 
 grievous to <I>several</I> of the senses, which is the destruction of 
 them <I>all.</I> Now their arguing goes upon two mistakes:--

 [1.] They understood Christ of an immortality in this world, and this 
 was a mistake. In the sense that Christ spoke, it was not true that 
 <I>Abraham and the prophets were dead,</I> for God is still the <I>God 
 of Abraham</I> and the <I>God of the holy prophets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:6">Rev. xxii. 6</A>);

 now God is not the God of the dead, but of the living; therefore 
 Abraham and the prophets are still alive, and, as Christ meant it, they 
 had not <I>seen</I> nor <I>tasted</I> death.

 [2.] They thought none could be greater than Abraham and the prophets, 
 whereas they could not but know that the Messiah would be greater than 
 Abraham or any of the prophets; they did virtuously, but he excelled 
 them all; nay, they borrowed their greatness from him. It was the 
 honour of Abraham that he was the Father of the Messiah, and the honour 
 of the prophets that they testified beforehand concerning him: so that 
 he certainly <I>obtained a</I> far <I>more excellent name than 
 they.</I> Therefore, instead of inferring from Christ's making himself 
 greater than Abraham that he had a <I>devil,</I> they should have 
 inferred from his proving himself so (by doing the works which neither 
 Abraham nor the prophets ever did) that he was the Christ; but their 
 eyes were blinded. They scornfully asked, <I>Whom makest thou 
 thyself?</I> As if he had been guilty of pride and vain-glory; whereas 
 he was so far from making himself greater than he was that he now drew 
 a veil over his own glory, emptied himself, and made himself less than 
 he was, and was the greatest example of humility that ever was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's reply to this cavil; still he vouchsafes to reason with 
 them, that every mouth may be stopped. No doubt he could have struck 
 them dumb or dead upon the spot, but this was the <I>day of his 
 patience.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In his answer he insists not upon his own testimony concerning 
 himself, but waives it as not sufficient nor conclusive 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>):

 <I>If I honour myself, my honour is nothing,</I> <B><I>ean ego 
 doxazo</I></B>--<I>if I glorify myself.</I> Note, Self-honour is no 
 honour; and the affectation of glory is both the forfeiture and the 
 defeasance of it: it is <I>not glory</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:27">Prov. xxv. 27</A>),

 but so great a reproach that there is no sin which men are more 
 industrious to hide than this; even he that most affects praise would 
 not be thought to do it. Honour of our own creating is a mere chimera, 
 has nothing in it, and therefore is called <I>vain-glory.</I> 
 Self-admirers are self-<I>deceivers.</I> Our Lord Jesus was not one 
 that <I>honoured himself,</I> as they represented him; he was 
 <I>crowned</I> by him who is the fountain of honour, and glorified not 
 himself to be made a high priest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:4,5">Heb. v. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He refers himself to <I>his</I> Father, God; and to <I>their</I> 
 father, Abraham.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To his Father, <I>God: It is my Father that honoureth me.</I> By 
 this he means, 

 [1.] That he <I>derived</I> from his Father all the honour he now 
 claimed; he had commanded them to believe in him, to follow him, and to 
 keep his word, all which put an honour upon him; but it was the Father 
 that <I>laid help</I> upon him, that <I>lodged</I> all <I>fulness</I> 
 in him, that sanctified him, and sealed him, and sent him into the 
 world to receive all the honours due to the Messiah, and this justified 
 him in all these demands of respect. 

 [2.] That he <I>depended</I> upon his Father for all the honour he 
 further <I>looked for.</I> He courted not the applauses of the age, but 
 despised them; for his eye and heart were upon the glory which the 
 Father had promised him, and <I>which he had with the Father before the 
 world was.</I> He aimed at an advancement with which the Father was to 
 <I>exalt him, a name</I> he was to <I>give him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:8,9">Phil. ii. 8, 9</A>.

 Note, Christ and all that are his depend upon God for their honour; and
 he that is sure of honour where he is known cares not though he be 
 slighted where he is in disguise. Appealing thus often to his Father,
 and his Father's testimony of him, which yet the Jews did not admit nor 
 give credit to,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He here takes occasion to show the reason of <I>their</I> 
 incredulity, notwithstanding <I>this</I> testimony--and this was their 
 <I>unacquaintedness</I> with God; as if he had said, "But why should I 
 talk to you of my Father's honouring me, when he is one you know 
 nothing of? You <I>say of him that he is your God, yet you have not 
 known him.</I>" Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> The profession they made of relation to God: "<I>You say that 
 he is your God,</I> the God you have chosen, and are in covenant with; 
 you say that you are Israel; but all are not so indeed that are of 
 Israel," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:6">Rom. ix. 6</A>.

 Note, Many pretend to have an interest in God, and say that he is
 <I>theirs,</I> who yet have no just cause to say so. Those who called
 themselves the <I>temple of the Lord,</I> having <I>profaned the 
 excellency of Jacob,</I> did but trust in lying words. What will it
 avail us to say, He is <I>our God,</I> if we be not in sincerity <I>his 
 people,</I> nor such as he will own? Christ mentions here their 
 profession of relation to God, as that which was an aggravation of 
 their unbelief. All people will honour those whom their God honours; 
 but these Jews, who said that the Lord was their God, studied how to 
 put the utmost disgrace upon one upon whom their God put honour. Note, 
 The Profession we make of a covenant relation to God, and an interest 
 in him, if it be not improved <I>by us</I> will be improved <I>against 
 us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> Their ignorance of him, and estrangement from him, 
 notwithstanding this profession: <I>Yet you have not known him.</I>

 (<I>a.</I>) <I>You know him not at all.</I> These Pharisees were so 
 taken up with the study of their traditions concerning things foreign 
 and trifling that they never minded the most needful and useful 
 knowledge; like the false prophets of old, who <I>caused people to 
 forget God's name by their dreams,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:27">Jer. xxiii. 27</A>.
 
 Or,

 (<I>b.</I>) <I>You know him not aright,</I> but mistake concerning him;
 and this is as bad as not knowing him at all, or worse. Men may be able 
 to dispute subtly concerning God, and yet may think him such a one as 
 themselves, and <I>not know him.</I> You say that he is <I>yours,</I> 
 and it is natural to us to desire to know <I>our own,</I> yet you 
 <I>know him not.</I> Note, There are many who <I>claim-kindred</I> to 
 God who yet have no acquaintance with him. It is only the name of God
 which they have learned to talk of, and to hector with; but for the 
 nature of God, his attributes and perfections, and relations to his 
 creatures, they know nothing of the matter; we <I>speak this to their 
 shame,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:34">1 Cor. xv. 34</A>.

 Multitudes satisfy themselves, but deceive themselves, with a titular
 relation to an <I>unknown God.</I> This Christ charges upon the Jews 
 here,

 [<I>a.</I>] To show how vain and groundless their pretensions of 
 relation to God were. "You say that he is yours, but you give 
 yourselves the lie, for it is plain that you do not know him;" and we 
 reckon that a cheat is effectually convicted if it be found that he is 
 ignorant of the persons he pretends alliance to. 

 [<I>b.</I>] To show the true reason why they were not wrought upon by 
 Christ's doctrine and miracles. They knew not God; and therefore 
 perceived not the image of God, nor the voice of God in Christ. Note, 
 The reason why men receive not the <I>gospel of Christ</I> is because 
 they have not the <I>knowledge of God.</I> Men <I>submit not to the 
 righteousness of Christ</I> because they are <I>ignorant of God's 
 righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:3">Rom. x. 3</A>.

 They that know not God, and obey not the gospel of Christ, are put
 together,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:8">2 Thess. i. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He gives them the reason of <I>his</I> assurance that 
 his Father would <I>honour</I> him and <I>own him: But I know him;</I> 
 and again, <I>I know him;</I> which bespeaks, not only his 
 <I>acquaintance</I> with him, having lain in his bosom, but his 
 <I>confidence</I> in him, to stand by him, and bear him out in his 
 whole undertaking; as was prophesied concerning him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7,8">Isa. l. 7, 8</A>),
 
 <I>I know</I> that I shall not be ashamed, for he is near that 
 justifies; and as Paul, "<I>I know whom I have believed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:12">2 Tim. i. 12</A>),

 I know him to be faithful, and powerful, and heartily engaged in the 
 cause which I know to be his <I>own.</I>" Observe, 

 1. How he <I>professes</I> his knowledge of his Father, with the 
 greatest certainty, as one that was neither afraid nor ashamed to own 
 it: <I>If I should say I know him not, I should be a liar like unto 
 you.</I> He would not deny his relation to God, to humour the Jews, and 
 to avoid their reproaches, and prevent further trouble; nor would he 
 retract what he had said, nor confess himself either deceived or a 
 deceiver; if he should, he would be found a false witness against God 
 and himself. Note, Those who disown their religion and relation to
 God, as Peter, are liars, as much as hypocrites are, who pretend to 
 know him, when they do not. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:13,14">1 Tim. vi. 13, 14</A>.

 Mr. Clark observes well, upon this, that it is a great sin to deny God's
 grace in us.

 2. How he <I>proves</I> his knowledge of his Father: <I>I know him and
 keep his sayings,</I> or <I>his word.</I> Christ, as man, was obedient 
 to the moral law, and, as Redeemer, to the mediatorial law; and in both 
 he kept <I>his Father's</I> word, and <I>his own word</I> with the 
 Father. Christ requires of us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>)

 that we <I>keep his sayings;</I> and he has set before us a copy of 
 obedience, a copy without a blot: he <I>kept his Father's sayings;</I> 
 well might he who <I>learned obedience</I> teach it; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:8,9">Heb. v. 8, 9</A>.
 
 Christ by this evinced that he knew the Father. Note, The best proof of
 our acquaintance with God is our obedience to him. Those only know God 
 aright that keep his word; it is a ruled case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:3">1 John ii. 3</A>.

 <I>Hereby we know that we know him</I> (and do not only fancy it),
 <I>if we keep his commandments.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ refers them to <I>their</I> father, whom they boasted so 
 much of a relation to, and that was Abraham, and this closes the 
 discourse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Christ asserts Abraham's prospect of him, and respect to him: 
 <I>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it, and was 
 glad,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>.

 And by this he proves that he was not at all out of the way when he 
 <I>made himself greater than Abraham.</I> Two things he here speaks of 
 as instances of that patriarch's respect to the promised Messiah:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The ambition he had to <I>see his day: He rejoiced,</I> 
 <B><I>egalliasto</I></B>--<I>he leaped at it.</I> The word, though it 
 commonly signifies <I>rejoicing,</I> must here signify a transport of 
 <I>desire</I> rather than of <I>joy,</I> for otherwise the latter part 
 of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:56">the verse</A>

 would be a tautology; he <I>saw it, and was glad.</I> He <I>reached
 out,</I> or <I>stretched himself forth,</I> that he might <I>see my 
 day;</I> as Zaccheus, that ran before, and climbed the tree, <I>to see 
 Jesus.</I> The notices he had received of the Messiah to come had 
 raised in him an expectation of something <I>great,</I> which he 
 earnestly longed to know more of. The dark intimation of that which is 
 considerable puts men upon enquiry, and makes them earnestly ask 
 <I>Who?</I> and <I>What?</I> and <I>Where?</I> and <I>When?</I> and 
 <I>How?</I> And thus the prophets of the Old Testament, having a 
 general idea of a grace that should <I>come, searched diligently</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10">1 Pet. i. 10</A>),

 and Abraham was as industrious herein as any of them. God told him of a 
 land that he would give his posterity, and of the wealth and honour he 
 designed them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:14">Gen. xv. 14</A>);

 but he never <I>leaped</I> thus to see that day, as he did to see the 
 day of the Son of man. He could not look with so much indifferency upon 
 the promised <I>seed</I> as he did upon the promised land; <I>in 
 that</I> he was, but <I>to the other</I> he could not be, contentedly a 
 stranger. Note, Those who rightly know any thing of Christ cannot but 
 be earnestly desirous to know more of him. Those who discern the 
 dawning of the light of the Sun of righteousness cannot but wish to see 
 his rising. The mystery of redemption is that which <I>angels desire to 
 look into,</I> much more should we, who are more immediately concerned 
 in it. Abraham desired to see Christ's day, though it was at a great 
 distance; but this degenerate seed of his discerned not his day, nor 
 bade it welcome when it came. The appearing of Christ, which gracious 
 souls love and long for, carnal hearts dread and loathe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The satisfaction he had in what he did see of it: 
 <I>He saw it, and was glad.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> How God gratified the pious desire of Abraham; he longed to 
 see Christ's day, and he <I>saw it.</I> Though he saw it not so 
 plainly, and fully, and distinctly as we now see it under the gospel, 
 yet he saw something of it, more <I>afterwards</I> than he did at 
 first. Note, To him that has, and to him that asks, shall be given; to 
 him that uses and improves what he has, and that desires and prays for 
 more of the knowledge of Christ, God will give more. But how did 
 Abraham see Christ's day? 

 (<I>a.</I>) Some understand it of the sight he had of it in the other 
 world. The separate soul of Abraham, when the veil of flesh was rent, 
 saw the mysteries of the kingdom of God in heaven. Calvin mentions this 
 sense of it, and does not much disallow it. Note, The longings of 
 gracious souls after Jesus Christ will be fully satisfied when they 
 come to heaven, and not till then. But, 

 (<I>b.</I>) It is more commonly understood of some sight he had of 
 <I>Christ's day</I> in this world. They that <I>received not the
 promises,</I> yet <I>saw them afar off,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:13">Heb. xi. 13</A>.

 Balaam saw Christ, but not <I>now,</I> not <I>nigh.</I> There is room 
 to conjecture that Abraham had some vision of Christ and his day, for 
 his own private satisfaction, which is not, nor must be, recorded in 
 his story, like that of Daniel's, which must be <I>shut up, and sealed 
 unto the time of the end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:4">Dan. xii. 4</A>.

 Christ knew what Abraham saw better than Moses did. But there are
 divers things recorded in which Abraham saw more of that which he 
 longed to see than he did when the promise was first made to him. He 
 saw in Melchizedek one <I>made like unto the Son of God,</I> and a 
 priest for ever; he saw an appearance of Jehovah, attended with two 
 angels, in the plains of Mamre. In the prevalency of his intercession 
 for Sodom he saw a specimen of Christ's intercession; in the casting 
 out of Ishmael, and the establishment of the covenant with Isaac, he 
 saw a figure of the gospel day, which is Christ's day; for these things 
 were an allegory. In offering Isaac, and the ram instead of Isaac, he 
 saw a double type of the great sacrifice; and his calling the place 
 <I>Jehovah-jireh--It shall be seen,</I> intimates that he saw something 
 more in it than others did, which time would produce; and in making his 
 servant <I>put his hand under his thigh,</I> when he swore, he had a 
 regard to the Messiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> How <I>Abraham</I> entertained these discoveries of Christ's 
 day, and bade them welcome: <I>He saw, and was glad.</I> He was glad of 
 what he <I>saw</I> of God's favour to himself, and glad of what he 
 <I>foresaw</I> of the mercy God had in store for the world. Perhaps 
 this refers to Abraham's laughing when God assured him of a son by 
 Sarah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:16,17">Gen. xvii. 16, 17</A>),

 for that was not a laughter of distrust as Sarah's but of joy; in that 
 promise he saw Christ's day, and it <I>filled him with joy 
 unspeakable.</I> Thus he embraced the promises. Note, A believing
 sight of Christ and his day will put gladness into the heart. No joy 
 like the joy of faith; we are never acquainted with true pleasure till 
 we are acquainted with Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The Jews cavil at this, and reproach him for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>):

 <I>Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</I> 
 Here, <I>First,</I> They suppose that if Abraham saw him and his day he 
 also had seen Abraham, which yet was not a necessary <I>innuendo,</I> 
 but this turn of his words would best serve to expose him; yet it was 
 true that Christ had seen Abraham, and had talked with him as a man 
 talks with his friend. <I>Secondly,</I> They suppose it a very absurd 
 thing for him to pretend to have seen Abraham, who was <I>dead</I> so 
 many ages before he was born. The state of the dead is an 
 <I>invisible</I> state; but here they ran upon the old mistake, 
 understanding that corporally which Christ spoke spiritually. Now this 
 gave them occasion to <I>despise his youth,</I> and to upbraid him with 
 it, as if he were <I>but of yesterday, and knew</I> nothing: <I>Thou 
 art not yet fifty years old.</I> They might as well have said, <I>Thou 
 art not forty;</I> for he was now but thirty-two or thirty-three years 
 old. As to this, Iren&aelig;us, one of the first fathers, with this 
 passage supports the tradition which he says he had from some that had 
 conversed with St. John, that our Saviour lived to be fifty years old,
 which he contends for, <I>Advers. H&aelig;res.</I> lib. 2, cap. 39, 40.
 See what little credit is to be given to tradition; and, as to this 
 here, the Jews spoke <I>at random;</I> some year they would mention, 
 and therefore pitched upon one that they thought he was far enough 
 short of; he did not look to be forty, but they were sure he could not 
 be fifty, much less contemporary with Abraham. Old age is reckoned to 
 begin at fifty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:47">Num. iv. 47</A>),

 so that they meant no more than this, "Thou art not to be reckoned an 
 old man; many of us are much thy seniors, and yet pretend not to have 
 seen Abraham." Some think that his countenance was so altered, with 
 grief and watching, that, together with the gravity of his aspect, it 
 made him look like a man of fifty years old: <I>his visage was so 
 marred,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:14">Isa. lii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Our Saviour gives an effectual answer to this cavil, by a solemn 
 assertion of his own seniority even to Abraham himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>):

 "<I>Verily, verily, I say unto you;</I> I do not only say it in private 
 to my own disciples, who will be sure to say as I say, but <I>to 
 you</I> my enemies and persecutors; I say it to your faces, take it how 
 you will: <I>Before Abraham was, I am;</I>" <B><I>prin Abraam 
 genesthai, ego eimi</I></B>, <I>Before Abraham was made or born, I 
 am.</I> The change of the word is observable, and bespeaks Abraham a 
 creature, and himself the Creator; well therefore might he make himself 
 <I>greater</I> than Abraham. <I>Before Abraham he was, First,</I> As 
 God. <I>I am,</I> is the name of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:14">Exod. iii. 14</A>);

 it denotes his self-existence; he does not say, <I>I was,</I> but <I>I 
 am,</I> for he is the first and the last, immutably the same 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:8">Rev. i. 8</A>);

 thus he was not only before Abraham, but before <I>all worlds,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1,Pr+8:23"><I>ch.</I> i. 1; Prov. viii. 23</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> As Mediator. He was the appointed Messiah, long
 before Abraham; the <I>Lamb slain from the foundation of the world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:8">Rev. xiii. 8</A>),

 the channel of conveyance of light, life, and love from God to man. 
 This supposes his divine nature, that he is the same in himself from 
 eternity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:8">Heb. xiii. 8</A>),

 and that he is the same to man ever since the fall; he was made of God 
 wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, to Adam, and 
 Abel, and Enoch, and Noah, and Shem, and all the patriarchs that lived 
 and died by faith in him before Abraham was born. Abraham was the root 
 of the Jewish nation, the rock out of which they were hewn. If Christ 
 was before Abraham, his doctrine and religion were no novelty, but 
 were, in the substance of them, prior to Judaism, and ought to take 
 place of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] This great word ended the dispute <I>abruptly,</I> and put a 
 period to it: they could bear to hear no more from him, and he needed 
 to say no more to them, having witnessed this good confession, which 
 was sufficient to support all his claims. One would think that Christ's 
 discourse, in which shone so much both of grace and glory, should have 
 captivated them all; but their inveterate prejudice against the holy 
 spiritual doctrine and law of Christ, which were so contrary to their 
 pride and worldliness, baffled all the methods of conviction. Now was 
 fulfilled that prophecy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1,2">Mal. iii. 1, 2</A>),

 that when the messenger of the covenant should <I>come to his 
 temple</I> they <I>would not abide the day of his coming,</I> because 
 he would be <I>like a refiner's fire.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> How they were <I>enraged</I> at Christ for what he said: 
 <I>They took up stones to cast at him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>.

 Perhaps they looked upon him as a blasphemer, and such were indeed to 
 be stoned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:16">Lev. xxiv. 16</A>);

 but they must be first legally tried and convicted. Farewell justice 
 and order if every man pretend to execute a law at his pleasure. 
 Besides, they had said but just now that he was a distracted 
 crack-brained man, and if so it was against all reason and equity to 
 punish him as a malefactor for what he said. <I>They took up 
 stones.</I> Dr. Lightfoot will tell you how they came to have stones so 
 ready in the temple; they had workmen at this time repairing the 
 temple, or making some additions, and the pieces of stone which they 
 hewed off served for this purpose. See here the desperate power of sin 
 and Satan in and over the children of disobedience. Who would think 
 that ever there should be such wickedness as this in men, such an open 
 and daring rebellion against one that undeniably proved himself to be 
 the Son of God? Thus every one has a stone to throw at his holy 
 religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:22">Acts xxviii. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> How he made his <I>escape</I> out of their hands. 

 1. He <I>absconded;</I> Jesus <I>hid himself;</I>
 <B><I>ekrybe</I></B>--<I>he was hid,</I> either by the crowd of those 
 that wished well to him, to shelter him (he that ought to have been 
 upon a throne, high and lifted up, is content to be <I>lost in a 
 crowd</I>); or perhaps he concealed himself behind some of the walls or 
 pillars of the temple (<I>in the secret of his tabernacle he shall hide 
 me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:5">Ps. xxvii. 5</A>);

 or by a divine power, casting a mist before their eyes, he made himself
 invisible to them. <I>When the wicked rise a man is hidden,</I> a wise
 and good man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:12,28">Prov. xxviii. 12, 28</A>.

 Not that Christ was afraid or ashamed to stand by what he had said, but 
 his <I>hour was not yet come,</I> and he would countenance the flight 
 of his ministers and people in times of persecution, when they are 
 called to it. The Lord hid Jeremiah and Baruch,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:26">Jer. xxxvi. 26</A>.

 2. He <I>departed,</I> he <I>went out of the temple,</I> going
 <I>through the midst of them,</I> undiscovered, and <I>so passed 
 by.</I> This was not a cowardly inglorious flight, nor such as argued 
 either guilt or fear. It was foretold concerning him that he should not 
 fail nor be discouraged,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:4">Isa. xlii. 4</A>.

 But,

 (1.) It was an instance of his power over his enemies, and that they
 could do no more against him than he gave them leave to do; by which it 
 appears that when afterwards he was taken in their pits he <I>offered 
 himself,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:18"><I>ch.</I> x. 18</A>.

 They now thought they had made sure of him and yet he <I>passed through
 the midst</I> of them, either their eyes being blinded or their hands 
 tied, and thus he left them to fume, like a lion <I>disappointed of his 
 prey.</I> 

 (2.) It was an instance of his prudent provision for his own safety, 
 when he knew that his work was not done, nor his testimony finished; 
 thus he gave an example to his own rule, <I>When they persecute you in 
 one city flee to another;</I> nay, if occasion be, to a 
 <I>wilderness,</I> for so Elijah did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:3,4">1 Kings xix. 3, 4</A>),
 
 and the woman, the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:6">Rev. xii. 6</A>.

 When they took up loose stones to throw at Christ, he could have 
 commanded the fixed stones, which did <I>cry out of the wall</I> 
 against them, to avenge his cause, or the earth to open and swallow 
 them up; but he chose to accommodate himself to the state he was in, to 
 make the example imitable by the prudence of his followers, without a 
 miracle.

 (3.) It was a righteous deserting of those who (worse than the
 Gadarenes, who <I>prayed him to depart</I>) stoned him from among them.
 Christ will not long stay with those who bid him be gone. Christ did 
 again visit the temple after this; as one <I>loth to depart,</I> he 
 <I>bade oft farewell;</I> but at last he abandoned it for ever, and 
 left it <I>desolate.</I> Christ now <I>went through</I> the midst of 
 the Jews, and none of them courted his stay, nor stirred up himself to 
 take hold of him, but were even content to let him go. Note, God never 
 forsakes any till they have first provoked him to withdraw, and will 
 have none of him. Calvin observes that these chief priests, when they 
 had driven Christ out of the temple, valued themselves on the 
 possession they kept of it: "But," says he, "those deceive themselves 
 who are proud of a church or temple which Christ has forsaken." 
 <I>Longe falluntur, cum templum se habere putant Deo vacuum.</I> When 
 Christ left them it is said that he passed by silently and unobserved; 
 <B><I>paregen houtos</I></B>, so that they were not aware of him. Note, 
 Christ's departures from a church, or a particular soul, are often 
 <I>secret,</I> and not soon taken notice of. As <I>the kingdom of God 
 comes not,</I> so it <I>goes not, with observation.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:20">Judg. xvi. 20</A>.
 
 <I>Samson wist not that the Lord was departed from him.</I> Thus it was
 with these forsaken Jews, God left them, and they never missed him.</P>
