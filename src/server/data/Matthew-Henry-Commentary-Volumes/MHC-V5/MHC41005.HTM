 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the
 country of the Gadarenes.
 &nbsp; 2  And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met
 him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
 &nbsp; 3  Who had <I>his</I> dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind
 him, no, not with chains:
 &nbsp; 4  Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains,
 and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters
 broken in pieces: neither could any <I>man</I> tame him.
 &nbsp; 5  And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in
 the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
 &nbsp; 6  But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
 &nbsp; 7  And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with
 thee, Jesus, <I>thou</I> Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by
 God, that thou torment me not.
 &nbsp; 8  For he said unto him, Come out of the man, <I>thou</I> unclean
 spirit.
 &nbsp; 9  And he asked him, What <I>is</I> thy name? And he answered,
 saying, My name <I>is</I> Legion: for we are many.
 &nbsp; 10  And he besought him much that he would not send them away
 out of the country.
 &nbsp; 11  Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of
 swine feeding.
 &nbsp; 12  And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the
 swine, that we may enter into them.
 &nbsp; 13  And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits
 went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently
 down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;)
 and were choked in the sea.
 &nbsp; 14  And they that fed the swine fled, and told <I>it</I> in the city,
 and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was
 done.
 &nbsp; 15  And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with
 the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his
 right mind: and they were afraid.
 &nbsp; 16  And they that saw <I>it</I> told them how it befell to him that
 was possessed with the devil, and <I>also</I> concerning the swine.
 &nbsp; 17  And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
 &nbsp; 18  And when he was come into the ship, he that had been
 possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.
 &nbsp; 19  Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home
 to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done
 for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.
 &nbsp; 20  And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great
 things Jesus had done for him: and all <I>men</I> did marvel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an instance of Christ's dispossessing the strong man 
 armed, and disposing of him as he pleased, to make it appear that he 
 was <I>stronger than he.</I> This he did when he was come <I>to the 
 other side,</I> whither he went through a storm; his business there was 
 to rescue this poor creature out of the hands of Satan, and when he had 
 done that, he returned. Thus he came from heaven to earth, and 
 returned, in a storm, to redeem a remnant of mankind out of the hands 
 of the devil, though but a <I>little remnant,</I> and did not think his 
 pains <I>ill bestowed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In Matthew, they were said to be <I>two</I> possessed with devils; here 
 it is said to be a <I>man</I> possessed with an unclean spirit. If 
 there were <I>two,</I> there was one, and Mark doth not say that there 
 was <I>but one;</I> so that this difference cannot give us any just 
 offence; it is probable that one of them was much more remarkable than 
 the other, and said what was said. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The miserable condition that this poor creature was in; he was under 
 the power of an <I>unclean spirit,</I> the devil got possession of him, 
 and the effect of it was not, as in many, a silent melancholy, but a 
 raging frenzy; he was raving mad; his condition seems to have been 
 worse than any of the possessed, that were Christ's patients.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He had <I>his dwelling among the tombs,</I> among the graves of dead 
 people. Their tombs were out of the cities, in <I>desolate places</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:14">Job iii. 14</A>);

 which gave the devil great advantage: for <I>woe to him that is 
 alone.</I> Perhaps the devil drove him to <I>the tombs,</I> to make 
 people fancy that the souls of the dead were turned into d&aelig;mons, 
 and did what mischief was done, so to excuse themselves from it. The 
 touch of a grave was polluting, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+19:16">Num. xix. 16</A>.

 The <I>unclean spirit</I> drives people into that company that is
 <I>defiling,</I> and so keeps possession of them. Christ, by rescuing 
 souls out of Satan's power, <I>saves the living from among the 
 dead.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was very strong and ungovernable; <I>No man could bind him,</I> 
 as it is requisite both for their own good, and for the safety of 
 others, that those who are distracted should be. Not only cords would 
 not hold him, but <I>chains</I> and <I>fetters of iron</I> would not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 Very deplorable is the case of such as <I>need to be</I> thus 
 <I>bound,</I> and of all miserable people in this world they are most 
 to be pitied; but his case was worst of all, in whom the devil was so 
 strong, that he could not be <I>bound.</I> This sets forth the sad 
 condition of those souls in which the devil has dominion; those 
 <I>children of disobedience,</I> in whom that unclean spirit works.
 Some notoriously wilful sinners are like this madman; all are herein 
 <I>like the horse and the mule,</I> that they need to be <I>held in 
 with bit and bridle;</I> but some are like the <I>wild ass,</I> that 
 will not be so held. The commands and curses of the law are as 
 <I>chains</I> and <I>fetters,</I> to restrain sinners from their wicked 
 courses; but they <I>break those bands in sunder,</I> and it is an 
 evidence of the power of the devil in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He was a terror and torment to himself and to all about him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 The devil is a <I>cruel</I> master to those that are <I>led captive</I> 
 by him, a perfect tyrant; this wretched creature was <I>night and day 
 in the mountains and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with 
 stones,</I> either bemoaning his own deplorable case, or in a rage and 
 indignation against heaven. Men in frenzies often wound and destroy 
 themselves; what is a man, when reason is <I>de</I>throned and Satan 
 <I>en</I>throned? The worshippers of Baal in their fury <I>cut
 themselves,</I> like this madman in his. The voice of God is, <I>Do 
 thyself no harm;</I> the voice of Satan is, <I>Do thyself all the harm 
 thou canst;</I> yet God's word is despised, and Satan's regarded.
 Perhaps his <I>cutting himself with stones</I> was only cutting his 
 feet with the sharp stones he ran barefoot upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His application to Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 <I>When he saw Jesus afar off,</I> coming ashore, he <I>ran, and 
 worshipped him.</I> He usually <I>ran upon</I> others with <I>rage,</I> 
 but he <I>ran to</I> Christ with <I>reverence.</I> That was done by an 
 invisible hand of Christ, which could not be done with chains and 
 fetters; his fury was all on a sudden curbed. Even the devil, in this 
 poor creature, was forced to tremble before Christ, and bow to him: or, 
 rather, the poor man came, and <I>worshipped Christ,</I> in a sense of 
 the need he had of his help, the power of Satan in and over him being, 
 for this instant, suspended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The word of command Christ gave to the unclean spirit, to quit his 
 possession 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 <I>Come out of him, thou unclean spirit.</I> He made the man desirous 
 to be relieved, when he enabled him to <I>run, and worship him,</I> and 
 then put forth his power for his relief. If Christ <I>work in us</I> 
 heartily to pray for a deliverance from Satan, he will work for us that 
 deliverance. Here is an instance of the power and authority with which 
 Christ <I>commanded the unclean spirits, and they obeyed him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:27"><I>ch.</I> i. 27</A>.

 He said, <I>Come out of the man.</I> The design of Christ's gospel is
 to <I>expel</I> unclean spirits out of the souls of people; "<I>Come 
 out of the man, thou unclean spirit,</I> that the Holy Spirit may 
 enter, may take possession of the heart, and have dominion in it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The dread which the devil had of Christ. The <I>man ran,</I> and 
 <I>worshipped Christ;</I> but it was the devil in the man, that 
 <I>cried with a loud voice</I> (making use of the poor man's tongue), 
 <I>What have I to do with thee?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Just as that other unclean spirit,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:24"><I>ch.</I> i. 24</A>.

 1. He calls God the <I>most high God,</I> above all other gods. By the
 name <I>Elion--the Most High,</I> God was <I>known</I> among the 
 Ph&oelig;nicians, and the other nations that bordered upon Israel; and by 
 that name the devil calls him. 

 2. He owns Jesus to be the <I>Son of God.</I> Note, It is no strange 
 thing to hear the best words drop from the worst mouths. There is such 
 a way of saying this as none can attain to but <I>by the Holy Ghost</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:3">1 Cor. xii. 3</A>);

 yet it may be said, after a sort, by the <I>unclean spirit.</I> There 
 is no judging of men by their loose sayings; but by their fruits ye 
 shall know them. Piety from the teeth outward is an easy thing. The 
 most fair-spoken hypocrite cannot say better than to call Jesus the Son 
 of God, and yet that the devil did. 

 3. He disowns any design against Christ; "<I>What have I to do with
 thee?</I> I have no need of thee, I pretend to none; I desire to have 
 nothing to do with thee; I <I>cannot stand</I> before thee, and 
 <I>would not</I> fall." 

 4. He deprecates his wrath; I <I>adjure thee,</I> that is, "I
 earnestly beseech thee, by all that is sacred, I beg of thee for God's 
 sake, by whose permission I have got possession of this man, that, 
 though thou drive me out hence, yet that thou <I>torment me not,</I> 
 that thou do not restrain me from doing mischief somewhere else; though 
 I know I am <I>sentenced,</I> yet let me not be <I>sent</I> to the 
 chains of darkness, or hindered from going to and fro, to 
 <I>devour.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The account Christ took from this unclean spirit of his name. This 
 we had not in Matthew. Christ asked him, <I>What is thy name?</I> Not 
 but that Christ could call all the <I>fallen</I> stars, as well as the 
 <I>morning</I> stars, by their names; but he demands this, that the 
 standers by might be affected with the vast numbers and power of those 
 malignant infernal spirits, as they had reason to be, when the answer 
 was, <I>My name is Legion, for we are many;</I> a <I>legion</I> of 
 soldiers among the Romans consisted, some say, of six thousand men, 
 others of twelve thousand and five hundred; but the number of a legion 
 with them, like that of a regiment with us, was not always the same. 
 Now this intimates that the devils, the infernal powers, are, 

 1. <I>Military</I> powers; a legion is a number of soldiers in arms.
 The devils war against God and his glory, Christ and his gospel, men 
 and their holiness and happiness. They are such as we are to 
 <I>resist</I> and <I>wrestle against,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:12">Eph. vi. 12</A>.

 2. That they are <I>numerous;</I> he <I>owns,</I> or rather he
 <I>boasts--We are many;</I> as if he hoped to be <I>too many</I> for 
 Christ himself to deal with. What multitudes of apostate spirits were 
 there, and all enemies to God and man; when here were a legion posted 
 to keep garrison in one poor wretched creature against Christ! Many 
 there are that rise up against us. 

 3. That they are <I>unanimous;</I> they are <I>many</I> devils, and yet
 but <I>one legion</I> engaged in the same wicked cause; and therefore 
 that cavil of the Pharisees, which supposed Satan to cast out Satan, 
 and to be divided against himself, was altogether groundless. It was 
 not <I>one</I> of this legion that betrayed the rest, for they all 
 said, as one man, <I>What have I to do with thee?</I> 

 4. That they are very <I>powerful;</I> Who can stand before a
 <I>legion?</I> We are not a match for our spiritual enemies, in our own 
 strength; but <I>in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</I> we 
 shall be able to <I>stand against them,</I> though there are legions of 
 them. 

 5. That there is <I>order</I> among them, as there is in a
 <I>legion;</I> there are <I>principalities, and powers, and rulers of 
 the darkness of this world,</I> which supposes that there are those of 
 a lower rank; the <I>devil</I> and his angels; the <I>dragon</I> and 
 his; the prince of the devils and his subjects: which makes those 
 enemies the more formidable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The request of this legion, that Christ would suffer them to go 
 into a herd of swine that was <I>feeding nigh unto the mountains</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 those mountains which the demoniacs haunted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Their request was,
 
 1. That he <I>would not send them away out of the country</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);
 
 not only that he would not <I>commit</I> them, or <I>confine</I> them, 
 to their infernal prison, and so <I>torment them before the time;</I> 
 but that he would not <I>banish</I> them <I>that country,</I> as justly 
 he might, because in this poor man they had been such a terror to it, 
 and done so much mischief. They seem to have had a particular affection 
 for <I>that country;</I> or, rather, a particular spite to it; and to 
 have liberty to walk <I>to and fro through</I> the rest of <I>the 
 earth,</I> will not serve 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:7">Job i. 7</A>),

 unless the <I>range of those mountains</I> be allowed them for their 
 pasture, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:8">Job xxxix. 8</A>.

 But why would they abide in <I>that country?</I> Grotius saith, Because
 in <I>that country</I> there were many <I>apostate Jews,</I> who had 
 thrown themselves out of the covenant of God, and had thereby given 
 Satan power over them. And some suggest, that, having by experience got 
 the knowledge of the dispositions and manners of the people of that 
 country, they could the more effectually do them mischief by their 
 temptations.

 2. That he would suffer them to <I>enter into the swine,</I> by
 destroying which they hoped to do more mischief to the souls of all the 
 people in the country, than they could by entering into the body of any 
 particular person, which therefore they did not ask leave to do, for 
 they knew Christ would not grant it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The permission Christ gave them to enter into the swine, and the 
 immediate destruction of the swine thereby; <I>He gave them leave</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 he did not forbid or restrain them, he let them do as they had a mind. 
 Thus he would let the Gadarenes see what powerful spiteful enemies 
 devils are, that they might thereby be induced to make him their 
 Friend, who alone was able to control and conquer them, and had made it 
 appear that he was so. Immediately the <I>unclean spirits entered into 
 the swine,</I> which by the law were unclean creatures, and naturally 
 love to <I>wallow in the mire,</I> the fittest place for them. Those 
 that, like the swine, delight in <I>the mire</I> of sensual lusts, are 
 fit habitations for Satan, and are, like Babylon, the <I>hold of every 
 foul spirit,</I> and a <I>cage of every unclean and hateful bird</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:2">Rev. xviii. 2</A>),

 as pure souls are habitations of the Holy Spirit. The consequence of 
 the devils entering into the swine, was, that they all <I>ran mad</I> 
 presently, and ran headlong into the adjoining sea, where they were all 
 drowned, to the number of <I>two thousand.</I> The man they possessed 
 did only <I>cut himself,</I> for God had said, <I>He is in your hands, 
 only save his life.</I> But thereby it appeared, that, if he had not 
 been so restrained, the poor man would have <I>drowned himself.</I> See 
 how much we are indebted to the providence of God, and the ministration 
 of good angels, for our preservation from malignant spirits.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. The report of all this dispersed through the country immediately. 
 They that <I>fed the swine,</I> hastened to the owners, to give an 
 account of their charge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This drew the people together, to see what was done: and, 

 1. When they saw how wonderfully the poor man was cured, they hence 
 conceived a <I>veneration for Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 They saw him that was <I>possessed with the devil,</I> and knew him 
 well enough, by the same token that they had many a time been 
 frightened at the sight of him; and were now as much surprised to see 
 him <I>sitting clothed and in his right mind;</I> when Satan was cast 
 out, he came to himself, and was his own man presently. Note, Those who 
 are grave and sober, and live by rule and with consideration, thereby 
 make it appear that by the power of Christ the devil's power is broken 
 in their souls. The sight of this <I>made them afraid;</I> it
 astonished them, and forced them to own the power of Christ, and that 
 he is <I>worthy to be feared.</I> But, 

 2. When they found that their swine were lost, they thence conceived a
 <I>dislike of Christ,</I> and wished to have rather his room than his 
 company; they prayed him to <I>depart out of their coasts,</I> for they 
 think not any good he can do them sufficient to make them amends for 
 the loss of so many swine, fat swine, it may be, and ready for the 
 market. Now the devils had what they would have; for by no handle do 
 these evil spirits more effectually manage sinful souls than by that of 
 the love of the world. They were afraid of some further punishment, if
 Christ should tarry among them, whereas, if they would but part with 
 their sins, he had life and happiness for them; but, being loth to quit 
 either their sins or their swine, they chose rather to abandon their 
 Saviour. Thus <I>they</I> do, who, rather than let go a base lust,
 will throw away their interest in Christ, and their expectations from 
 him. They should rather have argued, "If he has such a power as this 
 over devils and all creatures, it is good having him our Friend; if the 
 devils have leave to tarry <I>in our country</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 let us entreat <I>him</I> to tarry in it too, who alone can control 
 them." But, instead of this, they wished him further off. Such strange 
 misconstructions do carnal hearts make of the just judgments of God; 
 instead of being by them driven to him as they ought, they set him at 
 so much the greater distance; though he hath said, <I>Provoke me not, 
 and I will do you no hurt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:6">Jer. xxv. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. An account of the conduct of the poor man after his deliverance. 

 1. He <I>desired that he might go along with Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 perhaps for fear lest the evil spirit should again seize him; or, 
 rather, that he might receive instruction from him, being unwilling to 
 stay among those heathenish people that desired him to depart. Those 
 that are freed from the evil spirit, cannot but covet acquaintance and 
 fellowship with Christ. 

 2. Christ <I>would not suffer him</I> to go with him, lest it should
 savour of ostentation, and to let him know that he could both protect 
 and instruct him at a distance. And besides, he had other work for him 
 to do; he must go home to his friends, and tell them what <I>great 
 things the Lord had done for him,</I> the Lord Jesus had done; that 
 Christ might be honoured, and his neighbours and friends might be 
 edified, and invited to believe in Christ. He must take particular 
 notice rather of Christ's <I>pity</I> than of his <I>power,</I> for 
 that is it which especially he glories in; he must tell them what 
 <I>compassion</I> the Lord had had on him in his misery.

 3. The man, in a transport of joy, proclaimed, all the country over,
 what <I>great things Jesus had done for him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 This is a debt we owe both to Christ and to our brethren, that he may 
 be glorified and they edified. And see what was the effect of it; 
 <I>All men did marvel,</I> but few went any further. Many that cannot 
 but wonder at the works of Christ, yet do not, as they ought, <I>wonder 
 after him.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other
 side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the
 sea.
 &nbsp; 22  And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the
 synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his
 feet,
 &nbsp; 23  And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth
 at the point of death: <I>I pray thee,</I> come and lay thy hands on
 her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.
 &nbsp; 24  And <I>Jesus</I> went with him; and much people followed him, and
 thronged him.
 &nbsp; 25  And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve
 years,
 &nbsp; 26  And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had
 spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew
 worse,
 &nbsp; 27  When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and
 touched his garment.
 &nbsp; 28  For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be
 whole.
 &nbsp; 29  And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and
 she felt in <I>her</I> body that she was healed of that plague.
 &nbsp; 30  And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had
 gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who
 touched my clothes?
 &nbsp; 31  And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude
 thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
 &nbsp; 32  And he looked round about to see her that had done this
 thing.
 &nbsp; 33  But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done
 in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the
 truth.
 &nbsp; 34  And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee
 whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Gadarenes having desired Christ to leave their country, he did not 
 stay to trouble them long, but presently went by water, as he came, 
 back <I>to the other side</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 and there <I>much people gathered to him.</I> Note, If there be some 
 that reject Christ, yet there are others that receive him, and bid him 
 welcome. A despised gospel will <I>cross the water,</I> and go where it 
 will have better entertainment. Now among the many that applied 
 themselves to him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is one, that comes <I>openly</I> to <I>beg</I> a cure for a 
 sick child; and it is no less a person than one of the <I>rulers of the 
 synagogue,</I> one that presided in the synagogue-worship or, as some 
 think, one of the judges of the consistory court, which was in every 
 city, consisting of <I>twenty-three.</I> He was not named in Matthew, 
 he is here, <I>Jairus,</I> or <I>Jair,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:3">Judg. x. 3</A>.

 He addressed himself to Christ, though a ruler, with great humility and
 reverence; <I>When he saw him, he fell at his feet,</I> giving honour 
 to him as one really greater than he appeared to be; and with great 
 importunity, he <I>besought him greatly,</I> as one in earnest, as one 
 that not only valued the mercy he came for, but that knew he could 
 obtain it no where else. The case is this, He has a <I>little 
 daughter,</I> about twelve years old, the darling of the family, and 
 she <I>lies a dying;</I> but he believes that if Christ will but come, 
 and <I>lay his hands upon her,</I> she will return even from the gates 
 of the grave. He said, at first, when he came, <I>She lies a dying</I> 
 (so Mark); but afterward, upon fresh information sent him, he saith, 
 <I>She is even now dead</I> (so Matthew); but he still prosecutes his 
 suit; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:42-49">Luke viii. 42-49</A>.

 Christ readily agreed, and went with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is another, that comes <I>clandestinely</I> to <I>steal</I> a 
 cure (if I may so say) for herself; and she got the relief she came
 for. This cure was wrought by <I>the way,</I> as he was going to raise 
 the ruler's daughter, and was followed by a crowd. See how Christ 
 improved his time, and lost none of the precious moments of it. Many of 
 his discourses, and some of his miracles, are dates <I>by the 
 way-side;</I> we should be doing good, not only when we <I>sit in the 
 house,</I> but when we <I>walk by the way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:7">Deut. vi. 7</A>.

 Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The piteous case of this poor woman. She had a constant <I>issue of 
 blood</I> upon her, for <I>twelve years,</I> which had thrown her, no 
 doubt, into great weakness, had embittered the comfort of her life, and 
 threatened to be her death in a little time. She had had the best 
 advice of physicians, that she could get, and had made use of the many 
 medicines and methods they prescribed: as long as she had any thing to 
 give them, they had kept her in hopes that they could cure her; but now 
 that she had spent all she had among them, they gave her up as 
 incurable. See here, 

 (1.) That skin for skin, and all that a man has, will be give for life 
 and health; she spent all she had upon physicians. 

 (2.) It is ill with those patients whose physicians are their worst 
 disease; who <I>suffer</I> by their physicians, instead of being 
 relieved by them.

 (3.) Those that are not <I>bettered</I> by medicines, commonly <I>grow 
 worse,</I> and the disease gets the more ground. 

 (4.) It is usual with people not to apply themselves to Christ, till 
 they have tried in vain all other helpers, and find them, as certainly 
 they will, <I>physicians of no value.</I> And he will be found a 
 <I>sure refuge,</I> even to those who make him their <I>last 
 refuge.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The strong faith that she had in the power of Christ to heal her; 
 she said within herself, though it doth not appear that she was 
 encouraged by any preceding instance to say it, <I>If I may but touch 
 his clothes, I shall be whole,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 She believed that he cured, not as a prophet, by virtue <I>derived</I> 
 from God, but as the Son of God, by a virtue <I>inherent</I> in 
 himself. Her case was such as she could not in modesty tell him 
 publicly, as others did their grievances, and therefore a private cure 
 was what she wished for, and her faith was suited to her case.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The wonderful effect produced by it; <I>She came in the</I> crowd 
 <I>behind</I> him, and with much ado got to <I>touch his garment,</I> 
 and immediately she felt the cure wrought, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 The flux of blood was <I>dried up,</I> and she felt herself perfectly 
 well all over her, as well as ever she was in her life, in an instant; 
 by this it appears that the cure was altogether miraculous; for those 
 that in such cases are cured by natural means, recover their strength 
 slowly and gradually, and not <I>per saltum--all at once;</I> but <I>as 
 for God, his work is perfect.</I> Note, Those whom Christ heals of the 
 disease of sin, that bloody issue, cannot but experience in themselves 
 a universal change for the better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Christ's enquiry after his concealed patient, and the encouragement 
 he gave her, upon the discovery of her; Christ <I>knew in himself that 
 virtue had gone out of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He knew it not by any deficiency of spirits, through the exhausting of 
 this virtue, but rather by an agility of spirits, in the exerting of 
 it, and the innate and inseparable pleasure he had in doing good. And 
 being desirous to see his patient, he asked, not in displeasure, as one 
 affronted, but in tenderness, as one concerned, <I>Who touched my 
 clothes?</I> The disciples, not without a show of rudeness and 
 indecency, almost ridiculed his question

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>);

 <I>The multitudes throng thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</I> As 
 if it had been an improper question. Christ passed by the affront, and 
 <I>looks around</I> to <I>see her that had done this thing;</I> not 
 that he might <I>blame</I> her for her presumption, but that he might 
 <I>commend</I> and <I>encourage</I> her faith, and by his own act and 
 deed might <I>warrant</I> and <I>confirm</I> the cure, and 
 <I>ratify</I> to her that which she had <I>surreptitiously</I> 
 obtained. He needed not that any should inform him, for he had 
 presently his eye upon her. Note, As secret acts of sin, so secret acts 
 of faith, are known to the Lord Jesus, and are under his eye. If 
 believers derive virtue from Christ ever so closely, he knows it, and 
 is pleased with it. The poor woman, hereupon, presented herself to the 
 Lord Jesus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 <I>fearing and trembling,</I> not knowing how he would take it. Note, 
 Christ's patients are often trembling, when they have reason to be 
 triumphing. She might have come boldly, <I>knowing what was done in
 her;</I> yet, <I>knowing that,</I> she <I>fears</I> and 
 <I>trembles.</I> It was a <I>surprise,</I> and was not yet, as it 
 should have been, a <I>pleasing</I> surprise. However, she <I>fell down 
 before him.</I> Note, There is nothing better for those that fear and 
 tremble, than to throw themselves at the feet of the Lord Jesus; to 
 humble themselves before him, and refer themselves to him. And she 
 <I>told him all the truth.</I> Note, We must not be ashamed to own the 
 secret transactions between Christ and our souls; but, when called to 
 it, mention, to his praise, and the encouragement of others, what he 
 has done for our souls, and the experience we have had of <I>healing 
 virtue</I> derived from him. And the consideration of this, that 
 nothing can be hid from Christ, should engage us to confess all to him.
 See what an encouraging word he gave her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 <I>Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole.</I> Note, Christ puts 
 honour upon faith, because faith gives honour to Christ. But see how 
 <I>what is done by faith</I> on earth is ratified in heaven; Christ 
 saith, <I>Be whole of thy disease.</I> Note, If our faith sets the seal 
 of its <I>amen</I> to the power and promise of God, saying, "So it is, 
 and so let it be to me;" God's grace will set the seal of its 
 <I>amen</I> to the prayers and hopes of faith, saying, "So be it, and 
 so it shall be, to thee." And therefore, "<I>Go in peace;</I> be well 
 satisfied that thy cure is honestly come by, is effectually wrought, 
 and take the comfort of it." Note, They that by faith are healed of 
 their spiritual diseases, have reason to <I>go in peace.</I></P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>35  While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the
 synagogue's <I>house certain</I> which said, Thy daughter is dead: why
 troublest thou the Master any further?
 &nbsp; 36  As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith
 unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.
 &nbsp; 37  And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James,
 and John the brother of James.
 &nbsp; 38  And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue,
 and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.
 &nbsp; 39  And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye
 this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
 &nbsp; 40  And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all
 out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them
 that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.
 &nbsp; 41  And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her,
 Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto
 thee, arise.
 &nbsp; 42  And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was
 <I>of the age</I> of twelve years. And they were astonished with a
 great astonishment.
 &nbsp; 43  And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and
 commanded that something should be given her to eat.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Diseases and deaths came into the world by the sin and disobedience of 
 the first Adam; but by the grace of the second Adam both are conquered. 
 Christ, having healed an incurable disease, here goes on to triumph 
 over death, as in the beginning of the chapter he had triumphed over an 
 outrageous devil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The melancholy news is brought to Jairus, that his <I>daughter is 
 dead,</I> and therefore, if Christ be as other physicians, he comes too 
 late. While there is life, there is hope, and room for the use of 
 means; but when life is gone, it is past recall; <I>Why troublest thou 
 the Master any further?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Ordinarily, the proper thought in this case, is, "The matter is 
 determined, the will of God is done, and I submit, I acquiesce; <I>The 
 Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. While the child was alive, I
 fasted and wept; for I said, Who can tell but God will yet be gracious 
 to me,</I> and <I>the child shall live?</I> But <I>now that it is dead, 
 wherefore should I weep?</I> I <I>shall go to it, but it shall not 
 return to me.</I>" With such words we should <I>quiet ourselves</I> at 
 such a time, that our souls may be <I>as a child that is weaned from 
 his mother:</I> but there the case was extraordinary; the death of the 
 child doth not, as usually, put an end to the narrative.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ encourageth the afflicted father yet to hope that his 
 application to Christ on the behalf of his child should not be in vain. 
 Christ had staid to work a cure by the way, but he shall be no sufferer 
 by that, nor loser by the gain of others; <I>Be not afraid, only 
 believe.</I> We may suppose Jairus at a pause, whether he should ask 
 Christ to go on or no; but have we not as much occasion for the grace 
 of God, and his consolations, and consequently of the prayers of our 
 ministers and Christian friends, when death is in the house, as when 
 sickness is? Christ therefore soon determines this matter; "<I>Be not 
 afraid</I> that my coming will be to no purpose, only believe that I 
 will make it turn to a good account." Note, 

 1. We must not despair concerning our relations that are dead, nor
 <I>sorrow</I> for them <I>as those that have no hope.</I> See what is 
 said to Rachel, who <I>refused to be comforted concerning her 
 children,</I> upon the presumption that they <I>were not; Refrain thy 
 voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; for there is hope in 
 thine end, that thy children shall come again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:16,17">Jer. xxxi. 16, 17</A>.
 
 Therefore fear not, faint not.

 2. Faith is the only remedy against disquieting grief and fear at such
 a time: let that silence them, <I>Only believe.</I> Keep up a 
 confidence in Christ, and a dependence upon him, and he will do what is 
 for the best. Believe the resurrection, and then be not afraid.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He went with a select company to the house where the dead child 
 was. He had, by the crowd that attended him, given advantage to the 
 poor woman he last healed, and, having done that, now he shook off the 
 crowd, and <I>suffered no man to follow him</I> (to <I>follow with 
 him,</I> so the word is), but his three bosom-disciples, Peter, and 
 James, and John; a competent number to be witnesses of the miracle, but 
 not such a number as that his taking them with him might look like 
 vainglory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He raised the dead child to life; the circumstances of the 
 narrative here are much the same as we had them in Matthew; only here 
 we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the child was extremely well beloved, for the relations and 
 neighbours <I>wept and wailed greatly.</I> It is very afflictive when 
 that which is come forth like a flower is so <I>soon cut down,</I> and 
 withereth before it is grown up; when that grieves us, of which we 
 said, <I>This same shall comfort us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That it was evident beyond dispute, that the child was really and 
 truly dead. Their <I>laughing</I> Christ to <I>scorn,</I> for saying, 
 <I>She is not dead, but sleepeth,</I> though highly reprehensible, 
 serves for the proof of this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That Christ put those out as unworthy to be witnesses of the 
 miracle, who were noisy in their sorrow, and were so ignorant in the 
 things of God, as not to understand him when he spoke of death as a 
 <I>sleep,</I> or so scornful, as to ridicule him for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That he took the parents of the child to be witnesses of the 
 miracle, because in it he had an eye to <I>their faith,</I> and 
 designed it for <I>their</I> comfort, who were the <I>true,</I> for 
 they were the <I>silent</I> mourners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That Christ raised the child to life by a word of power, which is 
 recorded here, and recorded in Syriac, the language in which Christ 
 spoke, for the greater certainty of the thing; <I>Talitha, cumi; 
 Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise.</I> Dr. Lightfoot saith, It was 
 customary with the Jews, when they gave physic to one that was 
 <I>sick,</I> to say, <I>Arise from thy disease;</I> meaning, <I>We 
 wish</I> thou mayest arise: but to one that was <I>dead,</I> Christ 
 said, <I>Arise from the dead;</I> meaning, <I>I command</I> that thou 
 arise; nay, there is more in it--the dead have not power to arise,
 therefore power goes along with this word, to make it effectual. <I>Da 
 quod jubes, et jube quod vis--Give what thou commandest, and command
 what thou wilt.</I> Christ works while he commands, and works by the 
 command, and therefore may command what he pleaseth, even the dead to 
 arise. Such is the gospel call to those that are by nature dead in 
 trespasses and sins, and can no more rise from that death by their own 
 power, than this child could; and yet that word, <I>Awake, and arise 
 from the dead,</I> is neither vain, nor in vain, when it follows 
 immediately, <I>Christ shall give thee light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:14">Eph. v. 14</A>.

 It is by the word of Christ that spiritual life is given, <I>I said
 unto thee, Live,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:6">Ezek. xvi. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That the damsel, as soon as life returned, <I>arose, and walked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 Spiritual life will appear by our <I>rising</I> from the bed of sloth 
 and carelessness, and our <I>walking</I> in a religious conversation, 
 our walking <I>up and down</I> in Christ's name and strength; even from 
 those that are <I>of the age of twelve years,</I> it may be expected 
 that they should walk as those whom Christ has <I>raised to life,</I> 
 otherwise than in the native <I>vanity of their minds.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. That all who saw it, and heard of it, admired the miracle, and him 
 that wrought it; <I>They were astonished with a great astonishment.</I> 
 They could not but acknowledge that there was something in it 
 extraordinary and very great, and yet they knew not what to make of it, 
 or to infer from it. Their wonder should have worked forward to a 
 lively faith, but it rested in a <I>stupor</I> or 
 <I>astonishment.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. That Christ endeavoured to conceal it; <I>He charged them straitly, 
 that no man should know it.</I> It was sufficiently known to a 
 competent number, but he would not have it as yet <I>proclaimed</I> any
 further; because his own resurrection was to be the great instance of 
 his power over death, and therefore the divulging of other instances 
 must be reserved till that great proof was given: let one part of the 
 evidence be kept private, till the other part, on which the main stress 
 lies, be made ready.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 9. That Christ took care something should be <I>given her to eat.</I> 
 By this it appeared that she was raised not only to life, but to a good 
 state of health, that she had an appetite to her meat; even the 
 new-born babes in Christ's house desire the sincere milk, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:1,2">1 Pet. ii. 1, 2</A>.
 
 And it is observable, that, as Christ, when at first he had made man,
 presently provided food for him, and food out of the earth of which he 
 was made 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:29">Gen. i. 29</A>),

 so now when he had given a new life, he took care that something should 
 be given to eat; for is he has given <I>life,</I> he may be trusted to 
 give <I>livelihood,</I> because <I>the life is more than meat,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25">Matt. vi. 25</A>.

 Where Christ hath given <I>spiritual life,</I> he will provide food for
 the support and nourishment of it unto life eternal, for he will 
 <I>never forsake,</I> or be wanting to, the <I>work of his own 
 hands.</I></P>
