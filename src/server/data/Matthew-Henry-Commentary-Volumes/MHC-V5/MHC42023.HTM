 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto
 Pilate.
 &nbsp; 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this <I>fellow</I>
 perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to C&aelig;sar,
 saying that he himself is Christ a King.
 &nbsp; 3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews?
 And he answered him and said, Thou sayest <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and <I>to</I> the people, I
 find no fault in this man.
 &nbsp; 5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the
 people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to
 this place.
 &nbsp; 6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a
 Galil&aelig;an.
 &nbsp; 7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's
 jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at
 Jerusalem at that time.
 &nbsp; 8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was
 desirous to see him of a long <I>season,</I> because he had heard many
 things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by
 him.
 &nbsp; 9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered
 him nothing.
 &nbsp; 10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently
 accused him.
 &nbsp; 11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked
 <I>him,</I> and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to
 Pilate.
 &nbsp; 12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends
 together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus was condemned as a blasphemer in the spiritual court, 
 but it was the most <I>impotent malice</I> that could be that this 
 court was actuated by; for, when they had <I>condemned</I> him, they 
 knew they could not <I>put him to death,</I> and therefore took another 
 course.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They accused him before Pilate. The <I>whole multitude of them 
 arose,</I> when they saw they could go no further with him in their 
 court, and <I>led him unto Pilate,</I> though it was no judgment day, 
 no assizes or sessions; and they demanded justice against him, not as a 
 blasphemer (that was no crime that he took cognizance of), but as one
 disaffected to the Roman government, which they in their hearts did not 
 look upon as any crime at all, or, if it was one, they themselves were 
 much more chargeable with it than he was; only it would serve the turn 
 and answer the purpose of their malice: and it is observable that that 
 which was the <I>pretended crime,</I> for which they employed the Roman 
 powers to destroy Christ, was the <I>real crime</I> for which the Roman 
 powers not long after destroyed them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is the indictment drawn up against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 in which they pretended a zeal for C&aelig;sar, only to ingratiate 
 themselves with Pilate, but it was all <I>malice</I> against Christ, 
 and nothing else. They misrepresented him, 

 (1.) As making the people <I>rebel against C&aelig;sar.</I> It was 
 true, and Pilate knew it, that there was a general uneasiness in the 
 people under the Roman yoke, and they wanted nothing but an opportunity 
 to shake it off; now they would have Pilate believe that this Jesus was 
 active to foment that general discontent, which, if the truth was 
 known, they themselves were the aiders and abettors of: <I>We have 
 found him perverting the nation;</I> as if converting them to God's 
 government were <I>perverting them</I> from the civil government; 
 whereas nothing tends more to make men good subjects than making them 
 Christ's faithful followers. Christ had particularly taught that they 
 <I>ought to give tribute to C&aelig;sar,</I> though he knew there were 
 those that would be offended at him for it; and yet he is here falsely 
 accused as <I>forbidding to give tribute to C&aelig;sar.</I> Innocency 
 is no fence against calumny.

 (2.) As making himself a <I>rival with C&aelig;sar,</I> though the very 
 reason why they rejected him, and would not own him to be the Messiah, 
 was because he did not appear in worldly pomp and power, and did not 
 set up for a temporal prince, nor offer to do any thing against 
 C&aelig;sar; yet this is what they charged him with, that he said, 
 <I>he himself is Christ a king.</I> He did say that he was 
 <I>Christ,</I> and, if so, then <I>a king,</I> but not such a king as 
 was ever likely to give disturbance to C&aelig;sar. When his followers
 would have made him a king 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:15">John vi. 15</A>),

 he declined it, though by the many miracles he wrought he made it 
 appear that if he would have set up in competition with C&aelig;sar he 
 would have been too hard for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His pleading to the indictment: <I>Pilate asked him, Art thou the 
 king of the Jews?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 To which he answered, <I>Thou sayest it;</I> that is, "It is as thou 
 sayest, that I am entitled to the government of the Jewish nation; but 
 in rivalship with the scribes and Pharisees, who tyrannize over them in 
 matters of religion, not in rivalship with C&aelig;sar, whose 
 government relates only to their civil interests." Christ's kingdom is 
 wholly spiritual, and will not interfere with C&aelig;sar's 
 jurisdiction. Or, "<I>Thou sayest it;</I> but canst thou prove it?
 What evidence hast thou for it?" All that knew him knew the contrary, 
 that he never pretended to be the <I>king of the Jews,</I> in 
 opposition to C&aelig;sar as supreme, or to the governors that were 
 sent by him, but the contrary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Pilate's declaration of his innocency 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 He <I>said to the chief priests, and the people</I> that seemed to join 
 with them in the prosecution, "<I>I find no fault in this man.</I> What 
 breaches of your law he may have been guilty of I am not concerned to 
 enquire, but I find nothing proved upon him that makes him obnoxious to 
 our court."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The continued fury and outrage of the prosecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Instead of being moderated by Pilate's declaration of his innocency, 
 and considering, as they ought to have done, whether they were not 
 bringing the guilt of innocent blood upon themselves, they were the 
 more exasperated, more exceedingly <I>fierce.</I> We do not find that 
 they have any particular fact to produce, much less any evidence to 
 prove it; but they resolve to carry it with noise and confidence, and 
 say it, though they cannot prove it: <I>He stirs up the people</I> to 
 rebel against C&aelig;sar, <I>teaching throughout all Judea, beginning 
 from Galilee to this place.</I> He did <I>stir up the people,</I> but 
 it was not to any thing factious or seditious, but to every thing that 
 was virtuous and praiseworthy. He did <I>teach,</I> but they could not 
 charge him with teaching any doctrine that tended to disturb the public 
 peace, or make the government uneasy or jealous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They accused him before Herod. 

 1. Pilate removed him and his cause to Herod's court. The accusers
 mentioned Galilee, the northern part of Canaan. "Why," saith Pilate, 
 "is he of that country? Is he a Galilean?"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 "Yes," said they, "that is his head-quarters; there he was spent most 
 of his time." "Let us send him to Herod then," saith Pilate, "for Herod 
 is now in town, and it is but fit he should have cognizance of his 
 cause, since he belongs to Herod's jurisdiction." Pilate was already 
 sick of the cause, and desirous to rid his hands of it, which seems to 
 have been the true reason for sending him to Herod. But God ordered it 
 so for the more evident fulfilling of the scripture, as appears

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:26,27">Acts iv. 26, 27</A>,
 
 where that of David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:2">Ps. ii. 2</A>),

 <I>The kings of the earth and the rulers set themselves against the
 Lord and his Anointed,</I> is expressly said to be fulfilled in Herod 
 and Pontius Pilate. 

 2. Herod was very willing to have the examining of him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>When he saw Jesus he was exceedingly glad,</I> and perhaps the more 
 glad because he saw him a prisoner, saw him in bonds. He had <I>heard
 many things of him</I> in Galilee, where his miracles had for a great 
 while been all the talk of the country; and he <I>longed to see 
 him,</I> not for any affection he had for him or his doctrine, but 
 purely out of curiosity; and it was only to gratify this that he 
 <I>hoped to have seen some miracle done by him,</I> which would serve 
 him to talk of as long as he lived. In order to this, he <I>questioned 
 with him in many things,</I> that at length he might bring him to 
 something in which he might show his power. Perhaps he pumped him 
 concerning things <I>secret,</I> or things <I>to come,</I> or 
 concerning his curing diseases. But Jesus <I>answered him nothing;</I> 
 nor would he gratify him so much as with the performance of one 
 miracle. The poorest beggar, that asked a miracle for the relief of his 
 necessity, was <I>never denied;</I> but this proud prince, that asked a 
 miracle merely for the gratifying of his curiosity, is denied. He
 might have seen Christ and his wondrous works many a time in Galilee, 
 and <I>would not,</I> and therefore it is justly said, Now he would see 
 them, and <I>shall not;</I> they are hidden from his eyes, because he 
 knew not the day of his visitation. Herod thought, now that he had him 
 in bonds, he might <I>command</I> a miracle, but miracles must not be 
 made cheap, nor Omnipotence be at the beck of the greatest potentate.
 
 3. His prosecutors appeared against him before Herod, for they were
 restless in the prosecution: <I>They stood, and vehemently accused
 him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 <I>impudently</I> and <I>boldly,</I> so the word signifies. They would
 make Herod believe that he had poisoned Galilee too with his seditious 
 notions. Note, It is no new thing for good men and good ministers, that 
 are real and useful friends to the civil government, to be falsely 
 accused as factious and seditious, and enemies to government. 

 4. Herod was very <I>abusive</I> to him: He, with <I>his men of
 war,</I> his attendants, and officers, and great men, <I>set him at 
 nought.</I> They <I>made nothing</I> of him; so the word is. Horrid 
 wickedness! To <I>make nothing</I> of him who <I>made all things.</I> 
 They laughed at him as <I>a fool;</I> for they knew he had wrought many 
 miracles to befriend others, and why would he not now work one to 
 befriend himself? Or, they laughed at him as one that had lost his
 power, and was become weak as other men. Herod, who had been acquainted 
 with John Baptist, and had more knowledge of Christ too than Pilate 
 had, was more <I>abusive</I> to Christ than Pilate was; for knowledge 
 without grace does but make men the more <I>ingeniously</I> wicked. 
 Herod arrayed Christ in a <I>gorgeous robe,</I> some gaudy painted 
 clothes, as a mock-king; and so he taught Pilate's soldiers afterwards 
 to do him the same indignity. He was ringleader in that abuse. 

 5. Herod sent him back to Pilate, and it proved an occasion of the
 making of them friends, they having been for some time before at 
 variance. Herod could not get sight of a miracle, but would not
 condemn him neither as a malefactor, and therefore <I>sent him again to 
 Pilate</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and so returned Pilate's civility and respect in sending the prisoner 
 to him; and this mutual obligation, with the messages that passed 
 between them on this occasion, brought them to a better understanding 
 one of another than there had been of late between them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They had been <I>at enmity between themselves,</I> probably upon 
 Pilate's killing of the Galileans, who were Herod's subjects

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:1">Luke xiii. 1</A>),

 or some other such matter of controversy as usually occurs among 
 princes and great men. Observe how those that quarrelled with one
 another yet could unite against Christ; as Gebal, and Ammon, and 
 Amalek, though divided among themselves, were confederate against the 
 <I>Israel of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:7">Ps. lxxxiii. 7</A>.

 Christ is the great peace-maker; both Pilate and Herod owned his
 innocency, and their agreeing in this cured their disagreeing in other 
 things.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests
 and the rulers and the people,
 &nbsp; 14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one
 that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined <I>him</I>
 before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things
 whereof ye accuse him:
 &nbsp; 15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing
 worthy of death is done unto him.
 &nbsp; 16 I will therefore chastise him, and release <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the
 feast.)
 &nbsp; 18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this
 <I>man,</I> and release unto us Barabbas:
 &nbsp; 19 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for
 murder, was cast into prison.)
 &nbsp; 20 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to
 them.
 &nbsp; 21 But they cried, saying, Crucify <I>him,</I> crucify him.
 &nbsp; 22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he
 done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore
 chastise him, and let <I>him</I> go.
 &nbsp; 23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he
 might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief
 priests prevailed.
 &nbsp; 24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
 &nbsp; 25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder
 was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered
 Jesus to their will.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the blessed Jesus run down by the mob, and hurried to the 
 cross in the storm of a popular noise and tumult, raised by the malice 
 and artifice of the <I>chief priests,</I> as agents for the prince of 
 the power of the air.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Pilate solemnly protests that he believes he has done nothing worthy 
 of death or of bonds. And, if he did believe so, he ought immediately 
 to have <I>discharged</I> him, and not only so, but to have 
 <I>protected</I> him from the fury of the priests and rabble, and to 
 have bound his prosecutors to their good behaviour for their insolent 
 conduct. But, being himself a bad man, he had no kindness for Christ, 
 and, having made himself otherwise obnoxious, was afraid of displeasing 
 either the emperor or the people; and therefore, for want of integrity, 
 he <I>called together the chief priests, and rulers, and people</I> 
 (whom he should have dispersed, as a <I>riotous and seditious 
 assembly,</I> and forbid them to come near him), and will hear what 
 they have to say, to whom he should have turned a deaf ear, for he 
 plainly saw what spirit actuated them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>You have brought,</I>" saith he, "<I>this man to me,</I> and, 
 because I have a respect for you, <I>I have examined him before 
 you,</I> and have heard all you have to allege against him, and I can 
 make nothing of it: <I>I find no fault in him;</I> you cannot prove the 
 things whereof you accuse him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He appeals to Herod concerning him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>I sent you to him,</I> who is supposed to have known more of him 
 than I have done, and he has <I>sent him back,</I> not convicted of any 
 thing, nor under any mark of his displeasure; in his opinion, his 
 crimes are not capital. He has laughed at him as a weak man, but has 
 not stigmatized him as a dangerous man." He thought Bedlam a fitter 
 place for him than Tyburn.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He proposes to release him, if they will but consent to it. He 
 ought to have done it without asking leave of them, <I>Fiat justitia, 
 ruat c&oelig;lum--Let justice have its course, though the heavens should be
 desolated.</I> But the fear of man brings many into this snare, that, 
 whereas justice should take place, though heaven and earth come 
 together, they will do an unjust thing, against their consciences, 
 rather than pull an old house about their ears. Pilate declares him 
 innocent, and therefore has a mind to release him; yet, to please the 
 people, 

 1. He will release him under the notion of a malefactor, because <I>of
 necessity he must release one</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 so that whereas he ought to have been released by an <I>act of 
 justice,</I> and thanks to nobody, he would have him released by an 
 <I>act of grace,</I> and not be beholden to the people for it. 

 2. He will <I>chastise</I> him, and release him. If <I>no fault</I> be 
 to be <I>found in him,</I> why should he be chastised? There is as much 
 injustice in scourging as in crucifying an innocent man; nor would it 
 be justified by pretending that this would satisfy the clamours of the 
 people, and make <I>him</I> the object of their pity who was not to be 
 the object of their envy. We must not do evil that good may come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The people choose rather to have Barabbas released, a wretched
 fellow, that had nothing to recommend him to their favour but the 
 daringness of his crimes. He was imprisoned for a <I>sedition made in 
 the city,</I> and for <I>murder</I> (of all crimes among men the least 
 pardonable), yet this was the criminal that was preferred before 
 Christ: <I>Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 And no wonder that such a man is the favourite and darling of such a 
 <I>mob,</I> he that was really seditious, rather than he that was 
 really loyal and falsely accused of sedition.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. When Pilate urged the second time that Christ should be released, 
 they cried out, <I>Crucify him, crucify him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 They not only will have him die, but will have him die so great a 
 death; nothing less will serve but he must be crucified: <I>Crucify 
 him, crucify him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. When Pilate the third time reasoned with them, to show them the 
 unreasonableness and injustice of it, they were the more peremptory and 
 outrageous 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>Why? What evil hath he done?</I> Name his crime. <I>I have found no 
 cause of death,</I> and you cannot say what cause of death you have 
 found in him; and therefore, if you will but speak the word, <I>I will 
 chastise him and let him go.</I>" But popular fury, the more it is 
 complimented, the more furious it grows; they were <I>instant with loud 
 voices,</I> with great noises or outcries, not requesting, but 
 <I>requiring, that he might be crucified;</I> as if they had as much 
 right, at the feast, to demand the crucifying of one that was innocent 
 as the release of one that was guilty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Pilate's yielding, at length, to their importunity. The voice of 
 the people and of the <I>chief priests prevailed,</I> and were too hard 
 for Pilate, and overruled him to go contrary to his convictions and 
 inclinations. He had not courage to go against so strong a stream, but 
 <I>gave sentence that it should be as they required,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Here is judgment <I>turned away backward,</I> and <I>justice standing 
 afar off,</I> for fear of popular fury. <I>Truth is fallen in the
 street, and equity cannot enter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:14">Isa. lix. 14</A>.

 Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the
 cross, that he might bear <I>it</I> after Jesus.
 &nbsp; 27 And there followed him a great company of people, and of
 women, which also bewailed and lamented him.

 weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.

 say, Blessed <I>are</I> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the blessed Jesus, the Lamb of God, led as <I>a lamb to 
 the slaughter,</I> to the sacrifice. It is strange with what expedition 
 they went through his trial; how they could do so much work in such a 
 little time, though they had so many great men to deal with, attendance 
 on whom is usually a work of time. He was brought before the chief 
 priests at break of day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:66"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 66</A>),

 after that to Pilate, then to Herod, then to Pilate again; and there
 seems to have been a long struggle between Pilate and the people about 
 him. He was scourged, and crowned with thorns and contumeliously used, 
 and all this was done in four or five hours' time, or six at most, for 
 he was crucified between nine o'clock and twelve. Christ's persecutors 
 resolve to lose no time, for fear lest his friends at the other end of 
 the town should get notice of what they were doing, and should rise to 
 rescue him. Never any one was so <I>chased out of the world</I> as 
 Christ was, but so he himself said, <I>Yet a little while and ye shall 
 not see me;</I> a very little while indeed. Now as they led him away to 
 death we find,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. One that was a <I>bearer,</I> that carried his cross, <I>Simon</I> 
 by name, <I>a Cyrenian,</I> who probably was a friend of Christ, and 
 was known to be so, and this was done to put a reproach upon him; they 
 laid Christ's cross upon him, that he might <I>bear it after Jesus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 lest Jesus should faint under it and die away, and so prevent the 
 further instances of malice they designed. It was pity, but a <I>cruel 
 pity,</I> that gave him this ease.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Many that were <I>mourners,</I> true mourners, who followed him, 
 <I>bewailing</I> and <I>lamenting</I> him. These were not only his 
 friends and well-wishers, but the common people, that were not his 
 enemies, and were moved with compassion towards him, because they had 
 heard the fame of him, and what an excellent useful man he was, and had 
 reason to think he suffered unjustly. This drew a great crowd after 
 him, as is usual at executions, especially of those that have been 
 persons of distinction: <I>A great company of people followed him,</I> 
 especially of women 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 some led by pity, others by curiosity, but they <I>also</I> (as well as
 those that were his particular friends and acquaintance) <I>bewailed 
 and lamented him.</I> Though there were many that reproached and 
 reviled him, yet there were some that valued him, and pitied him, and 
 were sorry for him, and were partakers with him in his sufferings. The 
 dying of the Lord Jesus may perhaps move natural affections in many 
 that are strangers to devout affections; many bewail Christ that do not 
 believe in him, and lament him that do not love him above all. Now here 
 we are told what Christ said to these mourners. Though one would think
 he should be wholly taken up with his own concern, yet he found time 
 and heart to take cognizance of their tears. Christ <I>died
 lamented,</I> and has a bottle for the tears of those that lamented 
 him. He <I>turned to them,</I> though they were strangers to him, and 
 bade them <I>not weep for him, but for themselves.</I> He diverts their 
 lamentation into another channel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He gives them a general direction concerning their lamentations: 
 <I>Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me.</I> Not that they were to 
 be blamed for weeping for him, but rather commended; those hearts were 
 hard indeed that were not affected with such sufferings of such a 
 person; but they must not weep for him only (those were profitless 
 tears that they shed for him), but rather let them <I>weep for 
 themselves and for their children,</I> with an eye to the destruction 
 that was coming upon Jerusalem, which some of them might live to see 
 and share in the calamities of, or, at least, their children would, for 
 whom they ought to be solicitous. Note, When with an eye of faith we 
 behold Christ crucified we ought to weep, not for him, but for 
 ourselves. We must not be affected with the death of Christ as with the 
 death of a common person whose calamity we pity, or of a common friend 
 whom we are likely to part with. The death of Christ was a thing 
 peculiar; it was his victory and triumph over his enemies; it was our 
 deliverance, and the purchase of eternal life for us. And therefore let 
 us weep, not for him, but for our own sins, and the sins of our 
 children, that were the cause of his death; and weep for fear (such 
 were the tears here prescribed) of the miseries we shall bring upon 
 ourselves, if we slight his love, and reject his grace, as the Jewish 
 nation did, which brought upon them the ruin here foretold. When our 
 dear relations and friends die in Christ, we have no reason to weep for 
 them, who have put off the burden of the flesh, are made perfect in 
 holiness, and have entered into perfect rest and joy, but for ourselves 
 and our children, who are left behind in a world of sins, and sorrows, 
 and snares.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives them a particular reason why they should <I>weep for 
 themselves and for their children: "Fore behold</I> sad times are 
 coming upon your city; it will be destroyed, and you will be involved 
 in the common destruction." When Christ's own disciples sorrowed after 
 a <I>godly sort</I> for his leaving them, he wiped away their tears 
 with the promise that he would <I>see them again,</I> and they should 
 <I>rejoice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:22">John xvi. 22</A>.

 But, when these daughters of <I>Jerusalem bewailed him</I> only with a
 <I>worldly</I> sorrow, he turned their tears into another channel, and
 told them that they should have something given them to cry for. Let
 them <I>be afflicted, and mourn, and weep,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:9">Jam. iv. 9</A>.

 He had lately wept over Jerusalem himself, and now he bids them weep 
 over it. Christ's tears should set us a weeping. Let the daughters of
 Zion, that own Christ for their king, rejoice in him, for he comes to 
 save them; but let the daughters of Jerusalem, that only weep for him, 
 but do not take him for their king, weep and tremble to think of his 
 coming to judge them. Now the destruction of Jerusalem is here foretold 
 by two proverbial sayings, that might then fitly be used, which both 
 bespeak it very terrible, that what people commonly dread they would 
 then desire, to be <I>written childless</I> and to be <I>buried 
 alive.</I>

 (1.) They would wish to be <I>written childless.</I> Whereas commonly
 those that have no children envy those that have, as Rachel envied 
 Leah, then those that have children will find them such a burden in 
 attempting to escape, and such a grief when they see them either 
 <I>fainting</I> for famine or <I>falling</I> by the sword, that they 
 will envy those that have none, and say, <I>Blessed are the barren, and 
 the wombs that never bare,</I> that have no children to be <I>given 
 up</I> to the murderer, or to be <I>snatched</I> out of his hands. It 
 would not only go ill with those who at that time were <I>with 
 child,</I> or <I>giving suck,</I> as Christ had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:19">Matt. xxiv. 19</A>),

 but it would be terrible to those who had had children, and suckled 
 them, and had them now alive. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:11-14">Hos. ix. 11-14</A>.

 See the vanity of the creature and the uncertainty of its comforts; for 
 such may be the changes of Providence concerning us that those very 
 things may become the greatest burdens, cares, and griefs to us, which 
 we have delighted in as the greatest blessings. 

 (2.) They would wish to be <I>buried alive: They shall begin to say to 
 the mountains, Fall on us, and to the hills, Cover us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 This also refers to a passage in the same prophecy with the former, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:8">Hos. x. 8</A>.

 They shall wish to be hid in the darkest caves, that they may be out of 
 the noise of these calamities. They will be willing to be sheltered
 upon any terms, though with the hazard of being crushed to pieces. This 
 would be the language especially of the great and mighty men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:16">Rev. vi. 16</A>.

 They that would not flee to Christ for refuge, and put themselves under 
 his protection, will in vain call to <I>hills</I> and <I>mountains</I> 
 to shelter them from his wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He shows how natural it was for them to infer this desolation from 
 his sufferings. <I>If they do these things in a green tree, what shall 
 be done in the dry?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 Some think that this is borrowed from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:47">Ezek. xx. 47</A>:

 <I>The fire shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry
 tree.</I> These words may be applied,

 (1.) More particularly to the destruction of Jerusalem, which Christ
 here foretold, and which the Jews by putting him to death brought upon 
 themselves: "<I>If they</I> (the Jews, and the inhabitants of 
 Jerusalem) <I>do these things upon the green tree,</I> if they do thus 
 abuse an innocent and excellent person for his <I>good works,</I> how 
 may they expect God to deal with them <I>for their so doing,</I> who 
 have made themselves a <I>dry tree,</I> a corrupt and wicked 
 generation, and good for nothing? If this be their sin, what do you
 think will be their punishment?" Or take it thus: "If they (the Romans, 
 their judges, and their soldiers) abuse me thus, who have given them no 
 provocation, who am to them as a green tree, which you seem to be as 
 much enraged at, <I>what will they do by Jerusalem</I> and the Jewish 
 nation, who will be so very provoking to them, and make themselves as a 
 <I>dry tree,</I> as fuel to the fire of their resentments? If God 
 suffer those things to be done to me, what will he appoint to be done 
 to those barren trees of whom it had been often said that they should 
 be <I>hewn down and cast into the fire?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:10,7:19">Matt. iii. 10; vii. 19</A>.

 (2.) They may be applied more generally to all the revelations of God's
 wrath against sin and sinners: "If God deliver me up to such sufferings 
 as these because I am made a sacrifice for sin, what will he do with 
 sinners themselves?" Christ was a <I>green tree,</I> fruitful and 
 flourishing; now, if such things were done to him, we may thence infer 
 what would have been done to the whole race of mankind if he had not 
 <I>interposed,</I> and what shall be done to those that continue dry 
 trees, notwithstanding all that is done to make them fruitful. If God 
 did this to the Son of his love, when he found sin but imputed to him, 
 what shall he do to the generation of his wrath, when he finds sin 
 reigning in them? If the Father was pleased in doing these things to 
 the green tree, why should he be loth to do it to the dry? Note, The 
 consideration of the bitter sufferings of our Lord Jesus should engage 
 us to stand in awe of the justice of God, and to tremble before him.
 The best saints, compared with Christ, are <I>dry tree;</I> if he 
 suffer, why may not they expect so suffer? And what then shall the 
 damnation of sinners be?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>32  And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to
 be put to death.
 &nbsp; 33 And when they were come to the place, which is called
 Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Divers passages which we had before in Matthew and Mark concerning 
 Christ's sufferings. 

 1. That there were <I>two others, malefactors, led with him</I> to the 
 place of execution, who, it is probable, had been for some time under 
 sentence of death, and were designed to be executed on this day, which 
 was probably the pretence for making such haste in the prosecution of 
 Christ, that he and these two malefactors might be executed together, 
 and one solemnity might serve. 

 2. That he was crucified at a place called <I>Calvary,</I>
 <B><I>Kranion</I></B>, the Greek name for <I>Golgotha--the place of a 
 skull:</I> an ignominious place, to add to the reproach of his 
 sufferings, but significant, for there he triumphed over death as it 
 were upon his own dunghill. He was <I>crucified.</I> His hands and feet 
 were nailed to the cross as it lay upon the ground, and it was then 
 <I>lifted</I> up, and fastened into the earth, or into some socket made 
 to receive it. This was a painful and shameful death above any other. 
 
 3. That he was crucified <I>in the midst between two thieves,</I> as if
 he had been the worst of the three. Thus he was not only treated as a 
 transgressor, but <I>numbered with them,</I> the worst of them. 

 4. That the soldiers who were employed in the execution seized his
 garments as their fee, and divided them among themselves <I>by lot: 
 They parted his raiment, and cast lots;</I> it was worth so little 
 that, if divided, it would come to next to nothing, and therefore they 
 cast lots for it. 

 5. That he was reviled and reproached, and treated with all the scorn
 and contempt imaginable, when he was <I>lifted up</I> upon the cross. 
 It was strange that so much barbarity should be found in the human 
 nature: <I>The people stood beholding,</I> not at all concerned, but 
 rather pleasing themselves with the spectacle; and <I>the rulers,</I> 
 whom from their office one would take to be men of sense and men of 
 honour, stood among the rabble, <I>and derided him,</I> to set those on 
 that were about them to do so too; and they said, <I>He saved others, 
 let him save himself.</I> Thus was he upbraided for the good works he 
 had done, as if it were indeed <I>for these</I> that they 
 <I>crucified</I> him. They triumphed over him as if they had conquered 
 him, whereas he was himself then more than a conqueror; they challenged 
 him to save himself from the cross, when he was saving others by the 
 cross: <I>If he be the Christ, the chosen of God,</I> let him save 
 himself. They knew that <I>the Christ was the chosen of God,</I> 
 designed by him, and dear to him. "If he, as the Christ, would deliver 
 our nation from the Romans (and they could not form any other idea than 
 that of the Messiah), let him deliver himself from the Romans that have 
 him now in their hands." Thus the Jewish <I>rulers</I> jeered him as 
 subdued by the Romans, instead of subduing them. The <I>Roman 
 soldiers</I> jeered him as <I>the King of the Jews:</I> "A people good 
 enough for such a prince, and a prince good enough for such a people." 
 They <I>mocked him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>);

 they made sport with him, and made a jest of his sufferings; and when 
 they were drinking sharp sour wine themselves, such as was generally 
 allotted them, they triumphantly asked him if he would pledge them, or 
 drink with them. And they said, <I>If thou be the king of the Jews, 
 save thyself;</I> for, as the Jews prosecuted him under the notion of a 
 pretended Messiah, so the Romans under the notion of a pretended king. 
 
 6. That the superscription over his head, setting forth his crime, was,
 <I>This is the King of the Jews,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 He is put to death for pretending to be the king of the Jews; so they 
 meant it; but God intended it to be a declaration of what he really 
 was, notwithstanding his present disgrace: he is <I>the king of the 
 Jews,</I> the king of the church, and his cross is the way to his 
 crown. This was written in those that were called the three learned 
 languages, <I>Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew,</I> for those are best 
 learned that have learned Christ. It was written in these three 
 languages that it might be known and read of all men; but God designed 
 by it to signify that the gospel of Christ should be preached to all 
 nations, <I>beginning at Jerusalem,</I> and be read in all languages.
 The Gentile philosophy made the Greek tongue famous, the Roman laws and 
 government made the Latin tongue so, and the Hebrew excelled them all 
 for the sake of the Old Testament. In these three languages is Jesus 
 Christ <I>proclaimed king.</I> Young scholars, that are taking pains at 
 school to make themselves masters of these three languages, should aim 
 at this, that in the use of them they may increase their acquaintance 
 with Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are two passages which we had not before, and they are very 
 remarkable ones.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ's prayer for his enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>Father, forgive them.</I> Seven remarkable words Christ spoke after 
 he was nailed to the cross, and before he died, and this is the first. 
 One reason why he died the death of the cross was that he might have 
 liberty of speech to the last, and so might glorify his Father and 
 edify those about him. As soon as ever he was fastened to the cross, or 
 while they were nailing him, he prayed this prayer, in which 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The petition: <I>Father, forgive them.</I> One would think that he 
 should have prayed, "Father, consume them; the Lord look upon it, and 
 requite it." The sin they were now guilty of might justly have been 
 made unpardonable, and justly might they have been excepted by name out 
 of the act of indemnity. No, these are particularly <I>prayed for.</I> 
 Now he made intercession for transgressors, as was foretold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:12">Isa. liii. 12</A>),
 
 and it is to be added to his prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:1-26">John xvii.</A>),

 to complete the specimen he gave of his intercession within the veil:
 that for saints, this for sinners. Now the sayings of Christ upon the 
 cross as well as his sufferings had a further intention than they 
 seemed to have. This was a mediatorial word, and explicatory of the 
 intent and meaning of his death: "<I>Father, forgive them,</I> not only 
 these, but all that shall repent, and believe the gospel;" and he did 
 not intend that these should be forgiven upon any other terms. "Father, 
 that which I am now suffering and dying for is in order to this, that 
 poor sinners may be pardoned." Note,

 [1.] The great thing which Christ died to purchase and procure for us 
 is the forgiveness of sin. 

 [2.] This is that for which Christ intercedes for all that repent and 
 believe in the virtue of his satisfaction; his blood speaks this: 
 <I>Father, forgive them.</I> 

 [3.] The greatest sinners may, through Christ, upon their repentance, 
 hope to find mercy. Though they were his persecutors and murderers, he 
 prayed, Father, forgive <I>them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The plea: <I>For they know not what they do;</I> for, <I>if they
 had known,</I> they would not have crucified him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>.

 There was a veil upon his glory and upon their understandings; and how 
 could they see through two veils? They wished his blood on them and 
 their children: but, had they known what they did, they would have 
 unwished it again. Note,

 [1.] The crucifiers of Christ <I>know not what they do.</I> They that 
 speak ill or religion speak ill of that which they know not, and it is 
 because they will not know it. 

 [2.] There is a kind of ignorance that does in part excuse sin: 
 ignorance through want of the means of knowledge or of a capacity to 
 receive instruction, through the infelicities of education, or 
 inadvertency. The crucifiers of Christ were kept in ignorance by their 
 rulers, and had prejudices against him instilled into them, so that in 
 what they did against Christ and his doctrine they thought they did God 
 service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:2">John xvi. 2</A>.

 Such as to be pitied and prayed for. This prayer of Christ was answered 
 not long after, when many of those that had a hand in his death were 
 converted by Peter's preaching. This is written also for example to us.
 <I>First,</I> We must in prayer call God <I>Father,</I> and come to him 
 with reverence and confidence, as children to a father.
 <I>Secondly,</I> The great thing we must beg of God, both for ourselves 
 and others, is the forgiveness of sins. <I>Thirdly,</I> We must pray
 for <I>our enemies,</I> and those that hate and persecute us, must 
 extenuate their offences, and not aggravate them as we must our own 
 (<I>They know not what they do; peradventure it was an oversight</I>); 
 and we must be earnest with God in prayer for the forgiveness of their 
 sins, their sins against us. This is Christ's example to his own rule 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:44,45">Matt. v. 44, 45</A>,

 <I>Love your enemies</I>); and it very much strengthens the rule, for, 
 if Christ loved and prayed for such enemies, what enemies can we have 
 that we are not obliged to <I>love</I> and <I>pray for?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The conversion of the thief upon the cross, which is an illustrious 
 instance of Christ's triumphing over principalities and powers even 
 when he seemed to be triumphed over by them. Christ was crucified 
 between two thieves, and in them were represented the different effects 
 which the cross of Christ would have upon the children of men, to whom 
 it would be <I>brought near</I> in the preaching of the gospel. They 
 were all malefactors, all guilty before God. Now the cross of Christ is 
 to some a <I>savour of life unto life,</I> to others of <I>death unto 
 death.</I> To them that perish it is foolishness, but to them that are 
 saved it is the wisdom of God and the power of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here was one of these malefactors that was <I>hardened to the 
 last.</I> Near to the cross of Christ, he <I>railed on him,</I> as 
 others did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 he said, <I>If thou be the Christ,</I> as they say thou art, <I>save 
 thyself and us.</I> Though he was now in pain and agony, and in the 
 valley of the shadow of death, yet this did not humble his proud 
 spirit, nor teach him to give good language, no, not to his 
 fellow-sufferer. <I>Though thou bray a fool in a mortar, yet will not 
 his foolishness depart from him.</I> No troubles will of themselves 
 work a change in a wicked heart, but sometimes they <I>irritate</I> the 
 corruption which one would think they should <I>mortify.</I> He 
 challenges Christ to <I>save both himself and them.</I> Note, There are 
 some that have the impudence to rail at Christ, and yet the confidence 
 to expect to be saved by him; nay, and to conclude that, if he do not 
 save them, he is not to be looked upon as the Saviour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here was the other of them that was <I>softened at the last.</I> 
 It as said in Matthew and Mark that the <I>thieves,</I> even <I>they 
 that were crucified with him, reviled him,</I> which some think is by a 
 figure put for <I>one</I> of them, but others think that they both 
 <I>reviled</I> him at first, till the heart of one of them was 
 wonderfully changed, and with it his language on a sudden. This 
 malefactor, when just ready to fall into the hands of Satan, was 
 snatched as a brand out of the burning, and made a monument of divine 
 mercy and grace, and Satan was left to roar as a lion disappointed of 
 his prey. This gives no encouragement to any to put off their 
 repentance to their death-bed, or to hope that then they shall find 
 mercy; for, though it is certain that true repentance is never too 
 late, it is as certain that late repentance is seldom true. None can be 
 sure that they shall have time to repent at death, but every man may be 
 sure that he cannot have the advantages that this penitent thief had, 
 whose case was altogether extraordinary. He never had any offer of 
 Christ, nor day of grace, before how: he was designed to be made a 
 singular instance of the power of Christ's grace now at a time when he 
 was <I>crucified in weakness.</I> Christ, having conquered Satan in the 
 destruction of Judas and the preservation of Peter, erects this further 
 trophy of his victory over him in the conversion of this malefactor, as 
 a specimen of what he would do. We shall see the case to be 
 extraordinary if we observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The extraordinary operations of God's grace upon him, which 
 appeared in what he said. Here were so many evidences given in a short 
 time of a blessed change wrought in him that more could not have been 
 given in so little a compass.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> See what he said to the other malefactor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:40,41"><I>v.</I> 40, 41</A>.

 1. He reproved him for railing at Christ, as destitute of the <I>fear
 of God,</I> and having no sense at all of religion: <I>Dost not thou 
 fear God?</I> This implies that it was the fear of God which restrained 
 him from following the multitude to do this evil. "I fear God, and 
 therefore dare not do it; and dost not thou?" All that have their eyes 
 opened see this to be at the bottom of the wickedness of the wicked, 
 that they have not the fear of God before their eyes. "If thou hadst 
 any humanity in thee, thou wouldest not insult over one that is thy 
 fellow-sufferer; <I>thou art in the same condition;</I> thou art a 
 <I>dying man</I> too, and therefore, whatever these wicked people do, 
 it ill becomes thee to abuse a dying man." 

 2. He owns that he deserves what was done to him: <I>We indeed
 justly.</I> It is probable that they both suffered for one and the same 
 crime, and therefore he spoke with the more assurance, <I>We received 
 the due reward of our deeds.</I> This magnifies divine grace, as acting 
 in a distinguishing way. These two have been comrades in sin and 
 suffering, and yet one is <I>saved</I> and the other <I>perishes;</I> 
 two that had gone together all along hitherto, and yet now <I>one taken 
 and the other left.</I> He does not say, <I>Thou</I> indeed justly, but 
 <I>We.</I> Note, True penitents acknowledge the justice of God in all 
 the punishments of their sin. God has <I>done right,</I> but <I>we have 
 done wickedly.</I> 

 3. He believes Christ to have suffered <I>wrongfully.</I> Though he was
 condemned in two courts, and run upon as if he had been the worst of 
 malefactors, yet this penitent thief is convinced, by his conduct in 
 his sufferings, that <I>he has done nothing amiss,</I> <B><I>ouden 
 atopon</I></B>--<I>nothing absurd, or unbecoming his character.</I> The 
 chief priests would have him crucified <I>between</I> the malefactors, 
 as <I>one of them;</I> but this thief has more sense than they, and 
 owns he is <I>not one of them.</I> Whether he had before heard of 
 Christ and of his wonderous works does not appear, but the Spirit of 
 grace enlightened him with this knowledge, and enabled him to say, This 
 man has <I>done nothing amiss.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> See what he said to our Lord Jesus: <I>Lord, remember
 me when thou comest into thy kingdom,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 This is the prayer of a <I>dying sinner</I> to a <I>dying Saviour.</I> 
 It was the honour of Christ to be <I>thus prayed to,</I> though he was 
 upon the cross reproached and reviled. It was the happiness of the 
 thief <I>thus to pray;</I> perhaps he never prayed before, and yet now 
 was heard, and saved at the last gasp. While there is life there is 
 hope, and while there is hope there is room for prayer.

 1. Observe his <I>faith</I> in this prayer. In his confession of sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>)

 he discovered <I>repentance towards God.</I> In this petition he
 discovered <I>faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</I> He owns him to 
 be <I>Lord,</I> and to have a <I>kingdom,</I> and that he was going to 
 that kingdom, that he should have authority in that kingdom, and that 
 those should be happy whom he favoured; and to <I>believe</I> and 
 <I>confess</I> all this was a <I>great thing</I> at this time of day. 
 Christ was now in the depth of disgrace, deserted by his own disciples, 
 reviled by his own nation, suffering as a pretender, and not delivered 
 by his Father He made this profession before those prodigies happened 
 which put honour upon his sufferings, and which startled the centurion; 
 yet <I>verily we have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</I> 
 He believed <I>another life</I> after this, and desired to be happy in 
 <I>that</I> life, not as the other thief, to be <I>saved from the 
 cross,</I> but to be well provided for when the cross had done its 
 worst. 

 2. Observe his humility in this prayer. All his request is, <I>Lord, 
 remember me.</I> He does not pray, Lord, <I>prefer me</I> (as they did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:21">Matt. xx. 21</A>),

 though, having the honour as none of the disciples had to drink of 
 Christ's cup and to be baptized with his baptism either on his <I>right 
 hand</I> or on <I>his left</I> in his sufferings when his own disciples 
 had deserted him he might have had some colour to ask as they did to 
 sit on his right hand and on his left in his kingdom. Acquaintance in
 sufferings has sometimes gained such a point, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+52:31,32">Jer. lii. 31, 32</A>.

 But he is far from the thought of it. All he begs is, <I>Lord, remember 
 me,</I> referring himself to Christ in what way to remember him. It is 
 a request like that of <I>Joseph to the chief butler, Think on me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+40:14">Gen. xl. 14</A>),

 and it sped better; the chief butler <I>forgot Joseph,</I> but Christ
 remembered this thief. 

 3. There is an air of importunity and fervency in this prayer. He
 does, as it were, breathe out his soul in it: "<I>Lord, remember 
 me,</I> and I have enough; I desire no more; into thy hands I commit my 
 case." Note, To be remembered by Christ, now that he is in his kingdom, 
 is what we should earnestly desire and pray for, and it will be enough 
 to secure our welfare living and dying. Christ is <I>in his 
 kingdom,</I> interceding. "<I>Lord, remember me,</I> and intercede for
 me." He is there ruling. "Lord, remember me, and rule in me by thy
 Spirit." He is there preparing places for those that are his. "Lord,
 remember me, and prepare a place for me; remember me <I>at death,</I> 
 remember me <I>in the resurrection.</I>" See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:13">Job xiv. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The extraordinary grants of Christ's favour to him: <I>Jesus said 
 unto him,</I> in answer to his prayer, "<I>Verily I say unto thee,</I> 
 I the <I>Amen,</I> the faithful Witness, I say <I>Amen</I> to this 
 prayer, put my <I>fiat</I> to it: nay, thou shalt have more than thou 
 didst ask, <I>This day thou shalt be with me in paradise,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First, To whom</I> this was spoken: to the penitent thief, to him, 
 and not to his companion. Christ upon the cross is like Christ upon the 
 throne; for <I>now is the judgment of this world:</I> one departs with 
 a curse, the other with a blessing. Though Christ himself was now in
 the greatest struggle and agony, yet he had a word of comfort to speak 
 to a poor penitent that committed himself to him. Note, Even great 
 sinners, if they be true penitents, shall, through Christ, obtain not 
 only the pardon of their sins, but a place in the paradise of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:15">Heb. ix. 15</A>.

 This magnifies the riches of free grace, that rebels and traitors shall
 not only be pardoned, but preferred, thus preferred.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly, By whom</I> this was spoken. This was another mediatorial 
 word which Christ spoke, though upon a particular occasion, yet with a 
 general intention to explain the true intent and meaning of his 
 sufferings; as he died to purchase the <I>forgiveness of sins</I> for 
 us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 so also to purchase <I>eternal life</I> for us. By this word we are 
 given to understand that Jesus Christ died to <I>open the kingdom of 
 heaven to all penitent obedient believers.</I> 

 1. Christ here lets us know that he was going to paradise himself, to 
 <I>hades--the invisible world.</I> His human soul was removing to the 
 place of separate souls; not to the place of the damned, but to 
 paradise, the place of the blessed. By this he assures us that his 
 satisfaction was accepted, and the Father was well pleased in him, else 
 he had not gone to paradise; that was the beginning of the joy set 
 before him, with the prospect of which he comforted himself. He went by 
 the cross to the crown, and we must not think of going any other way, 
 or of being perfected but by sufferings. 

 2. He lets all penitent believers know that when they die they shall go
 to be with him there. He was now, as a priest, purchasing this
 happiness for them, and is ready, as a king, to confer it upon them 
 when they are prepared and made ready for it. See here how the 
 happiness of heaven is set forth to us.

 (1.) It is <I>paradise,</I> a garden of pleasure, the <I>paradise of 
 God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:7">Rev. ii. 7</A>),

 alluding to the garden of Eden, in which our first parents were placed 
 when they were innocent. In the second Adam we are restored to all we 
 lost in the first Adam, and more, to a heavenly paradise instead of an 
 earthly one.

 (2.) It is being <I>with Christ</I> there. That is the happiness of 
 heaven, to see Christ, and sit with him, and share in his glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24">John xvii. 24</A>.

 (3.) It is immediate upon death: <I>This day shalt thou be with me,</I>
 to-night, before to-morrow. <I>Thou souls of the faithful, after they 
 are delivered from the burden of the flesh,</I> immediately <I>are in 
 joy and felicity;</I> the spirits of just men are immediately <I>made 
 perfect.</I> Lazarus departs, and is immediately <I>comforted;</I> Paul 
 departs, and is immediately with Christ,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>44  And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness
 over all the earth until the ninth hour.
 &nbsp; 45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was
 rent in the midst.
 &nbsp; 46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
 into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave
 up the ghost.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have three things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's dying <I>magnified</I> by the <I>prodigies</I> that 
 attended it: only two are here mentioned, which we had an account of 
 before. 

 1. The <I>darkening of the sun at noon-day.</I> It was now about the 
 <I>sixth hour,</I> that is, according to our computation, twelve 
 o'clock at noon; and there was a <I>darkness over all the earth until 
 the ninth hour.</I> The sun was eclipsed and the air exceedingly 
 clouded at the same time, both which concurred to this thick darkness, 
 which continued<I> three hours,</I> not <I>three days,</I> as that of 
 Egypt did. 

 2. The <I>rending of the veil of the temple.</I> The former prodigy was
 in the <I>heavens,</I> this in the <I>temple;</I> for both these are 
 the houses of God, and, when the Son of God was thus abused, they could 
 not but feel the indignity, and thus signify their resentment of it. By 
 this rending of the veil was signified the taking away of the 
 ceremonial law, which was a wall of partition between Jews and 
 Gentiles, and of all other difficulties and discouragements in our 
 approaches to God, so that now we may <I>come boldly to the throne of 
 grace.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's dying <I>explained</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>)

 by the words with which he breathed out his soul. Jesus <I>had 
 cried</I> with a loud voice when he said, <I>Why hast thou forsaken 
 me?</I> So we are told in Matthew and Mark, and, it should seem, it was 
 with a <I>loud voice</I> that he said this too, to show his 
 earnestness, and that all the people might take notice of it: and this 
 he said, <I>Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.</I> 

 1. He borrowed these words from his father David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:5">Ps. xxxi. 5</A>);

 not that he needed to have words put into his mouth, but he chose to 
 make use of David's words to show that it was the Spirit of Christ that 
 testified in the Old-Testament prophets, and that he came to fulfil the 
 scripture. Christ died with scripture in his mouth. Thus he directs us
 to make use of scripture language in our addresses to God. 

 2. In this address to God he calls him <I>Father.</I> When he
 complained of being forsaken, he cried, <I>Eli, Eli, My God, my 
 God;</I> but, to show that dreadful agony of his soul was now over, he 
 here calls God <I>Father.</I> When he was giving up his life and soul 
 for us, he did for us call God <I>Father,</I> that we through him might 
 receive the adoption of sons.

 3. Christ made use of these words in a sense peculiar to himself as
 Mediator. He was now to <I>make his soul an offering for our sin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10">Isa. liii. 10</A>),

 to <I>give his life a ransom for many</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:28">Matt. xx. 28</A>),

 <I>by the eternal Spirit to offer himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:14">Heb. ix. 14</A>.

 He was himself both the priest and the sacrifice; our souls were
 forfeited, and his must go to redeem the forfeiture. The price must be 
 paid <I>into the hands</I> of God, the party offended by sin; to him he 
 had undertaken to make full satisfaction. Now by these words he 
 <I>offered up the sacrifice,</I> did, as it were, lay his hand upon the 
 head of it, and surrender it; <B><I>tithemi</I></B>--"I <I>deposit</I> 
 it, I pay it down into thy hands. Father, accept of my life and soul 
 instead of the lives and souls of the sinners I die for." The <I>animus 
 offerentis--the good will of the offerer,</I> was requisite to the 
 acceptance of the offering. Now Christ here expresses his cheerful
 willingness to offer himself, as he had done when it was first proposed 
 to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:9,10">Heb. x. 9, 10</A>),

 <I>Lo, I come to do thy will, by which will we are sanctified.</I> 

 4. Christ hereby signifies his dependence upon his Father for his
 resurrection, by the re-union of his soul and body. He commends his 
 spirit into his Father's hand, to be <I>received</I> into paradise, and 
 <I>returned</I> the third day. By this it appears that our Lord Jesus, 
 as he had a <I>true body,</I> so he had a reasonable soul, which 
 existed in a state of separation from the body, and thus he was made 
 like unto his brethren; this soul he lodged in his Father's hand, 
 committed it to his custody, resting in hope that it should not be left 
 in <I>hades,</I> in its <I>state of separation</I> from the body, no, 
 not so long as that the body might see corruption. 

 5. Christ has hereby left us an example, has fitted those words of
 David to the purpose of dying saints, and hath, as it were, sanctified 
 them for their use. In death our great care should be about our souls, 
 and we cannot more effectually provide for their welfare than by 
 committing them now into the hands of God, as a Father, to be 
 sanctified and governed by his Spirit and grace, and at death 
 committing them into his hands to be made perfect in holiness and 
 happiness. We must show that we are freely willing to die, that we 
 firmly believe in another life after this, and are desirous of it, by 
 saying, <I>Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's dying improved by the impressions it made upon those that 
 attended him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The centurion that had command of the guard was much affected with 
 what he saw, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 He was a Roman, a Gentile, a stranger to the consolations of Israel; 
 and yet he <I>glorified God.</I> He never saw such amazing instances of 
 divine power, and therefore took occasion thence to adore God as the 
 <I>Almighty.</I> And he bore a testimony to the patient sufferer: 
 "<I>Certainly this was a righteous man,</I> and was unjustly put to 
 death." God's manifesting his power so much to do him honour was a 
 plain evidence of his innocency. His testimony in Matthew and Mark goes 
 further: <I>Truly this was the Son of God.</I> But in his case this 
 amounts to the same; for, if he was <I>a righteous man,</I> he said 
 very truly when he said that <I>he was the Son of God;</I> and 
 therefore that testimony of his concerning himself must be admitted, 
 for, if it were false, he was not a <I>righteous man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The disinterested spectators could not but be concerned. This is 
 taken notice of only here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.

 <I>All the people that came together to that sight,</I> as is usual 
 upon such occasions, <I>beholding the things which were done,</I> could 
 not but go away very serious for the time, whatever they were when they 
 came home: <I>They smote their breasts, and returned.</I>

 (1.) They laid the thing very much to heart for the present. They 
 looked upon it as a wicked thing to put him to death, and could not but 
 think that some judgment of God would come upon their nation for it. 
 Probably these very people were of those that had cried, <I>Crucify 
 him, crucify him,</I> and, when he was nailed to the cross, reviled and 
 blasphemed him; but now they were so terrified with the darkness and 
 the earthquake, and the uncommon manner of his expiring, that they had 
 not only their mouths stopped, but their consciences startled, and in 
 remorse for what they had done, as the publican, they <I>smote upon 
 their breasts,</I> beat upon their own hearts, as those that had 
 indignation at themselves. Some think that this was a happy step 
 towards that good work which was afterwards wrought upon them, when 
 they were pricked to the heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:37">Acts ii. 37</A>.

 (2.) Yet, it should seem, the impression soon wore off: <I>They smote 
 their breasts, and returned.</I> They did not show any further token of 
 respect to Christ, nor enquire more concerning him, but went home; and 
 we have reason to fear that in a little time they quite forgot it. Thus 
 many that see Christ evidently set forth crucified among them in the 
 word and sacraments are a little affected for the present, but it does 
 not continue; they smite their breasts, and return. They see Christ's 
 face in the glass of the ordinances and admire him; but they <I>go 
 away, and straightway forget what manner of man he is,</I> and what 
 reason they have to love him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His own friends and followers were obliged to keep their distance, 
 and yet got as near as they could and durst, to see what was done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):

 <I>All his acquaintance,</I> that knew him and were known of him, 
 <I>stood afar off,</I> for fear lest if they had been near him they 
 should have been taken up as favourers of him; this was part of his 
 sufferings, as of Job's 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:13">Job xix. 13</A>):

 <I>He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are 
 verily estranged from me.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:18">Ps. lxxxviii. 18</A>.

 And <I>the women that followed him</I> together <I>from Galilee were 
 beholding these things,</I> not knowing what to make of them, nor so 
 ready as they should have been to take them for certain preludes of his 
 resurrection. Now was Christ <I>set for a sign that should be spoken
 against,</I> as Simeon foretold, <I>that the thoughts of many hearts 
 might be revealed,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>50  And, behold, <I>there was</I> a man named Joseph, a counsellor;
 <I>and he was</I> a good man, and a just:

 them;) <I>he was</I> of Arimath&aelig;a, a city of the Jews: who also
 himself waited for the kingdom of God.
 &nbsp; 52 This <I>man</I> went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
 &nbsp; 53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in
 a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was
 laid.
 &nbsp; 54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
 &nbsp; 55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee,
 followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was
 laid.
 &nbsp; 56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and
 rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.

 We have here an account of Christ's burial; for he must be brought not 
 only to death, but to the dust of death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:15">Ps. xxii. 15</A>),

 according to the sentence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:19">Gen. iii. 19</A>),

 <I>To the dust thou shalt return.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who buried him. His acquaintance <I>stood afar off;</I> they had 
 neither money to bear the <I>charge</I> nor courage to bear the 
 <I>odium</I> of burying him decently; but God raised up one that had 
 both, a <I>man named Joseph,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>.

 His character is that he was <I>a good man and a just,</I> a man of 
 unspotted reputation for virtue and piety, not only <I>just</I> to all, 
 but good to all that needed him (and care to <I>bury the dead,</I> as 
 becomes the hope of the resurrection of the dead, is one instance of 
 goodness and beneficence); he was a person of quality, a counsellor, a 
 senator, a member of the sanhedrim, one of the elders of the Jewish 
 church. Having said this of him, it was necessary to add that, though 
 he was of that body of men who had put Christ to death, yet he <I>had 
 not consented to their counsel and deed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 though it was carried by the majority, yet he entered his protest 
 against it, and followed not the multitude to do evil. Note, That evil 
 counsel or deed to which we have not consented shall not be reckoned 
 our act. Nay, he not only <I>dissented</I> openly from those that were 
 enemies to Christ, but be <I>consented</I> secretly with those that 
 were his friends: <I>He himself waited for the kingdom of God;</I> he 
 believed the Old-Testament prophecies of the Messiah and his kingdom, 
 and expected the accomplishment of them. This was the man that appears 
 upon this occasion to have had a true respect for the Lord Jesus. Note, 
 There are many who are hearty in Christ's interests, how, though they 
 do not make any show in their outward profession of it, yet will be 
 more ready to do him a piece of real service, when there is occasion, 
 than others who make a greater figure and noise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What he did towards the burying of him. 

 1. He <I>went to Pilate,</I> the judge that condemned him, and 
 <I>begged the body of Jesus,</I> for it was at his disposal; and, 
 though he might have raised a party sufficient to have carried off the 
 body by violence, yet he would take the regular course, and do it 
 peaceably. 

 2. He <I>took it down,</I> it should seem, with his own hands, and
 <I>wrapped it in linen.</I> They tell us that it was the manner of the 
 Jews to <I>roll</I> the bodies of the dead, as we do little children in 
 their <I>swaddling-clothes,</I> and that the word here used signifies 
 as much; so that the piece of fine linen, which he bought whole, he cut 
 into many pieces for this purpose. It is said of Lazarus, <I>He was 
 bound hand and foot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:44">John xi. 44</A>.

 <I>Grave-clothes</I> are to the saints as <I>swaddling-clothes,</I>
 which they shall out-grow and put off, when they <I>come to the perfect 
 man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Where he was buried. <I>In a sepulchre that was hewn in stone,</I> 
 that the prison of the grave might be made strong, as the church, when 
 she was brought into darkness, had her way <I>enclosed with hewn 
 stone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:2,9">Lam. iii. 2, 9</A>.

 But it was <I>a sepulchre in which never man before was laid,</I> for
 he was buried on such an account as never any one before him was 
 buried, only in order to his rising again the third day by his own 
 power; and he was to triumph over the grave as never any man did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. When he was buried. <I>On the day of the preparation, when the 
 sabbath drew on,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.

 This is given as a reason why they made such haste with the funeral, 
 because the <I>sabbath drew</I> on, which required their attendance to 
 other work, preparing for the sabbath, and going forth to welcome it. 
 Note, Weeping must not hinder sowing. Though they were in tears for the 
 death of Christ, yet they must apply themselves to the sanctifying of 
 the sabbath; and, when the sabbath draws on, there must be 
 <I>preparation.</I> Our worldly affairs must be so ordered that they 
 may not hinder us from our sabbath work, and our holy affections must 
 be so excited that they may carry us on in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Who attended the funeral; not any of the disciples, but only <I>the 
 women that came with him from Galilee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>),

 who, as they staid by him while he hung on the cross, so they 
 <I>followed</I> him, all in tears no doubt, and <I>beheld the 
 sepulchre</I> where it was, which was the way to it, and <I>how his 
 body was laid in it.</I> They were led to this, not by their curiosity, 
 but by their affection to the Lord Jesus, which was <I>strong as 
 death</I> and which <I>many waters could not quench.</I> Here was a 
 silent funeral, and not a solemn one, and yet <I>his rest was 
 glorious.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. What preparation was made for the embalming of his body after he 
 was buried 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>):

 <I>They returned, and prepared spices and ointments,</I> which was more 
 an evidence of their love than of their faith; for had they 
 <I>remembered</I> and <I>believed</I> what he had so often told them, 
 that he should <I>rise again the third day,</I> they would have spared 
 their <I>cost</I> and <I>pains</I> herein, as knowing that in a short 
 time there would be a greater honour put upon his body, by the glory of 
 his resurrection, than they could put upon it with their most 
 <I>precious ointments;</I> but, busy as they were in this preparation, 
 they <I>rested on the sabbath day,</I> and did none of this servile 
 work thereon, not only according to the custom of their nation, but 
 <I>according to the commandments</I> of their God, which, though the 
 day be altered, is still in full force: <I>Remember the sabbath day, to 
 keep it holy.</I></P>
