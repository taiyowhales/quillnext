 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Nothing is related concerning our Lord Jesus from his twelfth year to 
 his entrance on his thirtieth year. We often think it would have been a 
 pleasure and advantage to us if we had journals, or at least annuls, of 
 occurrences concerning him; but we have as much as Infinite Wisdom 
 thought fit to communicate to us, and, if we improve not that, neither 
 should we have improved more if we had had it. The great intention of 
 the evangelists was to give us an account of the gospel of Christ, 
 which we are to believe, and by which we hope for salvation: now that 
 began in the ministry and baptism of John, and therefore they hasten to 
 give us an account of that. We could wish, perhaps, that Luke had 
 wholly passed by what was related by Matthew and Mark, and had written 
 only what was new, as he has done in his two first chapters. But it was 
 the will of the Spirit that some things should be established out of 
 the mouth, not only of two, but of three witnesses; and we must not 
 reckon it a needless repetition, nor shall we do so if we renew out 
 meditations upon these things, with suitable affections. In this 
 chapter we have, 

 I. The beginning of John's baptism, and the scope and intention of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.
 
 His exhortation to the multitude

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>),

 to which is added (though it happened after what follows) the mention
 of his imprisonment,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius C&aelig;sar,
 Pontius Pilate being governor of Jud&aelig;a, and Herod being tetrarch
 of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Itur&aelig;a and of the
 region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,
 &nbsp; 2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God
 came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 3 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
 baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;
 &nbsp; 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the
 prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
 Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
 &nbsp; 5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill
 shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and
 the rough ways <I>shall be</I> made smooth;
 &nbsp; 6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
 &nbsp; 7 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized
 of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from
 the wrath to come?
 &nbsp; 8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin
 not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to <I>our</I> father:
 for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up
 children unto Abraham.
 &nbsp; 9 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
 every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
 down, and cast into the fire.
 &nbsp; 10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?
 &nbsp; 11 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats,
 let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let
 him do likewise.
 &nbsp; 12 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,
 Master, what shall we do?
 &nbsp; 13 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is
 appointed you.
 &nbsp; 14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what
 shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man,
 neither accuse <I>any</I> falsely; and be content with your wages.

 John's baptism introducing a new dispensation, it was requisite that we 
 should have a particular account of it. Glorious things were said of 
 John, what a distinguished favourite of Heaven he should be, and what a 
 great blessing to this earth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:15,17"><I>ch.</I> i. 15, 17</A>);

 but we lost him in the deserts, and there he remains until <I>the day
 of his showing unto Israel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:80"><I>ch.</I> i. 80</A>.

 And now at last that day dawns, and a welcome day it was to them that
 waited for it more than they that waited for the morning. Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The date of the beginning of John's baptism, when it was that he 
 appeared; this is here taken notice of, which was not by the other 
 evangelists, that the truth of the thing might be confirmed by the 
 exact fixing of the time. And it is dated,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By the government of the heathen, which the Jews were under, to show 
 that they were a conquered people, and therefore it was time for the 
 Messiah to come to set up a spiritual kingdom, and an eternal one, upon 
 the ruins of all the temporal dignity and dominion of David and 
 Judah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is dated by the reign of the Roman emperor; it was in the 
 fifteenth year of Tiberius C&aelig;sar, the third of the twelve
 C&aelig;sars, a very bad man, given to covetousness, drunkenness, and 
 cruelty; such a man is mentioned first (saith Dr. Lightfoot), as it 
 were, to teach us what to look for from that cruel and abominable city 
 wherein Satan reigned in all ages and successions. The people of the 
 Jews, after a long struggle, were of late made a province of the 
 empire, and were under the dominion of this Tiberius; and that country 
 which once had made so great a figure, and had many nations tributaries 
 to it, in the reigns of David and Solomon, is now itself an 
 inconsiderable despicable part of the Roman empire, and rather trampled 
 upon than triumphed in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The lawgiver was now departed from between Judah's feet; and, as an 
 evidence of that, their public acts are dated by the reign of the Roman 
 emperor, and therefore now Shiloh must come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is dated by the governments of the viceroys that ruled in the 
 several parts of the Holy Land under the Roman emperor, which was 
 another badge of their servitude, for they were all foreigners, which 
 bespeaks a sad change with that people whose <I>governors</I> used to 
 be <I>of themselves</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:21">Jer. xxx. 21</A>),

 and it was their glory. <I>How is the gold become dim!</I>

 [1.] Pilate is here said to be the governor, president, or procurator, 
 of Judea. This character is given of him by some other writers, that he 
 was a wicked man, and one that made no conscience of a lie. He reigned 
 ill, and at last was displaced by Vitellius, president of Syria, and 
 sent to Rome, to answer for his mal-administrations. 

 [2.] The other three are called <I>tetrarchs,</I> some think from the 
 countries which they had the command of, each of them being over a 
 <I>fourth part</I> of that which had been entirely under the government 
 of Herod the Great. Others think that they are so called from the post 
 of honour they held in the government; they had the <I>fourth</I> 
 place, or were <I>fourth-rate</I> governors: the emperor was the 
 <I>first,</I> the <I>pro-consul,</I> who governed a province, the 
 <I>second,</I> a <I>king</I> the <I>third,</I> and a <I>tetrarch</I> 
 the <I>fourth.</I> So Dr. Lightfoot.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By the government of the Jews among themselves, to show that they 
 were a corrupt people, and that therefore it was time that the Messiah 
 should come, to reform them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. God had appointed that there 
 should be but one high priest at a time, but here were two, to serve 
 some ill turn or other: one served one year and the other the other 
 year; so some. One was the high priest, and the other the <I>sagan,</I> 
 as the Jews called him, to officiate for him when he was disabled; or, 
 as others say, one was high priest, and represented Aaron, and that was 
 <I>Caiaphas;</I> Annas, the other, was <I>nasi,</I> or head of the 
 sanhedrim, and represented Moses. But to us there is but one high 
 priest, one Lord of all, to whom all judgment is committed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The origin and tendency of John's baptism.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The origin of it was <I>from heaven: The word of God came unto 
 John,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He received full commission and full instructions from God to do what 
 he did. It is the same expression that is used concerning the 
 Old-Testament prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:2">Jer. i. 2</A>);

 for John was a prophet, yea, more than a prophet, and in him prophecy 
 revived, which had been long suspended. We are not told how <I>the word 
 of the Lord came</I> to John, whether by an angel, as to his father, or 
 by dream, or vision, or voice, but it was to his satisfaction, and 
 ought to be to ours. John is here called <I>the son of Zacharias,</I> 
 to refer us to what the angel said to his father, when he assured him 
 that he should have this son. The word of the Lord came to him <I>in 
 the wilderness;</I> for those whom God <I>fits</I> he will find out, 
 wherever they are. As the word of the Lord is not <I>bound</I> in a 
 <I>prison,</I> so it is not <I>lost</I> in a <I>wilderness.</I> The 
 <I>word of the Lord</I> made its way to Ezekiel among the captives by 
 the river of Chebar, and to John in the isle of Patmos. John was the 
 <I>son of a priest,</I> now entering upon the thirtieth year of his 
 age; and therefore, according to the custom of the temple, he was now 
 to be admitted into the temple-service, where he should have attended 
 as a candidate five years before. But God had called him to a more 
 honourable ministry, and therefore the Holy Ghost enrols him here, 
 since he was not enrolled in the archives of the temple: <I>John the 
 son of Zacharias began his ministration such a time.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The scope and design of it were to bring all the people of his 
 country off from their sins and home to their God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 <I>He came</I> first <I>into all the country about Jordan,</I> the 
 neighbourhood wherein he resided, that part of the country which Israel 
 took possession of first, when they entered the land of promise under 
 Joshua's conduct; there was the banner of the gospel first displayed.
 John resided in the most solitary part of the country: but, when the 
 word of the Lord came to him, he quitted his deserts, and came into the 
 inhabited country. Those that are <I>best pleased</I> in their 
 retirements must cheerfully <I>exchange</I> them, when God calls them 
 into places of concourse. <I>He came</I> out of the wilderness <I>into 
 all the country,</I> with some marks of distinction, <I>preaching</I> a 
 new <I>baptism;</I> not a sect, or party, but a <I>profession,</I> or 
 distinguishing badge. The sign, or ceremony, was such as was ordinarily 
 used among the Jews, <I>washing with water,</I> by which proselytes 
 were sometimes admitted, or disciples to some great master; but the 
 meaning of it was, <I>repentance for the remission of sins:</I> that 
 is, all that submitted to his baptism,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Were thereby obliged to <I>repent of their sins,</I> to be 
 <I>sorry</I> for what they had done amiss, and to <I>do so no more.</I> 
 The former they <I>professed,</I> and were concerned to be 
 <I>sincere</I> in their professions; the latter they <I>promised,</I> 
 and were concerned to <I>make good</I> what they promised. He bound 
 them, not to such ceremonious observances as were imposed by the 
 tradition of the elders, but to change their mind, and change their 
 way, to <I>cast away from them all their transgressions,</I> and to 
 <I>make them new hearts</I> and to live new lives. The design of the 
 gospel, which now began, was to make men devout and pious, holy and 
 heavenly, humble and meek, sober and chaste, just and honest, 
 charitable and kind, and good in every relation, who had been much 
 otherwise; and this is to <I>repent.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They were thereby assured of the pardon of their sins, upon their 
 repentance. As the baptism he administered bound them not to submit to 
 the power of sin, so it sealed to them a gracious and pleadable 
 discharge from the guilt of sin. <I>Turn yourselves from all your 
 transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruin;</I> agreeing with 
 the word of the Lord, by the Old-Testament prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:30">Ezek. xviii. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The fulfilling of the scriptures in the ministry of John. The 
 other evangelists had referred us to the same text that is here 
 referred to, that of Esaias, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:3"><I>ch.</I> xl. 3</A>.

 It is <I>written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet,</I>
 which he heard from God, which he spoke for God, those words of his 
 which were <I>written</I> for the generations to come. Among them it is 
 found that there should be <I>the voice of one crying in the 
 wilderness;</I> and John is that voice, a clear distinct voice, a loud 
 voice, an articulate one; he cries, <I>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, 
 and make his paths straight.</I> John's business is to <I>make way</I> 
 for the entertainment of the gospel in the hearts of the people, to 
 bring them into such a frame and temper as that Christ might be welcome 
 to them, and they welcome to Christ. Luke goes further on with the 
 quotation than Matthew and Mark had done, and applies the following 
 words likewise to John's ministry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>),

 <I>Every valley shall be filled.</I> Dr. Hammond understands this as a
 prediction of the desolation coming upon the people of the Jews for 
 their infidelity: the land should be made plain by the pioneers for the 
 Roman army, and should be laid waste by it, and there should then be a 
 visible distinction made between the impenitent on the one side and the 
 receivers of the gospel on the other side. But it seems rather to be 
 meant of the gospel of Christ, of which that was the introduction. 

 1. The humble shall by it be <I>enriched</I> with grace: <I>Every
 valley</I> that lies <I>low</I> and <I>moist</I> shall be <I>filled</I> 
 and be <I>exalted.</I>

 2. The proud shall by it be humbled; the <I>self-confident</I> that
 stand upon <I>their own bottom,</I> and the <I>self-conceited</I> that 
 lift up <I>their own top,</I> shall have contempt put upon them: 
 <I>Every mountain and hill shall be brought low.</I> If they repent, 
 they are brought to the dust; if not, to the lowest hell.

 3. Sinners shall be converted to God: <I>The crooked ways</I> and the
 <I>crooked</I> spirits shall be <I>made straight;</I> for, though 
 <I>none can make that straight which God hath made crooked</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:13">Eccl. vii. 13</A>),

 yet God by his grace can make that straight which sin hath made
 crooked. 

 4. Difficulties that were hindering and discouraging in the way to
 heaven shall be removed: <I>The rough ways shall be made smooth;</I> 
 and they that love God's law shall have <I>great peace,</I> and 
 <I>nothing shall offend them.</I> The gospel has made the way to heaven 
 <I>plain</I> and easy to be <I>found, smooth</I> and easy to be 
 <I>walked in.</I> 

 5. The great salvation shall be more fully discovered than ever, and
 the discovery of it shall spread further

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>All flesh shall see the salvation of God;</I> not the Jews only, but 
 the Gentiles. All shall <I>see</I> it; they shall have it set before
 them and offered to them, and some of all sorts shall <I>see</I> it, 
 enjoy it, and have the benefit of it. When way is made for the gospel 
 into the heart, by the captivation of high thoughts and bringing them 
 into obedience to Christ, by the leveling of the soul and the removing 
 of all obstructions that stand in the way of Christ and his grace, then 
 prepare to bid the salvation of God welcome.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The general warnings and exhortations which he gave to those who 
 submitted to his baptism, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.

 In Matthew he is said to have preached these same things to <I>many of 
 the Pharisees and Sadducees,</I> that <I>came to his baptism</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:7-10">Matt. iii. 7-10</A>);

 but here he is said to have spoken them <I>to the multitude, that came 
 forth to be baptized of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This was the purport of his preaching to all that came to him, and he 
 did not alter it in compliment to the Pharisees and Sadducees, when 
 they came, but dealt as plainly with them as with any other of his 
 hearers. And as he did not flatter the <I>great,</I> so neither did he 
 compliment the <I>many,</I> or make his court to them, but gave the 
 same reproofs of sin and warnings of wrath to the <I>multitude</I> that 
 he did to the Sadducees and Pharisees; for, if they had not the same 
 faults, they had others as bad. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the guilty corrupted race of mankind is become a <I>generation 
 of vipers;</I> not only poisoned, but poisonous; hateful to God, hating 
 one another. This magnifies the patience of God, in continuing the race 
 of mankind upon the earth, and not destroying that <I>nest of 
 vipers.</I> He did it once by water, and will again by fire.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This generation of vipers is fairly warned to <I>flee from the wrath 
 to come,</I> which is certainly before them if they continue such; and 
 their being a <I>multitude</I> will not be at all their security, for 
 it will be neither <I>reproach</I> nor <I>loss</I> to God to cut them 
 off. We are not only warned of this wrath, but are put into a way to 
 escape it, if we look about us in time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. There is no way of <I>fleeing from the wrath to come,</I> but by 
 <I>repentance.</I> They that submitted to the baptism of repentance 
 thereby evidenced that they were <I>warned</I> to flee from the wrath 
 to come and <I>took</I> the warning; and we by our baptism profess to 
 have fled out of Sodom, for fear of what is coming upon it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Those that profess repentance are highly concerned to live like 
 penitents 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance,</I> else, 
 notwithstanding your professions of repentance, you cannot escape 
 <I>the wrath to come.</I>" By the fruits of repentance it will be known 
 whether it be sincere or no. By the change of our way must be evidenced 
 the change of our mind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. If we be not really holy, both in heart and life, our profession of 
 religion and relation to God and his church will stand us in no stead 
 at all: <I>Begin not</I> now to frame excuses from this great duty of 
 repentance, by <I>saying within yourselves, We have Abraham to our 
 father.</I> What will it avail us to be the children of godly parents 
 if we be not godly, to be within the pale of the Church if we be not 
 brought into the bond of the covenant?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. We have therefore no reason to depend upon our external privileges
 and professions of religion, because God has no need of us or of our 
 services, but can effectually secure by his own honour and interest 
 without us. If we were cut off and ruined, he could raise up to himself 
 a church out of the most unlikely,--<I>children to Abraham</I> even
 <I>out of stones.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. The greater professions we make of repentance, and the greater 
 assistances and encouragements are given us to repentance, the nearer 
 and the sorer will our destruction be if we do not <I>bring forth 
 fruits meet for repentance.</I> Now that the gospel begins to be 
 preached, now that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, <I>now</I> that 
 the <I>axe is laid to the root of the tree,</I> threatenings to the 
 wicked and impenitent are now more terrible than before, as 
 encouragements to the penitent are now more comfortable. "Now that you 
 are upon your behaviour, look to yourselves."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. Barren trees will be cast into the fire at length; it is the fittest 
 place for them: <I>Every tree</I> that doth not bring forth fruit, 
 <I>good fruit,</I> is <I>hewn down,</I> and <I>cast into the fire.</I> 
 If it serve not for fruit, to the honour of God's grace, let it serve 
 for fuel, to the honour of his justice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The particular instructions he gave to several sorts of persons, 
 that enquired of him concerning their duty: the <I>people,</I> the 
 <I>publicans,</I> and the <I>soldiers.</I> Some of the Pharisees and 
 Sadducees came to his baptism; but we do not find them asking, <I>What 
 shall we do?</I> They thought they knew what they had to do as well as 
 he could tell them, or were determined to do what they pleased, 
 whatever he told them. But the <I>people,</I> the <I>publicans,</I> and 
 the <I>soldiers,</I> who knew that they had done amiss, and that they 
 ought to do better, and were conscious to themselves of great ignorance 
 and unacquaintedness with the divine law, were particularly 
 inquisitive: <I>What shall we do?</I> Note, 

 1. Those that are <I>baptized</I> must be <I>taught,</I> and those that
 have baptized them are concerned, as they have opportunity, to teach 
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:19,20">Matt. xxviii. 19, 20</A>.

 2. Those that profess and promise repentance in general must evidence
 it by particular instances of reformation, according as their place and 
 condition are. 

 3. They that would do their duty must desire to know their duty, and
 enquire concerning it. The first good word Paul said, when he was 
 converted, was, <I>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</I> These here 
 enquire, not, <I>What shall this man do?</I> but, What shall <I>we</I> 
 do? What <I>fruits meet for repentance</I> shall we <I>bring forth?</I> 
 Now John gives answer to each, according to their place and 
 station.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He tells the <I>people</I> their duty, and that is to be 
 charitable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 He <I>that has two coats,</I> and, consequently, one to spare, let him 
 <I>give,</I> or <I>lend</I> at least, <I>to him that has none,</I> to 
 keep him warm. Perhaps he saw among his hearers some that were 
 overloaded with clothes, while others were ready to perish in rags, and 
 he puts those who had superfluities upon contributing to the relief of 
 those that had not necessaries. The gospel requires <I>mercy,</I> and 
 not sacrifice; and the design of it is to engage us to do all the good 
 we can. <I>Food and raiment</I> are the two supports of life; he that 
 hath <I>meat</I> to spare, let him give to him that is destitute of 
 <I>daily food,</I> as well as he that hath clothes to spare: what we 
 have we are but stewards of, and must use it, accordingly, as our 
 Master directs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He tells the <I>publicans</I> their duty, the collectors of the
 emperor's revenue 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Exact no more than that which is appointed you.</I> They must do 
 justice between the government and the merchant, and not oppress the 
 people in levying the taxes, nor any way make them heavier or more 
 burdensome than the law had made them. They must not think that because 
 it was their office to take care that the people did not defraud the 
 prince they might therefore, by the power they had, bear hard upon the 
 people; as those that have ever so little a branch of power are apt to 
 abuse it: "No, keep to your <I>book of rates,</I> and reckon it enough 
 that you collect for C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's, and 
 do not enrich yourselves by taking more." The public revenues must be 
 applied to the public service, and not to gratify the avarice of 
 private persons. Observe, He does not direct the publicans to quit 
 their places, and to go no more to the receipt of custom; the 
 employment is in itself lawful and necessary, but let them be just and 
 honest in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He tells the <I>soldiers</I> their duty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Some think that these soldiers were of the Jewish nation and religion: 
 others think that they were Romans; for it was not likely either that 
 the Jews would serve the Romans or that the Romans would trust the Jews 
 in their garrisons in their own nation; and then it is an early 
 instance of Gentiles embracing the gospel and submitting to it. 
 Military men seldom seem inclined to religion; yet these submitted even 
 to the Baptist's strict profession, and desired to receive the <I>word 
 of command</I> from him: <I>What must we do?</I> Those who more than 
 other men have their lives in their hands, and are in deaths often, are 
 concerned to enquire what they shall do that they may be <I>found in 
 peace.</I> In answer to this enquiry, John does not bid them lay down 
 their arms, and desert the service, but cautions them against the sins 
 that soldiers were commonly guilty of; for this is fruit meet for 
 repentance, to <I>keep ourselves from our iniquity.</I>

 [1.] They must not be injurious to <I>the people</I> among whom they 
 were quartered, and over whom indeed they were set: "<I>Do violence to 
 no man.</I> Your business is to keep the peace, and prevent men's doing 
 violence to one another; but do not you <I>do violence</I> to any. 
 <I>Shake no man</I>" (so the word signifies); "do not put people into
 fear; for the sword of war, as well as that of justice, is to be a 
 terror only to evil doers, but a protection to those that do well. Be 
 not rude in your quarters; force not money from people by frightening 
 them. Shed not the blood of war in peace; offer no incivility either to 
 man or woman, nor have any hand in the barbarous devastations that 
 armies sometimes make." Nor must they <I>accuse any falsely</I> to the 
 government, thereby to make themselves formidable, and get bribes. 

 [2.] They must not be injurious to their <I>fellow-soldiers;</I> for 
 some think that caution, not to <I>accuse falsely,</I> has special 
 reference to them: "Be not forward to complain one of another to your 
 superior officers, that you may be revenged on those whom you have a 
 pique against, or undermine those above you, and get into their 
 places." <I>Do not oppress any;</I> so some think the word here 
 signifies as used by the LXX. in several passages of the Old Testament. 
 
 [3.] They must not be given to mutiny, or contend with their generals 
 about their pay: "<I>Be content with your wages.</I> While you have 
 what you agreed for, do not murmur that it is not more." It is 
 discontent with what they have that makes men oppressive and injurious; 
 they that never think they have enough themselves will not scruple at 
 any the most irregular practices to make it more, by defrauding others.
 It is a rule to all servants that they <I>be content with their 
 wages;</I> for they that indulge themselves in discontents expose 
 themselves to many temptations, and it is wisdom to make the best of 
 that which is.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in
 their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;
 &nbsp; 16 John answered, saying unto <I>them</I> all, I indeed baptize you
 with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose
 shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the
 Holy Ghost and with fire:
 &nbsp; 17 Whose fan <I>is</I> in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his
 floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff
 he will burn with fire unquenchable.
 &nbsp; 18 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto
 the people.
 &nbsp; 19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias
 his brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had
 done,
 &nbsp; 20 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are now drawing near to the appearance of our Lord Jesus publicly; 
 the Sun will not be long after the morning-star. We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the people took occasion, from the ministry and baptism of John, 
 to think of the Messiah, and to think of him as at the door, as now 
 come. Thus the way of the Lord was <I>prepared,</I> and people were 
 prepared to bid Christ welcome; for, when men's expectations are 
 raised, that which they are in expectation of becomes doubly 
 acceptable. Now when they observed what an excellent doctrine John 
 Baptist preached, what a divine power went along with it, and what a 
 tendency it had to reform the world, 

 1. They began presently to consider that now was the time for the
 Messiah to appear. The sceptre was departed from Judah, for they had no 
 king but C&aelig;sar; nay, and the law-giver too was gone from between 
 his feet, for Herod had lately slain the sanhedrim. Daniel's seventy
 weeks were now expiring; and therefore it was but three or four years 
 after this that they looked that the kingdom of heaven should appear 
 immediately,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:11">Luke xix. 11</A>.

 Never did the corrupt state of the Jews more need a reformation, nor
 their distressed state more need a deliverance, than now. 

 2. Their next thought was, "Is not his he that should come?" <I>All</I>
 thinking <I>men mused,</I> or reasoned, <I>in their hearts,</I> 
 concerning John, <I>whether he were the Christ or not.</I> He had 
 indeed none of the external pomp and grandeur in which they generally 
 expected the Messiah to appear; but his life was holy and strict, his 
 preaching powerful and with authority, and therefore "why may we not 
 think that he is the Messiah, and that he will shortly throw off this 
 disguise, and appear in more glory?" Note, That which puts people upon 
 considering, reasoning with themselves, prepares the way for 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How John disowned all pretensions to the honour of being himself 
 the Messiah, but confirmed them in their expectations of him that 
 really was the Messiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 John's office, as a crier or herald, was to give notice that the 
 <I>kingdom of God</I> and the King of that kingdom were <I>at hand;</I> 
 and therefore, when he had told all manner of people severally what 
 they must do ("You must do this, and you must do that"), he tells them
 one thing more which they must all do: they must expect the Messiah now 
 shortly to appear. And this serves as an <I>answer</I> to their 
 <I>musings</I> and debates concerning himself. Though he knew not
 their thoughts, yet, in declaring this, he <I>answered</I> them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He declares that the utmost he could do was to <I>baptize</I> them 
 <I>with water.</I> He had no access to <I>the Spirit,</I> nor could 
 command <I>that</I> or work upon <I>that;</I> he could only exhort them 
 to <I>repent,</I> and assure them of forgiveness, upon repentance; he 
 could not work repentance in them, nor confer remission on them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He consigns them, and turns them over, as it were, to Jesus Christ, 
 for whom he was sent to <I>prepare the way,</I> and to whom he was 
 ready to transfer all the interest he had in the affections of the 
 people, and would have them no longer to <I>debate</I> whether John was 
 the Messiah or no, but to look for him that was really so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) John owns the Messiah to have a greater <I>excellency</I> than he 
 had, and that he was in all things preferable to him; he is one the 
 <I>latchet of whose shoe</I> he does not think himself <I>worthy to 
 loose;</I> he does not think himself worthy to be the meanest of his 
 servants, to help him on and off with his shoes. John was <I>a 
 prophet,</I> yea <I>more than a prophet,</I> more so than any of the 
 Old-Testament prophets; but Christ was a prophet more than John, for it 
 was both <I>by the Spirit of Christ,</I> and <I>of the grace of 
 Christ,</I> that all the prophets prophesied, and John among the rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10,11">1 Pet. i. 10, 11</A>.

 This was a great truth which John came to preach; but the manner of his
 expressing it bespeaks his humility, and in it he not only <I>does 
 justice</I> to the Lord Jesus, but <I>does him honour</I> too: "He is 
 one whom I am not worthy to approach, or draw nigh to, no not as a 
 servant." Thus highly does it become us to speak of Christ, and thus 
 humbly of ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He owns him to have a greater <I>energy</I> than he had: "He is 
 <I>mightier than I,</I> and does that which I cannot do, both for the 
 comfort of the faithful and for the terror of hypocrites and 
 dissemblers." They thought that a wonderful power went along with John; 
 but what was that compared with the power which Jesus would come 
 clothed with? 

 [1.] John can do no more than <I>baptize with water,</I> in token of 
 this, that they ought to purify and cleanse themselves; but Christ can, 
 and will, <I>baptize with the Holy Ghost;</I> he can give the Spirit to 
 cleanse and purify the heart, not only as <I>water</I> washes off the 
 <I>dirt</I> on the outside, but as <I>fire</I> purges out the 
 <I>dross</I> that is within, and <I>melts down</I> the metal, that it 
 may be cast into a <I>new mould.</I> 

 [2.] John can only preach a <I>distinguishing</I> doctrine, and by word 
 and sign <I>separate between the precious and the vile;</I> but Christ 
 hath his <I>fan in his hand,</I> with which he can, and will, perfectly 
 separate between the wheat and the chaff. He <I>will thoroughly purge 
 his floor;</I> it is <I>his own,</I> and therefore he will <I>purge</I> 
 it, and will cast out of his church the unbelieving impenitent Jews, 
 and confirm in his church all that faithfully follow him. 

 [3.] John can only <I>speak comfort</I> to those that receive the 
 gospel, and, like other prophets, <I>say to the righteous</I> that 
 <I>it shall be well with them;</I> but Jesus Christ will <I>give them 
 comfort.</I> John can only promise them that they shall be safe; but 
 Christ will make them so: he will <I>gather the wheat into his 
 garner;</I> good, serious, solid people he will gather now into his 
 church on earth, which shall be made up of such, and he will shortly 
 gather them into his church in heaven, where they shall be for ever 
 sheltered. 

 [4.] John can only <I>threaten</I> hypocrites, and tell the <I>barren 
 trees</I> that they shall be <I>hewn down</I> and <I>cast into the 
 fire;</I> but Christ can execute that threatening; those that are as 
 <I>chaff,</I> light, and vain, and worthless, <I>he will burn with fire 
 unquenchable.</I> John refers here to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:18,4:1,2">Mal. iii. 18; iv. 1, 2</A>.

 <I>Then,</I> when the <I>floor is purged, ye shall return, and discern
 between the righteous and the wicked,</I> for <I>the day comes that 
 shall burn as an oven.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The evangelist concludes his account of John's preaching with an <I>et 
 c&aelig;tera</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the 
 people,</I> which are not recorded. <I>First,</I> John was an 
 <I>affectionate</I> preacher. He was 
 <B><I>parakalon</I></B>--<I>exhorting,</I> beseeching; he pressed 
 things home upon his hearers, followed his doctrine close, as one in 
 earnest. <I>Secondly,</I> He was a <I>practical</I> preacher. Much of
 his preaching was <I>exhortation,</I> quickening them to their duty, 
 directing them in it, and not amusing them with matters of nice 
 speculation. <I>Thirdly,</I> He was a <I>popular</I> preacher. Though 
 he had scribes and Pharisees, men of polite learning, attending his 
 ministry, and Sadducees, men of <I>free thought,</I> as they pretended, 
 yet he addressed himself <I>to the people,</I> <B><I>pros ton 
 laon</I></B>--<I>to the laity,</I> and accommodated himself to their 
 capacity, as promising himself best success among them.
 <I>Fourthly,</I> He was an <I>evangelical</I> preacher, for so the word 
 here used signifies, <B><I>euengelizeto</I></B>--<I>he preached the 
 gospel</I> to the people; in all his <I>exhortations,</I> he directed 
 people to Christ, and excited and encouraged their expectations of 
 <I>him.</I> When we press duty upon people, we must direct them to 
 Christ, both for righteousness and strength. <I>Fifthly,</I> He was a
 <I>copious</I> preacher: <I>Many other things he preached,</I> 
 <B><I>polla men kai hetera</I></B>--<I>many things, and different.</I> 
 He preached a great deal, shunned not to declare the whole counsel of 
 God; and he <I>varied</I> in his preaching, that those who were not 
 reached, and touched, and wrought upon, by one truth, might be by 
 another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How full a stop was put to John's preaching. When he was in the 
 midst of his usefulness, going on thus successfully, he was imprisoned 
 by the malice of Herod 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):

 <I>Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him,</I> not only for living in 
 incest with his brother Philip's wife, but for the many other <I>evils 
 which Herod had done</I> (for those that are wicked in one instance are 
 commonly so in many others), he could not <I>bear it,</I> but 
 contracted an antipathy to him for his plain dealing, and <I>added</I> 
 this wickedness to all the rest, which was indeed <I>above all,</I> 
 that he <I>shut up John in prison,</I> put that burning and shining 
 light under a bushel. Because he could not bear his reproofs, others 
 should be deprived of the benefit of his instructions and counsels. 
 Some little good he might do to those who had access to him, when he 
 was in prison; but nothing to what he might have done if he had had 
 liberty to go about all the country, as he had done. We cannot think of 
 Herod's doing this without the greatest compassion and lamentation, nor 
 of God's permitting it without admiring the depth of the divine 
 counsels, which we cannot account for. Must he be silenced who is the 
 <I>voice of one crying in the wilderness?</I> Must such a preacher be 
 shut up in prison who ought to have been set up in the courts of the 
 temple? But thus the faith of his disciples must be tried; thus the 
 unbelief of those who rejected him must be punished; thus he must be 
 Christ's forerunner in suffering as well as preaching; and thus, having 
 been for about a year and a half preparing people for Christ, he must 
 now give way to him, and, the Sun being risen, the morning-star must of 
 course disappear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The evangelist mentioned John's imprisonment before Christ's being 
 baptized, though it was nearly a year after it, because he would finish 
 the story of John's ministry, and then introduce that of Christ. Now 
 here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A short account of Christ's baptism, which had been more fully 
 related by St. Matthew. Jesus came, to be baptized of John, and he was 
 so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is here said that, <I>when all the people were baptized,</I> then 
 <I>Jesus was baptized:</I> all that were then present. Christ would be 
 baptized last, among the common people, and in the rear of them; thus 
 he humbled himself, and made himself of no reputation, as one of the 
 least, nay, as less than the least. He saw what multitudes were hereby 
 prepared to receive him, and then he appeared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Notice is here taken of Christ's <I>praying</I> when he was 
 <I>baptized,</I> which was not in Matthew: being baptized, and 
 <I>praying.</I> He did not <I>confess sin,</I> as others did, for he 
 had none to confess; but he <I>prayed,</I> as others did, for he would 
 thus keep up communion with his Father. Note, The inward and spiritual 
 grace of which sacraments are the outward and visible signs must be 
 fetched in by prayer; and therefore prayer must always accompany them. 
 We have reason to think that Christ now prayed for this manifestation 
 of God's favour to him which immediately followed; he prayed for the 
 discovery of his Father's favour to him, and the descent of the Spirit. 
 What was promised to Christ, he must obtain by prayer: <I>Ask of me and 
 I will give thee, &c.</I> Thus he would put an honour upon prayer, 
 would tie us to it, and encourage us in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. When he prayed, <I>the heaven was opened.</I> He that by his power 
 parted the waters, to make a way through them to Canaan, now by his 
 power parted the air, another fluid element, to open a correspondence 
 with the heavenly Canaan. Thus was there opened to Christ, and by him 
 to us, <I>a new and living way into the holiest;</I> sin had shut up 
 heaven, but Christ's prayer opened it again. Prayer is an ordinance 
 that <I>opens heaven: Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. <I>The Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon 
 him;</I> our Lord Jesus was now to receive greater measures of the 
 Spirit than before, to qualify him for his prophetical office, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1">Isa. lxi. 1</A>.

 When he begins to preach, <I>the Spirit of the Lord is upon him.</I>
 Now this is here expressed by a sensible evidence for his encouragement 
 in his work, and for the satisfaction of John the Baptist; for he was 
 told before that by this sign it should be notified to him which was 
 the Christ. Dr. Lightfoot suggests that the Holy Ghost descended in a
 bodily shape, that he might be revealed to be a personal substance, and 
 not merely an operation of the Godhead: and thus (saith he) was made a 
 full, clear, and sensible demonstration of the Trinity, at the 
 beginning of the gospel; and very fitly is this done at Christ's 
 baptism, who was to make the ordinance of baptism a badge of the 
 profession of that faith in the doctrine of the Trinity, <I>Father, 
 Son, and Holy Ghost.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. There came <I>a voice from heaven,</I> from God the Father, from the 
 <I>excellent glory</I> (so it is expressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:17">2 Pet. i. 17</A>),

 <I>Thou art my beloved Son.</I> Here, and in Mark, it is expressed as 
 spoken <I>to</I> Christ; in Matthew as spoken <I>of</I> him: <I>This is 
 my beloved Son.</I> It comes all to one; it was intended to be a 
 notification to John, and as such was properly expressed by, <I>This is 
 my beloved Son;</I> and likewise an answer to his prayer, and so it is 
 most fitly expressed by. <I>Thou art.</I> It was foretold concerning
 the Messiah, <I>I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:14">2 Sam. vii. 14</A>.
 
 <I>I will make him my First-born,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:27">Ps. lxxxix. 27</A>.

 It was also foretold that he should be God's <I>elect, in whom his soul
 delighted</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa. xlii. 1</A>);

 and, accordingly, it is here declared, <I>Thou art my beloved Son, in 
 whom I am well pleased.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A long account of Christ's pedigree, which had been more briefly 
 related by St. Matthew. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His age: <I>He now began to be about thirty years of age.</I> So old 
 Joseph was when he stood before Pharaoh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:46">Gen. xli. 46</A>),

 David when he began to reign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:4">2 Sam. v. 4</A>),

 and at this age the priests were to enter upon the full execution of 
 their office, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:3">Num. iv. 3</A>.

 Dr. Lightfoot thinks that it is plain, by the manner of expression
 here, that he was just twenty-nine years old complete, and entering 
 upon his thirtieth year, in the month <I>Tisri;</I> that, after this, 
 he lived three years and a half, and died when he was thirty-two years 
 and a half old. <I>Three years and a half,</I> the time of Christ's 
 ministry, is a period of time very remarkable in scripture. <I>Three 
 years and six months</I> the heavens were shut up in Elijah's time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:25,Jam+5:17">Luke iv. 25; Jam. v. 17</A>.

 This was the half week in which the Messiah was to confirm the
 covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:27">Dan. ix. 27</A>.

 This period is expressed in the prophetical writings by a time, times, 
 and half a time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:7,Re+12:14">Dan. xii. 7; Rev. xii. 14</A>);

 and by forty-two months, and a thousand two hundred and threescore
 days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:2,3">Rev. xi. 2, 3</A>.

 It is the time fixed for the witnesses' prophesying in sackcloth, in 
 conformity to Christ's preaching in his humiliation just so long.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His pedigree, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>,

 &c. Matthew had given us somewhat of this. He goes no higher than
 Abraham, but Luke brings it as high as Adam. Matthew designed to show
 that Christ was the son of Abraham, in whom <I>all the families of the 
 earth are blessed,</I> and that he was heir to the throne of David; and 
 therefore he begins with Abraham, and brings the genealogy down to 
 Jacob, who was the father of Joseph, and heir-male of the house of 
 David: but Luke, designing to show that Christ was the <I>seed of the 
 woman,</I> that should break the serpent's head, traces his pedigree 
 upward as high as Adam, and begins it with Ei, or Heli, who was the 
 father, not of Joseph, but of the virgin Mary. And some suggest that 
 the supply which our translators all along insert here is not right, 
 and that it should not be read <I>which,</I> that is, which 
 <I>Joseph</I> was the son of Heli, but which <I>Jesus;</I> he was 
 <I>the son of Joseph, of Eli, of Matthat,</I> &c., and he, that is, 
 Jesus, was the son <I>of Seth, of Adam, of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 The difference between the two evangelists in the genealogy of Christ 
 has been a stumbling-block to infidels that cavil at the word, but such 
 a one as has been removed by the labours of learned men, both in the 
 early ages of the church and in latter times, to which we refer 
 ourselves. Matthew draws the pedigree from Solomon, whose natural line 
 ending in Jechonias, the legal right was transferred to Salathiel, who 
 was of the house of Nathan, another son of David, which line Luke here 
 pursues, and so leaves out all the kings of Judah. It is well for us
 that our salvation doth not depend upon our being able to solve all 
 these difficulties, nor is the divine authority of the gospels at all 
 weakened by them; for the evangelists are not supposed to write these 
 genealogies either of their own knowledge or by divine inspiration, but 
 to have copied them out of the authentic records of the genealogies 
 among the Jews, the heralds' books, which therefore they were obliged 
 to follow; and in them they found the pedigree of Jacob, the father of 
 Joseph, to be as it is set down in Matthew; and the pedigree of Heli, 
 the father of Mary, to be as it is set down here in Luke. And this is 
 the meaning of <B><I>hos enomizeto</I></B>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 not, <I>as it was supposed,</I> referring only to Joseph, but <I>uti 
 sancitum est lege--as it is entered into the books,</I> as we find it 
 upon record; by which is appeared that Jesus was both by father and 
 mother's side the Son of David, witness this extract out of their own 
 records, which any one might at that time have liberty to compare with 
 the original, and further the evangelists needed not to go; nay, had 
 they varied from that, they had not gained their point. Its not being 
 contradicted at that time is satisfaction enough to us now that it is a 
 true copy, as it is further worthy of observation, that, when those 
 records of the Jewish genealogies had continued thirty or forty years 
 after these extracts out of them, long enough to justify the 
 evangelists therein, they were all lost and destroyed with the Jewish 
 state and nation; for now there was no more occasion for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One difficulty occurs between Abraham and Noah, which gives us some 
 perplexity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:35,36"><I>v.</I> 35, 36</A>.

 Sala is said to be the <I>son of Cainan,</I> and he <I>the son of 
 Arphaxad,</I> whereas Sala was the son of Arphaxad

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:24,11:12">Gen. x. 24; xi. 12</A>),

 and there is no such man as Cainan found there. But, as to that, it is
 sufficient to say that the Seventy Interpreters, who, before our 
 Saviour's time, translated the Old Testament into Greek, for reasons 
 best known to themselves inserted that Cainan; and St. Luke, writing 
 among the <I>Hellenist Jews,</I> was obliged to make use of that 
 translation, and therefore to take it as he found it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The genealogy concludes with this, <I>who was the son of Adam, the son 
 of God.</I> 

 (1.) Some refer it to Adam; he was in a peculiar manner the <I>son of 
 God,</I> being, more immediately than any of his offspring, the 
 offspring of God by creation. 

 (2.) Others refer it to Christ, and so make the last words of this
 genealogy to denote his divine and human nature. He was both the <I>Son 
 of Adam</I> and the <I>Son of God</I> that he might be a proper 
 Mediator between God and the sons of Adam, and might bring the sons of 
 Adam to be, through him, the <I>sons of God.</I></P>
