 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> one half of our undertaking upon the New 
 Testament<SUP><A HREF="#{1}">1</A></SUP> is now, by the assistance of 
 divine grace, finished, and presented to the reader, who, it is hoped, 
 the Lord working with it, may hereby be somewhat helped in 
 understanding and improving the sacred history of Christ and his 
 apostles, and in making it, as it certainly is, the best exposition of 
 our creed, in which these inspired writers are summed up, as is 
 intimated by that evangelist who calls his gospel <I>A Declaration of 
 those things which are most surely believed among us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:1">Luke i. 1</A>.

 And, as there is no part of scripture in the belief of which it
 concerns more to be established, so there is none with which the 
 generality of Christians are more conversant, or which they speak of 
 more frequently.  It is therefore our duty, by constant pains in 
 meditation and prayer, to come to an intimate acquaintance with the 
 true intent and meaning of these narratives, what our concern is in 
 them, and what we are to build upon them and draw from them; that we 
 may not rest in such a knowledge of them as that which we had when in 
 our childhood we were taught to read English out of the translation and 
 Greek out of the originals of these books. We ought to know them as the 
 physician does his dispensatory, the lawyer his books of reports, and 
 the sailor his chart and compass; that is, to know how to make use of 
 them in that to which we apply ourselves as our business in this world, 
 which is to serve God here and enjoy him hereafter, and both in Christ 
 the Mediator.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The great designs of the Christian institutes (of which these books are 
 the fountains and foundations) were, to reduce the children of men to 
 the fear and love of God, as the commanding active principle of their 
 observance of him, and obedience to him,--to show them the way of their 
 reconciliation to him and acceptance with him, and to bring them under 
 obligations to Jesus Christ as Mediator, and thereby to engage them to 
 all instances of devotion towards God and justice and charity towards 
 all men, in conformity to the example of Christ, in obedience to his 
 law, and in pursuance of his great intentions. What therefore I have 
 endeavoured here has been with this view, to make these writings 
 serviceable to the faith, holiness, and comfort of good Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now that these writings, thus made use of to serve these great and 
 noble designs, may have their due influence upon us, it concerns us to 
 be well established in our belief of their divine origin. And here we 
 have to do with two sorts of people. Some embrace the Old Testament, 
 but set that up in opposition to the New, pleading that, if that be 
 right, this is wrong; and these are the Jews. Others, though they live 
 in a Christian nation, and by baptism wear the Christian name, yet, 
 under pretence of freedom of thought, despise Christianity, and 
 consequently reject the New Testament, and therefore the Old of course. 
 I confess it is strange that any now who receive the Old Testament 
 should reject the New, since, besides all the particular proofs of the 
 divine authority of the New Testament, there is such an admirable 
 harmony between it and the Old. It agrees with the Old in all the main 
 intentions of it, refers to it, builds upon it, shows the 
 accomplishment of its types and prophecies, and thereby is the 
 perfection and crown of it. Nay, if it be not true, the Old Testament 
 must be false, and all the glorious promises which shine so brightly in 
 it, and the performance of which was limited within certain periods of 
 time, must be a great delusion, which we are sure they are not, and 
 therefore must embrace the New Testament to support the reputation of 
 the Old.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those things in the Old Testament which the New Testament lays aside 
 are the peculiarity of the Jewish nation and the observances of the 
 ceremonial law, both which certainly were of divine appointment; and 
 yet the New Testament does not at all clash with the Old; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were always designed to be laid aside in the fulness of time. 
 No other is to be expected than that the morning-star should disappear 
 when the sun rises; and the latter parts of the Old Testament often 
 speak of the laying aside of those things, and of the calling in of the 
 Gentiles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They were very honourable laid aside, and rather exchanged for that 
 which was more noble and excellent, more divine and heavenly. The 
 Jewish church was swallowed up in the Christian, the mosaic ritual in 
 evangelical institutions. So that the New Testament is no more the 
 undoing of the Old than the sending of a youth to the university is the 
 undoing of his education in the grammar-school.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Providence soon determined this controversy (which is the only thing 
 that seemed a controversy between the Old Testament and the New) by the 
 destruction of Jerusalem, the desolations of the temple, the 
 dissolution of the temple-service, and the total dispersion of all the 
 remains of the Jewish nation, with a judicial defeat of all the 
 attempts to incorporate it again, now for above 1600 years; and this 
 according to the express predictions of Christ, a little before his 
 death. And, as Christ would not have the doctrine of his being the 
 Messiah much insisted on till the great conclusive proof of it was 
 given by his resurrection from the dead, so the repeal of the 
 ceremonial law, as to the Jews, was not much insisted on, but their 
 keeping up the observation of it was connived at, till the great 
 conclusive proof of its repeal was given by the destruction of 
 Jerusalem, which made the observation of it for ever impracticable. And 
 the manifest tokens of divine wrath which the Jews, considered as a 
 people, even notwithstanding the prosperity of particular persons among 
 them, continue under to this day, is a proof, not only of the truth of 
 Christ's predictions concerning them, but that they lie under a greater 
 guilt than that of idolatry (for which they lay under a desolation of 
 70 years), and this can be no other than crucifying Christ, and 
 rejecting his gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus evident it is that, in our expounding of the New Testament, we are 
 not undoing what we did in expounding the Old; so far from it that we 
 may appeal to the law and the prophets for the confirmation of the 
 great truth which the gospels are written to prove--That our Lord Jesus 
 is the Messiah promised to the fathers, who should come, and we are to 
 look for no other. For though his appearing did not answer the 
 expectation of the carnal Jews, who looked for a Messiah in external 
 pomp and power, yet it exactly answered all the types, prophecies, and 
 promises, of the Old Testament, which all had their accomplishment in 
 him; and even his ignominious sufferings, which are the greatest 
 stumbling-block to the Jews, were foretold concerning the Messiah; so 
 that if he had not submitted to them we had failed in our proof; so fat 
 it is from being weakened by them. Bishop Kidder's <I>Demonstration of 
 the Christian's Messiah</I> has abundantly made out this truth, and 
 answered the cavils (for such they are, rather than arguments) of the 
 Jews against it, above any in our language.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But we live in an age when Christianity and the New Testament are more 
 virulently and daringly attacked by some within their own bowels than 
 by those upon their borders. Never were Moses and his writings so 
 arraigned and ridiculed by any Jews, or Mahomet and his Alcoran by any 
 Mussulmans, as Christ and his gospel by men that are baptized and 
 called Christians; and this, not under colour of any other divine 
 revelation, but in contempt and defiance of all divine revelation; and 
 not by way of complaint that they meet with that which shocks their 
 faith, and which, through their own weakness, they cannot get over, and 
 therefore desire to be instructed in, and helped in the understanding 
 of, and the reconciling of them to the truth which they have received, 
 but by way of resolute opposition, as if they looked upon it as their 
 enemy, and were resolved by all means possible to be the ruin of it, 
 though they cannot say what evil it has done to the world or to them. 
 If the pretence of it has transported many in the church of Rome into 
 such corruptions of worship and cruelties of government as are indeed 
 the scandal of human nature, yet, instead of being thereby prejudiced 
 against pure Christianity, they should the rather appear more 
 vigorously in defence of it, when they see so excellent an institution 
 as this is in itself so basely abused and misrepresented. They pretend 
 to a liberty of thought in their opposition to Christianity, and would 
 be distinguished by the name of free-thinkers. I will not here go about 
 to produce the arguments which, to all that are not wilfully ignorant 
 and prejudiced against the truth, are sufficient to prove the divine 
 origin and authority of the doctrine of Christ. The learned find much 
 satisfaction in reading the apologies of the ancients for the Christian 
 religion, when it was struggling with the polytheism and idolatry of 
 the Gentiles. Justin Martyr and Tertullian, Lactantius and Minutius 
 Felix, wrote admirable in defence of Christianity, when it was further 
 sealed by the blood of the martyrs. But its patrons and advocates in 
 the present day have another sort of enemies to deal with. The 
 antiquity of the pagan theology, its universal prevalence, the edicts 
 of princes, and the traditions and usages of the country, are not now 
 objected to Christianity; but I know not what imaginary freedom of 
 thought, and an unheard-of privilege of human nature, are assumed, not 
 to be bound by any divine revelation whatsoever. Now it is easy to make 
 out,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That those who would be thought thus to maintain a liberty of 
 thinking as one of the privileges of human nature, and in defence of 
 which they will take up arms against God himself, do not themselves 
 think freely, nor give others leave to do so. In some of them a 
 resolute indulgence of themselves in those vicious courses which they 
 know the gospel if they admit it will make very uneasy to them, and a 
 secret enmity to a holy heavenly mind and life, forbid them all free 
 thought; for so strong a prejudice have their lusts and passions laid 
 them under against the laws of Christ that they find themselves under a 
 necessity of opposing the truths of Christ, upon which these laws are 
 founded. <I>Perit judicium, quando res transit in affectum--The 
 judgment is overcome, when the decision is referred to the 
 affections.</I> Right or wrong, Christ's bonds must be broken, and his 
 cords cast from them; and therefore, how evident soever the premises 
 be, the conclusion must be denied, if it tend to fasten these bands and 
 cords upon them; and where is the freedom of thought then? <I>While 
 they promise themselves liberty, they themselves are the servants of 
 corruption; for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought 
 into bondage.</I> In others of them, a reigning pride and affectation 
 of singularity, and a spirit of contradiction, those lusts of the mind, 
 which are as impetuous and imperious as any of the lusts of the flesh 
 and of the world, forbid a freedom of thinking, and enslave the soul in 
 all its enquiries after religion. Those can no more think freely who 
 resolve they will think by themselves than those can who resolve to 
 think with their neighbours. Nor will they give others liberty to think 
 freely; for it is not by reason and argument that they go about to 
 convince us, but by jest and banter, and exposing Christianity and its 
 serious professors to contempt. Now, considering how natural it is to 
 most men to be jealous for their reputation, this is as great an 
 imposition as can possibly be; and the unthinking are as much kept from 
 free-thinking by the fear of being ridiculed in the club of those who 
 set up for oracles in reason as by the fear of being cursed, 
 excommunicated, and anathematized, by the counsel of those who set up 
 for oracles in religion. And where is the free-thinking then?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That those who will allow themselves a true liberty of thinking, and 
 will think seriously, cannot but embrace all Christ's sayings, as 
 <I>faithful,</I> and well <I>worthy of all acceptation.</I> Let the 
 corrupt bias of the carnal heart towards the world, and the flesh, and 
 self (the most presumptuous idol of the three) be taken away, and let 
 the doctrine of Christ be proposed first in its true colours, as Christ 
 and his apostles have given it to us, and in its true light, with all 
 its proper evidence, intrinsic and extrinsic; and then let the capable 
 soul freely use its rational powers and faculties, and by the operation 
 of the Spirit of grace, who alone works faith in all that believe, even 
 the high thought, when once it becomes a free thought, freed from the 
 bondage of sin and corruption, will, by a pleasing and happy power, be 
 captivated, and brought into obedience to Christ; and, when he thus 
 makes it free, it will be <I>free indeed.</I> Let any one who will give 
 himself leave to think impartially, and be at the pains to think 
 closely, read Mr. Baxter's <I>Reasons for the Christian Religion,</I> 
 and he will find both that it goes to the bottom, and lays the 
 foundation deep and firm, and also that it brings forth the top-stone 
 in a believer's consent to God in Christ, to the satisfaction of any 
 that are truly concerned about their souls and another world. The 
 proofs of the truths of the gospel have been excellently well 
 methodized, and enforced likewise, by bishop Stillingfleet, in his 
 <I>Origines Sacr&aelig;;</I> by Grotius, in his book of the <I>Truth of 
 the Christian Religion;</I> by Dr. Whitby, in his General Preface to 
 his <I>Commentary on the New Testament;</I> and of late by Mr. Ditton, 
 very argumentatively, in his discourse concerning <I>the Resurrection 
 of Jesus Christ;</I> and many others have herein done worthily. And I 
 will not believe any man who rejects the New Testament and the 
 Christian religion to have thought freely upon the subject, unless he 
 has, with humility, seriousness, and prayer to God for direction, 
 deliberately read these or the like books, which, it is certain, were 
 written both with liberty and clearness of thought.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 For my own part, if my thoughts were worth any one's notice, I do 
 declare I have thought of this great concern with all the liberty that 
 a reasonable soul can pretend to, or desire; and the result is that the 
 more I think, and the more freely I think, the more fully I am 
 satisfied that the Christian religion is the true religion, and that 
 which, if I submit my soul sincerely to it, I may venture my soul 
 confidently upon. For when I think freely,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. I cannot but think that the God who made man a reasonable creature 
 by his power has a right to rule him by his law, and to oblige him to 
 keep his inferior faculties of appetite and passion, together with the 
 capacities of thought and speech, in due subjection to the superior 
 powers of reason and conscience. And, when I look into my own heart, I 
 cannot but think that it was this which my Maker designed in the order 
 and frame of my soul, and that herein he intended to support his own 
 dominion in me.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. I cannot but think that my happiness is bound up in the favour of 
 God, and that his favour will, or will not, be towards me, according as 
 I do, or do not, comply with the laws and ends of my creation,--that I 
 am accountable to this God, and that from him my judgment proceeds, not 
 only for this world, but for my everlasting state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. I cannot but think that my nature is very unlike what the nature of 
 man was as it came out of the Creator's hands,--that it is degenerated 
 from its primitive purity and rectitude. I find in myself a natural 
 aversion to my duty, and to spiritual and divine exercises, and a 
 propensity to that which is evil, such an inclination towards the world 
 and the flesh as amounts to a propensity to backslide from the living 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. I cannot but think that I am therefore, by nature, thrown out of the 
 favour of God; for though I think he is a gracious and merciful God, 
 yet I think he is also a just and holy God, and that I am become, by 
 sin, both odious to his holiness and obnoxious to his justice. I should 
 not think freely, but very partially, if I should think otherwise. I 
 think I am guilty before God, have sinned, and come short of glorifying 
 him, and of being glorified with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. I cannot but think that, without some special discovery of God's 
 will concerning me, and good-will to me, I cannot possibly recover his 
 favour, be reconciled to him, or be so far restored to my primitive 
 rectitude as to be capable of serving my Creator, and answering the 
 ends of my creation, and becoming fit for another world; for the 
 bounties of Providence to me, in common with the inferior creatures, 
 cannot serve either as assurances that God is reconciled tome or means 
 to reconcile me to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. I cannot but think that the way of salvation, both from the guilt 
 and from the power of sin, by Jesus Christ, and his mediation between 
 God and man, as it is revealed by the New Testament, is admirable will 
 fitted to all the exigencies of my case, to restore me both to the 
 favour of God and to the government and enjoyment of myself. Here I see 
 a proper method for the removing of the guilt of sin (that I may not 
 die by the sentence of the law) by the all-sufficient merit and 
 righteousness of the Son of God in our nature, and for the breaking of 
 the power of sin (that I may not die by my own disease) by the 
 all-sufficient influence and operation of the Spirit of God upon our 
 nature. Every malady has herein its remedy, every grievance is hereby 
 redressed, and in such a way as advances the honour of all the divine 
 attributes and is suited and accommodated to human nature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. I cannot but think that what I find in myself of natural religion 
 does evidently bear testimony to the Christian religion; for all that 
 truth which is discovered to me by the light of nature is confirmed, 
 and more clearly discovered, by the gospel; the very same thing which 
 the light of nature gives me a confused sight of (like the sight of men 
 as trees walking) the New Testament gives me a clear and distinct sight 
 of. All that good which is pressed upon me by the law of nature is more 
 fully discovered to me, and I find myself much more strongly bound to 
 it by the gospel of Christ, the engagements it lays upon me to my duty, 
 and the encouragements and assistances it gives me in my duty. And this 
 is further confirming to me that there, just there, where natural light 
 leaves me at a loss, and unsatisfied--tells me that hitherto it can 
 carry me, but no further--the gospel takes me up, helps me out, and 
 gives me all the satisfaction I can desire, and that is especially in 
 the great business of the satisfying of God's justice for the sin of 
 man. My own conscience asks, <I>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, 
 and bow myself before the most high God? Will he be pleased with 
 thousands of rams?</I> But I am still at a loss; I cannot frame a 
 righteousness from any thing I am, or have, in myself, or from any 
 thing I can do for God or present to God, wherein I dare appear before 
 him; but the gospel comes, and tells me that Jesus Christ had <I>made 
 his soul an offering for sin,</I> and God has declared himself 
 well-pleased with all believers in him; and this makes me easy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. I cannot but think that the proofs by which God has attested the 
 truth of the gospel are the most proper that could be given in a case 
 of this nature--that the power and authority of the Redeemer in the 
 kingdom of grace should be exemplified to the world, not by the highest 
 degree of the pomp and authority of the kings of the earth, as the Jews 
 expected, but by the evidences of his dominion in the kingdom of 
 nature, which is a much greater dignity and authority than any of the 
 kings of the earth ever pretended to, and is no less than divine. And 
 his miracles being generally wrought upon men, not only upon their 
 bodies, as they were mostly when Christ was here upon earth, but, which 
 is more, upon their minds, as they were mostly after the pouring out of 
 the Spirit in the gift of tongues and other supernatural endowments, 
 were the most proper confirmations possible of the truth of the gospel, 
 which was designed for the making of men holy and happy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 9. I cannot but think that the methods taken for the propagation of 
 this gospel, and the wonderful success of those methods, which are 
 purely spiritual and heavenly, and destitute of all secular advantages 
 and supports, plainly show that it was of God, for God was with it; and 
 it could never have spread as it did, in the face of so much 
 opposition, if it had not been accompanied with a power from on high. 
 And the preservation of Christianity in the world to this day, 
 notwithstanding the difficulties it has struggles with, is to me a 
 standing miracle for the proof of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 10. I cannot but think that the gospel of Christ has had some influence 
 upon my soul, has had such a command over me, and been such a comfort 
 to me, as is a demonstration to myself, though it cannot be so to 
 another, that it is of God. I have tasted in it <I>that the Lord is 
 gracious;</I> and the most subtle disputant cannot convince one who has 
 tasted honey that it is not sweet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And now I appeal to him who knows the thoughts and intents of the heart 
 that in all this I think freely (if it be possible for a man to know 
 that he does so), and not under the power of any bias. Whether we have 
 reason to think that those who, without any colour of reason, not only 
 usurp, but monopolize, the character of free-thinkers, do so, let those 
 judge who easily observe that they do not speak sincerely, but 
 industriously dissemble their notions; and one instance I cannot but 
 notice of their unfair dealing with their readers--that when, for the 
 diminishing of the authority of the New Testament, they urge the 
 various readings of the original, and quote an acknowledgment of Mr. 
 Gregory of Christ-church, in his preface to his Works, <I>That no 
 profane author whatsoever, &c.,</I> and yet suppress what immediately 
 follows, as the sense of that learned man upon it, <I>That this is an 
 invincible reason for the scriptures' part, &c.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But while we are thus maintaining the divine origin and authority of 
 the New Testament, as it has been received through all the ages of the 
 church, we find our cause not only attacked by the enemies we speak of, 
 but in effect betrayed by one who makes our New Testament almost double 
 to what it really is,<SUP><A HREF="#{2}">2</A></SUP>
 adding to the <I>Constitutions of the
 Apostles,</I> collected by <I>Clement,</I> together with the 
 <I>Apostolical Canons,</I> and making those to be of equal authority 
 with the writings of the evangelists, and preferable to the Epistles. 
 By enlarging the lines of defence thus, without either cause or 
 precedent, he gives great advantage to the invaders. Those 
 <I>Constitutions of the Apostles</I> have many things in them very 
 good, and may be of use, as other human compositions; but to pretend 
 that they wee composed, as they profess to be, by the twelve apostles 
 in concert at Jerusalem, <I>I Peter saying this, I Andrew saying that, 
 &c.,</I> is the greatest imposition that can be practised upon the
 credulity of the simple.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is certain there were a great many spurious writings which, in 
 the early days of the church, went under the names of the apostles and 
 apostolical men; so that it has always been complained of as impossible 
 to find out any thing but the canon of scripture that could with any 
 assurance be attributed to them. Baronius himself acknowledges it, 
 <I>Cum apostolorum nomine tam facta quam dicta reperiantur esse 
 supposititia; nec sic quid de illis &agrave; veris sincerisque 
 spriptoribus narratum sit integrum et incorruptum remanserit, in
 desperationem plan&egrave; quandam animum dejicunt posse unquam assequi 
 quod verum certumque subsistat--Since so many of the acts and sayings 
 ascribed to the apostles are found to be spurious, and even the 
 narrations of faithful writers respecting them are not free from 
 corruption, we must despair of ever being able to arrive at any 
 absolute certainty about them.</I>--Ad An. Christ. 44, sect. 42, &c. 
 There were Acts under the names of Andrew the apostle, Philip, Peter, 
 Thomas; a Gospel under the names of Thaddeus, another of Barnabas, 
 another of Bartholomew; a book concerning the infancy of our Saviour, 
 another concerning his nativity, and many the like, which we all 
 rejected as forgeries.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. These <I>Constitutions</I> and <I>Canons,</I> among the rest, were 
 condemned in the primitive church as apocryphal, and therefore justly 
 rejected; because, though otherwise good, they pretended to be what 
 really they were not, dictated by the twelve apostles themselves, as 
 received from Christ. If Jesus Christ gave them such instructions, and 
 they gave them in such a solemn manner to the church, as is pretended, 
 it is unaccountable that there is not the least notice taken of any 
 such thing done or designed in the <I>Gospels,</I> the <I>Acts,</I> or 
 any of the <I>Epistles.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those who have judged the most favourable of these <I>Canons</I> and 
 <I>Constitutions</I> have concluded that they were complied by some 
 officious persons under the name of <I>Clement,</I> towards the end of 
 the second century, above 150 years after Christ's ascension, out of 
 the common practice of the churches; that is, that which the compilers 
 were most acquainted with, or had respect for; when at the same time we 
 have reason to think that the far greater number of Christian churches 
 which by that time were planted had Constitutions of their own, which, 
 if they had had the happiness to be transmitted to posterity, would 
 have recommended themselves as well as these, or better. But, as the 
 legislators of old put a reputation upon their laws by pretending to 
 have received them from some deity or other, so church-governors 
 studied to gain reputation to their sees by placing some apostolical 
 man or other at the head of their catalogue of bishops (<I>see bishop 
 Stillingfleet's Irenicum, p.</I> 302), and reputation to their Canons 
 and Constitutions by fathering them upon the apostles. But how can it 
 be imagined that the apostles should be all together at Jerusalem, to 
 compose this book of <I>Canons</I> with so much solemnity, when we know 
 that their commission was to go into all the world, and to preach the 
 gospel to every creature? Accordingly, Eusebius tells us that Thomas 
 went into Parthia, Andrew into Scythia, John into the lesser Asia; and 
 we have reason to think that after their dispersion they never came 
 together again, any more than the planters of the nations did after the 
 Most High had separated the sons of Adam.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I think that any one who will compare these <I>Constitutions</I> with 
 the writings which we are sure were given by inspiration of God will 
 easily discern a vast difference in the style and spirit. <I>What is 
 the chaff to the wheat?</I> "Where are ministers, in the style of the 
 true apostles, called priests, high priests? Where do we find in the 
 apostolical age, that age of suffering, of the placing of the bishop in 
 his <I>throne?</I> Or of readers, singers, and porters, in the
 church?"<SUP><A HREF="#{3}">3</A></SUP></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I fear the collector and compiler of those <I>Constitutions,</I> under 
 the name of <I>Clement,</I> was conscious to himself of his honesty in 
 it, in that he would not have them published before all, because of the 
 mysteries contained in them; nor were they known or published till the 
 middle of the fourth century, when the forgery could not be so well 
 disproved. I cannot see any mysteries in them, that they should be 
 concealed, if they had been genuine; but I am sure that Christ bids his 
 apostles publish the mysteries of the kingdom of God upon the 
 house-tops. And St. Paul, though there are mysteries in his epistles 
 much more sublime than any of these <I>Constitutions,</I> charges that 
 they should be read to all the holy brethren. Nay, these 
 <I>Constitutions</I> are so wholly in a manner taken up either with 
 moral precepts, or rules of practice in the church, that if they had 
 been what they pretend they had been most fit to be published before 
 all. And though the <I>Apocalypse</I> is so full of mysteries, yet a 
 blessing is pronounced upon the readers and hearers of that prophecy. 
 We must therefore conclude that, whenever they were written, by 
 declining the light they owned themselves to be apocryphal, that is, 
 hidden or concealed; that they durst not mingle themselves with what 
 was given by divine inspiration; to allude to what is said of the 
 ministers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:13">Acts v. 13</A>),

 <I>Of the rest durst no man join himself to</I> the apostles, <I>for 
 the people magnified them.</I> So that even by their own confession 
 they were not delivered to the churches with the other writings, when 
 the New-Testament canon was solemnly sealed up with that dreadful 
 sentence passed on those that <I>add unto these things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And as we have thus had attempts made of late upon the purity and 
 sufficiency of our New Testament, by additions to it, so we have 
 likewise had from another quarter a great contempt put upon it by the 
 papal power. The occasion was this:--One Father Quesnel, a French 
 papist, but a Jansenist, nearly thirty years ago, published <I>the New 
 Testament</I> in French, in several small volumes, <I>with Moral 
 Reflections</I> on every verse, to render the reading of it more 
 profitable, and meditation upon it more easy. It was much esteemed in 
 France, for the sake of the piety and devotion which appeared in it, 
 and it had several impressions. The Jesuits were much disgusted, and 
 solicited the pope for the condemnation of it, though the author of it 
 was a papist, and many things in it countenanced popish superstition. 
 After much struggling about it in the court of Rome a bull was at 
 length obtained, at the request of the French king, from the present 
 pope Clement 11 bearing date September 8, 1713, by which the said book, 
 with what title or in what language soever it is printed, is prohibited 
 and condemned; both the New Testament itself, because in many things 
 varying from the vulgar Latin, and the Annotations, as containing 
 divers propositions (above a hundred are enumerated) scandalous and 
 pernicious, injurious to the church and its customs, impious, 
 blasphemous, savouring of heresy. And the propositions are such as 
 these--"That the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is the effectual 
 principle of all manner of good, is necessary for every good action; 
 for without it nothing is done, nay nothing can be done"--"That it is a 
 sovereign grace, and is an operation of the almighty hand of 
 God"--"That, when God accompanies his word with the internal power of 
 his grace, it operates in the soul the obedience which it 
 demands"--"That faith is the first grace, and the fountain of all 
 others"--"That it is in vain for us to call God our Father, if we do 
 not cry to him with a spirit of love"--"That there is no God, nor 
 religion, where there is no charity"--"That the catholic church 
 comprehends the angels and all the elect and just men of the earth of 
 all ages"--"That it had the Word incarnate for its head, and all the 
 saints for its members"--"That it is profitable and necessary at all 
 times, in all places, and for all sorts of persons, to know the holy 
 Scriptures"--"That the holy obscurity of the word of God is no reason 
 for the laity not reading it"--"That the Lord's day ought to be 
 sanctified by reading books of piety, especially the holy 
 scriptures"--And "that to forbid Christians from reading the scriptures 
 is to prohibit the use of the light to the children of light." Many 
 such positions as these, which the spirit of every good Christian 
 cannot but relish as true and good, are condemned by the pope's bull as 
 impious and blasphemous. And this bull, though strenuously opposed by a 
 great number of the bishops in France, who were well affected to the 
 notions of father Quesnel, was yet received and confirmed by the French 
 king's letters patent, bearing date at Versailles, February 14, 1714, 
 which forbid all manner of persons, upon pain of exemplary punishment, 
 so much as to keep any of those books in their houses; and adjudge any 
 that should hereafter write in defence of the propositions condemned by 
 the pope as disturbers of the peace. It was registered the day 
 following, February 15, by the Parliament of Paris, but with divers 
 provisos and limitations.</P>

 By this is appears that popery is still the same thing that ever it 
 was, an enemy to the knowledge of the scriptures, and to the honour of 
 divine grace. What reason have we to bless God that we have liberty to 
 read the scriptures, and have helps to understand and improve them, 
 which we are concerned diligently to make a good use of, that we may 
 not provoke God to give us up into the hands of those powers that would 
 use us in like manner!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I am willing to hope that those to whom the reading of the 
 <I>Exposition of the Old Testament</I> was pleasant will find this yet 
 more pleasant; for this is that part of scripture which does most 
 plainly testify of Christ, and in which that <I>gospel grace which 
 appears unto all men, bringing salvation,</I> shines most clearly. This 
 is the New-Testament milk for babes, the rest is strong meat for strong 
 men. By these, therefore, let us be nourished and strengthened that we 
 my be pressing on towards perfection; and that, having laid the 
 foundation in the history of our blessed Saviour's life, death, and 
 resurrection, and the first preaching of his gospel, we may build upon 
 it by an acquaintance with the mysteries of godliness, to which we 
 shall be further introduced in the Epistles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I desire I may be read with a candid, and not a critical, eye. I 
 pretend not to gratify the curious; the summit of my ambition is to 
 assist those who are truly serious in searching the scriptures daily. I 
 am sure the work is designed, and hope it is calculated, to promote 
 piety towards God and charity towards our brethren, and that there is 
 not only something in it which may edify, but nothing which may justly 
 offend any good Christian.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If any receive spiritual benefit by my poor endeavours, it will be 
 comfort to me, but let God have all the glory, and that free grace of 
 his which has employed one that is utterly unworthy of such an honour,
 and enabled one thus far to go on in it who is utterly insufficient for 
 such a service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having obtained help of God, I continue hitherto in it, and humbly 
 depend upon the same good hand of my God to carry me on it that which
 remains, to gird my loins with needful strength and to make my way
 perfect; and for this I humbly desire the prayers of my friends. One
 volume more, I hope, will include what is yet to be done; and I will
 both go about it, and go on with it, as God shall enable me, with all
 convenient speed; but it is that part of the scripture which, of all
 others, requires the most care and pains in expounding it. But I trust
 that <I>as the day so shall the strength be.</I></P>

 It may be proper to apprise the reader that the volume to which this
 preface was originally prefixed included the Acts of the Apostles,
 which in the present edition will commence the second volume, in order
 to secure a more equal division of the New Testament--the commentary on
 the remaining books being less extended than the author
 contemplated.--E<FONT SIZE=-2>D</FONT>.
