 Hitherto this evangelist has recorded little of the history of Christ, 
 only so far as was requisite to introduce his discourses; but now that 
 the time drew nigh that Jesus must die he is very particular in 
 relating the circumstances of his sufferings, and some which the others 
 had omitted, especially his sayings. So far were his followers from 
 being ashamed of his cross, or endeavouring to conceal it, that this 
 was what, both by word and writing, they were most industrious to 
 proclaim, and gloried in it. This chapter relates, 

 I. How Christ was arrested in the garden and surrendered himself a
 prisoner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:1-12">ver. 1-12</A>.

 II. How he was abused in the high priest's court, and how Peter, in the
 meantime, denied him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:13-27">ver. 13-27</A>.

 III. How he was prosecuted before Pilate, and examined by him, and put
 in election with Barabbas for the favour of the people, and lost it,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his
 disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the
 which he entered, and his disciples.
 &nbsp; 2  And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus
 ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.
 &nbsp; 3  Judas then, having received a band <I>of men</I> and officers from
 the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and
 torches and weapons.
 &nbsp; 4  Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon
 him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?
 &nbsp; 5  They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them,
 I am <I>he.</I> And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.
 &nbsp; 6  As soon then as he had said unto them, I am <I>he,</I> they went
 backward, and fell to the ground.
 &nbsp; 7  Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus
 of Nazareth.
 &nbsp; 8  Jesus answered, I have told you that I am <I>he:</I> if therefore
 ye seek me, let these go their way:
 &nbsp; 9  That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them
 which thou gavest me have I lost none.
 &nbsp; 10  Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high
 priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name
 was Malchus.
 &nbsp; 11  Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the
 sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink
 it?
 &nbsp; 12  Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took
 Jesus, and bound him,
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The hour was now come that <I>the captain of our salvation,</I> who was 
 to be <I>made perfect by sufferings,</I> should engage the enemy. We 
 have here his entrance upon the encounter. The day of recompence is in 
 his heart, and <I>the year of his redeemed is come, and his own arm 
 works the salvation,</I> for he has no second. <I>Let us turn aside 
 now, and see this great sight.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Our Lord Jesus, like a bold champion, takes the field first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 <I>When he had spoken these words,</I> preached the sermon, prayed his 
 prayer, and so finished his testimony, he would lose no time, but 
 <I>went forth</I> immediately out of the house, out of the city, by 
 moon-light, for the passover was observed at the full moon, <I>with his 
 disciples</I> (the eleven, for Judas was otherwise employed), and <I>he 
 went over the brook Cedron,</I> which runs between Jerusalem and the 
 mount of Olives, <I>where was a garden,</I> not his own, but some 
 friend's, who allowed him the liberty of it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That our Lord Jesus entered upon his sufferings <I>when he had 
 spoken these words,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:1">Matt. xxvi. 1</A>,

 <I>When he had finished all these sayings.</I> Here it is intimated,

 (1.) That our Lord Jesus took his work before him. The office of the
 priest was to teach, and pray, and offer sacrifice. Christ, after 
 teaching and praying, applies himself to make atonement. Christ had 
 said all he had to say as a prophet, and now he addresses himself to 
 the discharge of his office as a priest, to <I>make his soul an 
 offering for sin;</I> and, when he had gone through this, he entered 
 upon his kingly office. 

 (2.) That having by his sermon prepared his disciples for this hour of 
 trial, and by his prayer prepared himself for it, he then courageously 
 went out to meet it. When he had put on his armour, he entered the 
 lists, and not till then. Let those that suffer according to the will 
 of God, in a good cause, with a good conscience, and having a clear 
 call to it, comfort themselves with this, that Christ will not engage 
 those that are his in any conflict, but he will first do that for them 
 which is necessary to prepare them for it; and if we receive Christ's 
 instructions and comforts, and be interested in his intercession, we 
 may, with an unshaken resolution, venture through the greatest 
 hardships in the way of duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That <I>he went forth with his disciples.</I> Judas knew what house 
 he was in in the city, and he could have staid and met his sufferings 
 there; but, 

 (1.) He would do as he was wont to do, and not alter his method, either 
 to meet the cross or to miss it, when his hour was come. It was his
 custom when he was at Jerusalem, after he had spent the day in public 
 work, to retire at night <I>to the mount of Olives;</I> there his 
 quarters were, in the skirts of the city, for they would not make room 
 for him in the palaces, in the heart of the town. This being his 
 custom, he could not be put out of his method by the foresight of his 
 sufferings, but, as Daniel, did then just <I>as he did aforetime,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:10">Dan. vi. 10</A>.

 (2.) He was as unwilling that there should be <I>an uproar among the
 people</I> as his enemies were, for it was not his way <I>to strive or
 cry.</I> If he had been seized in the city, and a tumult raised
 thereby, mischief might have been done, and a great deal of blood shed,
 and therefore he withdrew. Note, When we find ourselves involved in
 trouble, we should be afraid of involving others with us. It is no
 disgrace to the followers of Christ to fall tamely. Those who aim at
 honour from men value themselves upon a resolution to sell their lives
 as dearly as they can; but those who know that their blood is precious
 to Christ, and that not a drop of it shall be shed but upon a valuable
 consideration, need not stand upon such terms. 

 (3.) He would set us an example in the beginning of his passion, as he 
 did at the end of it, of retirement from the world. <I>Let us go forth 
 to him, without the camp, bearing his reproach,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:13">Heb. xiii. 13</A>.

 We must lay aside, and leave behind, the crowds, and cares, and 
 comforts, of cities, even holy cities, if we would cheerfully take up 
 our cross, and keep up our communion with God therein.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he went <I>over the brook Cedron.</I> He must go over this to 
 go to <I>the mount of Olives,</I> but the notice taken of it intimates 
 that there was something in it significant; and it points, 

 (1.) At David's prophecy concerning the Messiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:7">Ps. cx. 7</A>),

 that <I>he shall drink of the brook in the way;</I> the brook of 
 suffering in the way to his glory and our salvation, signified by 
 <I>the brook Cedron, the black brook,</I> so called either from the 
 darkness of the valley it ran through or the colour of the water, 
 tainted with the dirt of the city; such a brook Christ drank of, when 
 it lay in the way of our redemption, and <I>therefore shall he lift up 
 the head,</I> his own and ours. 

 (2.) At David's pattern, as a type of the Messiah. In his flight from 
 Absalom, particular notice is taken of his <I>passing over the brook 
 Cedron, and going up by the ascent of mount Olivet, weeping,</I> and 
 all that were with him in tears too,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:23,30">2 Sam. xv. 23, 30</A>.

 <I>The Son of David,</I> being driven out by the rebellious Jews, who
 would <I>not have him to reign over them</I> (and Judas, like
 Ahithophel, being in the plot against him), passed over the brook in
 meanness and humiliation, attended by a company of true mourners. The
 godly kings of Judah had burnt and destroyed the idols they found at
 <I>the brook Cedron;</I> Asa, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:16">2 Chron. xv. 16</A>;
 
 Hezekiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:14">2 Chron. xxx. 14</A>;
 
 Josiah,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:4,6">2 Kings xxiii. 4, 6</A>.

 Into that brook the abominable things were cast. Christ, <I>being now 
 made sin for us,</I> that he might abolish it and take it away, began 
 his passion by the same brook. Mount Olivet, where Christ began his 
 sufferings, lay on the east side of Jerusalem; mount Calvary, where he 
 finished them, on the west; for in them he had an eye to such as should 
 <I>come from the east and the west.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That he entered into a garden. This circumstance is taken notice of 
 only by this evangelist, that Christ's sufferings began in a garden. In 
 the garden of Eden sin began; there the curse was pronounced, there the 
 Redeemer was promised, and therefore in a garden that promised seed 
 entered the lists with the old serpent. Christ was buried also in a 
 garden. 

 (1.) Let us, when we walk in our gardens, take occasion thence to 
 meditate on Christ's sufferings in a garden, to which we owe all the 
 pleasure we have in our gardens, for by them the curse upon the ground 
 for man's sake was removed. 

 (2.) When we are in the midst of our possessions and enjoyments, we 
 must keep up an expectation of troubles, for our gardens of delight are 
 in a vale of tears.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That he had his disciples with him, 

 (1.) Because he used to take them with him when he retired for prayer. 
 
 (2.) They must be witnesses of his sufferings, and his patience under 
 them, that they might with the more assurance and affection preach them 
 to the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:48">Luke xxiv. 48</A>),

 and be themselves prepared to suffer. 

 (3.) He would take them into the danger to show them their weakness, 
 notwithstanding the promises they had made of fidelity. Christ 
 sometimes brings his people into difficulties, that he may magnify 
 himself in their deliverance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That Judas the traitor <I>knew the place,</I> knew it to be the 
 place of his usual retirement, and probably, by some word Christ had 
 dropped, knew that he intended to be there that night, for want of a 
 better closet. A solitary garden is a proper place for meditation and 
 prayer, and after a passover is a proper time to retire for private 
 devotion, that we may pray over the impressions made and the vows 
 renewed, and clench the nail. Mention is made of Judas's knowing the 
 place, 

 (1.) To aggravate the sin of Judas, that he would betray his Master, 
 notwithstanding the intimate acquaintance he had with him; nay, and 
 that he would make use of his familiarity with Christ, as giving him an 
 opportunity of betraying him; a generous mind would have scorned to do 
 so base a thing. Thus has Christ's holy religion been <I>wounded in the 
 house of its friends,</I> as it could not have been wounded any where 
 else. Many an apostate could not have been so profane, if he had not 
 been a professor; could not have ridiculed scriptures and ordinances, 
 if he had not known them. 

 (2.) To magnify the love of Christ, that, though he knew where the 
 traitor would seek him, thither he went to be found of him, now that he 
 knew his <I>hour was come.</I> Thus he showed himself willing to suffer 
 and die for us. What he did was not by constraint, but by consent; 
 though as man he said, <I>Let this cup pass away,</I> as Mediator he 
 said, "<I>Lo, I come,</I> I come with a good will." It was late in the 
 night (we may suppose eight or nine o'clock) when Christ went out to 
 the garden; for it was not only his <I>meat and drink,</I> but his rest 
 and sleep, <I>to do the will of him that sent him.</I> When others were 
 going to bed, he was going to prayer, going to suffer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>The captain of our salvation</I> having taken the field, the 
 enemy presently comes upon the spot, and attacks him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 Judas with his men comes thither, commissioned by the chief priests, 
 especially those among them that were Pharisees, who were the most 
 bitter enemies to Christ. This evangelist passes over Christ's agony, 
 because the other three had fully related it, and presently introduces 
 Judas and his company that came to seize him. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The persons employed in this action--<I>a band of men and officers 
 from the chief priests, with Judas.</I> 

 (1.) Here is a multitude engaged against Christ--<I>a band of men,</I> 
 <B><I>speira</I></B>--<I>cohors, a regiment,</I> a Roman band, which 
 some think was five hundred men, others a thousand. Christ's friends 
 were few, his enemies many. Let us therefore <I>not follow a multitude 
 to do evil,</I> nor fear a multitude designing evil to us, <I>if God be 
 for us.</I> 

 (2.) Here is a mixed multitude; the band of men were Gentiles, Roman 
 soldiers, a detachment out of the guards that were posted in the tower 
 of Antonia, to be a curb upon the city; the <I>officers of the chief 
 priests,</I> <B><I>hyperetas</I></B>. Either their domestic servants, 
 or the officers of their courts, were Jews; these had an enmity to each 
 other, but were united against Christ, who came to <I>reconcile both to 
 God in one body.</I> 

 (3.) It is a commissioned multitude, not a popular tumult; no, they 
 have received orders <I>from the chief priests,</I> upon whose 
 suggestion to the governor that this Jesus was a dangerous man, it is 
 likely they had a warrant from him too to take him up,<I> for they 
 feared the people.</I> See what enemies Christ and his gospel have had, 
 and are likely to have, numerous and potent, and therefore formidable: 
 ecclesiastical and civil powers combined against them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1,2">Ps. ii. 1, 2</A>.

 Christ said it would be so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:18">Matt. x. 18</A>),
 
 and found it so. 

 (4.) All under the direction of Judas. He <I>received</I> this <I>band
 of men;</I> it is probable that he requested it, alleging that it was 
 necessary to send a good force, being as ambitious of the honour of 
 commanding in chief in this expedition as he was covetous of <I>the 
 wages of</I> this <I>unrighteousness.</I> He thought himself 
 wonderfully preferred from coming in the rear of the contemptible 
 twelve to be placed at the head of these formidable hundreds; he never 
 made such a figure before, and promised himself, perhaps, that this 
 should not be the last time, but he should be rewarded with a captain's 
 commission, or better, if he succeeded well in this enterprise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The preparation they had made for an attack: They came <I>with 
 lanterns, and torches, and weapons.</I> 

 (1.) If Christ should abscond, though they had moonlight, they would 
 have occasion for their lights; but they might have spared these; the 
 second Adam was not driven, as the first was, to hide himself, either 
 for fear or shame, <I>among the trees of the garden.</I> It was folly 
 to light a candle to seek the Sun by. 

 (2.) If he should resist, they would have occasion for their arms.
 <I>The weapons of his warfare were spiritual,</I> and at these 
 <I>weapons</I> he had often beaten them, and <I>put them to 
 silence,</I> and therefore they have now recourse to other <I>weapons, 
 swords and staves.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Our Lord Jesus gloriously repulsed the first onset of the enemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>,
 
 where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he received them, with all the mildness imaginable towards them, 
 and all the calmness imaginable in himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He met them with a very soft and mild question 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Knowing all things that should come upon him,</I> and therefore not 
 at all surprised with this alarm, with a wonderful intrepidity and 
 presence of mind, undisturbed and undaunted, he <I>went forth</I> to 
 meet them, and, as if he had been unconcerned, softly asked, "<I>Whom 
 seek you?</I> What is the matter? What means this bustle at this time 
 of night?" See here, 

 [1.] Christ's foresight of his sufferings; He <I>knew all those things 
 that should come upon him,</I> for he had bound himself to suffer them. 
 Unless we had strength, as Christ had, to bear the discovery, we should 
 not covet to know what shall come upon us; it would but anticipate our 
 pain; <I>sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof:</I> yet it will 
 do us good to expect sufferings in general, so that when they come we 
 may say, "It is but what we looked for, the cost we sat down and 
 counted upon." 

 [2.] Christ's forwardness to his sufferings; he did not run away from 
 them, but went out to meet them, and reached forth his hand to take the 
 bitter cup. When the people would have forced him to a crown, and 
 offered to make him a king in Galilee, but he withdrew, and hid himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:15"><I>ch.</I> vi. 15</A>);

 but, when they came to force him to a cross, he offered himself; for he
 came to this world to suffer and went to the other world to reign. This 
 will not warrant us needlessly to expose ourselves to trouble, for we 
 know not when our hour is come; but we are called to suffering when we 
 have no way to avoid it but by sin; and, when it comes to this, let 
 <I>none of these things move</I> us, for they cannot hurt us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He met them with a very calm and mild answer when they told him 
 whom they were in quest of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They said, <I>Jesus of Nazareth;</I> and he said, <I>I am he.</I>

 [1.] It should seem, <I>their eyes were held, that they could not know 
 him.</I> It is highly probable that many of the Roman band, at least 
 the officers of the temple, had often seen him, if only to satisfy 
 their curiosity; Judas, however, to be sure, knew him well enough, and 
 yet none of them could pretend to say, <I>Thou art the man</I> we seek. 
 Thus he showed them the folly of bringing lights to see for him, for he 
 could make them not to know him when they saw him; and he has herein 
 shown us how easily he can infatuate the counsels of his enemies, and 
 make them lose themselves, when they are seeking mischief. 

 [2.] In their enquiries for him they called him <I>Jesus of 
 Nazareth,</I> which was the only title they knew him by, and probably 
 he was so called in their warrant. It was a name of reproach given him, 
 to darken the evidence of his being the Messiah. By this it appears
 that they knew him not, whence he was; for, if they had known him, 
 surely they would not have persecuted him. 

 [3.] He fairly answers them: <I>I am he.</I> He did not improve the 
 advantage he had against them by their blindness, as Elisha did against 
 the Syrians, telling them, <I>This is not the way, neither is this the 
 city;</I> but improves it as an opportunity of showing his willingness 
 to suffer. Though they called him Jesus of Nazareth, he answered to the 
 name, for he despised the reproach; he might have said, <I>I am not 
 he,</I> for he was <I>Jesus of Bethlehem;</I> but he would by no means 
 allow equivocations. He has hereby taught us to own him, whatever it 
 cost us; not to be <I>ashamed of him or his words;</I> but even in 
 difficult times <I>to confess Christ crucified, and manfully to fight 
 under his banner. I am he,</I> <B><I>Ego eimi</I></B>--<I>I am he,</I> 
 is the glorious name of the blessed God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:14">Exod. iii. 14</A>),

 and the honour of that name is justly challenged by the blessed Jesus. 
 
 [4.] Particular notice is taken, in a parenthesis, <I>that Judas stood 
 with them.</I> He that used to stand with those that followed Christ 
 now stood with those that fought against him. This describes an 
 apostate; he is one that changes sides. He herds himself with those 
 with whom his heart always was, and with whom he shall have his lot in 
 the judgment-day. This is mentioned, <I>First,</I> To show the
 impudence of Judas. One would wonder where he got the confidence with 
 which he now faced his Master, and <I>was not ashamed, neither could he 
 blush;</I> Satan in his heart gave him a whore's forehead. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> To show that Judas was particularly aimed at in the 
 power which went along with that word, <I>I am he,</I> to foil the 
 aggressors. It was an arrow levelled at the traitor's conscience, and 
 pierced him to the quick; for Christ's coming and his voice will be 
 more terrible to apostates and betrayers than to sinners of any other 
 class.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See how he terrified them, and obliged them to retire 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>They went backward, and,</I> like men thunder-struck, <I>fell to the 
 ground.</I> It should seem, they did not fall forward, as humbling 
 themselves before him, and yielding to him, but backward, as standing 
 it out to the utmost. Thus Christ was declared to be more than a man, 
 even when he was trampled upon as <I>a worm, and no man.</I> This word, 
 <I>I am he,</I> had revived his disciples, and raised them up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:27">Matt. xiv. 27</A>);

 but the same word strikes his enemies down. Hereby he showed 
 plainly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What he could have done with them. When he struck them down, he 
 could have struck them dead; when he spoke them <I>to the ground,</I> 
 he could have spoken them to hell, and have sent them, like Korah's 
 company, the next way thither; but he would not do so, 

 [1.] Because the hour of his suffering was come, and he would not put 
 it by; he would only show that his life was not forced from him, but 
 <I>he laid it down of himself,</I> as he had said. 

 [2.] Because he would give an instance of his patience and forbearance 
 with the worst of men, and his compassionate love to his very enemies. 
 In striking them down, and no more, he gave them both a call to repent 
 and space to repent; but <I>their hearts were hardened,</I> and all was 
 in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What he will do at last with all his implacable enemies, <I>that 
 will not repent to give him glory; they shall flee, they shall fall, 
 before him.</I> Now the scripture was accomplished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:12">Ps. xxi. 12</A>),

 <I>Thou shalt make them turn their back,</I> and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:8">Ps. xx. 8</A>.

 And it will be accomplished more and more; <I>with the breath of his

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Having given his enemies a repulse, he gives his friends a 
 protection, and that by his word too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>,
 
 where we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he continued to expose himself to their rage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They did not lie long where they fell, but, by divine permission, got 
 up again; it is only in the other world that God's judgments are 
 everlasting. When they were down, one would have thought Christ should 
 have made his escape; when they were up again, one would have thought 
 they should have let fall their pursuit; but still we find,

 (1.) They are as eager as ever to seize him. It is in some confusion 
 and disorder that they recover themselves; they cannot imagine what 
 ailed them, that they could not keep their ground, but will impute it 
 to any thing rather than Christ's power. Note, There are hearts so very 
 hard in sin that nothing will work upon them to reduce and reclaim 
 them. 

 (2.) He is as willing as ever to be seized. When they were fallen 
 before him, he did not insult over them, but seeing them at a loss, 
 asked them the same question, <I>Whom seek you?</I> And they gave him 
 the same answer, <I>Jesus of Nazareth.</I> In his repeating the 
 question, he seems to come yet closer to their consciences: "Do you not 
 know <I>whom you seek?</I> Are you not aware that you are in error, and 
 will you meddle with your match? Have you not had enough of it, but 
 will you try the other struggle? <I>Did ever any harden his heart 
 against God and prosper?</I>" In their repeating the same answer, they 
 showed an obstinacy in their wicked way; they still call him <I>Jesus 
 of Nazareth,</I> with as much disdain as ever, and Judas is as 
 unrelenting as any of them. <I>Let us therefore fear lest,</I> by a
 few bold steps at first in a sinful way, <I>our hearts be 
 hardened.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he contrived to secure his disciples from their rage. He 
 improved this advantage against them for the protection of his 
 followers. When he shows his courage with reference to himself, <I>I 
 have told you that I am he,</I> he shows his care for his disciples, 
 <I>Let these go their way.</I> He speaks this as a command to them, 
 rather than a contract with them; for they lay at his mercy, not he at 
 theirs. He charges them therefore as <I>one having authority: "Let 
 these go their way;</I> it is at your peril if you meddle with them" 
 This aggravated the sin of the disciples in forsaking him, and 
 particularly Peter's in denying him, that Christ had given them this 
 pass, or warrant of protection, and yet they had not faith and courage 
 enough to rely upon it, but betook themselves to such base and sorry 
 shifts for their security. When Christ said, <I>Let these go their 
 way,</I> he intended,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To manifest his affectionate concern for his disciples. When he 
 exposed himself, he excused them, because they were not as yet fit to 
 suffer; their faith was weak, and their spirits were low, and it would 
 have been as much as their souls, and the lives of their souls, were 
 worth, to bring them into sufferings now. <I>New wine</I> must not be 
 <I>put into old bottles.</I> And, besides, they had other work to do; 
 they must go their way, for they are to go into all the world, to 
 preach the gospel. <I>Destroy them not, for a blessing is in them.</I>
 Now herein, 

 [1.] Christ gives us a great encouragement to follow him; for, though 
 he has allotted us sufferings, yet he considers our frame, will wisely 
 time the cross, and proportion it to our strength, and will <I>deliver 
 the godly out of temptation,</I> either from it, or through it. 

 [2.] He gives us a good example of love to our brethren and concern for 
 their welfare. We must not consult our own ease and safety only, but 
 others, as well as our own, and in some cases more than our own. There
 is a generous and heroic love, which will enable us to <I>lay down our 
 lives for the brethren,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:16">1 John iii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He intended to give a specimen of his undertaking as Mediator. 
 When he offered himself to suffer and die, it was that we might escape. 
 He was our <B><I>antipsychos</I></B>--<I>a sufferer in our stead;</I> 
 when he said, <I>Lo, I come,</I> he said also, <I>Let these go their 
 way;</I> like the ram offered instead of Isaac.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Now herein he confirmed the word which he had spoken a little before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:12"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 12</A>),

 <I>Of those whom thou gavest me, I have lost none.</I> Christ, by
 fulfilling that word in this particular, gave an assurance that it 
 should be accomplished in the full extent of it, not only for those 
 that were now with him, but for all that should believe on him through 
 their word. Though Christ's keeping them was meant especially of the 
 preservation of their souls from sin and apostasy, yet it is here 
 applied to the preservation of their natural lives, and very fitly, for 
 even the body was a part of Christ's charge and care; he is to <I>raise 
 it up at the last day,</I> and therefore to preserve it as well as 
 <I>the spirit and soul,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:23,2Ti+4:17,18">1 Thess. v. 23; 2 Tim. iv. 17, 18</A>.
 
 Christ will preserve the natural life for the service to which it is
 designed; it is given to him to be used for him, and he will not lose 
 the service of it, but will be magnified in it, <I>whether by life or 
 death;</I> it shall be held in life as long as any use is to be made of 
 it. Christ's witnesses shall not die till they have given in their 
 evidence. But this is not all; this preservation of the disciples was, 
 in the tendency of it, a spiritual preservation. They were now so weak 
 in faith and resolution that in all probability, if they had been 
 called out to suffer at this time, they would have shamed themselves 
 and their Master, and some of them, at least the weaker of them, would 
 have been lost; and therefore, that he might <I>lose none,</I> he would 
 not expose them. The safety and preservation of the saints are owing, 
 not only to the divine grace in proportioning the strength to the 
 trial, but to the divine providence in proportioning the trial to the 
 strength.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Having provided for the safety of his disciples, he rebukes the 
 rashness of one of them, and represses the violence of his followers,
 as he had repulsed the violence of his persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>,

 where we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Peter's rashness. He had a sword; it is not likely that he wore one 
 constantly as a gentleman, but they had two swords among them all 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:38">Luke xxii. 38</A>),

 and Peter, being entrusted with one, drew it; for now, if ever, he 
 thought it was his time to use it; and <I>he smote one of the high 
 priest's servants,</I> who was probably one of the forwardest, and 
 aiming, it is likely, to cleave him down the head, missed his blow, and 
 only <I>cut off his right ear. The servant's name,</I> for the greater 
 certainty of the narrative, is recorded; it <I>was Malchus,</I> or 
 <I>Malluch,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:4">Neh. x. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We must here acknowledge Peter's good-will; he had an honest zeal 
 for his Master, though now misguided. He had lately promised to venture 
 his life for him, and would now make his words good. Probably it 
 exasperated Peter to see Judas at the head of this gang; his baseness 
 excited Peter's boldness, and I wonder that when he did draw his sword 
 he did not aim at the traitor's head.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Yet we must acknowledge Peter's ill conduct; and, though his good 
 intention did excuse, yet it would not justify him. 

 [1.] He had no warrant from his Master for what he did. Christ's 
 soldiers must wait the word of command, and not outrun it; before they 
 expose themselves to sufferings, they must see to it, not only that 
 their cause be good, but their call clear. 

 [2.] He transgressed the duty of his place, and resisted the powers 
 that were, which Christ had never countenanced, but forbidden

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:39">Matt. v. 39</A>):

 <I>that you resist not evil</I> 

 [3.] He opposed his Master's sufferings, and, notwithstanding the 
 rebuke he had for it once, is ready to repeat, <I>Master, spare 
 thyself;</I> suffering be <I>far from thee;</I> though Christ had told 
 him that he must and would suffer, and that his hour was now come. 
 Thus, while he seemed to fight for Christ, he fought against him. 

 [4.] He broke the capitulation his Master had lately made with the 
 enemy. When he said, <I>Let these go their way,</I> he not only
 indented for their safety, but in effect passed his word for their good 
 behaviour, that they should go away peaceably; this Peter heard, and 
 yet would not be bound by it. As we may be guilty of a sinful cowardice 
 when we are called to appear, so we may be of a sinful forwardness when 
 we are called to retire. 

 [5.] He foolishly exposed himself and his fellow disciples to the fury 
 of this enraged multitude. If he had cut off Malchus's head when he cut 
 off his ear, we may suppose the soldiers would have fallen upon all the 
 disciples, and have hewn them to pieces, and would have represented 
 Christ as not better than Barabbas. Thus many have been guilty of 
 self-destruction, in their zeal for self-preservation. 

 [6.] Peter played the coward so soon after this (denying his Master) 
 that we have reason to think he would not have done this but that he 
 saw his Master cause them to fall on the ground, and then he could deal 
 with them; but, when he saw him surrender himself notwithstanding, his 
 courage failed him; whereas the true Christian hero will appear in the 
 cause of Christ, not only when it is prevailing, but when it seems to 
 be declining; will be on the right side, though it be not the rising 
 side.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) We must acknowledge God's over-ruling providence in directing the 
 stroke (so that it should do no more execution, but only cut off his 
 ear, which was rather marking him than maiming him), as also in giving
 Christ an opportunity to manifest his power and goodness in healing the
 hurt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:51">Luke xxii. 51</A>.

 Thus what was in danger of turning to Christ's reproach proved an 
 occasion of that which redounded much to his honour, even among his 
 adversaries.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The rebuke his Master gave him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Put up thy sword into the sheath,</I> or scabbard; it is a gentle 
 reproof, because it was his zeal that carried him beyond the bounds of 
 discretion. Christ did not aggravate the matter, only bade him <I>do so 
 no more.</I> Many think their being in grief and distress will excuse 
 them if they be hot and hasty with those about them; but Christ has 
 here set us an example of meekness in sufferings. Peter must put up his 
 sword, for it was the <I>sword of the Spirit</I> that was to be 
 committed to him--<I>weapons of warfare not carnal,</I> yet 
 <I>mighty.</I> When Christ with a word felled the aggressors, he showed 
 Peter how he should be armed with a <I>word, quick and powerful, and 
 sharper than any two-edged sword,</I> and with that, not long after 
 this, he laid Ananias and Sapphira dead at his feet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The reason for this rebuke: <I>The cup which my Father has given me, 
 shall I not drink it?</I> Matthew relates another reason which Christ 
 gave for this rebuke, but John preserves this, which he had omitted; in 
 which Christ gives us, 

 (1.) A full proof of his own submission to his Father's will. Of all 
 that was amiss in what Peter did, he seems to resent nothing so much as 
 that he would have hindered his sufferings now that his <I>hour was 
 come:</I> "What, <I>Peter,</I> wilt thou step in between the cup and 
 the lip? <I>Get thee hence, Satan.</I>" If Christ be determined to 
 suffer and die, it is presumption for Peter in word or deed to oppose 
 it: <I>Shall I not drink it?</I> The manner of expression bespeaks a 
 settled resolution, and that he would not entertain a thought to the 
 contrary. He was willing to drink of this cup, though it was a bitter 
 cup, an infusion of the wormwood and the gall, the cup of trembling, a 
 bloody cup, the <I>dregs of the cup of the Lord's wrath,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:22">Isa. li. 22</A>.

 He drank it, that he might put into our hands the cup of salvation, the 
 cup of consolation, the cup of blessing; and <I>therefore</I> he is 
 willing to drink it, because <I>his Father put it into his hand.</I> If 
 his Father will have it so, it is for the best, and be it so. 

 (2.) A fair pattern to us of submission to God's will in every thing 
 that concerns us. We must <I>pledge</I> Christ in the cup that he drank 
 of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:23">Matt. xx. 23</A>),

 and must argue ourselves into a compliance. 

 [1.] It is but a <I>cup;</I> a small matter comparatively, be it what 
 it will. It is not a sea, a red sea, a dead sea, for it is not hell; it 
 is light, and but for a moment. 

 [2.] It is a cup that is given us; sufferings are gifts.

 [3.] It is given us by a Father, who has a Father's authority, and does 
 us no wrong; a Father's affection, and means us no hurt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Having entirely reconciled himself to the dispensation, he calmly 
 surrendered, and yielded himself a prisoner, not because he could not 
 have made his escape, but because he would not. One would have thought 
 the cure of Malchus's ear should have made them relent, but nothing 
 would win upon them. <I>Maledictus furor, quem nec majestast miraculi 
 nec pietas beneficii confringere potuit</I>--<I>Accursed rage, which 
 the grandeur of the miracle could not appease, nor the tenderness of 
 the favour conciliate.</I>--Anselm. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How they seized him: <I>They took Jesus.</I> Only some few of them 
 could lay hands on him, but it is charged upon them all, for they were 
 all aiding and abetting. In treason there are not accessaries; all are 
 principals. Now the scripture was fulfilled, <I>Bulls have compassed
 me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:12">Ps. xxii. 12</A>),
 
 <I>compassed me like bees,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:12">Ps. cxviii. 12</A>.

 <I>The breath of our nostrils is taken in their pit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:20">Lam. iv. 20</A>.
 
 They had so often been frustrated in their attempts to seize him that 
 now, having got him into their hands, we may suppose they flew upon him 
 with so much the more violence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How they secured him: <I>They bound him.</I> This particular of his 
 sufferings is taken notice of only by this evangelist, that, as soon as 
 ever he was taken, he was bound, pinioned, handcuffed; tradition says, 
 "They bound him with such cruelty that the blood started out at his
 fingers' ends; and, having bound his hands behind him, they clapped an 
 iron chain about his neck, and with that dragged him along." See 
 <I>Gerhard. Harm.</I> cap. 5.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This shows the spite of his persecutors. They bound him, 

 [1.] That they might torment him, and put him in pain, as they bound 
 Samson to afflict him. 

 [2.] That they might disgrace him, and put him to shame; slaves were 
 bound, so was Christ, though free-born. 

 [3.] That they might prevent his escape, Judas having told them to hold 
 him fast. See their folly, that they should think to fetter that power
 which had but just now proved itself omnipotent. 

 [4.] They bound him as one already condemned, for they were resolved to 
 prosecute him to the death, and that he should die as a fool dieth, 
 that is, as a malefactor, with his hands bound,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:33,34">2 Sam. iii. 33, 34</A>.

 Christ had bound the consciences of his persecutors with the power of 
 his word, which galled them; and, to be revenged on him, they laid 
 these bonds on him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to
 Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.
 &nbsp; 14  Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it
 was expedient that one man should die for the people.
 &nbsp; 15  And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and <I>so did</I> another
 disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went
 in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
 &nbsp; 16  But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that
 other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake
 unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.
 &nbsp; 17  Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not
 thou also <I>one</I> of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.
 &nbsp; 18  And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a
 fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and
 Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
 &nbsp; 19  The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of
 his doctrine.
 &nbsp; 20  Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever
 taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews
 always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.
 &nbsp; 21  Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have
 said unto them: behold, they know what I said.
 &nbsp; 22  And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood
 by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou
 the high priest so?
 &nbsp; 23  Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of
 the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?
 &nbsp; 24  Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
 &nbsp; 25  And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said
 therefore unto him, Art not thou also <I>one</I> of his disciples? He
 denied <I>it,</I> and said, I am not.
 &nbsp; 26  One of the servants of the high priest, being <I>his</I> kinsman
 whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden
 with him?
 &nbsp; 27  Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of Christ's arraignment before the high priest, 
 and some circumstances that occurred therein which were omitted by the 
 other evangelists; and Peter's denying him, which the other evangelists 
 had given the story of entire by itself, is interwoven with the other 
 passages. The crime laid to his charge having relation to religion, the 
 judges of the spiritual court took it to fall directly under their 
 cognizance. Both Jews and Gentiles seized him, and so both Jews and 
 Gentiles tried and condemned him, for he died for the sins of both. Let 
 us go over the story in order.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Having seized him, they <I>led him away to Annas first,</I> before 
 they brought him to the court that was sat, expecting him, in the house 
 of Caiaphas, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 1. They <I>led him away,</I> led him in triumph, as a trophy of their 
 victory; led him <I>as a lamb to the slaughter,</I> and they led him 
 through the sheep-gate spoken of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:1">Neh. iii. 1</A>.

 For through that they went from the mount of Olives into Jerusalem.
 They hurried him away with violence, as if he had been the worst and 
 vilest of malefactors. We had been led away of our own impetuous lusts, 
 and led captive by Satan at his will, and, that we might be rescued, 
 Christ was led away, led captive by Satan's agents and instruments. 

 2. They led him away to their masters that sent them. It was now about
 midnight, and one would think they should have put him in ward

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:12">Lev. xxiv. 12</A>),

 should have led him to some prison, till it was a proper time to call a
 court; but he is hurried away immediately, not to the justices of 
 peace, to be committed, but to the judges to be condemned; so extremely 
 violent was the prosecution, partly because they feared a rescue, which 
 they would thus not only leave no time for, but give a terror to; 
 partly because they greedily thirsted after Christ's blood, as <I>the 
 eagle that hasteth to the prey.</I> 

 3. They led him to Annas first. Probably his house lay in the way, and
 was convenient for them to call at to refresh themselves, and, as some 
 think, to be paid for their service. I suppose Annas was old and 
 infirm, and could not be present in council with the rest at that time 
 of night, and yet earnestly desired to see the prey. To gratify him 
 therefore with the assurance of their success, that the old man might 
 sleep the better, and to receive his blessing for it, they produce 
 their prisoner before him. It is sad to see those that are old and 
 sickly, when they cannot commit sin as formerly, taking pleasure in 
 those that do. Dr. Lightfoot thinks Annas was not present, because he 
 had to attend early that morning in the temple, to examine the 
 sacrifices which were that day to be offered, whether they were without 
 blemish; if so, there was a significancy in it, that Christ, the great 
 sacrifice, was presented to him, and sent away bound, as approved and 
 ready for the altar. 

 4. This Annas was father-in-law to Caiaphas the high priest; this
 kindred by marriage between them comes in as a reason either why 
 Caiaphas ordered that this piece of respect should be done to Annas, to 
 favour him with the first sight of the prisoner, or why Annas was 
 willing to countenance Caiaphas in a matter his heart was so much upon. 
 Note, Acquaintance and alliance with wicked people are a great 
 confirmation to many in their wicked ways.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Annas did not long detain them, being as willing as any of them to 
 have the prosecution pushed on, and therefore sent him bound to 
 Caiaphas, to his house, which was appointed for the rendezvous of the 
 sanhedrim upon this occasion, or to the usual place in the temple where 
 the high priest kept his court; this is mentioned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 But our translators intimate in the margin that it should come in here, 
 and, accordingly, read it there, <I>Annas had sent him.</I> Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The power of Caiaphas intimated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>).

 He was <I>high priest that same year.</I> The high priest's commission 
 was during life; but there were now such frequent changes, by the 
 Simoniacal artifices of aspiring men with the government, that it was 
 become almost an annual office, a presage of its final period 
 approaching; while they were undermining one another. God was 
 overturning them all, that he might come whose right it was. Caiaphas 
 was high priest that same year when Messiah was to be cut off, which 
 intimates, 

 (1.) That when a bad thing was to be done by a high priest, according 
 to the foreknowledge of God, Providence so ordered it that a bad man 
 should be in the chair to do it. 

 (2.) That, when God would make it to appear what corruption there was 
 in the heart of a bad man, he put him into a place of power, where he 
 had temptation and opportunity to exert it. It was the ruin of Caiaphas 
 that he was high priest that year, and so became a ringleader in the 
 putting of Christ to death. Many a man's advancement has lost him his
 reputation, and he had not been dishonoured if he had not been 
 preferred.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The malice of Caiaphas, which is intimated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 by the repeating of what he had said some time before, that, right or 
 wrong, guilty or innocent, <I>it was expedient that one man should die 
 for the people,</I> which refers to the story

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:50"><I>ch.</I> xi. 50</A>.

 This comes in here to show, 

 (1.) What a bad man he was; this was that Caiaphas that governed 
 himself and the church by rules of policy, in defiance of the rules of 
 equity. 

 (2.) What ill usage Christ was likely to meet with in his court, when 
 his case was adjudged before it was heard, and they were already 
 resolved what to do with him; <I>he must die;</I> so that his trial was 
 a jest. Thus the enemies of Christ's gospel are resolved, true or 
 false, to run it down. 

 (3.) It is a testimony to the innocency of our Lord Jesus, from the 
 mouth of one of his worst enemies, who owned that he fell a sacrifice 
 to the public good, and that it was not just he should die, but 
 <I>expedient</I> only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The concurrence of Annas in the prosecution of Christ. He made 
 himself a partaker in guilt, 

 (1.) With the captain and officers, that without law or mercy had bound 
 him; for he approved it by continuing him bound when he should have 
 loosed him, he not being convicted of any crime, nor having attempted 
 an escape. If we do not what we can to undo what others have ill done, 
 we are accessaries <I>ex post facto--after the fact.</I> It was more 
 excusable in the rude soldiers to bind him than in Annas, who should 
 have known better, to continue him bound.

 (2.) With the chief priest and council that condemned him, and 
 prosecuted him to death. This Annas was not present with them, yet thus 
 he wished them <I>good speed,</I> and became a <I>partaker of their 
 evil deeds.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In the house of Caiaphas, Simon Peter began to deny his Master, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:15-18"><I>v.</I> 15-18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was with much ado that Peter got into the hall where the court 
 was sitting, an account of which we have 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 Here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Peter's kindness to Christ, which (though it proved no kindness)
 appeared in two things:--

 [1.] That he <I>followed Jesus</I> when he was <I>led away;</I> though 
 at first he fled with the rest, yet afterwards he took heart a little, 
 and followed at some distance, calling to mind the promises he had made 
 to adhere to him, whatever it should cost him. Those that had followed
 Christ in the midst of his honours, and shared with him in those 
 honours, when the people cried Hosanna to him, ought to have followed 
 him now in the midst of his reproaches, and to have shared with him in 
 these. Those that truly love and value Christ will follow him all 
 weathers and all ways. 

 [2.] When he could not get in where Jesus was in the midst of his 
 enemies, he <I>stood at the door without,</I> willing to be as near him 
 as he could, and waiting for an opportunity to get nearer. Thus when we 
 meet with opposition in following Christ we must show our good-will. 
 But yet this kindness of Peter's was no kindness, because he had not 
 strength and courage enough to persevere in it, and so, as it proved, 
 he did but run himself into a snare: and even his following Christ, 
 considering all things, was to be blamed, because Christ, who knew him 
 better than he knew himself, had expressly told him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:36"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 36</A>),

 <I>Whither I go thou canst not follow me now,</I> and had told him
 again and again that he would deny him; and he had lately had 
 experience of his own weakness in forsaking him. Note, We must take
 heed of tempting God by running upon difficulties beyond our strength, 
 and venturing too far in a way of suffering. If our call be clear to 
 expose ourselves, we may hope that God will enable us to honour him; 
 but, if it be not, we may fear that God will leave us to shame 
 ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The other disciple's kindness to Peter, which yet, as it proved, 
 was no kindness neither. St. John several times in this gospel speaking 
 of himself as another disciple, many interpreters have been led by this 
 to fancy that this other disciple here was John; and many conjectures 
 they have how he should come to be known to the high-priest; <I>propter 
 generis nobilitatem--being of superior birth,</I> saith <I>Jerome, 
 Epitaph. Marcel.,</I> as if he were a better gentleman born than his 
 brother James, when they were both the sons of Zebedee the fisherman; 
 some will tell you that he had sold his estate to the high priest, 
 others that he supplied his family with fish, both which are very 
 improbable. But I see no reason to think that this other disciple was 
 John, or one of the twelve; other sheep Christ had, which were not of 
 the fold; and this might be, as the Syriac read it, <I>unus ex 
 discipulis aliis--one of those other disciples</I> that believe in 
 Christ, but resided at Jerusalem, and kept their places there; perhaps 
 Joseph of Arimathea, or Nicodemus, known to the high priest, but not 
 known to him to be disciples of Christ. Note, As there are many who 
 seem disciples and are not so, so there are many who are disciples and 
 seem not so. There are good people hid in courts, even in Nero's, as 
 well as hid in crowds. We must not conclude a man to be no friend to 
 Christ merely because he has acquaintance and conversation with those 
 that were his known enemies. Now, 

 [1.] This other disciple, whoever he was, showed a respect to Peter, in 
 introducing him, not only to gratify his curiosity and affection, but 
 to give him an opportunity of being serviceable to his Master upon his 
 trial, if there were occasion. Those that have a real kindness for 
 Christ and his ways, though their temper may be reserved and their 
 circumstances may lead them to be cautious and retired, yet, if their 
 faith be sincere, they will discover, when they are called to it, which 
 way their inclination lies, by being ready to do a professed disciple a 
 good turn. Peter perhaps had formerly introduced this disciple into 
 conversation with Christ, and now he requites his kindness, and is not 
 ashamed to own him, though, it should seem, he had at this time but a 
 poor downcast appearance. 

 [2.] But this kindness proved no kindness, nay a great diskindness; by 
 letting him into the high priest's hall, he let him into temptation, 
 and the consequence was bad. Note, The courtesies of our friends often 
 prove a snare to us, through a misguided affection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Peter, having got in, was immediately assaulted with the temptation, 
 and foiled by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How slight the attack was. It was but a silly maid, of so small 
 account that she was set to keep the door, that challenged him, and she 
 only asked him carelessly, <I>Art not thou one of this man's 
 disciples?</I> probably suspecting it by his sheepish look, and coming 
 in timorously. We should many a time better maintain a good cause if we 
 had a <I>good heart on it,</I> and could put a <I>good face on it.</I> 
 Peter would have had some reason to take the alarm if Malchus had set 
 upon him, and had said, "This is he that cut off my ear, and I will 
 have his head for it;" but when a maid only asked him, <I>Art not thou 
 one of them?</I> he might without danger have answered, <I>And what if 
 I am?</I> Suppose the servants had ridiculed him, and insulted over 
 him, upon it, those can bear but little for Christ that cannot <I>bear 
 this;</I> this is but <I>running with the footmen.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How speedy the surrender was. Without taking time to recollect 
 himself, he suddenly answered, <I>I am not.</I> If he had had the 
 boldness of the lion, he would have said, "It is my honour that I am 
 so;" or, if he had had the wisdom of the serpent, he would have kept 
 silence at this time, for it was an evil time. But, all his care being 
 for his own safety, he thought he could not secure this but by a 
 peremptory denial: <I>I am not;</I> he not only denies it, but even 
 disdains it, and scorns her words.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Yet he goes further into the temptation: <I>And the servants and 
 officers stood there, and Peter with them</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] See how the servants made much of themselves; the night being 
 cold, they made a fire in the hall, not for their masters (they were so 
 eager in persecuting Christ that they forgot cold), but for themselves 
 to refresh themselves. They cared not what became of Christ; all their 
 care was to sit and warm themselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:6">Amos vi. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] See how Peter herded himself with them, and made one among them. 
 <I>He sat and warmed himself. First,</I> It was a fault bad enough that 
 he did not attend his Master, and appear for him at the upper end of 
 the hall, where he was now under examination. He might have been a 
 witness for him, and have confronted the false witnesses that swore 
 against him, if his Master had called him; at least, he might have been 
 a witness to him, might have taken an exact notice of what passed, that 
 he might relate it to the other disciples, who could none of them get 
 in to hear the trial; he might have learned by his Master's example how 
 to carry himself when it should come to his turn to suffer thus; yet 
 neither his conscience nor his curiosity could bring him into the 
 court, but he sits by, as if, like Gallio, he cared for none of these 
 things. And yet at the same time we have reason to think his heart was 
 as full of grief and concern as it could hold, but he had not the 
 courage to own it. <I>Lord, lead us not into temptation. Secondly,</I> 
 It was much worse that he joined himself with those that were his 
 Master's enemies: <I>He stood with them, and warmed himself;</I> this 
 was a poor excuse for joining with them. A little thing will draw those 
 into bad company that will be drawn to it by the love of a good fire. 
 If Peter's zeal for his Master had not frozen, but had continued in the 
 heat it seemed to be of but a few hours before, he had not had occasion 
 to warm himself now. Peter was much to be blamed, 

 1. Because he associated with these wicked men, and kept company with
 them. Doubtless they were diverting themselves with this night's 
 expedition, scoffing at Christ, at what he had said, at what he had 
 done, and triumphing in their victory over him; and what sort of 
 entertainment would this give to Peter? If he said as they said, or by 
 silence gave consent, he involved himself in sin; if not, he exposed 
 himself to danger. If Peter had not so much courage as to appear 
 publicly for his Master, yet he might have had so much devotion as to 
 retire into a corner, and weep in secret for his Master's sufferings, 
 and his own sin in forsaking him; if he could not have done good, he 
 might have kept out of the way of doing hurt. It is better to abscond 
 than appear to no purpose, or bad purpose. 

 2. Because he desired to be thought <I>one of them,</I> that he might
 not be suspected to be a disciple of Christ. Is this Peter? What a
 contradiction is this to the prayer of every good man, <I>Gather not my 
 soul with sinners! Saul among the prophets</I> is not so absurd as 
 David among the Philistines. Those that deprecate the lot of the
 scornful hereafter should dread the <I>seat of the scornful</I> now. It 
 is ill warming ourselves with those with whom we are in danger of 
 burning ourselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:4">Ps. cxli. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Peter, Christ's friend, having begun to deny him, the high priest, 
 his enemy, begins to accuse him, or rather urges him to accuse himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>.

 It should seem, the first attempt was to prove him a seducer, and a
 teacher of false doctrine, which this evangelist relates; and, when 
 they failed in the proof of this, then they charged him with blasphemy, 
 which is related by the other evangelists, and therefore omitted here.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The articles or heads upon which Christ was examined 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 concerning <I>his disciples and his doctrine.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The irregularity of the process; it was against all law and 
 equity. They seize him as a criminal, and now that he is their prisoner 
 they have nothing to <I>lay to his charge;</I> no libel, no prosecutor; 
 but the judge himself must be the prosecutor, and the prisoner himself 
 the witness, and, against all reason and justice, he is put on to be 
 his own accuser.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The intention. The <I>high priest then</I> 
 (<B><I>oun</I></B>--<I>therefore,</I> which seems to refer to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 
 because he had resolved that Christ must be sacrificed to their private 
 malice under colour of the public good, examined him upon those 
 interrogatories which would touch his life. He examined him, 

 [1.] Concerning his disciples, that he might charge him with sedition, 
 and represent him as dangerous to the Roman government, as well as to 
 the Jewish church. He asked him who were his disciples--what number 
 they were--of what country--what were their names and characters, 
 insinuating that his scholars were designed for soldiers, and would in 
 time become a formidable body. Some think his question concerning his 
 disciples was, "What is now become of them all? Where are they? Why do 
 they not appear?" upbraiding him with their cowardice in deserting him, 
 and thus adding to the affliction of it. There was something 
 significant in this, that Christ's calling and owning his disciples was 
 the first thing laid to his charge, for it was <I>for their sakes</I> 
 that he <I>sanctified himself</I> and suffered. 

 [2.] Concerning his doctrine, that they might charge him with heresy, 
 and bring him under the penalty of the law against false prophets,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:9,10">Deut. xiii. 9, 10</A>.

 This was a matter properly cognizable in that court

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:12">Deut. xvii. 12</A>),

 therefore a prophet could not perish but at Jerusalem, where that court
 sat. They could not prove any false doctrine upon him; but they hoped 
 to extort something from him which they might distort to his prejudice, 
 and to make him an offender for some word or other, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:21">Isa. xxix. 21</A>.

 They said nothing to him concerning his miracles, by which he had done
 so much good, and proved his doctrine beyond contradiction, because of 
 these they were sure they could take no hold. Thus the adversaries of 
 Christ while they are industriously quarrelling with his truth, 
 willfully shut their eyes against the evidences of it, and take no 
 notice of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The appeal Christ made, in answer to these interrogatories. 

 (1.) As to his disciples, he said nothing, because it was an 
 impertinent question; if his doctrine was sound and good, his having 
 disciples to whom to communicate it was no more than what was practised 
 and allowed by their own doctors. If Caiaphas, in asking him concerning 
 his disciples, designed to ensnare them, and bring them into trouble, 
 it was in kindness to them that Christ said nothing of them, for he had 
 said, <I>Let these go their way.</I> If he meant to upbraid him with 
 their cowardice, no wonder that he said nothing, for</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 he would say nothing to condemn them, and could say nothing to justify 
 them. 

 (2.) As to his doctrine, he said nothing in particular, but in general 
 referred himself to those that heard him, being not only made manifest 
 to God, but made manifest also in their consciences,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He tacitly charges his judges with illegal proceedings. He does 
 not indeed speak evil of the rulers of the people, nor say now to these 
 princes, <I>You are wicked;</I> but he appeals to the settled rules of 
 their own court, whether they dealt fairly by him. <I>Do you indeed 
 judge righteously?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:1">Ps. lviii. 1</A>.

 So here, <I>Why ask you me?</I> Which implies two absurdities in 
 judgment: <I>First, "Why ask you me now</I> concerning my doctrine, 
 when you have already condemned it?" They had made an order of court 
 for excommunicating all that owned him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:22"><I>ch.</I> ix. 22</A>),

 had issued out a proclamation for apprehending him; and now they come
 to ask what his doctrine is! Thus was he condemned, as his doctrine and 
 cause commonly are, unheard. <I>Secondly, "Why ask you me?</I> Must I 
 accuse myself, when you have no evidence against me?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He insists upon his fair and open dealing with them in the 
 publication of his doctrine, and justifies himself with this. The crime 
 which the sanhedrim by the law was to enquire after was the clandestine 
 spreading of dangerous doctrines, enticing secretly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:6">Deut. xiii. 6</A>.

 As to this, therefore, Christ clears himself very fully. <I>First,</I>
 As to the manner of his preaching. He spoke openly, 
 <B><I>parresia</I></B>--<I>with freedom and plainness of speech;</I> he 
 did not deliver things ambiguously, as Apollo did his oracles. Those 
 that would undermine the truth, and spread corrupt notions, seek to 
 accomplish their purpose by sly insinuation, putting queries, starting 
 difficulties, and asserting nothing; but Christ explained himself 
 fully, with, <I>Verily, verily, I say unto you;</I> his reproofs were 
 free and bold, and his testimonies express against the corruptions of 
 the age. <I>Secondly,</I> As to the persons he preached to: <I>He spoke 
 to the world,</I> to all that had <I>ears to hear,</I> and were willing 
 to hear him, high or low, learned or unlearned, Jew or Gentile, friend 
 or foe. His doctrine feared not the censure of a mixed multitude; nor 
 did he grudge the knowledge of it to any (as the masters of some rare 
 invention commonly do), but freely communicated it, as the sun does his 
 beams. <I>Thirdly,</I> As to the places he preached in. When he was in 
 the country, he preached ordinarily in the synagogues--the places of 
 meeting for worship, and on the sabbath-day-the time of meeting; when 
 he came up to Jerusalem, he preached the same doctrine in the temple at 
 the time of the solemn feasts, when the Jews from all parts assembled 
 there; and though he often preached in private houses, and on 
 mountains, and by the sea-side, to show that his word and worship were 
 not to be confined to temples and synagogues, yet what he preached in 
 private was the very same with what he delivered publicly. Note, The 
 doctrine of Christ, purely and plainly preached, needs not be ashamed 
 to appear in the most numerous assembly, for it carries its own 
 strength and beauty along with it. What Christ's faithful ministers say 
 they would be willing all the world should hear. Wisdom cries in the 
 places of concourse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:21,8:3,9:3">Prov. i. 21; viii. 3; ix. 3</A>.

 <I>Fourthly,</I> As to the doctrine itself. He <I>said nothing in
 secret</I> contrary to what he said in public, but only by way of
 repetition and explication: <I>In secret have I said nothing;</I> as if
 he had been either suspicious of the truth of it, or conscious of any
 ill design in it. He sought no corners, for he feared no colours, nor
 said any thing that he needed to be ashamed of; what he did speak in
 private to his disciples he ordered them to proclaim on the house-tops,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:27">Matt. x. 27</A>.
 
 God saith of himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:19">Isa. xlv. 19</A>),

 <I>I have not spoken in secret;</I> his commandment is not hidden,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:11">Deut. xxx. 11</A>.

 And the righteousness of faith speaks in like manner,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:6">Rom. x. 6</A>.

 <I>Veritas nihil metuit nisi abscondi--truth fears nothing but
 concealment.</I>--Tertullian.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] He appeals to those that had heard him, and desires that they 
 might be examined what doctrine he had preached, and whether it had 
 that dangerous tendency that was surmised: "<I>Ask those that heard me 
 what I said unto them;</I> some of them may be in court, or may be sent 
 for out of their beds." He means not his friends and followers, who 
 might be presumed to speak in his favour, but, Ask any impartial 
 hearer; ask your own officers. Some think he pointed to them, when he 
 said, <I>Behold, they know what I said,</I> referring to the report 
 which they had made of his preaching 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:46"><I>ch.</I> vii. 46</A>),

 <I>Never man spoke like this man.</I> Nay, you may ask some upon the
 bench; for it is probable that some of them had heard him, and had been 
 put to silence by him. Note, The doctrine of Christ may safely appeal
 to all that know it, and has so much right and reason on its side that 
 those who will judge impartially cannot but witness to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. While the judges were examining him, the servants that stood by were 
 abusing him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was a base affront which one of the officers gave him; though he 
 spoke with so much calmness and convincing evidence, this insolent 
 fellow <I>struck him with the palm of his hand,</I> probably on the 
 side of his head or face, saying, <I>Answerest thou the high priest 
 so?</I> as if he had behaved himself rudely to the court.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He <I>struck him,</I> <B><I>edoke rhapisma</I></B>--<I>he gave him 
 a blow.</I> Some think it signifies a blow with a rod or wand, from 
 <B><I>rhabdos</I></B>, or with the staff which was the badge of his 
 office. Now the scripture was fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:6">Isa. l. 6</A>),

 <I>I gave my cheeks,</I> <B><I>eis rhapismata</I></B> (so the LXX.)
 <I>to blows,</I> the word here used. And 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:1">Mic. v. 1</A>,

 <I>They shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek;</I> 
 and the type answered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:10">Job xvi. 10</A>),

 <I>They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully.</I> It was unjust 
 to strike one that neither said nor did amiss; it was insolent for a 
 mean servant to strike one that was confessedly a person of account; it 
 was cowardly to strike one that had his hands tied; and barbarous to 
 strike a prisoner at the bar. Here was a breach of the peace in the 
 face of the court, and yet the judges countenanced it. Confusion of
 face was our due; but Christ here took it to himself: "Upon me be the 
 curse, the shame."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He checked him in a haughty imperious manner: <I>Answerest thou 
 the high priest so?</I> As if the blessed Jesus were not good enough to 
 speak to his master, or not wise enough to know how to speak to him, 
 but, like a rude and ignorant prisoner, must be controlled by the 
 jailor, and taught how to behave. Some of the ancients suggest that 
 this officer was Malchus, who owed to Christ the healing of his ear, 
 and the saving of his head, and yet made him this ill return. But, 
 whoever it was, it was done to please the high priest, and to curry 
 favour with him; for what he said implied a jealousy for the dignity of 
 the high priest. Wicked rulers will not want wicked servants, who will 
 <I>help forward the affliction</I> of those whom their masters 
 persecute. There was a successor of this high priest that commanded the 
 bystanders to smite Paul thus <I>on the mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:2">Acts xxiii. 2</A>.

 Some think this officer took himself to be affronted by Christ's appeal
 to those about him concerning his doctrine, as if he would have vouched 
 him to be a witness; and perhaps he was one of those officers that had 
 spoken honourably of him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:46"><I>ch.</I> vii. 46</A>),

 and, lest he should now be thought a secret friend to him, he thus
 appears a bitter enemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ bore this affront with wonderful meekness and patience 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 "<I>If I have spoken evil,</I> in what I have now said, <I>bear witness 
 of the evil.</I> Observe it to the court, and let them judge of it, who 
 are the proper judges; but if well, and as it did become me, <I>why 
 smitest thou me?</I>" Christ could have answered him with a miracle of 
 wrath, could have struck him dumb or dead, or have withered the hand 
 that was lifted up against him. But this was the day of his patience 
 and suffering, and he answered him with the <I>meekness of wisdom,</I> 
 to teach us not to avenge ourselves, not to render <I>railing for 
 railing,</I> but with the <I>innocency of the dove</I> to bear 
 injuries, even when with the <I>wisdom of the serpent,</I> as our 
 Saviour, we show the injustice of them, and appeal to the magistrate 
 concerning them. Christ did not here <I>turn the other cheek,</I> by 
 which it appears that that rule, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:39">Matt. v. 39</A>,

 is not to be understood literally; a man may possibly <I>turn the other 
 cheek,</I> and yet have his heart full of malice; but, comparing 
 Christ's precept with his pattern, we learn, 

 (1.) That in such cases we must not be our own avengers, nor judges in 
 our own cause. We must rather receive than give the second blow, which 
 makes the quarrel; we are allowed to defend ourselves, but not to 
 avenge ourselves: the magistrate (if it be necessary for the preserving 
 of the public peace, and the restraining and terrifying of evil-doers) 
 is to be the avenger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:4">Rom. xiii. 4</A>.

 (2.) Our resentment of injuries done us must always be rational, and 
 never passionate; such Christ's here was; <I>when he suffered,</I> he 
 reasoned, but <I>threatened not.</I> He fairly expostulated with him 
 that did him the injury, and so may we.

 (3.) When we are called out to suffering, we must <I>accommodate 
 ourselves</I> to the inconveniences of a suffering state, with 
 patience, and by one indignity done us be prepared to receive another, 
 and to make the best of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. While the servants were thus abusing him, Peter was proceeding to 
 deny him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:25-27"><I>v.</I> 25-27</A>.

 It is a sad story, and none of the least of Christ's sufferings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He repeated the sin the second time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 While he was warming himself with the servants, as one of them, they 
 asked him, <I>Art not thou one of his disciples?</I> What dost thou 
 here among us? He, perhaps, hearing that Christ was examined about his 
 disciples, and fearing he should be seized, or at least smitten, as his 
 Master was, if he should own it, flatly denied it, and said, <I>I am 
 not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It was his great folly to thrust himself into the temptation, by 
 continuing in the company of those that were unsuitable for him, and 
 that he had nothing to do with. He staid to warm himself; but those 
 that warm themselves with evil doers grow cold towards good people and
 good things, and those that are fond of the devil's fire-side are in
 danger of the devil's fire. Peter might have stood by his Master at the
 bar, and have warmed himself better than here, at the fire of his
 Master's love, which <I>many waters could not quench,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:6,7">Cant. viii. 6, 7</A>.
 
 He might there have warmed himself with zeal for his Master, and
 indignation at his persecutors; but he chose rather to warm with them
 than to warm against them. But how could one (one disciple) be warm
 alone?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:11">Eccl. iv. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was his great unhappiness that he was again assaulted by the 
 temptation; and no other could be expected, for this was a place, this 
 an hour, of temptation. When the judge asked Christ about his 
 disciples, probably the servants took the hint, and challenged Peter 
 for one of them, "Answer to thy name." See here, 

 [1.] The subtlety of the tempter in running down one whom he saw 
 falling, and mustering a greater force against him; not a maid now, but 
 all the servants. Note, Yielding to one temptation invites another, and 
 perhaps a stronger. Satan redoubles his attacks when we give ground.
 
 [2.] The danger of bad company. We commonly study to approve ourselves 
 to those with whom we choose to associate; we value ourselves upon 
 their good word and covet to stand right in their opinion. As we choose 
 our people we choose our praise, and govern ourselves accordingly; we 
 are therefore concerned to make the first choice well, and not to 
 mingle with those whom we cannot please without displeasing God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It was his great weakness, nay, it was his great wickedness, to 
 yield to the temptation, and to say, <I>I am not one</I> of his 
 disciples, as one ashamed of that which was his honour, and afraid of 
 suffering for it, which would have been yet more his honour. See how 
 the <I>fear of man brings a snare.</I> When Christ was admired, and 
 caressed, and treated with respect, Peter pleased himself, and perhaps 
 prided himself, in this, that he was a disciple of Christ, and so put 
 in for a share in the honours done to his Master. Thus many who seem 
 fond of the reputation of religion when it is in fashion are ashamed of 
 the reproach of it; but we must take it <I>for better and 
 worse.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He repeated the sin the third time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 Here he was attacked by one of the servants, who was kinsman to 
 Malchus, who, when he heard Peter deny himself to be a disciple of 
 Christ, gave him the lie with great assurance: "<I>Did not I see thee 
 in the garden with him?</I> Witness my kinsman's ear." Peter then 
 denied again, as if he knew nothing of Christ, nothing of the garden, 
 nothing of all this matter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This third assault of the temptation was more close than the 
 former: before his relation to Christ was only suspected, here it is 
 proved upon him by one that saw him with Jesus, and saw him draw his 
 sword in his defence. Note, Those who by sin think to help themselves 
 out of trouble do but entangle and embarrass themselves the more. Dare 
 to be brave, for truth will out. <I>A bird of the air</I> may perhaps 
 <I>tell the matter</I> which we seek to conceal with a lie. Notice is 
 taken of this servant's being akin to Malchus, because this 
 circumstance would make it the more a terror to Peter. "Now," thinks 
 he, "I am gone, my business is done, there needs no other witness nor 
 prosecutor." We should not make any man in particular our enemy if we 
 can help it, because the time may come when either he or some of his 
 relations may have us at their mercy. He that may need a friend should 
 not make a foe. But observe, though here was sufficient evidence 
 against Peter, and sufficient provocation given by his denial to have 
 prosecuted him, yet he escapes, has no harm done him nor attempted to 
 be done. Note, We are often drawn into sin by groundless causeless 
 fears, which there is no occasion for, and which a small degree of 
 wisdom and resolution would make nothing of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His yielding to it was no less base than the former: <I>He denied 
 again.</I> See here, 

 [1.] The nature of sin in general: <I>the heart is hardened by the 
 deceitfulness of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:13">Heb. iii. 13</A>.

 It was a strange degree of effrontery that Peter had arrived to on a 
 sudden, that he could with such assurance stand in a lie against so 
 clear a disproof; but <I>the beginning of sin is as the letting forth 
 of water,</I> when once the fence is broken men easily go from bad to 
 worse. 

 [2.] Of the sin of lying in particular; it is a fruitful sin, and upon 
 this account <I>exceedingly sinful:</I> one lie needs another to 
 support it, and that another. It is a rule in the devil's politics 
 <I>Male facta male factis tegere, ne perpluant</I>--<I>To cover sin 
 with sin, in order to escape detection.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment:
 and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment
 hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the
 passover.
 &nbsp; 29  Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation
 bring ye against this man?
 &nbsp; 30  They answered and said unto him, If he were not a
 malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.
 &nbsp; 31  Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him
 according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is
 not lawful for us to put any man to death:
 &nbsp; 32  That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake,
 signifying what death he should die.
 &nbsp; 33  Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called
 Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
 &nbsp; 34  Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or
 did others tell it thee of me?
 &nbsp; 35  Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief
 priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
 &nbsp; 36  Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my
 kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I
 should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not
 from hence.
 &nbsp; 37  Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus
 answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born,
 and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear
 witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my
 voice.
 &nbsp; 38  Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said
 this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I
 find in him no fault <I>at all.</I>
 &nbsp; 39  But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at
 the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King
 of the Jews?
 &nbsp; 40  Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but
 Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of Christ's arraignment before Pilate, the 
 Roman governor, in the <I>pr&aelig;torium</I> (a Latin word made
 Greek), the pr&aelig;tor's house, or <I>hall of judgment;</I> thither 
 they hurried him, to get him condemned in the Roman court, and executed 
 by the Roman power. Being resolved on his death, they took this course, 
 
 1. That he might be put to death the more legally and regularly,
 according to the present constitution of their government, since they 
 became a province of the empire; not stoned in a popular tumult, as 
 Stephen, but put to death with the present formalities of justice. Thus 
 he was treated as a malefactor, <I>being made sin for us.</I> 

 2. That he might be put to death the more safely. If they could engage
 the Roman government in the matter, which the people stood in awe of, 
 there would be little danger of an uproar. 

 3. That he might be put to death with more reproach to himself. <I>The
 death of the cross,</I> which the Romans commonly used, being of all 
 deaths the most ignominious, they were desirous by it to put an 
 indelible mark of infamy upon him, and so to sink his reputation for 
 ever. This therefore they harped upon, <I>Crucify him.</I> 

 4. That he might be put to death with less reproach to them. It was an
 invidious thing to put one to death that had done so much good in the 
 world, and therefore they were willing to throw the odium upon the 
 Roman government, to make that the less acceptable to the people, and 
 save themselves from the reproach. Thus many are more afraid of the
 scandal of a bad action than of the sin of it. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:28">Acts v. 28</A>.

 Two things are here observed concerning the prosecution:--

 (1.) Their policy and industry in the prosecution: <I>It was early;</I> 
 some think about two or three in the morning, others about five or six, 
 when most people were in their beds; and so there would be the less 
 danger of opposition from the people that were for Christ; while, at 
 the same time, they had their agents about, to call those together whom 
 they could influence to cry out against him. See how much their heart 
 was upon it, and how violent they were in the prosecution. Now that 
 they had him in their hands, they would lose no time till they had him 
 upon the cross, but denied themselves their natural rest, to push on 
 this matter. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:1">Mic. ii. 1</A>.

 (2.) Their superstition and vile hypocrisy: <I>The chief priests and 
 elders,</I> though they came along with the prisoner, that the thing 
 might be done effectually, <I>went not into the judgment-hall,</I> 
 because it was the house of an uncircumcised Gentile, <I>lest they 
 should be defiled,</I> but kept out of doors, <I>that they might eat 
 the passover,</I> not the paschal lamb (that was eaten the night 
 before) but the passover-feast, upon the sacrifices which were offered 
 on the fifteenth day, <I>the Chagigah,</I> as they called it, the 
 passover-bullocks spoken of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+16:2,2Ch+30:24.35:8,9">Deut. xvi. 2; 
 2 Chron. xxx. 24; xxxv. 8, 9</A>.

 These they were to eat of, and therefore would not go into the court,
 for fear of touching a Gentile, and thereby contracting, not a legal, 
 but only a traditional pollution. This they scrupled, but made no 
 scruple of breaking through all the laws of equity to persecute Christ 
 to the death. <I>They strained at a gnat, and swallowed a camel.</I> 
 Let us now see what passed at <I>the judgment-hall.</I> Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Pilate's conference with the prosecutors. They were called first, 
 and stated what they had to say against the prisoner, as was very fit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:29-32"><I>v.</I> 29-32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The judge calls for the indictment. Because they would not come into 
 the hall, <I>he went out to them</I> into the court before the house, 
 to talk with them. Looking upon Pilate as a magistrate, that we may 
 give every one his due, here are three things commendable in him:--

 (1.) His diligent and close application to business. If it had been 
 upon a good occasion, it had been very well that he was willing to be 
 called up early to the judgment-seat. Men in public trusts must not 
 love their ease. 

 (2.) His condescending to the humour of the people, and receding from 
 the honour of his place to gratify their scruples. He might have said, 
 "If they be so nice as not to come in to me, let them go home as they 
 came;" by the same rule as we might say, "If the complainant scruple to 
 take off his hat to the magistrate, let not his complaint be heard;" 
 but Pilate insists not upon it, bears with them, and goes out to them; 
 for, when it is for good, we should <I>become all things to all 
 men.</I> 

 (3.) His adherence to the rule of justice, in demanding the accusation, 
 suspecting the prosecution to be malicious: "<I>What accusation bring 
 you against this man?</I>" What is the crime you charge him with, and 
 what proof have you of it? It was a law of nature, before Valerius 
 Publicola made it a Roman law, <I>Ne quis indicta causa condemnetur--No 
 man should be condemned unheard.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:16,17">Acts xxv. 16, 17</A>.

 It is unreasonable to commit a man, without alleging some cause in the
 warrant, and much more to arraign a man when there is no bill of 
 indictment found against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The prosecutors demand judgment against him upon a general surmise 
 that he was a criminal, not alleging, much less proving, any thing in 
 particular <I>worthy of death or of bonds</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>If he were not a malefactor,</I> or evildoer, <I>we would not have 
 delivered him to thee</I> to be condemned. This bespeaks them, 

 (1.) Very rude and uncivil to Pilate, a company of ill-natured men, 
 that affected to despise dominion. When Pilate was so complaisant to 
 them as to come out to treat with them, yet they were to the highest 
 degree out of humour with him. He put the most reasonable question to 
 them that could be; but, if it had been the most absurd, they could not 
 have answered him with more disdain. 

 (2.) Very spiteful and malicious towards our Lord Jesus: right or 
 wrong, they will have him to be a malefactor, and treated as one. We 
 are to presume a man innocent till he is proved guilty, but they will 
 presume him guilty who could prove himself innocent. They cannot say, 
 "He is a traitor, a murderer, a felon, a breaker of the peace," but 
 they say, "He is an evil-doer." He an evil-doer who <I>went about doing 
 good!</I> Let those be called whom he had cured, and fed, and taught; 
 whom he has rescued from devils, and raised from death; and let them be 
 asked whether he be an evil-doer or no. Note, It is no new thing for 
 the best of benefactors to be branded and run down as the worst of 
 malefactors. 

 (3.) Very proud and conceited of themselves, and their own judgment and 
 justice, as if their delivering a man up, under the general character 
 of a malefactor, were sufficient for the civil magistrate to ground a 
 judicial sentence upon, than which what could be more haughty?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The judge remands him to their own court 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "<I>Take you him, and judge him according to your</I> own <I>law,</I> 
 and do not trouble me with him." Now, 

 (1.) Some think Pilate herein complimented them, acknowledging the 
 remains of their power, and allowing them to exert it. Corporal 
 punishment they might inflict, as <I>scourging in their synagogues;</I> 
 whether capital or no is uncertain. "But," saith Pilate, "go as far as 
 your law will allow you, and, if you go further, it shall be connived 
 at." This he said, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, but unwilling to 
 do them the service they required. 

 (2.) Others think he bantered them, and upbraided them with their 
 present state of weakness and subjection. They would be the sole
 judges of the guilt. "Pray," saith Pilate, "if you will be so, go on as 
 you have begun; you have found him guilty by your own law, condemn him, 
 if you dare, by your own law, to carry on the humour." Nothing is more 
 absurd, nor more deserves to be exposed, than for those to pretend to 
 dictate, and boast of their wisdom, who are weak and in subordinate 
 stations, and whose lot it is to be dictated to. Some think Pilate here 
 reflects upon the law of Moses, as if it allowed them what the Roman 
 law would by no means allow--the judging of a man unheard. "It may be 
 your law will suffer such a thing, but ours will not." Thus, through 
 their corruptions, the law of God was blasphemed; and so is his gospel 
 too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They disown any authority as judges, and (since it must be so) are 
 content to be prosecutors. They now grow less insolent and more 
 submissive, and own, "<I>It is not lawful for us to put any man to 
 death,</I> whatever less punishment we may inflict, and this is a 
 malefactor whom we would have the blood of."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Some think they had lost their power to give judgment in matters 
 of life and death only by their own carelessness, and cowardly yielding 
 to the darling iniquities of the age; so Dr. Lightfoot <B><I>ouk 
 exesti</I></B>--<I>It is not</I> in our power to pass sentence of death 
 upon <I>any,</I> if we do, we shall have the mob about us 
 immediately.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Others think their power was taken from them by the Romans, 
 because they had not used it well, or because it was thought too great 
 a trust to be lodged in the hands of a conquered and yet an unsubdued 
 people. Their acknowledgement of this they designed for a compliment to 
 Pilate, and to atone for their rudeness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 but it amounts to a full evidence that <I>the sceptre was departed from
 Judah,</I> and therefore that now the Messiah was come, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>.

 If the Jews have no power <I>to put any man to death,</I> where is the 
 sceptre? Yet they ask not, <I>Where is the Shiloh?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) However, there was a providence in it, that either they should
 have not power to put any man to death, or should decline the exercise 
 of it upon this occasion, <I>That the saying of Jesus might be 
 fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 Observe,

 [1.] In general, that even those who designed the defeating of Christ's
 sayings were, beyond their intention, made serviceable to the 
 fulfilling of them by an overruling hand of God. <I>No word of Christ
 shall fall to the ground;</I> he can never either deceive or be 
 deceived. Even <I>the chief priests,</I> while they persecuted him as 
 <I>a deceiver,</I> had their spirit so directed as to help to prove him 
 true, when we should think that by taking other measures they might 
 have defeated his predictions. <I>Howbeit, they meant not so,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7">Isa. x. 7</A>.

 [2.] Those sayings of Christ in particular were fulfilled which he had
 spoken concerning his own death. Two sayings of Christ concerning his 
 death were fulfilled, by the Jews declining to <I>judge him according 
 to their law. First,</I> He had said that he should be <I>delivered to 
 the Gentiles,</I> and that <I>they should put him to death</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:19,Mk+10:33,Lu+18:32,33">Matt. xx. 19;
 Mark x. 33; Luke xviii. 32, 33</A>),

 and hereby that saying was fulfilled. <I>Secondly,</I> He had said
 that he should be crucified 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:19,26:2">Matt. xx. 19; xxvi. 2</A>),
 
 <I>lifted up,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:14,12:32"><I>ch.</I> iii. 14; xii. 32</A>.

 Now, if they had <I>judged him by their law,</I> he had been stoned;
 burning, strangling, and beheading, were in some cases used among the 
 Jews, but never crucifying. It was therefore necessary that Christ 
 should be put to death by the Romans, that, being <I>hanged upon a 
 tree,</I> he might be <I>made a curse for us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:13">Gal. iii. 13</A>),

 and <I>his hands and feet</I> might be <I>pierced.</I> As the Roman 
 power had brought him to be born at Bethlehem, so now to die upon a 
 cross, and both according to the scriptures. It is likewise determined 
 concerning us, though not discovered to us, <I>what death we shall 
 die,</I> which should free us from all disquieting cares about that 
 matter. "Lord, what, and when, and how thou hast appointed."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is Pilate's conference with the prisoner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>,

 &c., where we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The prisoner set to the bar. Pilate, after he had conferred with the 
 chief priests at his door, entered into the hall, and called for Jesus 
 to be brought in. He would not examine him in the crowd, where he might 
 be disturbed by the noise, but ordered him to be brought <I>into the 
 hall;</I> for he made no difficulty of going in among the Gentiles. We 
 by sin were become liable to the judgment of God, and were to be 
 brought before his bar; therefore <I>Christ, being made sin and a curse 
 for us,</I> was arraigned as a criminal. Pilate entered into judgment 
 with him, that God might not enter into judgment with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His examination. The other evangelists tell us that his accusers had 
 laid it to his charge that <I>he perverted the nation, forbidding to 
 give tribute to C&aelig;sar,</I> and upon this he is examined.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is a question put to him, with a design to ensnare him and to 
 find out something upon which to ground an accusation: "<I>Art thou the 
 king of the Jews?</I> <B><I>ho basileus</I></B> --<I>that king of the 
 Jews</I> who has been so much talked of and so long expected--Messiah 
 the prince, art thou he? Dost thou pretend to be he? Dost thou call 
 thyself, and wouldest thou be thought so?" For he was far from 
 imagining that really he was so, or making a question of that. Some 
 think Pilate asked this with an air of scorn and contempt: "What! 
 <I>art thou a king,</I> who makest so mean a figure? <I>Art thou the 
 king of the Jews,</I> by whom thou art thus hated and persecuted? 
 <I>Art thou king de jure--of right,</I> while the emperor is only king 
 <I>de facto--in fact?</I>" Since it could not be proved he ever said 
 it, he would constrain him to say it now, that he might proceed upon 
 his own confession.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ answers this question with another; not for evasion, but as 
 an intimation to Pilate to consider what he did, and upon what grounds 
 he went 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 "<I>Sayest thou this thing of thyself,</I> from a suspicion arising in 
 thy own breast, <I>or did others tell it thee of me,</I> and dost thou 
 ask it only to oblige them?" 

 [1.] "It is plain that thou hast no reason to <I>say this of 
 thyself.</I>" Pilate was bound by his office to take care of the 
 interests of the Roman government, but he could not say that this was 
 in any danger, or suffered any damage, from any thing our Lord Jesus 
 had ever said or done. He never appeared in worldly pomp, never assumed 
 any secular power, never acted as a judge or divider; never were any 
 traitorous principles or practices objected to him, nor any thing that 
 might give the least shadow of suspicion. 

 [2.] "If others <I>tell it thee of me,</I> to incense thee against me, 
 thou oughtest to consider who they are, and upon what principles they 
 go, and whether those who represent me as an <I>enemy to 
 C&aelig;sar</I> are not really such themselves, and therefore use this 
 only as a pretence to cover their malice, for, if so, the matter ought 
 to be well weighed by a judge that would do justice." Nay, if Pilate 
 had been as inquisitive as he ought to have been in this matter, he 
 would have found that the true reason why the chief priests were 
 outrageous against Jesus was because he did not set up a temporal 
 kingdom in opposition to the Roman power; if he would have done this, 
 and would have wrought miracles to bring the Jews out of the Roman 
 bondage, as Moses did to bring them out of the Egyptian, they would 
 have been so far from siding with the Romans against him that they 
 would have made him their king, and have fought under him against the 
 Romans; but, not answering this expectation of theirs, they charged 
 that upon him of which they were themselves most notoriously 
 guilty-disaffection to and design against the present government; and 
 was such an information as this fit to be countenanced?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Pilate resents Christ's answer, and takes it very ill, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 This is a direct answer to Christ's question,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 [1.] Christ had asked him whether he spoke of himself. "No," says he; 
 "<I>am I a Jew,</I> that thou suspectest me to be in the plot against 
 thee? I know nothing of the Messiah, nor desire to know, and therefore 
 interest not myself in the dispute who is the Messiah and who not; the 
 dispute who is the Messiah and who not; it is all alike to me." Observe 
 with what disdain Pilate asks, <I>Am I a Jew?</I> The Jews were, upon 
 many accounts, an honourable people; but, having corrupted the covenant 
 of their God, <I>he made them contemptible and base before all the 
 people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:8,9">Mal. ii. 8, 9</A>),

 so that a man of sense and honour reckoned it a scandal to be counted a 
 Jew. Thus good names often suffer for the sake of the bad men that wear 
 them. It is sad that when a Turk is suspected of dishonesty he should 
 ask, "What! do you take me for a Christian?" 

 [2.] Christ had asked him whether others told him. "Yes," says he, "and 
 those <I>thine own people,</I> who, one would think would be biased in 
 favour of thee, and <I>the priests,</I> whose testimony, <I>in verbum 
 sacerdotis--on the word of a priest,</I> ought to be regarded; and 
 therefore I have nothing to do but to proceed upon their information." 
 Thus Christ, in his religion, still suffers by those that are of his 
 own nation, even the priests, that profess relation to him, but do not 
 live up to their profession. 

 [3.] Christ had declined answering that question, <I>Art thou the king 
 of the Jews?</I> And therefore Pilate puts another question to him more 
 general, "<I>What hast thou done?</I> What provocation hast thou given 
 to thy own nation, and particularly the priests, to be so violent 
 against thee? Surely there cannot be all this smoke without some fire, 
 what is it?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Christ, in his next reply, gives a more full and direct answer to 
 Pilate's former question, <I>Art thou a king?</I> explaining in what 
 sense he was a king, but not such a king as was any ways dangerous to 
 the Roman government, not a secular king, for his interest was not 
 supported by secular methods, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] An account of the nature and constitution of Christ's kingdom: It 
 <I>is not of this world.</I> It is expressed negatively to rectify the 
 present mistakes concerning it; but the positive is implied, it is 
 <I>the kingdom of heaven,</I> and belongs to another world. Christ is a 
 king, and has a kingdom, but <I>not of this world. First</I> Its rise 
 is not from this world; the kingdoms of men arise <I>out of the sea and 
 the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:3,Re+13:1,11">Dan. vii. 3; Rev. xiii. 1, 11</A>);
 
 but <I>the holy city comes from God out of heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:2">Rev. xxii. 2</A>.

 His kingdom is not by succession, election, or conquest, but by the 
 immediate and special designation of the divine will and counsel. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Its nature is not worldly; it is a kingdom within men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:21">Luke xvi. 21</A>),

 set up in their hearts and consciences 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:17">Rom. xiv. 17</A>),

 its riches spiritual, its powers spiritual, and <I>all its glory 
 within.</I> The ministers of state in Christ's kingdom have not <I>the 
 spirit of the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:12">1 Cor. ii. 12</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> Its guards and supports are not worldly; its weapons
 are spiritual. It neither needed nor used secular force to maintain and 
 advance it, nor was it carried on in a way <I>hurtful to kings or 
 provinces;</I> it did not in the least interfere with the prerogatives 
 of princes nor the property of their subjects; it tended not to alter 
 any national establishment in secular things, nor opposed any kingdom 
 but that of sin and Satan. <I>Fourthly,</I> Its tendency and design
 are not worldly. Christ neither aimed nor would allow his disciples to 
 aim at the pomp and power of <I>the great men of the earth. 
 Fifthly,</I> Its subjects, though they are in the world, yet <I>are not 
 of the world;</I> they <I>are called and chosen out of the world,</I> 
 are born from, and bound for, another world; they are neither the 
 world's pupils nor its darlings, neither governed by its wisdom nor 
 enriched with its wealth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] An evidence of the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom produced. 
 If he had designed an opposition to the government, he would have 
 fought them at their own weapons, and would have repelled force with 
 force of the same nature; but he did not take this course: <I>If my 
 kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should 
 not be delivered to the Jews,</I> and my kingdom be ruined by them. 
 But, <I>First,</I> His followers did not offer to fight; there was no 
 uproar, no attempt to rescue him, though the town was now full of 
 Galileans, his friends and countrymen, and they were generally armed; 
 but the peaceable behaviour of his disciples on this occasion was 
 enough <I>to put to silence the ignorance of foolish men. Secondly,</I> 
 He did not order them to fight; nay, he forbade them, which was an 
 evidence both that he did not depend upon worldly aids (for he could 
 have summoned <I>legions of angels</I> into his service, which showed 
 that his <I>kingdom was from above</I>), and also that he did not dread 
 worldly opposition, for he was very willing to be <I>delivered to the 
 Jews,</I> as knowing that what would have been the destruction of any 
 worldly kingdom would be the advancement and establishment of his; 
 justly therefore does he conclude, <I>Now</I> you may see <I>my kingdom 
 is not from hence;</I> in the world but not of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) In answer to Pilate's further query, he replies yet more directly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>,
 
 where we have, 

 [1.] Pilate's plain question: "<I>Art thou a king then?</I> Thou 
 speakest of a kingdom thou hast; art thou then, in any sense, a king? 
 And what colour hast thou for such a claim? Explain thyself." 

 [2.] The good confession which our Lord Jesus witnessed before Pontius 
 Pilate, in answer to this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:13">1 Tim. vi. 13</A>):

 <I>Thou sayest that I am a king,</I> that is, It is as thou sayest, I 
 am a king; for <I>I came to bear witness of the truth. First,</I> He 
 grants himself to be a king, though not in the sense that Pilate meant. 
 The Messiah was expected under the character of a king, <I>Messiah the 
 prince;</I> and therefore, having owned to Caiaphas that he was the 
 Christ, he would not disown to Pilate that he was king, lest he should 
 seem inconsistent with himself. Note, Though Christ <I>took upon him 
 the form of a servant,</I> yet even then he justly claimed the honour 
 and authority of a king. <I>Secondly,</I> He explains himself, and 
 shows how he is a king, as <I>he came to bear witness of the truth;</I> 
 he rules in the minds of men by the power of truth. If he had meant to 
 declare himself a temporal prince, he would have said, <I>For this end 
 was I born, and for this cause came I into the world,</I> to rule the 
 nations, to conquer kings, and to take possession of kingdoms; no, 
 <I>he came to be a witness,</I> a witness for the God that made the 
 world, and against sin that ruins the world, and by this <I>word of his 
 testimony</I> he sets up, and keeps up, his kingdom. It was foretold 
 that he should be <I>a witness to the people,</I> and, as such, <I>a 
 leader and commander to the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:4">Isa. lv. 4</A>.

 Christ's kingdom was not of this world, in which <I>truth faileth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:15">Isa. lix. 15</A>,

 <I>Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare--He that cannot dissemble 
 knows not how to reign</I>), but of that world in which truth reigns 
 eternally. Christ's errand into the world, and his business in the
 world, were <I>to bear witness to the truth.</I> 

 1. To reveal it, to discover to the world that which otherwise could
 not have been known concerning God and his will and <I>good-will to 
 men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18,17:26"><I>ch.</I> i. 18; xvii. 26</A>.
 
 2. To confirm it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:8">Rom. xv. 8</A>.
 
 By his miracles <I>he bore witness to the truth</I> of religion, the
 truth of divine revelation, and of God's perfections and providence,
 and the truth of his promise and covenant, <I>that all men through him
 might believe.</I> Now by doing this he is a king, and sets up a
 kingdom. 

 (1.) The foundation and power, the spirit and genius, of Christ's 
 kingdom, is truth, divine truth. When he said, <I>I am the truth,</I> 
 he said, in effect, I am a king. He conquers by the convincing evidence 
 of truth; he rules by the commanding power of truth, and <I>in his 
 majesty rides prosperously, because of truth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:4">Ps. xlv. 4</A>.
 
 It is with his truth that he shall judge the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:13">Ps. xcvi. 13</A>.

 It is the sceptre of his kingdom; he <I>draws with the cords of a
 man,</I> with truth revealed to us, and received by us in <I>the love 
 of it;</I> and thus he <I>brings thoughts into obedience.</I> He came 
 <I>a light into the world,</I> and rules as the sun by day. 

 (2.) The subjects of this kingdom are those that are <I>of the 
 truth.</I> All that by the grace of God are rescued from under the 
 power of <I>the father of lies,</I> and are disposed to receive the 
 truth and submit to the power and influence of it, will hear Christ's 
 voice, will become his subjects, and will bear faith and true 
 allegiance to him. Every one that has any real sense of true religion 
 will entertain the Christian religion, and they belong to his kingdom; 
 by the power of truth he makes them willing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:3">Ps. xc. 3</A>.

 All that are in love with truth will hear the voice of Christ, for 
 greater, better, surer, sweeter truths can nowhere be found than are 
 found in Christ, by whom <I>grace and truth came;</I> so that, by 
 <I>hearing Christ's voice,</I> we know that we are <I>of the truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:19">1 John iii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Pilate, hereupon, puts a good question to him, but does not stay 
 for an answer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 He said, <I>What is truth?</I> and <I>immediately went out 
 again.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] It is certain that this was a good question, and could not be put 
 to one that was better able to answer it. Truth is that <I>pearl of 
 great price</I> which the human understanding has a desire for and is 
 in quest of; for it cannot rest but in that which is, or at least is 
 apprehended to be, truth. When we <I>search the scriptures,</I> and 
 attend the ministry of the word, it must be with this enquiry, <I>What 
 is truth?</I> and with this prayer, <I>Lead me in thy truth, into all 
 truth.</I> But many put this question that have not patience and 
 constancy enough to persevere in their search after truth, or not 
 humility and sincerity enough to receive it when they have found it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:7">2 Tim. iii. 7</A>.

 Thus many deal with their own consciences; they ask them those needful
 questions, "What am I?" "What have I done?" but will not take time for 
 an answer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It is uncertain with what design Pilate asked this question. 
 <I>First,</I> Perhaps he spoke it as a learner, as one that began to 
 think well of Christ, and to look upon him with some respect, and 
 desired to be informed what new notions he advanced and what 
 improvements he pretended to in religion and learning. But while he 
 desired to hear some new truth from him, as Herod to see some miracle, 
 the clamour and outrage of the priests' mob at his gate obliged him 
 abruptly to let fall the discourse. <I>Secondly,</I> Some think he
 spoke it as a judge, enquiring further into the cause now brought 
 before him: "Let me into this mystery, and tell me what the truth of it 
 is, the true state of this matter." <I>Thirdly,</I> Others think he 
 spoke it as a scoffer, in a jeering way: "Thou talkest of truth; canst 
 thou tell what truth is, or give me a definition of it?" Thus he makes 
 a jest of the everlasting gospel, that great truth which the chief 
 priests hated and persecuted, and which Christ was now witnessing to 
 and suffering for; and like men of no religion, who take a pleasure in 
 bantering all religions, he ridicules both sides; and therefore Christ 
 made him no reply. <I>Answer not a fool according to his folly; cast 
 not pearls before swine.</I> But, though Christ would not tell Pilate 
 what is truth, he has told his disciples, and by them has told us, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:6"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The result of both these conferences with the prosecutors and the 
 prisoner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:38-40"><I>v.</I> 38-40</A>),
 
 in two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The judge appeared his friend, and favourable to him, for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He publicly declared him innocent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 Upon the whole matter, <I>I find in him no fault at all.</I> He 
 supposes there might be some controversy in religion between him and 
 them, wherein he was as likely to be in the right as they; but nothing 
 criminal appears against him. This solemn declaration of Christ's
 innocency was,

 [1.] For the justification and honour of the Lord Jesus. By this it 
 appears that though he was treated as the worst of malefactors he had 
 never merited such treatment. 

 [2.] For explaining the design and intention of his death, that he did 
 not die for any sin of his own, even in the judgement of the judge 
 himself, and therefore he died as a sacrifice for our sins, and that, 
 even in the judgment of the prosecutors themselves, <I>one man should 
 die for the people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:50"><I>ch.</I> xi. 50</A>.

 This is he that <I>did no violence, neither was any deceit in his
 mouth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:9">Isa. liii. 9</A>),

 who was to <I>be cut off, but not for himself,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:26">Dan. ix. 26</A>.

 [3.] For aggravating the sin of the Jews that prosecuted him with so
 much violence. If a prisoner has had a fair trial, and has been 
 acquitted by those that are proper judges of the crime, especially if 
 there be no cause to suspect them partial in his favour, he must be 
 believed innocent, and his accusers are bound to acquiesce. But our 
 Lord Jesus, though brought in not guilty, is still run down as a 
 malefactor, and his blood thirsted for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He proposed an expedient for his discharge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>You have a custom, that I should release to you a prisoner at the 
 passover;</I> shall it be this king of the Jews? He proposed this, not 
 to the chief priests (he knew they would never agree to it), but to the
 multitude; it was an appeal to the people, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:15">Matt. xxvii. 15</A>.
 
 Probably he had heard how this Jesus had been attended but the other
 day with the hosannas of the common people; he therefore looked upon 
 him to be the darling of the multitude, and the envy only of the 
 rulers, and therefore he made no doubt but they would demand the 
 release of Jesus, and this would stop the mouth of the prosecutors, and 
 all would be well. 

 [1.] He allows their custom, for which, perhaps, they had had a long 
 prescription, in honour of the passover, which was a memorial of their 
 release. But it was adding to God's words, as if he had not instituted 
 enough for the due commemoration of that deliverance, and, though an 
 act of mercy, might be injustice to the public, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:15">Prov. xvii. 15</A>.

 [2.] He offers to release Jesus to them, according to the custom. If 
 Pilate had had the honesty and courage that became a judge, he would 
 not have named an innocent person to be competitor with a notorious 
 criminal for this favour; if he <I>found no fault in him,</I> he was 
 bound in conscience to discharge him. But he was willing to trim the 
 matter, and please all sides, being governed more by worldly wisdom 
 than by the rules of equity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The people appeared his enemies, and implacable against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):
 
 <I>They cried all again</I> and again, <I>Not this man,</I> let not him 
 be released, <I>but Barabbas.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) How fierce and outrageous they were. Pilate proposed the thing to 
 them calmly, as worthy their mature consideration, but they resolved it 
 in a heat, and gave in their resolution with clamour and noise, and in 
 the utmost confusion. Note, The enemies of Christ's holy religion cry 
 it down, and so hope to run it down; witness the outcry at Ephesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:34">Acts xix. 34</A>.

 But those who think the worse of things or persons merely for their
 being thus exclaimed against have a very small share of constancy and 
 consideration. Nay, there is cause to suspect a deficiency of reason 
 and justice on that side which calls in the assistance of popular 
 tumult.

 (2.) How foolish and absurd they were, as is intimated in the short 
 account here given of the other candidate: <I>Now Barabbas was a 
 robber,</I> and therefore, 

 [1.] A breaker of the law of God; and yet he shall be spared, rather 
 than one who reproved the pride, avarice, and tyranny of the priests 
 and elders. Though Barabbas be a robber, he will not rob them of 
 Moses's seat, nor of their traditions, and then no matter. 

 [2.] He was an enemy to the public safety and personal property. The 
 clamour of the town is wont to be against robbers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:5">Job xxx. 5</A>,

 <I>Men cried after them as after a thief</I>), yet here it is for one. 
 Thus those do who prefer their sins before Christ. Sin is a robber, 
 every base lust is a robber, and yet foolishly chosen rather than 
 Christ, who would truly enrich us.</P>
