 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The constant and unwearied diligence of our Lord Jesus in his great
 work of preaching the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. His discourse with the disciples of John concerning his being the
 Messiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:2-6">ver. 2-6</A>.

 III. The honourable testimony that Christ bore to John Baptist, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:7-15">ver. 7-15</A>.

 IV. The sad account he gives of that generation in general, and of
 some particular places with reference to the success, both of John's
 ministry and of his own,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:16-24">ver. 16-24</A>.

 V. His thanksgiving to his Father for the wise and gracious method he
 had taken in revealing the great mysteries of the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:25,26">ver. 25, 26</A>.
 
 VI. His gracious call and invitation of poor sinners to come to him,
 and to be ruled, and taught, and saved by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27-30">ver. 27-30</A>.

 No Where have we more of the terror of gospel woes for warning to us,
 or of the sweetness of gospel grace for encouragement to us, than in
 this chapter, which sets before us life and death, the blessing and the 
 curse.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding
 his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach
 in their cities.
 &nbsp; 2  Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he
 sent two of his disciples,
 &nbsp; 3  And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we
 look for another?
 &nbsp; 4  Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and show John again
 those things which ye do hear and see:
 &nbsp; 5  The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers
 are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the
 poor have the gospel preached to them.
 &nbsp; 6  And blessed is <I>he,</I> whosoever shall not be offended in me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first verse of this chapter some join to the foregoing chapter, and 
 make it (not unfitly) the close of that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The ordination sermon which Christ preached to his disciples in the 
 foregoing chapter is here called his commanding them. Note, Christ's 
 commissions imply commands. Their preaching of the gospel was not only 
 permitted them, but it was enjoined them. It was not a thing
 respecting which they were left at their liberty, but <I>necessity was 
 laid upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:16">1 Cor. ix. 16</A>.

 The promises he made them are included in these commands, for the
 covenant of grace is a <I>word which he hath commanded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:8">Ps. cv. 8</A>.
 
 He <I>made an end of commanding,</I> <B><I>etelesendiatasson</I></B>.
 Note, The instructions Christ gives are full instructions. He goes 
 through with his work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When Christ had said what he had to say to his disciples, he 
 <I>departed thence.</I> It should seem they were very loth to leave 
 their Master, till <I>he departed</I> and separated himself from them; 
 as the nurse withdraws the hand, that the child may learn to go by 
 itself. Christ would now teach them how to live, and how to work, 
 without his bodily presence. It was <I>expedient for them,</I> that 
 Christ should thus go away for awhile, that they might be prepared for 
 his long departure, and that, by the help of the Spirit, their own 
 hands might be <I>sufficient for them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:7">Deut. xxxiii. 7</A>),

 and they might not be always children. We have little account of what
 they did now pursuant to their commission. They went abroad, no doubt; 
 probably into Judea (for in Galilee the gospel had been mostly preached 
 hitherto), publishing the doctrine of Christ, and working miracles in 
 his name: but still in a more immediate dependence upon him, and not 
 being long from him; and thus they were trained up, by degrees, for 
 their great work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ departed, <I>to teach and preach</I> in the cities whither he 
 sent his disciples before him to <I>work miracles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:1-8"><I>ch.</I> x. 1-8</A>),

 and so to raise people's expectations, and to make way for his
 entertainment. Thus was the <I>way of the Lord prepared;</I> John 
 prepared it by bringing people to <I>repentance,</I> but he did <I>no 
 miracles.</I> The disciples go further, they <I>work miracles</I> for 
 confirmation. Note, Repentance and faith prepare people for the 
 blessings of the kingdom of heaven, which Christ gives. Observe, When 
 Christ empowered them to <I>work miracles,</I> he employed himself in 
 <I>teaching</I> and <I>preaching,</I> as if that were the more 
 honourable of the two. That was but in order to do this. Healing the 
 sick was the <I>saving of bodies,</I> but preaching the gospel was to 
 the <I>saving of souls.</I> Christ had directed his disciples to preach

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:7"><I>ch.</I> x. 7</A>),

 yet he did not leave off preaching himself. He set them to work, not
 for his own ease, but for the ease of the country, and was not the less
 busy for employing them. How unlike are they to Christ, who yoke others
 only that they may themselves be idle! Note, the increase and multitude
 of labourers in the Lord's work should be made not an excuse for our
 negligence, but an encouragement to our diligence. The more busy others
 are, the more busy we should be, and all little enough, so much work is
 there to be done. Observe, he went to preach <I>in their cities,</I>
 which were populous places; he cast the net of the gospel where there
 were most fish to be enclosed. Wisdom cries in <I>the cities</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:21">Prov. i. 21</A>),

 <I>at the entry of the city</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:3">Prov. viii. 3</A>),

 in <I>the cities of the Jews,</I> even of them who made light of him,
 who notwithstanding had the first offer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What he preached we are not told, but it was probably to the same 
 purpose with his sermon on the mount. But here is next recorded a 
 message which John Baptist sent to Christ, and his return to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:2-6"><I>v.</I> 2-6</A>.
 
 We heard before that Jesus heard of John's sufferings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:12"><I>ch.</I> iv. 12</A>.

 Now we are told that John, in prison, hears of Christ's doings. He
 <I>heard in the prison the works of Christ;</I> and no doubt he was
 glad to hear of them, for he was a true friend of the Bridegroom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:29">John iii. 29</A>.

 Note, When one useful instrument is laid aside, God knows how to raise
 up many others in the stead of it. The work went on, though John was in 
 prison, and it added no affliction, but a great deal of consolation, to 
 his bonds. Nothing more comfortable to God's people in distress, than 
 to <I>hear of the works of Christ;</I> especially to experience them in 
 their own souls. This turns a prison into a palace. Some way or other
 Christ will convey the notices of his love to those that are in trouble 
 for conscience sake. John could not see the works of Christ, but he 
 heard of them with pleasure. And blessed are they who <I>have not 
 seen,</I> but only heard, and yet <I>have believed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now John Baptist, hearing of Christ's works, sent two of his disciples 
 to him; and what passed between them and him we have here an account 
 of. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The question they had to propose to him: <I>Art thou he that should 
 come, or do we look for another?</I> This was a serious and important 
 question; <I>Art thou the Messiah promised, or not? Art thou the 
 Christ? Tell us.</I> 

 1. It is taken for granted that the Messiah should come. It was one of
 the names by which he was known to the Old-Testament saints, <I>he that 
 cometh or shall come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:26">Ps. cxviii. 26</A>.

 He is now come, but there is another coming of his which we still 
 expect. 

 2. They intimate, that if this be not <I>he,</I> they would <I>look for 
 another.</I> Note, We must not be weary of looking for him that is to 
 come, nor ever say, we will not more expect him till we come to enjoy 
 him. Though he tarry, wait for him, for he that shall come will come, 
 though not in our time.

 3. They intimate likewise, that if they be convinced that this is he,
 they will not be sceptics, they will be satisfied, and will look <I>for
 no other.</I> 

 4. They therefore ask, <I>Art thou he?</I> John had said for his part, 
 <I>I am not the Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:20">John i. 20</A>.
 
 Now,

 (1.) Some think that John sent this question for his own satisfaction.
 It is true he had borne a noble testimony to Christ; he had declared
 him to be the <I>Son of God</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:34">John i. 34</A>),

 the Lamb of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:29">v. 29</A>),

 and he that <I>should baptize with the Holy Ghost</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 and <I>sent of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:34">John iii. 34</A>),

 which were great things. But he desired to be further and more fully 
 assured, that he was the Messiah that had been so long promised and 
 expected. Note, In matters relating to Christ and our salvation by him, 
 it is good to be sure. Christ appeared not in that external pomp and 
 power in which it was expected he should appear; his own disciples 
 stumbled at this, and perhaps John did so; Christ saw something of this 
 at the bottom of this enquiry, when he said, <I>blessed is he who shall 
 not be offended in me.</I> Note, It is hard, even for good men, to bear 
 up against vulgar errors.

 (2.) John's doubt might arise from his own present circumstances. He 
 was a prisoner, and might be tempted to think, if Jesus be indeed the 
 Messiah, whence is it that I, his friend and forerunner, am brought 
 into this trouble, and am left to be so long in it, and he never looks 
 after me, never visits me, nor sends to me, enquires not after me, does 
 nothing either to sweeten my imprisonment or hasten my enlargement? 
 Doubtless there was a good reason why our Lord Jesus did not go to John 
 in prison, lest there should seem to have been a compact between them: 
 but John construed it into a neglect, and it was perhaps a shock to his 
 faith in Christ. Note,

 [1.] Where there is true faith, yet there may be a mixture of unbelief. 
 The best are not always alike strong.

 [2.] Troubles for Christ, especially when they continue long 
 unrelieved, are such trials of faith as sometimes prove too hard to be 
 borne up against.

 [3.] The remaining unbelief of good men may sometimes, in an hour of 
 temptation, strike at the root, and call in question the most 
 fundamental truths which were thought to be well settled. <I>Will the
 Lord cast off for ever?</I> But we will hope that John's faith did not 
 fail in this matter, only he desired to have it strengthened and 
 confirmed. Note, The best saints have need of the best helps they can 
 get for the strengthening of their faith, and the arming of themselves 
 against temptations to infidelity. Abraham believed, and yet desired a 
 sign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:6,8">Gen. xv. 6, 8</A>),
 
 so did Gideon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:36">Judg. vi. 36</A>.
 
 But,

 (3.) Others think that John sent his disciples to Christ with this
 question, not so much for his own satisfaction as for theirs. Observe,
 Though he was a prisoner they adhered to him, attended on him, and were 
 ready to receive instructions from him; they loved him, and would not 
 leave him. Now,

 [1.] They were weak in knowledge, and wavering in their faith, and 
 needed instruction and confirmation; and in this matter they were 
 somewhat prejudiced; being jealous <I>for their</I> master, they were 
 jealous <I>of our</I> Master; they were loth to acknowledge Jesus to be 
 the Messiah, because he eclipsed John, and are loth to believe their 
 own master when they think he speaks against himself and them. Good men 
 are apt to have their judgments blessed by their interest. Now John 
 would have their mistakes rectified, and wished them to be as well 
 satisfied as he himself was. Note, The strong ought to consider the
 infirmities of the weak, and to do what they can to help them: and such 
 as we cannot help ourselves we should send to those that can. <I>When 
 thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</I>

 [2.] John was all along industrious to turn over his disciples to 
 Christ, as from the grammar-school to the academy. Perhaps he foresaw 
 his death approaching, and therefore would bring his disciples to be 
 better acquainted with Christ, under whose guardianship he must leave 
 them. Note, Ministers' business is to direct every body to Christ. And 
 those who would know the certainty of the doctrine of Christ, must 
 apply themselves to him, who is come to give an understanding. They who 
 would grow in grace must be inquisitive.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is Christ's answer to this question, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>.

 It was not so direct and express, as when he said, <I>I that speak unto
 thee am he;</I> but it was a real answer, an answer in fact. Christ 
 will have us to spell out the convincing evidences of gospel truths, 
 and to take pains in digging for knowledge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He points them to what they heard and saw, which they must tell 
 John, that he might from thence take occasion the more fully to 
 instruct and convince them out of their own mouths. Go and tell him 
 <I>what you hear and see.</I> Note, Our senses may and ought to be 
 appealed to in those things that are their proper objects. Therefore 
 the popish doctrine of the real presence agrees not with the truth 
 <I>as it is in Jesus;</I> for Christ refers us to the things we <I>hear 
 and see. Go and tell John,</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>What you see</I> of the <I>power of Christ's miracles;</I> you 
 see how, by the word of Jesus, <I>the blind receive their sight,</I> 
 the <I>lame walk,</I> &c. Christ's miracles were done openly, and in 
 the view of all; for they feared not the strongest and most impartial 
 scrutiny. <I>Veritas no qu&aelig;rit angulos--Truth seeks not
 concealment.</I> They are to be considered, 

 [1.] As the <I>acts of a divine power.</I> None but the God of nature 
 could thus overrule and outdo the power of nature. It is particularly 
 spoken of as God's prerogative to <I>open the eyes of the blind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:8">Ps. cxlvi. 8</A>.

 Miracles are therefore the broad seal of heaven, and the doctrine they
 are affixed to must be of God, for his power will never contradict his 
 truth; nor can it be imagined that he should set his seal to a lie; 
 however <I>lying wonders</I> may be vouched for in proof of <I>false 
 doctrines, true miracles</I> evince a divine commission; such Christ's 
 were, and they leave no room to doubt that he was sent of God, and that 
 his doctrine was his that <I>sent him.</I>

 [2.] As the <I>accomplishment of a divine prediction.</I> It was 
 foretold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:5,6">Isa. xxxv. 5, 6</A>),

 that our God should come, and that then <I>the eyes of the blind should
 be opened.</I> Now if the works of Christ agree with the words of the 
 prophet, as it is plain they do, then no doubt but this is our God whom 
 we have waited for, who shall <I>come with a recompence;</I> this is he 
 who is so much wanted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Tell him <I>what you hear</I> of the <I>preaching of his 
 gospel,</I> which accompanies his miracles. Faith, though confirmed by 
 seeing, comes by hearing. Tell him, 

 [1.] That <I>the poor preach the gospel;</I> so some read it. It proves 
 Christ's divine mission, that those whom he employed in founding his 
 kingdom were poor men, destitute of all secular advantages, who, 
 therefore, could never have carried their point, if they had not been 
 carried on by a divine power.

 [2.] That <I>the poor have the gospel preached to them.</I> Christ's 
 auditory is made up of such as the scribes and Pharisees despised, and 
 looked upon with contempt, and the <I>rabbies</I> would not instruct, 
 because they were notable to pay them. The <I>Old-Testament</I> 
 prophets were sent mostly to kings and princes, but Christ preached to 
 the <I>congregations of the poor.</I> It was foretold that the <I>poor 
 of the flock</I> should <I>wait upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:11">Zech. xi. 11</A>.

 Note, Christ's gracious condescensions and compassions to <I>the
 poor,</I> are an evidence that it was he that should bring to the world
 the tender mercies of our God. It was foretold that the <I>Son of
 David</I> should be the <I>poor man's King,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:2,4,12,13">Ps. lxxii. 2, 4, 12, 13</A>.

 Or we may understand it, not so much of the <I>poor of the world,</I>
 as the <I>poor in spirit,</I> and so that scripture is fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1">Isa. lxi. 1</A>,

 <I>He hath anointed me to preach glad tidings to the meek.</I> Note, It
 is a proof of Christ's divine mission that his doctrine is gospel 
 indeed; good news to those who are truly humbled in sorrow for their 
 sins, and truly humble in the denial of self; to them it is 
 accommodated, for whom God always declared he had mercy in store.

 [3.] That the <I>poor receive the gospel,</I> and are wrought upon by 
 it, they are evangelized, they receive and entertain the gospel, are 
 leavened by it, and delivered into it as into a mould. Note, The 
 wonderful efficacy of the gospel is a proof of its divine original. The 
 poor are <I>wrought upon</I> by it. The prophets complained of <I>the 
 poor,</I> that they <I>knew not the way of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:4">Jer. v. 4</A>.

 They could do no good upon them; but the gospel of Christ made its way
 into their untutored minds.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He pronounces a <I>blessing</I> on those that <I>were not offended 
 in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 So clear are these evidences of Christ's mission, that they who are not 
 wilfully prejudiced against him, and scandalized in him (so the word 
 is), cannot but receive his doctrine, and so be <I>blessed in him.</I> 
 Note,

 (1.) There are many things in Christ which they who are ignorant and 
 unthinking are apt to be offended at, some circumstances for the sake 
 of which they reject the substance of his gospel. The meanness of his 
 appearance, his education at Nazareth, the poverty of his life, the 
 despicableness of his followers, the slights which the great men put 
 upon him, the strictness of his doctrine, the contradiction it gives to 
 flesh and blood, and the sufferings that attend the profession of his 
 name; these are things that keep many from him, who otherwise cannot 
 but see much of God in him. Thus he is set <I>for the fall of many,</I> 
 even in Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:34">Luke ii. 34</A>),
 
 a <I>Rock of offence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:8">1 Pet. ii. 8</A>.

 (2.) They are happy who get over these offences. <I>Blessed are
 they.</I> The expression intimates, that it is a difficult thing to 
 conquer these prejudices, and a dangerous thing not to conquer them; 
 but as to those, who, notwithstanding this opposition, to believe in 
 Christ, their faith will be found so much the more, to <I>praise, and 
 honour, and glory.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
 concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A
 reed shaken with the wind?
 &nbsp; 8  But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
 raiment? behold, they that wear soft <I>clothing</I> are in kings'
 houses.
 &nbsp; 9  But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto

 messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before
 thee.
 &nbsp; 11  Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women
 there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist:
 notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is
 greater than he.
 &nbsp; 12  And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom
 of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.
 &nbsp; 13  For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the high encomium which our Lord Jesus gave of John the 
 Baptist; not only to revive his honour, but to revive his work. Some of 
 Christ's disciples might perhaps take occasion from the question John 
 sent, to reflect upon him, as weak and wavering, and inconsistent with 
 himself, to prevent which Christ gives him this character. Note, It is 
 our duty to consult the reputation of our brethren, and not only to 
 remove, but to obviate and prevent, jealousies and ill thoughts of 
 them; and we must take all occasions, especially such as discover any 
 thing of infirmity, to speak well of those who are praiseworthy, and to 
 give them that <I>fruit of their hands.</I> John the Baptist, when he 
 was upon the stage, and Christ in privacy and retirement, bore 
 testimony to Christ; and now that Christ appeared publicly, and John 
 was under a cloud, he bore testimony to John. Note, They who have a 
 confirmed interest themselves, should improve it for the helping of the 
 credit and reputation of others, whose character claims it, but whose 
 temper or present circumstances put them out of the way of it. This is 
 giving honour to whom honour is due. John had abased himself to honour 
 Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:20,30,Mt+3:11">John iii. 20, 30, <I>ch.</I> iii. 11</A>),

 had made himself nothing, that Christ might be All, and now Christ
 dignifies him with this character. Note, They who humble themselves
 shall be exalted, and those that honour Christ he will honour; those
 that confess him before men, he will confess, and sometimes <I>before
 men</I> too, even in this world. John had now <I>finished his
 testimony,</I> and now Christ commends him. Note, Christ reserves
 honour for his servants when they <I>have done their work,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:26">John xii. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now concerning this commendation of John, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That Christ spoke thus honourably of John, not in the hearing of 
 John's disciples, but <I>as they departed,</I> just after they were 
 gone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:24">Luke vii. 24</A>.

 He would not so much as seem to flatter John, nor have these praises of
 him reported to him. Note, Though we must be forward to give to all 
 their due praise for their encouragement, yet we must avoid every thing 
 that looks like flattery, or may be in danger of puffing them up. They 
 who in other things are mortified to the world, yet cannot well bear 
 their own praise. Pride is a corrupt humour, which we must not feed 
 either in others or in ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That what Christ said concerning John, was intended not only for 
 his praise, but for the people's profit, to revive the remembrance of 
 John's ministry, which had been well attended, but which was now (as 
 other such things used to be) strangely forgotten: they did for a 
 season, and but <I>for a season, rejoice in his light,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:35">John v. 35</A>.
 
 "Now, consider, <I>what went ye out into the wilderness to see?</I> Put
 this question to yourselves." 

 1. John preached <I>in the wilderness,</I> and thither people flocked
 in crowds to him, though in a <I>remote</I> place, and an 
 <I>inconvenient</I> one. If teachers be removed into corners, it is 
 better to go after them than to be without them. Now if his preaching 
 was worth taking so much pains to hear it, surely it was worth taking 
 some care to recollect it. The greater the difficulties we have broken 
 through to hear the word, the more we are concerned to profit by it. 

 2. They went out to him to see him; rather to feed their eyes with the
 unusual appearance of his person, than to feed their souls with his 
 wholesome instructions; rather for curiosity than for conscience. Note, 
 Many that attend on the word come rather to see and be seen, than to 
 learn and be taught, to have something to talk of, than to be made wise 
 to salvation. Christ puts it to them, <I>what went ye out to see?</I> 
 Note, They who attend on the word will be called to an account, what 
 their intentions and what their improvements were. We think when the 
 sermon is done, the care is over; no, then the greatest of the care 
 begins. It will shortly be asked, "What business had you such a time at 
 such an ordinance? <I>What brought you thither?</I> Was it custom or 
 company, or was it a desire to honour God and get good? <I>What have 
 you brought thence?</I> What knowledge, and grace, and comfort? <I>What 
 went you to see?</I>" Note, When we go to read and hear the word, we 
 should see that we aim right in what we do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Let us see what the commendation of John was. They know not what 
 answer to make to Christ's question; well, says Christ, "I will tell 
 you what a man John the Baptist was."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. "He was a firm, resolute man, and not <I>a reed shaken with the 
 wind; you</I> have been so in your thoughts of him, but <I>he</I> was 
 not so. He was not wavering in his principles, nor uneven in his 
 conversation; but was remarkable for his steadiness and constant 
 consistency with himself." They who are <I>weak</I> as reeds will be 
 <I>shaken</I> as reeds; but John was <I>strong in spirit,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:14">Eph. iv. 14</A>.

 When the wind of popular applause on the one hand blew fresh and fair,
 when the storm of Herod's rage on the other hand grew fierce and 
 blustering, John was still the same, the same in all weathers. The 
 testimony he had borne to Christ was not the testimony of <I>a 
 reed,</I> of a man who was of one mind to-day, and of another 
 to-morrow; it was not a weather-cock testimony; no, his constancy in it 
 is intimated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:20">John i. 20</A>);

 he <I>confessed and denied not, but confessed,</I> and stood to it
 afterwards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:28">John iii. 28</A>.

 And therefore this question sent by his disciples was not to be
 construed into any suspicion of the truth of what he had formerly said: 
 therefore the people flocked to him, because he was not as a reed. 
 Note, There is nothing lost in the long run by an unshaken resolution 
 to go on with our work, neither courting the smiles, nor fearing the 
 frowns of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was a <I>self-denying</I> man, and <I>mortified</I> to this 
 world. "Was he a man <I>clothed in soft raiment?</I> If so, you would 
 not have gone <I>into the wilderness</I> to see him, but to the 
 <I>court.</I> You went to see one that had <I>his raiment of camel's 
 hair,</I> and a <I>leathern girdle about his loins;</I> his mien and 
 habit showed that he was dead to all the pomps of the world and the 
 pleasures of sense; his clothing agreed with the <I>wilderness</I> he 
 lived in, and the doctrine he preached there, that of repentance. Now 
 you cannot think that he who was such a stranger to the pleasures of a 
 court, should be brought to change his mind by the terrors of a prison, 
 and now to question whether Jesus be the Messiah or not!" Note, they 
 who have lived a life of mortification, are least likely to be driven 
 off from their religion by persecution. He was not a man clothed in 
 <I>soft raiment;</I> such <I>there are,</I> but they are <I>in kings' 
 houses.</I> Note, It becomes people in all their appearances to be 
 consistent with their character and their situation. They who are 
 preachers must not affect to look like courtiers; nor must they whose 
 lot is cast in common dwellings, be ambitious of the soft clothing 
 which they wear who are in kings' houses. Prudence teaches us to be 
 <I>of a piece.</I> John appeared rough and unpleasant, yet they flocked 
 after him. Note, The remembrance of our former zeal in attending on the 
 word of God, should quicken us to, and in, our present work: let it not 
 be said that we have done and suffered so many things <I>in vain,</I> 
 have <I>run in vain</I> and <I>laboured in vain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His greatest commendation of all was his office and ministry, which 
 was more his honour than any personal endowments or qualifications 
 could be; and therefore this is most enlarged upon in a full 
 encomium.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He was <I>a prophet,</I> yea, and <I>more than a prophet</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 so he said of him who was the great Prophet, to whom all the prophets 
 bear witness. John said of himself, he was not <I>that prophet,</I> 
 that great prophet, the Messiah himself; and now Christ (a very 
 competent Judge) says of him, that he was <I>more than a prophet.</I> 
 He owned himself inferior to Christ, and Christ owned him superior to 
 all other prophets. Observe, The forerunner of Christ was not a king, 
 but a prophet, lest it should seem that the kingdom of the Messiah had 
 been laid in earthly power; but his immediate forerunner was, as such, 
 a <I>transcendent</I> prophet, more than an <I>Old-Testament 
 prophet;</I> they all <I>did virtuously,</I> but John excelled them 
 all; they <I>saw Christ's day</I> at a distance, and their vision was 
 yet for a great while to come; but John saw the day dawn, he saw the 
 sun rise, and told the people of the Messiah, as one that stood among 
 them. They spake of Christ, but he pointed to him; they said, <I>A 
 virgin shall conceive:</I> he said, <I>Behold the Lamb of God!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He was the same that was predicted to be Christ's forerunner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 <I>This is he of whom it is written.</I> He was prophesied of by the 
 other prophets, and therefore was greater than they. Malachi prophesied 
 concerning John, <I>Behold, I send my messenger before thy face.</I> 
 Herein some of Christ's honour was put upon him, that the 
 <I>Old-Testament</I> prophets spake and wrote of him; and this honour 
 have all the saints, that their <I>names</I> are <I>written in the 
 Lamb's book of life.</I> It was great preferment to John above all the 
 prophets, that he was Christ's harbinger. He was a <I>messenger</I> 
 sent on a great errand; a messenger, <I>one among a thousand,</I> 
 deriving his honour from his whose messenger he was: he is <I>my 
 messenger</I> sent <I>of God.</I> His business was to <I>prepare 
 Christ's way,</I> to dispose people to receive the Saviour, by 
 discovering to them their sin and misery, and their need of a Saviour.
 This he had said of himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:23">John i. 23</A>)

 and now Christ said it of him; intending hereby not only to put an
 honour upon John's ministry, but to revive people's regard to it, as 
 making way for the Messiah. Note, Much of the beauty of God's 
 dispensations lies in their mutual connection and coherence, and the 
 reference they have one to another. That which advanced John above the 
 <I>Old-Testament</I> prophets was, that he went immediately before 
 Christ. Note, The nearer any are to Christ, the more truly honourable 
 they are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) There <I>was not a greater born of women</I> than John the 
 Baptist, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Christ knew how to value persons according to the degrees of their
 worth, and he prefers John before all that went before him, before all 
 that were <I>born of women</I> by ordinary generation. Of all that God
 had raised up and called to any service in his church, John is the most 
 eminent, even beyond Moses himself; for he began to preach the gospel 
 doctrine of remission of sins to those who are truly penitent; and he 
 had more signal revelations from heaven than any of them had; for he 
 <I>saw heaven opened,</I> and the <I>Holy Ghost descend.</I> He also 
 had great success in his ministry; almost the whole nation flocked to 
 him: none rose on so great a design, or came on so noble an errand, as 
 John did, or had such claims to a welcome reception. Many had been born 
 of women that made a great figure in the world, but Christ prefers John 
 before them. Note, Greatness is not to be measured by appearances and 
 outward splendour, but they are the greatest men who are the greatest 
 saints, and the greatest blessings, who are, as John was, <I>great in 
 the sight of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:15">Luke i. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Yet this high encomium of John has a surprising limitation, 
 <I>notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is 
 greater than he.</I> 

 [1.] In the kingdom of <I>glory.</I> John was a <I>great</I> and 
 <I>good</I> man, but he was yet in a state of infirmity and 
 imperfection, and therefore came short of glorified saints, and the 
 <I>spirits of just men made perfect.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> There are 
 degrees of glory in heaven, some that are less than others there; 
 though every vessel is alike full, all are not alike large and 
 capacious. <I>Secondly,</I> The least saint in heaven is
 <I>greater,</I> and knows more, and loves more, and does more in 
 praising God, and receives more from him, than the greatest in this 
 world. The saints on earth are excellent ones

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:3">Ps. xvi. 3</A>),

 but those in heaven are much more excellent; the best in this world are
 <I>lower than the angels</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:5">Ps. viii. 5</A>),

 the least there are <I>equal with the angels,</I> which should make us
 long for that blessed state, where the <I>weak shall be as David,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:8">Zech. xii. 8</A>.

 [2.] By the <I>kingdom of heaven</I> here, is rather to be understood 
 the <I>kingdom of grace,</I> the gospel dispensation in the perfection 
 of its power and purity; and ho mikroteros--<I>he that is less</I> in 
 that is <I>greater than John.</I> Some understand it of Christ himself, 
 who was younger than John, and, in the opinion of some, less than John, 
 who always spoke diminishingly of himself; <I>I am a worm, and no 
 man,</I> yet greater than John; so it agrees with what John the Baptist 
 said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:15">John i. 15</A>),

 <I>He that cometh after me is preferred before me.</I> But it is rather
 to be understood of the apostles and ministers of the <I>New 
 Testament,</I> the evangelical prophets; and the comparison between 
 them and John is not with respect to their personal sanctity, but to 
 their office; John preached Christ coming, but they preached Christ not 
 only come, but <I>crucified</I> and <I>glorified.</I> John came to the 
 dawning of the gospel-day, and therein excelled the foregoing prophets, 
 but he was taken off before the noon of that day, before the rending of 
 the veil, before Christ's death and resurrection, and the pouring out 
 of the Spirit; so that the least of the apostles and evangelists, 
 having greater discoveries made to them, and being employed in a 
 greater embassy, is <I>greater than John.</I> John did no miracles; the 
 apostles wrought many. The ground of this preference is laid in the 
 preference of the <I>New</I>-Testament dispensation to that of the 
 <I>Old</I> Testament. Ministers of the New Testament therefore excel,
 because their ministration does so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:6">2 Cor. iii. 6</A>,

 &c. John was a <I>maximum quod sic--the greatest of his order;</I> he
 went to the utmost that the dispensation he was under would allow; but 
 <I>minimum maximi est majus maximo minimi--the least of the highest 
 order is superior to the first of the lowest;</I> a dwarf upon a 
 mountain sees further than a giant in the valley. Note, All the true 
 greatness of men is derived from, and denominated by, the gracious 
 manifestation of Christ to them. The best men are no better than he is 
 pleased to make them. What reason have we to be thankful that our lot 
 is cast in the days of the <I>kingdom of heaven,</I> under such 
 advantages of light and love! And the greater the advantages, the 
 greater will the account be, if we <I>receive the grace of God in 
 vain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The great commendation of John the Baptist was, that God owned his 
 ministry, and made it wonderfully successful for the breaking of the 
 ice, and the preparing of people for the <I>kingdom of heaven. From the 
 days of</I> the first appearing of <I>John the Baptist,</I> until now 
 (which was not much above two years), a great deal of good was done; so 
 quick was the motion when it came near to Christ the Centre; <I>The 
 kingdom of heaven suffereth violence</I>--<B><I>biazetai</I></B>-<I>vim
 patitur,</I> like the violence of an army taking a city by storm, or of 
 a crowd bursting into a house, so the <I>violent take it by force.</I> 
 The meaning of this we have in the parallel place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:16">Luke xvi. 16</A>.

 Since that time <I>the kingdom of God is preached, and every man
 presseth into it.</I> Multitudes are wrought upon by the ministry of 
 John, and become his disciples. And it is</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] An <I>improbable</I> multitude. Those strove for a place in this 
 kingdom, that one would think had no right nor title to it, and so 
 seemed to be intruders, and to make a <I>tortuous</I> entry, as our law 
 calls it, a wrongful and forcible one. When the <I>children of the
 kingdom</I> are excluded out of it, and many come into it <I>from the 
 east and the west,</I> then it <I>suffers violence.</I> Compare this 
 with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:31,32"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 31, 32</A>.

 The publicans and harlots believed John, whom the scribes and Pharisees
 rejected, and so went into the kingdom of God before them, <I>took it 
 over their heads,</I> while they trifled. Note, It is no breach of good 
 manners to go to heaven before our betters: and it is a great 
 commendation of the gospel from the days of its infancy, that it has 
 brought many to holiness that were very unlikely.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] An <I>importunate</I> multitude. This violence denotes a strength, 
 and vigour, and earnestness of desire and endeavour, in those who 
 followed John's ministry, else they would not have come so far to 
 attend upon it. It shows us also, what fervency and zeal are required 
 of all those who design to make heaven of their religion. Note, They 
 who would <I>enter into the kingdom of heaven</I> must <I>strive to 
 enter;</I> that kingdom suffers a holy violence; self must be denied, 
 the bent and bias, the frame and temper, of the mind must be altered; 
 there are hard sufferings to be undergone, a force to be put upon the 
 corrupt nature; we must run, and wrestle, and fight, and be <I>in an 
 agony,</I> and all little enough to win such a prize, and to get over 
 such opposition from without and from within. <I>The violent take it by 
 force.</I> They who will have an interest in the great salvation are 
 carried out towards it with a strong desire, will have it <I>upon any 
 terms,</I> and not think them hard, nor quit their hold without a 
 blessing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:26">Gen. xxxii. 26</A>.

 They who will make their calling and election sure must give diligence.
 The kingdom of heaven was never intended to indulge the ease of 
 triflers, but to be the rest of them that labour. It is a blessed
 sight; Oh that we could see a greater number, not with an <I>angry</I> 
 contention thrusting others out of the kingdom of heaven, but with a 
 <I>holy</I> contention thrusting themselves into it!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The ministry of John was the <I>beginning of the gospel,</I> as it 
 is reckoned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:1,Ac+1:22">Mark i. 1; Acts i. 22</A>.
 
 This is shown here in two things:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] In John the Old Testament dispensation began to die, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 So long that ministration continued in full force and virtue, but then 
 it began to decline. Though the obligation of the law of Moses was not 
 removed till Christ's death, yet the discoveries of the Old Testament 
 began to be superseded by the more clear manifestation of the 
 <I>kingdom of heaven</I> as <I>at hand.</I> Because the <I>light of the 
 gospel</I> (as that of nature) was to precede and make way for its 
 <I>law,</I> therefore the prophecies of the Old Testament came to an 
 end (<I>finis perficiens,</I> not <I>interficiens--an end of 
 completion, not of duration</I>), before the precepts of it; so that 
 when Christ says, <I>all the prophets and the law prophesied until 
 John,</I> he shows us, <I>First,</I> How the light of the Old Testament
 was set up; it was set up in <I>the law and the prophets,</I> who 
 spoke, though darkly, of Christ and his kingdom. Observe, The 
 <I>law</I> is said to prophesy, as well as the <I>prophets,</I> 
 concerning him that was to come. Christ <I>began at Moses</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:27">Luke xxiv. 27</A>);

 Christ was foretold by the dumb signs of the Mosaic work, as well as by
 the more articulate voices of the prophets, and was exhibited, not only 
 in the verbal predictions, but in the personal and real types. Blessed 
 be God that we have both the New-Testament doctrine to explain the 
 Old-Testament prophecies, and the Old-Testament prophecies to confirm 
 and illustrate the New-Testament doctrine

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:1">Heb. i. 1</A>);

 like the two cherubim, they look at each other. The law was given by
 Moses long ago, and there had been no prophets for three hundred years 
 before John, and yet they are both said to <I>prophecy until John,</I> 
 because the law was still observed, and Moses and the prophets still 
 read. Note, The scripture is teaching to this day, though the penmen of 
 it are gone. Moses and the prophets are dead; the apostles and
 evangelists are dead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:5">Zech. i. 5</A>),
 
 but the <I>word of the Lord endures for ever</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:25">1 Pet. i. 25</A>);

 the <I>scripture</I> is <I>speaking expressly,</I> though the writers 
 are silent in the dust. <I>Secondly,</I> How this light was <I>laid
 aside:</I> when he says, they <I>prophesied until John,</I> he 
 intimates, that their glory was eclipsed by the glory which excelled; 
 their predictions superseded by John's testimony, <I>Behold the Lamb of 
 God!</I> Even before the sun rises, the morning light makes candles to 
 shine dim.  Their prophecies of a Christ to come became out of date, 
 when John said, <I>He is come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] In him the New-Testament day began to dawn; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 <I>This is Elias, that was for to come.</I> John was as the loop that 
 coupled the two Testaments; as Noah was <I>Fibula utriusque mundi--the 
 link connecting both worlds,</I> so was he <I>utriusque Testamenti--the 
 link connecting both Testaments.</I> The concluding prophecy of the Old 
 Testament was, <I>Behold, I will send you Elijah,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:5,6">Mal. iv. 5, 6</A>.

 Those words prophesied until John, and then, being turned into a 
 history, they ceased to prophecy. <I>First,</I> Christ speaks of it as
 a great truth, that John the Baptist is the Elias of the New Testament; 
 not Elias <I>in propria persona--in his own person,</I> as the carnal 
 Jews expected; he denied that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:21">John i. 21</A>),

 but one that should come in the spirit and power of Elias

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:17">Luke i. 17</A>),

 like him in temper and conversation, that should press repentance with
 terrors, and especially as it is in the prophecy, that should <I>turn 
 the hearts of the fathers to the children. Secondly,</I> He speaks of
 it as a truth, which would not be easily apprehended by those whose 
 expectations fastened upon the temporal kingdom of the Messiah, and 
 introductions to it agreeable. Christ suspects the welcome of it,
 <I>if ye will receive it.</I> Not but that it was true, whether they 
 would receive it or not, but he upbraids them with their prejudices, 
 that they were backward to receive the greatest truths that were 
 opposed to their sentiments, though never so favourable to their 
 interests. Or, "If <I>you will receive him,</I> or if you will receive 
 the ministry of John as that of the promised Elias, he will be an Elias 
 to you, to turn you and prepare you for the Lord," Note, Gospel truths 
 are as they are received, a savour of life or death. Christ is a 
 Saviour, and John an Elias, to those who will receive the truth 
 concerning them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Lastly, Our Lord Jesus closes this discourse with a solemn demand of 
 attention 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear;</I> which intimates, that 
 those things were dark and hard to be understood, and therefore needed 
 attention, but of great concern and consequence, and therefore well 
 deserved it. "Let all people take notice of this, if John be the Elias 
 prophesied of, then certainly here is a great revolution on foot, the 
 Messiah's kingdom is at the door, and the world will shortly be 
 surprised into a happy change. These are things which require your 
 serious consideration, and therefore you are all concerned to hearken 
 to what I say." Note, The things of God are of great and common 
 concern: every one that has <I>ears to hear</I> any thing, is concerned 
 to hear this. It intimates, that God requires no more from us but the 
 right use and improvement of the faculties he has already given us. He 
 requires those to hear that have ears, those to use their reason that 
 have reason. Therefore people are ignorant, not because they want 
 power, but because they want will; therefore they do not hear, because, 
 like the deaf adder, they <I>stop their ears.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto
 children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,
 &nbsp; 17  And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced;
 we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.
 &nbsp; 18  For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He
 hath a devil.
 &nbsp; 19  The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say,
 Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans
 and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.
 &nbsp; 20  Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his
 mighty works were done, because they repented not:
 &nbsp; 21  Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if
 the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre
 and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and
 ashes.
 &nbsp; 22  But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
 Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.
 &nbsp; 23  And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
 brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been
 done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained
 until this day.
 &nbsp; 24  But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the
 land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

 Christ was going on in the praise of John the Baptist and his ministry, 
 but here stops on a sudden, and turns that to the reproach of those who 
 enjoyed both that, and the ministry of Christ and his apostles too, in 
 vain. As to that generation, we may observe to whom he <I>compares 
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:16-19"><I>v.</I> 16-19</A>),

 and as to the particular places he instances in, we may observe with 
 whom he <I>compares them,</I>

 I. As to that <I>generation,</I> the body of the Jewish people at that 
 time. There were many indeed that pressed into the kingdom of heaven; 
 but the generality continued in unbelief and obstinacy. John was a 
 great and good man, but the generation in which his lot was cast was as 
 barren and unprofitable as could be, and unworthy of him. Note, The 
 badness of the places where good ministers live serves for a foil to 
 their beauty. It was Noah's praise that he was <I>righteous in his 
 generation.</I> Having commended John, he condemns those who had him 
 among them, and did not profit by his ministry. Note, The more 
 praise-worthy the people are, if they slight him, and so it will be 
 found in the day of account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This our Lord Jesus here sets forth in a parable, yet speaks as if he 
 were at a loss to find out a similitude proper to represent this, 
 <I>Whereunto shall I liken this generation?</I> Note, There is not a 
 greater absurdity than that which they are guilty of who have good 
 preaching among them, and are never the better for it. It is hard to 
 say <I>what they are like.</I> The similitude is taken from some common 
 custom among the Jewish children at their play, who, as is usual with 
 children, imitated the fashions of grown people at their marriages and 
 funerals, <I>rejoicing and lamenting;</I> but being all a jest, it made 
 no impression; no more did the ministry either of John the Baptist or 
 of Christ upon that generation. He especially reflects on the scribes 
 and Pharisees, who had a proud conceit of themselves; therefore to 
 humble them he compares them to children, and their behaviour to 
 children's play.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The parable will be best explained by opening it and the illustration 
 of it together in these five observations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The God of heaven uses a variety of proper means and methods for the
 conversion and salvation of poor souls; he would <I>have all men to be 
 saved,</I> and therefore leaves no stone unturned in order to it. The 
 great thing he aims at, is the <I>melting</I> of our <I>wills</I> into 
 a compliance with the will of God, and in order to this the affecting 
 of us with the discoveries he has made of himself. Having various
 affections to be wrought upon, he uses various ways of working upon 
 them, which though differing one from another, all tend to the same 
 thing, and God is in them all carrying on the same design. In the 
 parable, this is called his <I>piping</I> to us, and his 
 <I>mourning</I> to us; he hath <I>piped to us</I> in the precious 
 promises of the gospel, proper to work upon hope, and mourned to us in 
 the dreadful threatenings of the law, proper to work upon fear, that he 
 might frighten us out of our sins and allure us to himself. He had 
 <I>piped to us</I> in gracious and merciful providences, <I>mourned to 
 us</I> in calamitous, afflicting providences, and has set the one over 
 against the other. He has taught his ministers to <I>change their 
 voice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:20">Gal. iv. 20</A>);

 sometimes to speak in thunder from <I>mount Sinai,</I> sometimes in a
 still small voice from <I>mount Sion.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the explanation of the parable is set forth the different temper of 
 John's ministry and of Christ's, who were the two great lights of that 
 generation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) On the one hand, John came <I>mourning to them, neither eating nor 
 drinking;</I> not conversing familiarly with people, nor ordinarily 
 eating in company, but alone, in his cell in the wilderness, where 
 <I>his meat was locusts and wild honey.</I> Now this, one would think, 
 should work upon them; for such an austere, mortified life as this, was 
 very agreeable to the doctrine he preached: and that minister is most 
 likely to do good, whose conversation is according to his doctrine; and 
 yet the preaching even of such a minister is not always effectual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) On the other hand, <I>the Son of man came eating and drinking,</I> 
 and so he <I>piped unto them.</I> Christ conversed familiarly with all 
 sorts of people, not affecting any peculiar strictness or austerity; he 
 was affable and easy of access, not shy of any company, was often at 
 feasts, both with Pharisees and publicans, to try if this would win 
 upon those who were not wrought upon by John's reservedness: those who 
 were not awed by John's frowns, would be allured by Christ's smiles; 
 from whom St. Paul learned to be come <I>all things to all men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:22">1 Cor. ix. 22</A>.

 Now our Lord Jesus, by his freedom, did not at all condemn John, any
 more than John did condemn him, though their deportment was so very 
 different. Note, Though we are never so clear in the goodness of our 
 own practice, yet we must not judge of others by it. There may be a 
 <I>great diversity of operations,</I> where <I>it is the same God that 
 worketh all in all</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:6">1 Cor. xii. 6</A>),

 and this <I>various manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man
 to profit withal,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Observe especially, that God's ministers are variously gifted: the
 ability and genius of some lie one way, of others, another way: some 
 are Boanerges--<I>sons of thunder;</I> others, Barnabeses--<I>sons of 
 consolation;</I> yet <I>all these worketh that one and the self-same 
 Spirit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:11">1 Cor. xii. 11</A>),

 and therefore we ought not to condemn either, but to praise both, and
 praise God for both, who thus tries various ways of dealing with 
 persons of various tempers, that sinners may be either made pliable or 
 left inexcusable, so that, whatever the issue is, God will be 
 glorified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 2. The various methods which God takes for the conversion of sinners, 
 are with many fruitless and ineffectual: "<I>Ye have not danced, ye 
 have not lamented;</I> you have not been suitably affected either with 
 the one or with the other." Particular means have, as in medicine, 
 their particular intentions, which must be answered, particular 
 impressions, which must be submitted to, in order to the success of the 
 great and general design; now if people will be neither bound by laws, 
 nor invited by promises, nor frightened by threatenings, will neither 
 be awakened by the <I>greatest</I> things, nor allured by the 
 <I>sweetest</I> things, nor startled by the most <I>terrible</I> 
 things, nor be made sensible by the <I>plainest</I> things; if they 
 will hearken to the voice neither of scripture, nor reason, nor 
 experience, nor providence, nor conscience, nor interest, what more can 
 be done? <I>The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed, the founder 
 melteth in vain; reprobate silver shall men call them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:29">Jer. vi. 29</A>.
 
 Ministers' labour is bestowed in vain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:4">Isa. xlix. 4</A>),

 and, which is a much greater loss, <I>the grace of God received in
 vain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:1">2 Cor. vi. 1</A>.

 Note, It is some comfort to faithful ministers, when they see little
 success of their labours, that it is no new thing for the best 
 preachers and the best preaching in the world to come short of the 
 desired end. <I>Who has believed our report?</I> If from <I>the blood 
 of the slain,</I> from <I>the fat of the mighty,</I> the bow of those 
 great commanders, Christ and john, returned so often empty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:22">2 Sam. i. 22</A>),

 no marvel if ours do so, and we prophecy to so little purpose upon dry
 bones.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 3. That commonly those persons who do not profit by the means of grace,
 are perverse, and reflect upon the ministers by whom they enjoy those 
 means; and because they do not get good themselves, they do all the 
 hurt they can to others, by raising and propagating prejudices against 
 the word, and the faithful preachers of it. Those who will not comply 
 with God, and walk after him, confront him, and walk contrary to him. 
 So <I>this generation</I> did; because they were resolved not to 
 believe Christ and John, and to own them, as they ought to have done, 
 for the best of men, they set themselves to abuse them, and to 
 represent them as the worst.

 (1.) As for John the Baptist, they say, <I>He has a devil.</I> They 
 imputed his strictness and reservedness to melancholy, and some kind or 
 degree of a possession of Satan. "Why should we heed him? he is a poor 
 hypochondriacal man, full of fancies, and under the power of a crazed 
 imagination." 

 (2.) As for Jesus Christ, they imputed his free and obliging 
 conversation to the more vicious habit of luxury and flesh-pleasing: 
 <I>Behold a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber.</I> No reflection could 
 be more foul and invidious; it is the charge against the rebellious son 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:20">Deut. xxi. 20</A>),

 <I>He is a glutton and a drunkard;</I> yet none could be more false and
 unjust; for Christ <I>pleased not himself</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:3">Rom. xv. 3</A>),

 nor did ever any man live such a life of self-denial, mortification,
 and contempt of the world, as Christ lived: he that was <I>undefiled, 
 and separate from sinners,</I> is here represented as in league with 
 them, and polluted by them. Note, The most unspotted innocency, and the 
 most unparalleled excellency, will not always be a fence <I>against the 
 reproach of tongues:</I> nay, a man's best gifts and best actions, 
 which are both well intended and well calculated for edification, may 
 be made the matter of his reproach. The best of our actions may become 
 the worst of our accusations, as David's fasting,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:10">Ps. lxix. 10</A>.

 It was true in some sense, that Christ was <I>a Friend to publicans and
 sinners,</I> the best Friend they ever had, for he <I>came into the 
 world to save sinners,</I> great sinners, even the chief; so he said 
 very feelingly, who had been himself not a <I>publican and sinner,</I> 
 but a Pharisee and sinner; but this is, and will be to eternity, 
 Christ's praise, and they forfeited the benefit of it who thus turned 
 it to his reproach.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 4. That the cause of this great unfruitfulness and perverseness of 
 people under the means of grace, is that they are <I>like children 
 sitting in the markets;</I> they are foolish as children, froward as 
 children, mindless and playful as children; would they but <I>show 
 themselves men</I> in understanding, there would be some hopes of them.
 <I>The market-place they sit in</I> is to some a place of idleness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:3"><I>ch.</I> xx. 3</A>);

 to others a place of worldly business 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:13">James iv. 13</A>);

 to all a place of noise or diversion; so that if you ask the reason why
 people get so little good by the means of grace, you will find it is
 because they are slothful and trifling, and do not love to take pains;
 or because their heads, and hands, and hearts are full of the world,
 the cares of which <I>choke the word,</I> and choke their souls at last

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:31,Am+8:5">
 Ezek. xxxiii. 31; Amos viii. 5</A>);

 and they study to divert their own thoughts from every thing that is
 serious. Thus <I>in the markets</I> they are, and there they 
 <I>sit;</I> in these things their hearts rest, and by them they resolve 
 to abide.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 5. Though the means of grace be thus slighted and abused by many, by
 the most, yet there is a remnant that through grace do improve them, 
 and answer the designs of them, to the glory of God, and the good of 
 their own souls. <I>But wisdom is justified of her children.</I> Christ 
 is <I>Wisdom;</I> in him <I>are hid treasures of wisdom;</I> the saints 
 are the <I>children God has given</I> him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:13">Heb. ii. 13</A>.

 The gospel is <I>wisdom,</I> it is <I>the wisdom from above:</I> true
 believers are begotten again by it, and born from above too; they are 
 wise <I>children,</I> wise for themselves, and their true interests; 
 not <I>like the foolish children that sat in the markets.</I> These 
 <I>children of wisdom justify wisdom;</I> they comply with the designs 
 of Christ's grace, answer the intentions of it, and are suitably 
 affected with, and impressed by, the various methods it takes, and so 
 evidence the wisdom of Christ in taking these methods. This is 
 explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:29">Luke vii. 29</A>.

 <I>The publicans justified God, being baptized with the baptism of
 John,</I> and afterwards embracing the gospel of Christ. Note, The 
 success of the means of grace justifies the wisdom of God in the choice 
 of these means, against those who charge him with folly therein. The 
 cure of every patient, that observes the physician's orders, justifies 
 the wisdom of the physician: and therefore Paul is <I>not ashamed of 
 the gospel of Christ,</I> because, whatever it is to others, <I>to them 
 that believe it is the power of God unto salvation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:16">Rom. i. 16</A>.

 When <I>the cross of Christ,</I> which to others is <I>foolishness</I>
 and <I>a stumbling-block,</I> is <I>to them that are called the wisdom 
 of God and the power of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:23,24">1 Cor. i. 23, 24</A>),

 so that they make the knowledge of that the summit of their ambition

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:2">1 Cor. ii. 2</A>),

 and the efficacy of that the crown of their glorying

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:14">Gal. vi. 14</A>),

 here is <I>wisdom justified of her children. Wisdom's children</I> are
 <I>wisdom's</I> witnesses in the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:10">Isa. xliii. 10</A>),

 and shall be produced as witnesses in that day, when <I>wisdom,</I>
 that is now <I>justified</I> by <I>the saints,</I> shall <I>be 
 glorified in the saints,</I> and <I>admired in all them that 
 believe,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:10">2 Thess. i. 10</A>.

 If the unbelief of some reproach Christ by giving him the lie, the
 faith of others shall honour him by setting to its seal that he is 
 true, and that <I>he also is wise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:25">1 Cor. i. 25</A>.

 Whether we do it or not, it will be done; not only God's equity, but
 his <I>wisdom, will be justified when he speaks, when he 
 judges.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Well, this is the account Christ gives of that <I>generation,</I> and 
 that <I>generation is not passed away,</I> but remains in a succession 
 of the like; for as it was then, it has been since and is still; 
 <I>some believe the things which are spoken, and some believe not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:24">Acts xxviii. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As to the particular <I>places</I> in which Christ was most 
 conversant. What he said in general of that <I>generation,</I> he 
 applied in particular to those <I>places,</I> to affect them. <I>Then 
 began he to upbraid them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He began to preach to them long before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:17"><I>ch.</I> iv. 17</A>),

 but he did not <I>begin to upbraid</I> till now. Note, Rough and
 unpleasing methods must not be taken, till gentler means have first 
 been used. Christ is not apt <I>to upbraid; he gives liberally, and 
 upbraideth not,</I> till sinners by their obstinacy extort it from him. 
 <I>Wisdom</I> first invites, but when her invitations are slighted, 
 then she <I>upbraids,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:20,24">Prov. i. 20, 24</A>.

 Those do not go in Christ's method, who begin with upbraidings. Now
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sin charged upon them; not any against the moral law, then an 
 appeal would have lain to the gospel, which would have relieved, but a 
 sin against the gospel, the remedial law, and that is impenitency: this 
 was it he upbraided them with, or reproached them for, as the most 
 shameful, ungrateful thing that could be, that <I>they repented 
 not.</I> Note, Wilful impenitency is the great damning sin of 
 multitudes that enjoy the gospel, and which (more than any other) 
 sinners will be upbraided with to eternity. The great doctrine that 
 both John the Baptist, and Christ, and the apostles preached, was 
 repentance; the great thing designed, both in the <I>piping</I> and in 
 the <I>mourning,</I> was to prevail with people to change their minds 
 and ways, to leave their sins and turn to God; and this they would not 
 be brought to. He does not say, because they <I>believed</I> not (for 
 some king of faith many of them had) that Christ was a <I>Teacher come 
 from God;</I> but because <I>they repented not:</I> their faith did not 
 prevail to the transforming of their hearts, and the reforming of their 
 lives. Christ reproved them for their other sins, that he might <I>lead 
 them to repentance;</I> but when <I>they repented not, He upbraided 
 them</I> with that, as their refusal <I>to be healed: He upbraided 
 them</I> with it, that they might upbraid themselves, and might at 
 length see the folly of it, as that which alone makes the sad case a 
 desperate one, and the wound incurable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The aggravation of the sin; they were <I>the cities in which most of 
 his mighty works were done;</I> for thereabouts his principal residence 
 had been for some time. Note, Some places enjoy the means of grace in 
 greater plenty, power, and purity, than other places. God is a free 
 agent, and acts so in all his disposals, both as the God of nature and 
 as the God of grace, common and distinguishing grace. By Christ's 
 <I>mighty works</I> they should have been prevailed with, not only to 
 receive his doctrine, but to obey his law; the curing of bodily 
 diseases should have been the healing of their souls, but it had not 
 that effect. Note, The stronger inducements we have to repent, the more 
 heinous is the impenitency and the severer will the reckoning be, for 
 Christ keeps account of the <I>mighty works done</I> among us, and of 
 the gracious works done for us too, by which also we should be <I>led 
 to repentance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:4">Rom. ii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Chorazin and Bethsaida are here instanced 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>),

 they have each of them their woe: <I>Woe unto thee, Chorazin, woe unto 
 thee, Bethsaida.</I> Christ came <I>into the world to bless us;</I> but 
 if that blessing be slighted, he has woes in reserve, and his woes are 
 of all others the most terrible. These two cities were situate upon 
 <I>the sea of Galilee,</I> the former on the east side, and the latter 
 on the west, rich and populous places; Bethsaida was lately advanced to 
 a city by Philip the tetrarch; out of it Christ took at least three of 
 his apostles: thus highly were these places favoured! Yet because they 
 <I>knew not the day of their visitation,</I> they fell under these 
 woes, which stuck so close to them, that soon after this they decayed, 
 and dwindled into mean, obscure villages. So fatally does sin ruin 
 cities, and so certainly does the word of Christ take place!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now Chorazin and Bethsaida are here compared with Tyre and Sidon, two 
 maritime cities we read much of in the Old Testament, that had been 
 brought to ruin, but began to flourish again; these cities bordered 
 upon Galilee, but were in a very ill name among the Jews for idolatry 
 and other wickedness. Christ sometimes went <I>into the coasts of Tyre 
 and Sidon</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:21"><I>ch.</I> xv. 21</A>),

 but never thither; the Jews would have taken it very heinously if he
 had; therefore Christ, to convince and humble them, here shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That Tyre and Sidon would not have been so bad as Chorazin and 
 Bethsaida. If they had had the same word preached, and the same 
 miracles wrought among them, <I>they would have repented,</I> and that 
 <I>long ago,</I> as Nineveh did, in <I>sackcloth and ashes.</I> Christ, 
 who knows the hearts of all, knew that if he had gone and lived among 
 them, and preached among them, he should have done more good there than 
 where he was; yet he continued where he was for some time, to encourage 
 his ministers to do so, though they see not the success they desire. 
 Note, Among the children of disobedience, some are more easily wrought 
 upon than others; and it is a great aggravation of the impenitency of 
 those who plentifully enjoy the means of grace, not only that there are 
 many who sit under the same means that are wrought upon, but that there 
 are many more that would have been wrought upon, if they had enjoyed 
 the same means. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:6,7">Ezek. iii. 6, 7</A>.

 Our repentance is slow and delayed, but theirs would have been speedy;
 they would have repented long ago. Ours has been slight and
 superficial; theirs would have been deep and serious, in <I>sackcloth 
 and ashes.</I> Yet we must observe, with an awful adoration of the 
 divine sovereignty, that the Tyrians and Sidonians will justly perish 
 in their sin, though, if they had had the means of grace, they would 
 have repented; for God is a <I>debtor to no man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That therefore Tyre and Sidon shall not be so miserable as 
 Chorazin and Bethsaida, but it shall be <I>more tolerable</I> for them 
 in the <I>day of judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Note, <I>First,</I> At the <I>day of judgment</I> the everlasting state
 of the children of men will, by an unerring and unalterable doom, be 
 determined; happiness or misery, and the several degrees of each.  
 Therefore it is called the <I>eternal judgment</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:2">Heb. vi. 2</A>),

 because decisive of the eternal state. <I>Secondly,</I> In that
 judgment, all the means of grace that were enjoyed in the state of 
 probation will certainly come into the account, and it will be 
 enquired, not only how bad we were, but how much better we might have 
 been, had it not been our own fault,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:3,4">Isa. v. 3, 4</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> Though the damnation of all that perish will be 
 intolerable, yet the damnation of those who had the fullest and 
 clearest discoveries made them of the power and grace of Christ, and 
 yet repented not, will be of all others the most intolerable. The 
 gospel light and sound open the faculties, and enlarge the capacities 
 of all that see and hear it, either to receive the riches of <I>divine 
 grace,</I> or (if that grace be slighted) to take in the more plentiful 
 effusions of <I>divine wrath.</I> If self-reproach be the torture of 
 hell, it must needs be hell indeed to those who had such a fair 
 opportunity of getting to heaven. <I>Son, remember that.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Capernaum is here condemned with an emphasis 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 "<I>And thou, Capernaum,</I> hold up thy hand, and hear they doom," 
 Capernaum, above all the cities of Israel, was dignified with Christ's 
 most usual residence; it was like Shiloh of old, the place which he 
 chose, to put his name there, and it fared with it as with Shiloh, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:12,14">Jer. vii. 12, 14</A>.

 Christ's miracles here were <I>daily bread,</I> and therefore, as the
 manna of old, were despised and called light bread. Many a sweet and
 comfortable lecture of grace Christ had read them to little purpose, 
 and therefore he reads them a dreadful lecture of wrath: those who will 
 not hear the former shall be made to feel the latter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Capernaum's doom,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Put absolutely; Thou <I>which art exalted to heaven shalt be 
 brought down to hell</I> Note, <I>First,</I> Those who enjoy the gospel
 in power and purity, are thereby <I>exalted to heaven;</I> they have 
 therein a great honour for the present, and a great advantage for 
 eternity; they are lifted up toward <I>heaven;</I> but if, 
 notwithstanding, they still <I>cleave to the earth,</I> they may thank 
 themselves that they are not lifted up <I>into heaven. Secondly,</I>
 Gospel advantages and advancements abused will sink sinners so much 
 lower into hell. Our external privileges will be so far from saving us, 
 that if our hearts and lives be not agreeable to them, they will but 
 inflame the reckoning: the higher the precipice is, the more fatal is 
 the fall from it: Let us <I>not therefore be high-minded, but fear;</I> 
 not slothful, but diligent. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:6,7">Job xx. 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] We have it here put in comparison with the doom of Sodom--a place
 more remarkable, both for sin and ruin, than perhaps any other; and yet 
 Christ here tells us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> That Capernaum's means would have saved Sodom. If these
 miracles had been done among the Sodomites, as bad as they were, they 
 would have repented, and <I>their city would have remained unto this 
 day</I> a monument of sparing mercy, as now it is of destroying 
 justice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:7">Jude 7</A>.

 Note, Upon true repentance through Christ, even the greatest sin shall
 be pardoned and the greatest ruin prevented, that of Sodom not
 excepted. Angels were sent to Sodom, and yet it remained not; but if
 Christ had been sent thither, it <I>would have remained;</I> how well
 is it for us, then, that the world to come is <I>put in subjection to
 Christ,</I> and <I>not to angels!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:5">Heb. ii. 5</A>.

 Lot would not have <I>seemed as one that mocked,</I> if he had wrought
 miracles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> That Sodom's ruin will therefore be less at the great
 day than Capernaum's. Sodom will have many things to answer for, but 
 not the sin of neglecting Christ, as Capernaum will. If the gospel 
 prove <I>a savour of death,</I> a killing savour, it is doubly so; it 
 is <I>of death unto death,</I> so great a death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:16">2 Cor. ii. 16</A>);

 Christ had said the same of all other places that receive not his
 ministers nor bid his gospel welcome

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:15"><I>ch.</I> x. 15</A>);

 <I>It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for that
 city.</I> We that have now the written word in our hands, the gospel 
 preached, and the gospel ordinances administered to us, and live under 
 the dispensation of the Spirit, have advantages not inferior to those 
 of Chorazin, and Bethsaida, and Capernaum, and the account in the great 
 day will be accordingly. It has therefore been justly said, that the 
 professors of this age, whether they go to heaven or hell, will be the 
 greatest debtors in either of these places; if to heaven, the greatest 
 debtors to divine mercy for those rich means that brought them thither; 
 if to hell, the greatest debtors to divine justice, for those rich 
 means that would have kept them from thence.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O
 Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these
 things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
 babes.
 &nbsp; 26  Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.
 &nbsp; 27  All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
 knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have Christ looking up to heaven, with thanksgiving 
 to his Father for the sovereignty and security of the covenant of 
 redemption; and looking around him upon this earth, with an offer to 
 all the children of men, to whom these presents shall come, of the 
 privileges and benefits of the covenant of grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ here returns thanks to God for his favour to those 
 <I>babes</I> who had the mysteries of the gospel <I>revealed to 
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>).

 <I>Jesus answered and said.</I> It is called an answer, though no other 
 words are before recorded but his own, because it is so comfortable a 
 reply to the melancholy considerations preceding, and is aptly set in 
 the balance against them. The sin and ruin of those woeful cities, no 
 doubt, was a grief to the Lord Jesus; he could not but <I>weep over</I> 
 them, as he did <I>over Jerusalem</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:41">Luke xix. 41</A>);

 with this thought therefore he refreshes himself; and to make it the
 more refreshing, he puts it into a thanksgiving; that for all this, 
 <I>there is a remnant,</I> though but <I>babes,</I> to whom the things 
 of the gospel are <I>revealed. Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall 
 he be glorious.</I> Note, We may take great encouragement in looking 
 upward to God, when round about us we see nothing but what is 
 discouraging. It is sad to see how regardless most men are of their own 
 happiness, but it is comfortable to think that the wise and faithful 
 God will, however, effectually secure the interests of his own glory. 
 <I>Jesus answered and said, I thank thee.</I> Note, Thanksgiving is a 
 proper answer to dark and disquieting thoughts, and may be an effectual 
 means to silence them. Songs of praise are sovereign cordials to 
 drooping souls, and will help to cure melancholy. When we have no
 other answer ready to the suggestions of grief and fear, we may have 
 recourse to this, <I>I thank thee, O Father;</I> let us bless God that 
 it is not worse with us than it is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now in this thanksgiving of Christ, we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The titles he gives to God; <I>O Father, Lord of heaven and 
 earth.</I> Note, 

 (1.) In all our approaches to God, by praise as well as by prayer, it 
 is good for us to eye him as a Father, and to fasten on that relation, 
 not only when we ask for the mercies we want, but when we give thanks 
 for the mercies we have received. Mercies are then doubly sweet, and 
 powerful to enlarge the heart in praise, when they are received as 
 tokens of a Father's love, and gifts of a Father's hand; <I>Giving 
 thanks to the Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:12">Col. i. 12</A>.

 It becomes children to be grateful, and to say, <I>Thank you, 
 father,</I> as readily as, <I>Pray, father.</I>

 (2.) When we come to God as a Father, we must withal remember, that he
 is <I>Lord of heaven and earth;</I> which obliges us to come to him 
 with reverence, as to the sovereign Lord of all, and yet with 
 confidence, as one able to do for us whatever we need or can desire; to 
 defend us from all evil and to supply us with all good. Christ, in
 Melchizedec, had long since <I>blessed God</I> as the Possessor, or 
 <I>Lord of heaven and earth;</I> and in all our thanksgivings for 
 mercies in the stream, we must give him the glory of the 
 all-sufficiency that is in the fountain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The thing he gives thanks for: <I>Because thou has hid these things 
 from the wise and prudent, and</I> yet <I>revealed them to babes. These 
 things;</I> he does not say what things, but means the great things of 
 the gospel, <I>the things that belong to our peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:42">Luke xix. 42</A>.

 He spoke thus emphatically of them, <I>these things,</I> because they
 were things that filled him, and should fill us: all other things are 
 as nothing to <I>these things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note 

 (1.) The great things of the everlasting gospel have been and are hid 
 from many that were <I>wise and prudent,</I> that were eminent for 
 learning and worldly policy; some of the greatest scholars and the 
 greatest statesmen have been the greatest strangers to gospel 
 mysteries. <I>The world by wisdom knew not God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:21">1 Cor. i. 21</A>.

 Nay, there is an opposition given to the gospel, by a <I>science
 falsely so called,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:20">1 Tim. vi. 20</A>.

 Those who are most expert in things sensible and secular, are commonly
 least experienced in spiritual things. Men may dive deeply into the 
 mysteries of nature and into the mysteries of state, and yet be 
 ignorant of, and mistake about, the mysteries of <I>the kingdom of 
 heaven,</I> for want of an experience of the power of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) While <I>the wise and prudent men</I> of the world are in the dark 
 about gospel mysteries, even the <I>babes in Christ</I> have the 
 sanctifying saving knowledge of them: <I>Thou hast revealed them unto 
 babes.</I> Such the disciples of Christ were; men of mean birth and 
 education; no scholars, no artists, no politicians, unlearned and 
 ignorant men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:13">Acts iv. 13</A>.

 Thus are the secrets of wisdom, which are double to that which is

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:6">Job xi. 6</A>),

 made known <I>to babes and sucklings,</I> that <I>out of their mouth
 strength</I> might be <I>ordained</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:2">Ps. viii. 2</A>),

 and God's <I>praise</I> thereby <I>perfected.</I> The learned men of
 the world were not made choice of to be the preachers of the gospel, 
 but <I>the foolish things of the world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:6,8,10">1 Cor. ii. 6, 8, 10</A>).</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) This difference between <I>the prudent</I> and the <I>babes</I> is 
 of God's own making. 

 [1.] It is he that has <I>hid these things from the wise and 
 prudent;</I> he gave them parts, and learning, and much of human 
 understanding above others, and they were proud of that, and rested in 
 it, and looked no further; and therefore God justly denies them the 
 Spirit of wisdom and revelation, and then, though they hear the sound 
 of the gospel tidings, they are to them as a <I>strange thing.</I> God 
 is not the Author of their ignorance and error, but he leaves them to 
 themselves, and their sin becomes their punishment, and the Lord is 
 righteous in it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:39,40,Ro+11:7,8,Ac+28:26,27">John xii. 39, 40;
 Rom. xi. 7, 8; Acts xxviii. 26, 27</A>.

 Had they honoured God with the wisdom and prudence they had, he would
 have given them the knowledge of these better things; but because they 
 served their lusts with them, he has <I>hid their hearts from this 
 understanding.</I>

 [2.] It is he that has <I>revealed them unto babes.</I> Things revealed 
 belong to our children 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:29">Deut. xxix. 29</A>),

 and to them he <I>gives an understanding</I> to receive these things,
 and the impressions of them. Thus <I>he resists the proud,</I> and
 <I>gives grace to the humble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:6">Jam. iv. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) This dispensation must be resolved into the divine sovereignty. 
 Christ himself referred it to that; <I>Even so, Father, for so it 
 seemed good in thy sight.</I> Christ here subscribes to the will of his 
 Father in this matter; <I>Even so.</I> Let God take what ways he 
 pleases to glorify himself, and make us of what instruments he pleases 
 for the carrying on of his own work; his grace is his own, and he may 
 give or withhold it as he pleases. We can give no reason why Peter, a 
 fisherman, should be made an apostle, and not Nicodemus, a Pharisee, 
 and a ruler of the Jews, though he also believed in Christ; but <I>so 
 it seemed good in God's sight.</I> Christ said this in the hearing of 
 his disciples, to show them that it was not for any merit of their own 
 that they were thus dignified and distinguished, but purely from God's 
 good pleasure; he made them to differ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) This way of dispensing divine grace is to be acknowledged by us, 
 as it was by our Lord Jesus, with all thankfulness. We must thank God, 
 
 [1.] That <I>these things</I> are <I>revealed;</I> the mystery hid from 
 ages and generations is manifested; that they are <I>revealed,</I> not 
 to a few, but to be published to all the world. 

 [2.] That they are <I>revealed to babes;</I> that the meek and humble 
 are beautified with this salvation; and this honour put upon those whom 
 the world pours contempt upon.

 [3.] It magnifies the mercy to them, that <I>these things</I> are 
 <I>hid from the wise and prudent:</I> distinguishing favours are the 
 most obliging. As Job adored <I>the name of the Lord</I> in <I>taking 
 away</I> as well as in <I>giving,</I> so may we in <I>hiding these 
 things from the wise and prudent,</I> as well as in <I>revealing them 
 unto babes;</I> not as it is their misery, but as it is a method by 
 which self is abased, proud thoughts brought down, all flesh silenced, 
 and divine power and wisdom made to shine the more bright. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:27,31">1 Cor. i. 27, 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ here makes a gracious offer of the benefits of the gospel to 
 all, and these are the things which are <I>revealed to babes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>,

 &c. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The solemn preface which ushers in this call or invitation, both to 
 command our attention to it, and to encourage our compliance with it. 
 That we <I>might have strong consolation,</I> in flying for refuge to 
 this <I>hope set before us,</I> Christ prefixes his authority, produces 
 his credentials; we shall see he is empowered to make this offer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things he here lays before us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His commission from the Father: <I>All things are delivered unto 
 me of my Father.</I> Christ, as God, is equal in power and glory with 
 the Father; but as Mediator he receives his power and glory from the 
 Father; has <I>all judgment committed to him.</I> He is authorized to 
 settle a new covenant between God and man, and to offer peace and 
 happiness to the apostate world, upon such terms as he should think 
 fit: he was sanctified and sealed to be the sole Plenipotentiary, to 
 concert and establish this great affair. In order to this, he has 
 <I>all power</I> both <I>in heaven and in earth,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:18"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 18</A>);

 power over all flesh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:2">John xvii. 2</A>);

 authority to execute judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:22,27">John v. 22, 27</A>.

 This encourages us to come to Christ, that he is commissioned to
 receive us, and to give us what we come for, and has <I>all things 
 delivered to him</I> for that purpose, by him who is <I>Lord of 
 all.</I> All powers, all treasures are in his hand. Observe, The Father 
 has delivered his all into the hands of the Lord Jesus; let us but 
 deliver our all into his hand and the work is done; God has made him 
 the great Referee, the blessed Daysman, to lay his hand upon us both; 
 that which we have to do is to agree to the reference, to submit to the 
 arbitration of the Lord Jesus, for the taking up of this unhappy 
 controversy, and to enter into bonds to stand to his award.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His intimacy with the Father: <I>No man knoweth the Son but the 
 Father, Neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son.</I> This gives 
 us a further satisfaction, and an abundant one. Ambassadors use to have 
 not only their commissions, which they produce, but their instructions, 
 which they reserve to themselves, to be made use of as there is 
 occasion in their negotiations; our Lord Jesus had both, not only 
 authority, but ability, for his undertaking. In transacting the great 
 business of our redemption, the Father and the Son are the parties 
 principally concerned; <I>the counsel of peace is between them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:13">Zech. vi. 13</A>.

 It must therefore be a great encouragement to us to be assured, that
 they understood one another very well in this affair; that the Father 
 knew the Son, and the Son knew the Father, and both perfectly (a mutual 
 consciousness we may call it, between the Father and the Son), so that 
 there could be no mistake in the settling of this matter; as often 
 there is among men, to the overthrow of contracts, and the breaking of 
 the measures taken, through their misunderstanding one another. The Son 
 had <I>lain in the bosom of the Father</I> from eternity; he was <I>&agrave;
 secretioribus--of the cabinet-council,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18">John i. 18</A>.

 He was <I>by him, as one brought up with him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>),

 so that <I>none knows the Father save the Son,</I> he adds, <I>and he
 to whom the Son will reveal him.</I> Note, 

 [1.] The happiness of men lies in an acquaintance with God; it <I>is 
 life eternal,</I> it is the perfection of rational beings.

 [2.] Those who would have an acquaintance with God, must apply 
 themselves to Jesus Christ; for the light of the knowledge of the glory 
 of God shines in the face of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:6">2 Cor. iv. 6</A>.

 We are obliged to Christ for all the revelation we have of God the
 Father's will and love, ever since Adam sinned; there is no comfortable 
 intercourse between a holy God and sinful man, but in and by a 
 Mediator, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:6">John xiv. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is the offer itself that is made to us, and an invitation to 
 accept of it. After so solemn a preface, we may well expect something 
 very great; and it is <I>a faithful saying,</I> and well <I>worthy of 
 all acceptation; words whereby we may be saved.</I> We are here invited 
 to Christ as our Priest, Prince, and Prophet, to be saved, and, in 
 order to that, to be ruled and taught by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We must come to Jesus Christ as our Rest, and repose ourselves in 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),
 
 <I>Come unto me all ye that labour.</I> Observe,

 [1.] The character of the persons invited; <I>all that labour, and are 
 heavy laden.</I> This is a word in season to him that is weary,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:4">Isa. l. 4</A>.

 Those who complain of the burthen of the ceremonial law, which was an
 intolerable yoke, and was made much more so by the tradition of the 
 elders

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:46">Luke xi. 46</A>),

 let them come to Christ, and they shall be made easy; he came to free
 his church from this yoke, to cancel the imposition of those carnal 
 ordinances, and to introduce a purer and more spiritual way of worship; 
 but it is rather to be understood of the burthen of sin, both the guilt 
 and the power of it. Note, All those, and those only, are invited to 
 rest in Christ, that are sensible of sin as a burthen, and groan under 
 it; that are not only convinced of the evil of sin, of their own sin, 
 but are contrite in soul for it; that are really sick of their sins, 
 weary of the service of the world and of the flesh; that see their 
 state sad and dangerous by reason of sin, and are in pain and fear 
 about it, as Ephraim

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:18-20">Jer. xxxi. 18-20</A>),
 
 the prodigal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:17">Luke xv. 17</A>),

 the publican

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:13">Luke xviii. 13</A>),

 Peter's hearers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:37">Acts ii. 37</A>),

 Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:4,6,9">Acts ix. 4, 6, 9</A>),

 the jailor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:29,30">Acts xvi. 29, 30</A>).

 This is a necessary preparative for pardon and peace. The Comforter
 must first convince 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:8">John xvi. 8</A>);
 
 I have torn and then will heal.

 [2.] The invitation itself: <I>Come unto me.</I> That glorious display
 of Christ's greatness which we had

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 as Lord of all, might frighten us from him, but see here how he holds
 out <I>the golden sceptre,</I> that we may touch the top of it and may 
 live. Note, It is the duty and interest of weary <I>and heavy laden</I> 
 sinners to <I>come to Jesus Christ.</I> Renouncing all those things 
 which stand in opposition to him, or in competition with him, we must 
 accept of him, as our Physician and Advocate, and give up ourselves to 
 his conduct and government; freely willing to be saved by him, in his 
 own way, and upon his own terms. <I>Come</I> and <I>cast that burden
 upon</I> him, under which thou art <I>heavy laden.</I> This is the 
 gospel call, <I>The Spirit saith, Come;</I> and <I>the bride saith, 
 Come; let him that is athirst come; Whoever will, let him come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The blessing promised to those that do come: <I>I will give you 
 rest.</I> Christ is our Noah, whose name signifies <I>rest,</I> for 
 <I>this same shall give us rest.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+5:29,8:9">Gen. v. 29; viii. 9</A>.

 Truly <I>rest is good</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:15">Gen. xlix. 15</A>),

 especially to those <I>that labour and are heavy laden,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:12">Eccl. v. 12</A>.

 Note, Jesus Christ will give assured rest to those weary souls, that by
 a lively faith come to him for it; <I>rest</I> from the terror of sin, 
 in a well-grounded peace of conscience; <I>rest</I> from the power of 
 sin, in a regular order of the soul, and its due government of itself; 
 a <I>rest</I> in God, and a complacency of soul, in his love.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:6,7">Ps. xi. 6, 7</A>.

 This is that <I>rest which remains for the people of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:9">Heb. iv. 9</A>),
 
 begun in grace, and perfected in glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We must come to Jesus Christ as our Ruler, and submit ourselves to 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>).

 <I>Take my yoke upon you.</I> This must go along with the former, for 
 Christ is exalted to be both a <I>Prince and a Saviour,</I> a <I>Priest 
 upon his throne.</I> The <I>rest</I> he promises is a release from the 
 drudgery of sin, not from the service of God, but an obligation to the 
 duty we owe to him. Note, Christ has a <I>yoke</I> for our necks, as 
 well as a <I>crown</I> for our heads, and this <I>yoke</I> he expects 
 we should <I>take upon</I> us and draw in. To call those who are weary 
 <I>and heavy laden,</I> to <I>take a yoke upon</I> them, looks like 
 adding <I>affliction to the afflicted;</I> but the pertinency of it 
 lies in the word <I>my:</I> "You are under a <I>yoke</I> which makes 
 you weary: shake that off and try mine, which will make you easy." 
 Servants are said to be <I>under the yoke</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:1">1 Tim. vi. 1</A>),

 and subjects,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:10">1 Kings xii. 10</A>.

 To take Christ's <I>yoke upon</I> us, is to put ourselves into the
 relation to servants and subjects to him, and then of conduct ourselves
 accordingly, in a conscientious obedience to all his commands, and a
 cheerful submission to all his disposals: it is to <I>obey the gospel
 of Christ, to yield ourselves to the Lord:</I> it is Christ's
 <I>yoke;</I> the <I>yoke</I> he has appointed; a <I>yoke</I> he has
 himself drawn in before us, for <I>he learned obedience,</I> and which
 he does by his Spirit draw in with us, for <I>he helpeth our
 infirmities,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:26">Rom. viii. 26</A>.

 A <I>yoke</I> speaks some hardship, but if the beast must draw, the
 <I>yoke</I> helps him. Christ's commands are all in our favour: we
 must take this <I>yoke upon</I> us to draw in it. We are yoked to
 work, and therefore must be diligent; we are yoked to submit, and 
 therefore must be humble and patient: we are yoked together with our 
 fellow-servants, and therefore must keep up the communion of saints: 
 and <I>the words of the wise are as goads,</I> to those who are thus 
 yoked.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this is the hardest part of our lesson, and therefore it is 
 qualified 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>).

 <I>My yoke is easy and my burden is light;</I> you need not be afraid 
 of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The <I>yoke</I> of Christ's commands is an <I>easy yoke;</I> it is 
 <B><I>chrestos</I></B>, not only <I>easy,</I> but gracious, so the word 
 signifies; it is sweet and pleasant; there is nothing in it to gall the 
 yielding neck, nothing to hurt us, but, on the contrary, must to 
 refresh us. It is a <I>yoke</I> that is lined with love. Such is the 
 nature of all Christ's commands, so reasonable in themselves, so 
 profitable to us, and all summed up in one word, and that a sweet word, 
 love. So powerful are the assistances he gives us, so suitable the 
 encouragements, and so strong the consolations, that are to be found in 
 the way of duty, that we may truly say, it is a <I>yoke</I> of 
 pleasantness. It is easy to the new nature, very <I>easy to him that 
 understandeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+14:6">Prov. xiv. 6</A>.

 It may be a little hard at first, but it is easy afterwards; the love
 of God and the hope of heaven will make it <I>easy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The <I>burden</I> of Christ's cross is a <I>light burden,</I> very 
 <I>light:</I> afflictions from Christ, which befal us as men; 
 afflictions for Christ, which befal us as Christians; the latter are 
 especially meant. This <I>burden</I> in itself is <I>not joyous, but 
 grievous;</I> yet as it is Christ's, it is <I>light.</I> Paul knew as 
 much of it as any man, and he calls it a <I>light affliction,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:17">2 Cor. iv. 17</A>.
 
 God's presence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:2">Isa. xliii. 2</A>),

 Christ's sympathy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+73:9,Da+3:25">Isa. lxxiii. 9, Dan. iii. 25</A>),

 and especially the Spirit's aids and comforts
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:5">2 Cor. i. 5</A>),

 make suffering for Christ <I>light</I> and <I>easy.</I> As afflictions
 abound, and are prolonged, consolations abound, and are prolonged too.
 Let this therefore reconcile us to the difficulties, and help us over 
 the discouragements, we may meet with, both in doing work and suffering 
 work; though we may lose <I>for</I> Christ, we shall not lose <I>by 
 him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) We must come to Jesus Christ as our Teacher, and set ourselves to 
 learn of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Christ has erected a great school, and has invited us to be his
 scholars. We must enter ourselves, associate with his scholars, and
 daily attend the instructions he gives by his word and Spirit. We must
 converse much with what he said, and have it ready to use upon all
 occasions; we must conform to what he did, and follow his steps, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:21">1 Pet. ii. 21</A>.

 Some make the following words, <I>for I am meek and lowly in heart,</I>
 to be the particular lesson we are required to learn from the example
 of Christ. We must learn of him to be <I>meek</I> and <I>lowly,</I> and
 must mortify our pride and passion, which render us so unlike to him.
 We must so <I>learn of Christ</I> as to <I>learn Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:20">Eph. iv. 20</A>),

 for he is both Teacher and Lesson, Guide and Way, and All in All.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two reasons are given why we must <I>learn of Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>I am meek and lowly in heart,</I> and therefore fit to teach 
 you.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He is <I>meek,</I> and can have <I>compassion on the
 ignorant,</I> whom others would be in a passion with. Many able 
 teachers are hot and hasty, which is a great discouragement to those 
 who are dull and slow; but Christ knows how to bear with such, and to 
 open their understandings. His carriage towards his twelve disciples 
 was a specimen of this; he was mild and gentle with them, and made the 
 best of them; though they were heedless and forgetful, he was not 
 extreme to mark their follies. <I>Secondly, He is lowly in heart.</I>
 He condescends to teach poor scholars, to teach novices; he chose 
 disciples, not from the court, nor the schools, but from the seaside.  
 He teaches the first principles, such things as are milk for babes; he 
 stoops to the meanest capacities; he taught Ephraim to go,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:3">Hos. xi. 3</A>.
 
 Who teaches like him? It is an encouragement to us to put ourselves to
 school to such a Teacher. This humility and meekness, as it qualifies
 him to be a Teacher, so it will be the best qualification of those who
 are to be taught by him; <I>for the meek will he guide in judgment,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:9">Ps. xxv. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>You shall find rest to your souls.</I> This promise is borrowed 
 from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:16">Jer. vi. 16</A>,

 for Christ delighted to express himself in the language of the 
 prophets, to show the harmony between the two Testaments. Note,
 <I>First,</I> Rest for the soul is the most desirable rest; to have the 
 soul to <I>dwell at ease. Secondly,</I> The only way, and a sure way to
 find <I>rest for our souls</I> is, to sit at Christ's feet and hear his 
 word. The way of duty is the way of rest. The <I>understanding</I> 
 finds <I>rest</I> in the <I>knowledge of</I> God and Jesus Christ, and 
 is there abundantly satisfied, finding <I>that</I> wisdom in the gospel 
 which has been sought for in vain throughout the whole creation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:12">Job xxviii. 12</A>.

 The truths Christ teaches are such as we may venture our souls upon.
 The affections find rest in the love of God and Jesus Christ, and meet 
 with that in them which gives them an abundant satisfaction; quietness 
 and assurance for ever. And those satisfactions will be perfected and 
 perpetuated in heaven, where we shall see and enjoy God immediately, 
 shall see him as he is, and enjoy him as he is ours. This rest is to be 
 had with Christ for all those who learn of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Well, this is the sum and substance of the gospel call and offer: we 
 are here told, in a few words, what the Lord Jesus requires of us, and
 it agrees with what God said of him once and again. <I>This is my 
 beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him.</I></P>
