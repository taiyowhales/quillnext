 In this chapter we have, 

 I. Christ's declining for some time to appear publicly in Judea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. His design to go up to Jerusalem at the feast of tabernacles, and
 his discourse with his kindred in Galilee concerning his going up to
 this feast,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:2-13">ver. 2-13</A>.

 III. His preaching publicly in the temple at that feast. 

 1. In the midst of the feast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>.
 
 We have his discourse with the Jews, 
 
 (1.) Concerning his doctrine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>.

 (2.) Concerning the crime of sabbath-breaking laid to his charge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:19-24">ver. 19-24</A>.

 (3.) Concerning himself, both whence he came and whither he was going, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:25-36">ver. 25-36</A>.
 
 2. On the last day of he feast.

 (1.) His gracious invitation to poor souls to come to him,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:37-39">ver. 37-39</A>.
 
 (2.) The reception that it met with. 
 
 [1.] Many of the people disputed about it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:40-44">ver. 40-44</A>.

 [2.] The chief priests would have brought him into trouble for it, but 
 were first disappointed by their officers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:45-49">ver. 45-49</A>)

 and then silenced by one of their own court,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not
 walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
 &nbsp; 2  Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
 &nbsp; 3  His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go
 into Jud&aelig;a, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou
 doest.
 &nbsp; 4  For <I>there is</I> no man <I>that</I> doeth any thing in secret, and
 he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things,
 show thyself to the world.
 &nbsp; 5  For neither did his brethren believe in him.
 &nbsp; 6  Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your
 time is alway ready.
 &nbsp; 7  The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I
 testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
 &nbsp; 8  Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast;
 for my time is not yet full come.
 &nbsp; 9  When he had said these words unto them, he abode <I>still</I> in
 Galilee.
 &nbsp; 10  But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up
 unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
 &nbsp; 11  Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is
 he?
 &nbsp; 12  And there was much murmuring among the people concerning
 him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he
 deceiveth the people.
 &nbsp; 13  Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 

 I. The reason given why Christ spent more of his time in Galilee than 
 in Judea 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>because the Jews,</I> the people in Judea and Jerusalem, sought to 
 <I>kill him,</I> for curing the impotent man on the sabbath day,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:16"><I>ch.</I> v. 16</A>.

 They thought to be the death of him, either by a popular tumult or by a
 legal prosecution, in consideration of which he kept at a distance in
 another part of the country, very much out of the lines of Jerusalem's
 communication. It is not said, He <I>durst not,</I> but, He <I>would
 not,</I> walk in Jewry; it was not through fear and cowardice that he
 declined it, but in <I>prudence,</I> because his hour was not yet come.
 Note, 

 1. Gospel light is justly <I>taken away</I> from those that endeavour 
 to extinguish it. Christ will withdraw from those that drive him from 
 them, will hide his face from those that spit in it, and justly shut up 
 his bowels from those who spurn at them. 

 2. In times of imminent peril it is not only <I>allowable,</I> but 
 <I>advisable,</I> to <I>withdraw</I> and <I>abscond</I> for our own 
 safety and preservation, and to choose the service of those places 
 which are least perilous,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:23">Matt. x. 23</A>.

 <I>Then,</I> and not till <I>then,</I> we are called to expose and lay 
 down our lives, when we cannot save them without sin. 

 3. If the providence of God casts persons of <I>merit</I> into places
 of obscurity and little note, it must not be thought strange; it was 
 the lot of our Master himself. He who was fit to have sat in the 
 highest of Moses's seats willingly walked in Galilee among the ordinary 
 sort of people. Observe, He did not sit still in Galilee, nor bury 
 himself alive there, but <I>walked;</I> he went about doing good. When 
 we cannot do <I>what</I> and <I>where</I> we <I>would,</I> we must do 
 <I>what</I> and <I>where</I> we <I>can.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The approach of the <I>feast of tabernacles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 one of the three solemnities which called for the personal attendance 
 of all the males at Jerusalem; see the institution of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:34">Lev. xxiii. 34</A>,

 &c., and the revival of it after a long disuse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:14">Neh. viii. 14</A>.

 It was intended to be both a <I>memorial</I> of the tabernacle state of
 Israel in the wilderness, and a <I>figure</I> of the tabernacle state 
 of God's spiritual Israel in this world. This feast, which was 
 instituted so many hundred years before, was still religiously 
 observed. Note, Divine institutions are never antiquated, nor go out of 
 date, by length of time: nor must wilderness mercies ever be forgotten. 
 But it is called the <I>Jews' feast,</I> because it was now shortly to 
 be <I>abolished,</I> as a mere Jewish thing, and left to them that 
 <I>served the tabernacle.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's discourse with his <I>brethren,</I> some of his kindred, 
 whether by his mother or his supposed father is not certain; but they 
 were such as pretended to have an interest in him, and therefore 
 interposed to advise him in his conduct. And observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their ambition and vain-glory in urging him to make a more public 
 appearance than he did: "<I>Depart hence,</I>" said they, "<I>and go 
 into Judea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 where thou wilt make a better figure than thou canst here."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They give two reasons for this advice: 

 [1.] That it would be an encouragement to those in and about Jerusalem 
 who had a respect for him; for, expecting his temporal kingdom, the 
 royal seat of which they concluded must be at Jerusalem, they would 
 have had the disciples <I>there</I> particularly countenanced, and 
 thought the time he spent among his Galilean disciples wasted and 
 thrown away, and his miracles turning to no account unless those at 
 Jerusalem saw them. Or, "That <I>thy disciples,</I> all of them in 
 general, who will be gathered at Jerusalem to keep the feast, may 
 <I>see thy works,</I> and not, as here, a few at one time and a few at 
 another." 

 [2.] That it would be for the advancement of his name and honour: 
 <I>There is no man that does any thing in secret</I> if he himself 
 <I>seeks to be known</I> openly. They took it for granted that Christ 
 sought to make himself known, and therefore thought it absurd for him 
 to conceal his miracles: "<I>If thou do these things,</I> if thou be so 
 well able to gain the applause of the people and the approbation of the 
 rulers by thy miracles, venture abroad, and <I>show thyself to the 
 world.</I> Supported with these credentials, thou canst not fail of 
 acceptance, and therefore it is high time to set up for an interest, 
 and to think of being <I>great.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) One would not think there was any harm in this advice, and yet the 
 evangelist noted it is an evidence of their infidelity: <I>For neither 
 did his brethren believe in him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 if they had, they would not have said this. Observe,

 [1.] It was an honour to be of the kindred of Christ, but no 
 <I>saving</I> honour; they that hear his word and keep it are the 
 kindred he values. Surely grace runs in no blood in the world, when not 
 in that of Christ's family. 

 [2.] It was a sign that Christ did not aim at any secular interest, for 
 then his kindred would have struck in with him, and he would have 
 secured them first. 

 [3.] There were those who were akin to Christ according to the flesh 
 who did believe in him (three of the twelve were <I>his brethren</I>), 
 and yet others, as nearly allied to him as they, did not believe in 
 him. Many that have the same external privileges and advantages do not 
 make the same use of them. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What was there amiss in the advice which they gave him? I answer, 
 
 [1.] It was a piece of presumption for them to prescribe to Christ, and 
 to teach him what measures to take; it was a sign that they <I>did not 
 believe him</I> able to guide them, when they did not think him 
 sufficient to guide himself. 

 [2.] They discovered a great carelessness about his safety, when they 
 would have him go to Judea, where they knew the Jews sought to kill 
 him. Those that believed in him, and loved him, dissuaded him from 
 Judea,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:8"><I>ch.</I> xi. 8</A>.

 [3.] Some think they hoped that if his miracles were wrought at
 Jerusalem the Pharisees and rulers would try them, and discover some 
 cheat in them, which would justify their unbelief. So. Dr. Whitby. 

 [4.] Perhaps they were weary of his company in Galilee (for <I>are not 
 all these that speak Galileans?</I>) and this was, in effect, a desire 
 that he would <I>depart out of their coasts.</I> 

 [5.] They causelessly insinuate that he neglected his disciples, and 
 denied them such a <I>sight of his works</I> as was necessary to the 
 support of their faith. 

 [6.] They tacitly reproach him as <I>mean-spirited,</I> that he durst 
 not enter the lists with the great men, nor trust himself upon the 
 stage of public action, which, if he had any courage and <I>greatness 
 of soul,</I> he would do, and not sneak thus and skulk in a corner; 
 thus Christ's humility, and his humiliation, and the small figure which 
 his religion has usually made in the world, have been often turned to 
 the reproach of both <I>him</I> and <I>it.</I> 

 [7.] They seem to question the truth of the miracles he wrought, in 
 saying, "<I>If thou do these things,</I> if they will bear the test of 
 a public scrutiny in the courts above, produce them there." 

 [8.] They think Christ altogether such a one as themselves, as subject 
 as they to worldly policy, and as desirous as they to <I>make a fair 
 show in the flesh;</I> whereas he sought not honour from men. 

 [9.] Self was at the bottom of all; they hoped, if he would make 
 himself as great as he might, they, being his kinsmen, should share in 
 his honour, and have respect paid them for his sake. Note, 
 <I>First,</I> Many carnal people go to public ordinances, to worship at 
 the feast, only to <I>show themselves,</I> and all their care is to 
 make a <I>good appearance,</I> to present themselves handsomely to the 
 world. <I>Secondly,</I> Many that seem to seek Christ's honour do
 really therein seek their own, and make it serve a turn for 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The prudence and humility of our Lord Jesus, which appeared in his 
 answer to the advice his brethren gave him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.

 Though there were so many base insinuations in it, he answered them 
 mildly. Note, Even that which is said without <I>reason</I> should be 
 answered without <I>passion;</I> we should learn of our Master to reply 
 with meekness even to that which is most <I>impertinent</I> and 
 <I>imperious,</I> and, where it is easy to find much amiss, to seem not 
 to see it, and wink at the affront. They expected Christ's company
 with them to the feast, perhaps hoping he would bear their charges: but 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He shows the difference between himself and them, in two 
 things:--

 [1.] His <I>time</I> was <I>set,</I> so was not <I>theirs: My time is 
 not yet come, but your time is always ready.</I> Understand it of the 
 time of his going up to the feast. It was an indifferent thing to them 
 when they went, for they had nothing of moment to do either where they 
 were, to <I>detain</I> them <I>there,</I> or where they were going, to 
 <I>hasten</I> them <I>thither;</I> but every minute of Christ's time 
 was precious, and had its own particular business allotted to it. He 
 had some work yet to do in Galilee before he left the country: in the 
 harmony of the gospels betwixt this <I>motion</I> made by his kindred 
 and his <I>going up</I> to this feast comes in the story of his sending 
 forth the seventy disciples

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:1">Luke x. 1</A>,

 &c.), which was an affair of very great consequence; his time is <I>not
 yet,</I> for that must be done first. Those who live useless lives have 
 <I>their time always ready;</I> they can go and come when they please. 
 But those whose <I>time</I> is filled up with <I>duty</I> will often 
 find themselves <I>straitened,</I> and they have <I>not yet time</I> 
 for that which others can do <I>at any time.</I> Those who are made the 
 servants of God, as all men are, and who have made themselves the 
 servants of all, as all useful men have, must not expect not covet to 
 be <I>masters of their own time.</I> The confinement of business is a 
 thousand times better than the liberty of idleness. Or, it may be meant
 of the <I>time</I> of his appearing publicly at Jerusalem; Christ, who 
 knows all men and all things, knew that the best and most proper time 
 for it would be about the <I>middle of the feast.</I> We, who are 
 ignorant and short-sighted, are apt to prescribe to him, and to think 
 he should deliver his people, and so show himself now. The present time 
 is <I>our</I> time, but he is fittest to judge, and, it may be, <I>his 
 time is not yet come;</I> his people are not yet ready for deliverance, 
 nor his enemies ripe for ruin; let us therefore wait with patience for 
 <I>his time,</I> for all he does will be most glorious in its season.
 
 [2.] His <I>life</I> was <I>sought,</I> so was not <I>theirs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 They, in <I>showing themselves</I> to the world, did not expose 
 themselves: "<I>The world cannot hate you,</I> for you are <I>of the 
 world,</I> its children, its servants, and in with its interests; and 
 no doubt the world will <I>love its own;</I>" see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:19"><I>ch.</I> xv. 19</A>.

 Unholy souls, whom the holy God <I>cannot love,</I> the world that lies
 in wickedness <I>cannot hate;</I> but Christ, in showing himself to the 
 world, laid himself open to the greatest danger; for <I>me it 
 hateth.</I> Christ was not only <I>slighted,</I> as inconsiderable in 
 the world (<I>the world knew him not),</I> but <I>hated,</I> as if he 
 had been hurtful to the world; thus ill was he requited for his love to 
 the world: reigning sin is a rooted antipathy and enmity to Christ. But 
 why did the world hate Christ? What evil had he done to it? Had he, 
 like Alexander, under colour of conquering it, laid it waste? "No, but 
 because" (saith he) "<I>I testify of it, that the works of it are 
 evil.</I>" Note, <I>First,</I> The works of an evil world are <I>evil 
 works;</I> as the tree is, so are the fruits: it is a dark world, and 
 an apostate world, and its works are works of darkness and rebellion.
 <I>Secondly,</I> Our Lord Jesus, both by himself and by his ministers, 
 did and will both discover and testify against the evil works of this 
 wicked world. <I>Thirdly,</I> It is a great uneasiness and provocation 
 to the world to be convicted of the evil of its works. It is for the 
 honour of virtue and piety that those who are impious and vicious do 
 not care for hearing of it, for their own consciences make them 
 <I>ashamed</I> of the turpitude there is <I>in</I> sin and 
 <I>afraid</I> of the punishment that follows <I>after</I> sin.
 <I>Fourthly,</I> Whatever is <I>pretended,</I> the <I>real</I> cause of 
 the world's enmity to the gospel is the testimony it bears against sin 
 and sinners. Christ's witnesses by their doctrine and conversation 
 <I>torment</I> those that dwell on the earth, and therefore are treated 
 so barbarously, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>.

 But it is better to incur the world's hatred, by testifying against its 
 wickedness, than gain its good-will by going down the stream with 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He dismisses them, with a design to stay behind for some time in
 Galilee 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 
 <I>Go you up to this feast, I go not up yet.</I>

 [1.] He allows their going to the feast, though they were carnal and 
 hypocritical in it. Note, Even those who go not to holy ordinances with 
 right affections and sincere intentions must not be hindered nor 
 discouraged from going; who knows but they may be wrought upon there?
 
 [2.] He denies them his company when they went to the feast, because 
 they were carnal and hypocritical. Those who go to ordinances for 
 ostentation, or to serve some secular purpose, go without Christ, and 
 will speed accordingly. How sad is the condition of that man, though he 
 reckon himself akin to Christ, to whom he saith, "<I>Go up</I> to such 
 an ordinance, Go pray, Go hear the word, Go receive the sacrament, but 
 <I>I go not up</I> with thee? <I>Go thou</I> and appear before God, but 
 I will not appear <I>for thee,</I>" as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:1-3">Exod. xxxiii. 1-3</A>.

 But, if the presence of Christ go not with us, to what purpose should
 we go up? <I>Go you up, I go not up.</I> When we are going to, or 
 coming from, solemn ordinances, it becomes us to be careful what 
 company we <I>have</I> and <I>choose,</I> and to avoid that which is 
 vain and carnal, lest the coal of good affections be quenched by 
 corrupt communication. <I>I go not up yet to this feast;</I> he does 
 not say, I will not go up at all, but not yet. There may be reasons for 
 deferring a particular duty, which yet must not be wholly omitted or 
 laid aside; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:6-11">Num. ix. 6-11</A>.
 
 The reason he gives is, <I>My time is not yet fully come.</I> Note, Our
 Lord Jesus is very exact and punctual in knowing and keeping his time, 
 and, as it was the time <I>fixed,</I> so it was the <I>best</I> 
 time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ's continuance in Galilee till his <I>full time</I> was come, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He, saying these things to them (<B><I>tauta de eipon</I></B>) <I>abode 
 still in Galilee;</I> because of this discourse he continued there; 
 for,

 (1.) He would not be influenced by those who advised him to seek honour 
 from men, nor go along with those who put him upon making a figure; he 
 would not seem to countenance the temptation. 

 (2.) He would not depart from his own purpose. He had said, upon a 
 clear foresight and mature deliberation, that he would not go up yet to 
 this feast, and therefore he abode still in Galilee. It becomes the 
 followers of Christ thus to be <I>steady,</I> and not to <I>use 
 lightness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. His going up to the feast when his time was come. Observe, 

 (1.) <I>When</I> he went: <I>When his brethren were gone up.</I> He 
 would not go up <I>with them,</I> lest they should make a noise and 
 disturbance, under pretence of <I>showing him to the world;</I> whereas 
 it agreed both with the prediction and with his spirit not to <I>strive 
 nor cry,</I> nor let his <I>voice be heard in the streets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:2">Isa. xlii. 2</A>.

 But he went up <I>after them.</I> We may lawfully join in the same
 religious worship with those with whom we should yet decline an 
 intimate acquaintance and converse; for the blessing of ordinances 
 depends upon the grace of God, and not upon the grace of our 
 fellow-worshippers. His carnal brethren went up <I>first,</I> and then 
 he went. Note, In the external performances of religion it is possible 
 that formal hypocrites may <I>get the start</I> of those that are 
 sincere. Many come <I>first to the temple</I> who are brought thither 
 by vain-glory, and go thence unjustified, as he,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:11">Luke xviii. 11</A>.

 It is not, Who comes <I>first?</I> that will be the question, but, Who
 comes <I>fittest?</I> If we bring our hearts <I>with us,</I> it is no 
 matter who gets <I>before us.</I>

 (2.) <I>How</I> he went, <B><I>os en krypto</I></B>--<I>a s if he were 
 hiding himself: not openly, but as it were in secret,</I> rather for 
 fear of <I>giving offence</I> than of <I>receiving injury.</I> He went 
 up to the feast, because it was an opportunity of honouring God and 
 doing good; but he went up as it were in secret, because he would not 
 provoke the government. Note, Provided the work of God be done 
 effectually, it is best done when done with <I>least noise.</I> The 
 kingdom of God need not come <I>with observation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:20">Luke xvii. 20</A>.

 We may do the work of God <I>privately,</I> and yet not do it
 <I>deceitfully.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The great expectation that there was of him among the Jews at 
 Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:11-14"><I>v.</I> 11-14</A>.

 Having formerly come up to the feasts, and signalized himself by the 
 miracles he wrought, he had made himself the subject of much discourse 
 and observation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They could not but think of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</I>

 [1.] The common people longed to see him there, that they might have 
 their curiosity gratified with the sight of his person and miracles.
 They did not think it worth while to go to him into Galilee, though if 
 they had they would not have lost their labour, but they hoped the 
 feast would bring him to Jerusalem, and then they should see him. If an 
 opportunity of acquaintance with Christ come to their door, they can 
 like it well enough. They <I>sought him at the feast.</I> When we 
 attend upon God in his holy ordinances, we should seek Christ in them, 
 seek him at the gospel feasts. Those who would <I>see</I> Christ at a 
 feast must <I>seek</I> him there. Or, 

 [2.] Perhaps it was his enemies that were thus waiting an opportunity 
 to seize him, and, if possible, to put an effectual stop to his 
 progress. They said, <I>Where is he?</I> <B><I>pou esin
 ekeinos</I></B>--<I>where is that fellow?</I> Thus scornfully and 
 contemptibly do they speak of him. When they should have welcomed the 
 feast as an opportunity of serving God, they were glad of it as an 
 opportunity of persecuting Christ. Thus Saul hoped to slay David at the 
 new moon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:27">1 Sam. xx. 27</A>.

 Those who seek <I>opportunity to sin</I> in solemn assemblies for
 religious worship profane God's ordinances to the last degree, and defy 
 him upon his own ground; it is like striking <I>within the verge of the 
 court.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The people differed much in their sentiments concerning him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>There was much murmuring,</I> or <I>muttering</I> rather, <I>among 
 the people concerning him.</I> The enmity of the rulers against Christ, 
 and their enquiries after him, caused him to be so much the more talked 
 of and observed among the people. This ground the gospel of Christ has 
 got by the opposition made to it, that it has been the more enquired 
 into, and, by being <I>every where spoken against,</I> it has come to 
 be every where <I>spoken of,</I> and by this means has been spread the 
 further, and the merits of his cause have been the more <I>searched 
 into.</I> This murmuring was not <I>against</I> Christ, but 
 <I>concerning</I> him; some murmured at the rulers, because they did 
 not countenance and encourage him: others murmured at them, because 
 they did not silence and restrain him. Some murmured that he had so 
 great an interest in Galilee; others, that he had so little interest in 
 Jerusalem. Note, Christ and his religion have been, and will be, the 
 subject of much controversy and debate,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:51,52">Luke xii. 51, 52</A>.

 If all would agree to entertain Christ as they ought, there would be 
 perfect peace; but, when some receive the light and others resolve 
 against it, there will be murmuring. The <I>bones in the valley,</I>
 while they were <I>dead</I> and <I>dry,</I> lay quiet; but when it was 
 said unto them, <I>Live,</I> there was <I>a noise</I> and <I>a 
 shaking,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:7">Ezek. xxxvii. 7</A>.

 But the noise and rencounter of liberty and business are preferable,
 surely, to the silence and agreement of a prison. Now what were the 
 sentiments of the people concerning him?

 [1.] Some said, <I>he is a good man.</I> This was a truth, but it was
 far short of being the <I>whole truth.</I> He was not only a <I>good 
 man,</I> but more than a man, he was the <I>Son of God.</I> Many who 
 have no <I>ill</I> thoughts of Christ have yet <I>low</I> thoughts of 
 him, and scarcely honour him, even when they speak well of him, because 
 they do not <I>say enough;</I> yet indeed it was his honour, and the 
 reproach of those who persecuted him, that even those who would not 
 believe him to be the Messiah could not but own he was a <I>good 
 man.</I> 

 [2.] Others said, <I>Nay, but he deceiveth the people;</I> if this had 
 been true, he had been a very bad man. The doctrine he preached was 
 sound, and could not be contested; his miracles were real, and could 
 not be disproved; his conversation was manifestly holy and good; and 
 yet it must be taken for granted, notwithstanding, that there was some 
 undiscovered cheat at the bottom, because it was the interest of the 
 chief priests to oppose him and run him down. Such murmuring as there 
 was among the Jews concerning Christ there is still among us: the 
 Socinians say, <I>He is a good man,</I> and further they say not; the 
 <I>deists</I> will not allow this, but say, <I>He deceived the 
 people.</I> Thus some depreciate him, others abuse him, but <I>great is 
 the truth.</I> 

 [3.] They were frightened by their superiors from speaking much of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>No man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</I> Either, 
 <I>First,</I> They durst not openly speak <I>well</I> of him. While
 any one was at liberty to censure and reproach him, none durst 
 vindicate him. Or, <I>Secondly,</I> They durst not speak <I>at all</I> 
 of him openly. Because nothing could justly be said <I>against</I> him, 
 they would not suffer any thing to be said <I>of</I> him. It was a 
 crime to name him. Thus many have aimed to suppress truth, under colour 
 of silencing disputes about it, and would have all talk of religion 
 hushed, in hopes thereby to bury in oblivion religion itself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the
 temple, and taught.
 &nbsp; 15  And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man
 letters, having never learned?
 &nbsp; 16  Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but
 his that sent me.
 &nbsp; 17  If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
 whether it be of God, or <I>whether</I> I speak of myself.
 &nbsp; 18  He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he
 that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no
 unrighteousness is in him.
 &nbsp; 19  Did not Moses give you the law, and <I>yet</I> none of you
 keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?
 &nbsp; 20  The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth
 about to kill thee?
 &nbsp; 21  Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and
 ye all marvel.
 &nbsp; 22  Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it
 is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day
 circumcise a man.
 &nbsp; 23  If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the
 law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I
 have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
 &nbsp; 24  Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous
 judgment.
 &nbsp; 25  Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom
 they seek to kill?
 &nbsp; 26  But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him.
 Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
 &nbsp; 27  Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ
 cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
 &nbsp; 28  Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both
 know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself,
 but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
 &nbsp; 29  But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
 &nbsp; 30  Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him,
 because his hour was not yet come.
 &nbsp; 31  And many of the people believed on him, and said, When
 Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this
 <I>man</I> hath done?
 &nbsp; 32  The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things
 concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent
 officers to take him.
 &nbsp; 33  Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you,
 and <I>then</I> I go unto him that sent me.
 &nbsp; 34  Ye shall seek me, and shall not find <I>me:</I> and where I am,
 <I>thither</I> ye cannot come.
 &nbsp; 35  Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go,
 that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among
 the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
 &nbsp; 36  What <I>manner of</I> saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek
 me, and shall not find <I>me:</I> and where I am, <I>thither</I> ye cannot
 come?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Christ's public preaching in the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 He <I>went up into the temple, and taught,</I> according to his custom 
 when he was at Jerusalem. His business was to preach the gospel of the 
 kingdom, and he did it in every place of concourse. His sermon is not 
 recorded, because, probably, it was to the same purport with the 
 sermons he had preached in Galilee, which were recorded by the other 
 evangelists. For the gospel is the same to the <I>plain</I> and to the 
 <I>polite.</I> But that which is observable here is that it was 
 <I>about the midst of the feast;</I> the fourth or fifth day of the 
 eight. Whether he did not come up to Jerusalem till the middle of the 
 feast, or whether he came up at the beginning, but kept private till 
 now, is not certain. But, <I>Query,</I> Why did he not go to the temple 
 <I>sooner,</I> to preach? <I>Answer,</I>

 1. Because the people would have more leisure to hear him, and, it 
 might be hoped, would be better disposed to hear him, when they had 
 spent some days in their booths, as they did at the feast of 
 tabernacles. 

 2. Because he would choose to appear when both his friends and his 
 enemies had done looking for him; and so give a specimen of the method 
 he would observe in his appearances, which is to come at midnight,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:6">Matt. xxv. 6</A>.

 But why did he appear thus publicly now? Surely it was to <I>shame</I>
 his persecutors, the chief priests and elders.

 (1.) By showing that, though they were very bitter against him, yet he
 did not fear them, nor their power. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7,8">Isa. l. 7, 8</A>.

 (2.) By taking their work out of their hands. Their office was to
 teach the people in the temple, and particularly at the <I>feast of 
 tabernacles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:17,18">Neh. viii. 17, 18</A>.

 But they either did not teach them at all or taught for doctrines the
 commandments of men, and therefore he goes up to the temple and teaches 
 the people. When the shepherds of Israel made a prey of the flock it 
 was time for the chief Shepherd to appear, as was promised.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:22,23,Mal+3:1">Ezek. xxxiv. 22, 23; Mal. iii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His discourse with the Jews hereupon; and the conference is 
 reducible to four heads:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning <I>his doctrine.</I> See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How the Jews <I>admired</I> it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>They marvelled,</I> saying, <I>How knoweth this man letters, having 
 never learned?</I> Observe here,

 [1.] That our Lord Jesus was not educated in the schools of the 
 prophets, or at the feet of the rabbin; not only did not travel for 
 learning, as the philosophers did, but did not make any use of the 
 schools and academies in his own country. Moses was taught the learning 
 of the Egyptians, but Christ was not taught so much as the learning of 
 the Jews; having received the Spirit <I>without measure,</I> he needed 
 not receive any knowledge <I>from man, or by man.</I> At the time of 
 Christ's appearing, learning flourished both in the Roman empire and in 
 the Jewish church more than in any age before or since, and in such a 
 time of enquiry Christ chose to establish his religion, not in an 
 illiterate age, lest it should look like a design to impose upon the 
 world; yet he himself studied not the learning then in vogue. 

 [2.] That Christ <I>had letters,</I> though he had never <I>learned</I> 
 them; was mighty in the scriptures, though he never had any doctor of 
 the law for his tutor. It is necessary that Christ's ministers should 
 have <I>learning,</I> as he had; and since they cannot expect to have 
 it as he had it, by inspiration, they must take pains to get it in an 
 ordinary way. 

 [3.] That Christ's having learning, though he had not been taught it, 
 made him truly great and wonderful; the Jews speak of it here with 
 wonder. <I>First,</I> Some, it is likely, took notice of it to his 
 honour: He that had no human learning, and yet so far excelled all that 
 had, certainly must be endued with a divine knowledge. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 Others, probably, mentioned it in disparagement and contempt of him: 
 Whatever he <I>seems</I> to have, he cannot really have any true 
 learning, for he was never at the university, nor took his degree. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> Some perhaps suggested that he had got his learning by 
 magic arts, or some unlawful means or other. Since they know not how he 
 could be a scholar, they will think him a conjurer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What he <I>asserted</I> concerning it; three things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That his <I>doctrine</I> is <I>divine</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</I> They were 
 offended because he undertook to <I>teach</I> though he had never 
 learned, in answer to which he tells them that his doctrine was such as 
 was not to be <I>learned,</I> for it was not the product of <I>human 
 thought</I> and natural powers enlarged and elevated by reading and 
 conversation, but it was a <I>divine revelation.</I> As God, equal with 
 the Father, he might truly have said, <I>My doctrine is mine, and his 
 that sent me;</I> but being now in his estate of humiliation, and 
 being, as Mediator, God's servant, it was more congruous to say, "<I>My 
 doctrine is not mine,</I> not mine only, nor mine originally, as man 
 and mediator, but <I>his that sent me;</I> it does not centre in 
 myself, nor lead ultimately to myself, but to him that sent me." God 
 had promised concerning the great prophet that he would <I>put his 
 words into his mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:18">Deut. xviii. 18</A>),

 to which Christ seems here to refer. Note, It is the comfort of those
 who embrace Christ's doctrine, and the condemnation of those who reject 
 it, that it is a divine doctrine: it is <I>of God and not of 
 man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That the most competent judges of the truth and divine authority 
 of Christ's doctrine are those that with a sincere and upright heart 
 desire and endeavour to do the will of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>If any man be willing to do the will of God,</I> have his will 
 melted into the <I>will of God, he shall know of the doctrine whether 
 it be of God or whether I speak of myself.</I> Observe here, 
 <I>First,</I> What the question is, concerning the doctrine of Christ, 
 <I>whether it be of God</I> or no; whether the gospel be a divine 
 revelation or an imposture. Christ himself was willing to have his 
 doctrine enquired into, whether it were of God or no, much more should 
 his ministers; and we are concerned to examine what grounds we go upon, 
 for, if we be deceived, we are miserably deceived. <I>Secondly,</I> Who 
 are likely to succeed in this search: those that <I>do the will of 
 God,</I> at least are desirous to do it. Now see, 

 1. Who they are that <I>will do the will of God.</I> They are such as 
 are <I>impartial</I> in their enquiries concerning the will of God, and 
 are not biassed by any lust or interest, and such as are resolved by 
 the grace of God, when they find out what the will of God is, to 
 conform to it. They are such as have an honest principle of regard to 
 God, and are truly desirous to glorify and please him. 

 2. Whence it is that such a one shall know of the truth of Christ's 
 doctrine.

 (1.) Christ has promised to <I>give knowledge</I> to such; he hath
 said, <I>He shall know,</I> and he can give an understanding. Those who
 improve the light they have, and carefully live up to it, shall be
 secured by divine grace from destructive mistakes.

 (2.) They are disposed and prepared to <I>receive</I> that knowledge.
 He that is inclined to submit to the rules of the divine law is 
 disposed to admit the rays of divine light. <I>To him that has</I> 
 shall be given; those have a <I>good understanding</I> that <I>do his 
 commandments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:10">Ps. cxi. 10</A>.

 Those who <I>resemble</I> God are most likely to <I>understand</I>
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] That hereby it appeared that Christ, as a teacher, did not speak 
 <I>of himself,</I> because he did not seek himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 <I>First,</I> See here the character of a deceiver: he <I>seeketh his 
 own glory,</I> which is a sign that he <I>speaks of himself,</I> as the 
 false Christs and false prophets did. Here is the description of the 
 <I>cheat:</I> they <I>speak of themselves,</I> and have no commission 
 nor instructions from God; no warrant but their own will, no 
 inspiration but their own imagination, their own policy and artifice. 
 Ambassadors <I>speak not of themselves;</I> those ministers disclaim 
 that character who glory in this that they <I>speak of themselves.</I> 
 But see the discovery of the cheat; by this their pretensions are 
 disproved, they consult purely <I>their own glory;</I> self-seekers are 
 self-speakers. Those who speak <I>from God</I> will speak <I>for 
 God,</I> and for his glory; those who aim at their own preferment and 
 interest make it to appear that they had no commission form God. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> See the contrary character Christ gives of himself and 
 his doctrine: <I>He that seeks his glory that sent him,</I> as I do, 
 makes it to appear that <I>he is true.</I> 

 1. He was <I>sent of God.</I> Those teachers, and those only, who are 
 sent of God, are to be received and entertained by us. Those who bring 
 a divine message must prove a divine mission, either by special 
 revelation or by regular institution. 

 2. He <I>sought the glory of God.</I> It was both the tendency of his 
 doctrine and the tenour of his whole conversation to <I>glorify 
 God.</I> 

 3. This was a proof that he was <I>true,</I> and there was <I>no 
 unrighteousness in him.</I> False teachers are most <I>unrighteous;</I> 
 they are unjust to God whose name they abuse, and unjust to the souls 
 of men whom they impose upon. There cannot be a greater piece of 
 unrighteousness than this. But Christ made it appear that he was 
 <I>true,</I> that he was really what he said he was, that there was 
 <I>no unrighteousness</I> in him, no falsehood in his doctrine, no 
 fallacy nor fraud in his dealings with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They discourse concerning the <I>crime</I> that was laid to his 
 charge for curing the impotent man, and bidding him carry his bed on 
 the sabbath day, for which they had formerly prosecuted him, and which 
 was still the pretence of their enmity to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He argues against them by way of <I>recrimination,</I> convicting 
 them of far worse practices, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 How could they for shame censure him for a breach of the law of Moses, 
 when they themselves were such notorious breakers of it? <I>Did not 
 Moses give you the law?</I> And it was their privilege that they had 
 the law, no nation had such a law; but it was their wickedness that 
 <I>none of them kept the law,</I> that they rebelled against it, and 
 lived contrary to it. Many that have the law given them, when they have 
 it do not keep it. Their neglect of the law was universal: <I>None of 
 you keepeth</I> it: neither those of them that were in <I>posts of 
 honour,</I> who should have been most <I>knowing,</I> nor those who 
 were in <I>posts of subjection,</I> who should have been most 
 <I>obedient.</I> They boasted of the law, and pretended a zeal for it, 
 and were enraged at Christ for seeming to transgress it, and yet none 
 of them kept it; like those who say that they are for the church, and 
 yet never go to church. It was an aggravation of their wickedness, in 
 persecuting Christ for breaking the law, that they themselves did not 
 keep it: "<I>None of you keepeth the law,</I> why then go ye about to 
 kill me for not keeping it?" Note, Those are commonly most censorious 
 of others who are most faulty themselves. Thus hypocrites, who are 
 forward to pull a mote out of their brother's eye, are not aware of a 
 beam in their own. <I>Why go ye about to kill me?</I> Some take this as 
 the evidence of their not keeping the law: "<I>You keep not the 
 law;</I> if you did, you would understand yourselves better than to go 
 about to kill me for doing a good work." Those that support themselves 
 and their interest by persecution and violence, whatever they pretend 
 (though they may call themselves <I>custodes utriusque 
 tabul&aelig;--the guardians of both tables</I>), are not keepers of the 
 law of God. Chemnitius understands this as a reason why it was time to 
 supersede the law of Moses by the gospel, because the law was found 
 insufficient to <I>restrain sin:</I> "Moses gave you the law, but you 
 do not keep it, nor are kept by it from the greatest wickedness; there 
 is therefore need of a clearer light and better law to be brought in; 
 why then do you aim to kill me for introducing it?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the <I>people</I> rudely interrupted him in his discourse, and 
 contradicted what he said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Thou has a devil; who goes about to kill thee?</I> This intimates,

 [1.] The <I>good opinion</I> they had of their rulers, who, they think, 
 would never attempt so atrocious a thing as to kill him; no, such a 
 veneration they had for their elders and chief priests that they would 
 swear for them they would do no harm to an innocent man. Probably the 
 rulers had their little emissaries among the people who suggested this 
 to them; many deny that wickedness which at the same time they are 
 contriving. 

 [2.] The <I>ill opinion</I> they had of our Lord Jesus: "<I>Thou hast a 
 devil,</I> thou art possessed with a lying spirit, and art a <I>bad 
 man</I> for saying so;" so some: or rather, "Thou art melancholy, and 
 art a <I>weak man;</I> thou frightenest thyself with causeless fears, 
 as hypochondriacal people are apt to do." Not only open frenzies, but 
 silent melancholies, were then commonly imputed to the power of Satan. 
 "Thou art crazed, has a distempered brain." Let us not think it strange 
 if the best of men are put under the worst of characters. To this vile 
 calumny our Saviour returns no direct answer, but seems as if he took 
 no notice of it. Note, Those who would be like Christ must put up with
 affronts, and pass by the indignities and injuries done them; must not 
 <I>regard</I> them, much less <I>resent</I> them, and least of all 
 <I>revenge</I> them. <I>I, as a deaf man, heard not.</I> When Christ 
 was <I>reviled,</I> he <I>reviled not again,</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He argues by way of appeal and vindication.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He appeals to <I>their own sentiments</I> of this miracle: "<I>I 
 have done one work, and you all marvel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 You cannot choose but marvel at it as truly great, and altogether 
 supernatural; you must all own it to be marvellous." Or, "Though I have 
 done but <I>one work</I> that you have any colour to find fault with, 
 yet you marvel, you are offended and displeased as if I had been guilty 
 of some heinous or enormous crime."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He appeals to their own practice in other instances: "<I>I have 
 done one work</I> on the sabbath, and it was done easily, with a word's 
 speaking, and you all marvel, you make a mighty strange thing of it, 
 that a religious man should dare do such a thing, whereas you 
 yourselves <I>many a time</I> do that which is a much more servile work 
 on the sabbath day, in the case of circumcision; if it be lawful for 
 you, nay, and your duty, to circumcise a child on the sabbath day, when 
 it happens to be the eighth day, as no doubt it is, much more was it 
 lawful and good for me to heal a diseased man on that day." 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The rise and origin of circumcision: <I>Moses gave you 
 circumcision,</I> gave you the law concerning it. Here, 

 1. Circumcision is said to <I>be given,</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 they are said to <I>receive</I> it; it was not imposed upon them as a 
 yoke, but conferred upon them as a favour. Note, The ordinances of God, 
 and particularly those which are seals of the covenant, are <I>gifts 
 given to men,</I> and are to be received as such.

 2. Moses is said to give it, because it was a part of that law which
 was <I>given by Moses;</I> yet, as Christ said of the manna

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:32"><I>ch.</I> vi. 32</A>),

 Moses did not give it them, but God; nay, and it was not of Moses
 first, but <I>of the fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Though it was incorporated into the Mosaic institution, yet it was 
 ordained long before, for it was a seal of the righteousness of faith, 
 and therefore commenced with the promise four hundred and thirty years 
 before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:17">Gal. iii. 17</A>.

 The church membership of believers and their seed was not of Moses or
 his law, and therefore did not fall with it; but was <I>of the
 fathers,</I> belonged to the patriarchal church, and was part of that
 blessing of Abraham which was to come upon the Gentiles, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:14">Gal. iii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The respect paid to the law of circumcision above that 
 of the sabbath, in the constant practice of the Jewish church. The 
 Jewish casuists frequently take notice of it, <I>Circumcisio et ejus 
 sanatio pellit sabbbatum--Circumcision and its cure drive away the 
 sabbath;</I> so that if a child was born one sabbath day it was without 
 fail circumcised the next. If then, when the <I>sabbath rest</I> was 
 more strictly insisted on, yet those works were allowed which were 
 <I>in ordine ad spiritualia--for the keeping up of religion,</I> much 
 more are they allowed now under the gospel, when the stress is laid 
 more upon the <I>sabbath work.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> The inference Christ draws hence in justification of
 himself, and of what he had done

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>A man-child on the sabbath day receives circumcision, that the law 
 of circumcision might not be broken;</I> or, as the margin reads it, 
 <I>without breaking the law,</I> namely, of the sabbath. Divine 
 commands must be construed so as to agree with each other. "Now, if 
 this be allowed by yourselves, how unreasonable are you, who are 
 <I>angry with me because I have made a man every whit whole on the 
 sabbath day!</I>" <B><I>emoi cholate</I></B>. The word is used only 
 here, from <B><I>choge</I></B>--<I>fel, gall.</I> They were angry at 
 him with the greatest indignation; it was a spiteful anger, anger with 
 gall in it. Note, It is very absurd and unreasonable for us to condemn
 others for that in which we justify ourselves. Observe the comparison 
 Christ here makes between their <I>circumcising a child</I> and his 
 <I>healing a man</I> on the sabbath day.

 1. Circumcision was but a ceremonial institution; it was <I>of the 
 fathers</I> indeed, but not from the beginning; but what Christ did was 
 a good work by the law of nature, a more excellent law than that which 
 made circumcision a good work. 

 2. Circumcision was a <I>bloody</I> ordinance, and <I>made sore;</I>
 but what Christ did was healing, and made whole. The law works pain, 
 and, if that work may be done on the sabbath day, much more a gospel 
 work, which produces peace. 

 3. Especially considering that whereas, when they had circumcised a
 child, their care was only to heal up that part which was circumcised, 
 which might be done and yet the child remain under other illnesses, 
 Christ had made this man <I>every whit whole,</I> <B><I>holon anthropon 
 hygie</I></B>--<I>I have made the whole man healthful</I> and sound.
 The <I>whole body</I> was <I>healed,</I> for the disease affected the 
 whole body; and it was a perfect cure, such as left no relics of the 
 disease behind; nay, Christ not only healed his body, but his soul too, 
 by that admonition, <I>Go, and sin no more,</I> and so indeed made the 
 <I>whole man</I> sound, for the soul is the man. Circumcision indeed
 was intended for the good of the soul, and to make the <I>whole man</I> 
 as it should be; but they had perverted it, and turned it into a mere 
 carnal ordinance; but Christ accompanied his outward cures with inward 
 grace, and so made them sacramental, and healed the <I>whole 
 man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He concludes this argument with that rule 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous 
 judgment.</I> This may be applied, either, <I>First,</I> In particular, 
 to this work which they quarrelled with as a violation of the law. Be
 not partial in your judgment; judge not, <B><I>kat 
 opsin</I></B>--<I>with respect of persons;</I> knowing faces, as the 
 Hebrew phrase is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:17">Deut. i. 17</A>.

 It is contrary to the law of justice, as well as charity, to censure
 those who differ in opinion from us as transgressors, in taking that 
 liberty which yet in those of our own party, and way, and opinion, we 
 allow of; as it is also to commend that in some as necessary strictness 
 and severity which in others we condemn as imposition and persecution. 
 Or, <I>Secondly,</I> In general, to Christ's person and preaching, 
 which they were offended at and prejudiced against. Those things that 
 are false, and designed to impose upon men, commonly appear best when 
 they are judged of <I>according to the outward appearance,</I> they 
 appear most plausible <I>prima facie--at the first glance.</I> It was 
 this that gained the Pharisees such an interest and reputation, that 
 they <I>appeared right</I> unto men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:27,28">Matt. xxiii. 27, 28</A>),

 and men judged of them by that appearance, and so were sadly mistaken 
 in them. "But," saith Christ, "be not too confident that all are real 
 saints who are seeming ones." With reference to himself, his <I>outward 
 appearance</I> was far short of his real dignity and excellency, for he 
 took upon him the <I>form of a servant</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:7">Phil. ii. 7</A>),

 was in the <I>likeness of sinful flesh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Rom. viii. 3</A>),
 
 had <I>no form nor comeliness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2">Isa. liii. 2</A>.

 So that those who undertook to judge whether he was the Son of God or 
 no by his <I>outward appearance</I> were not likely to <I>judge 
 righteous judgment.</I> The Jews expected the outward appearance of the 
 Messiah to be pompous and magnificent, and attended with all the 
 ceremonies of secular grandeur; and, judging of Christ by that rule, 
 their judgment was from first to last a <I>continual</I> mistake, for 
 the kingdom of Christ was not to be <I>of this world,</I> nor to 
 <I>come with observation.</I> If a divine power accompanied him, and 
 God bore him witness, and the scriptures were fulfilled in him, though 
 his appearance was ever so mean, they ought to receive him, and to 
 judge by faith, and not by the sight of the eye. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:3,1Sa+16:7">Isa. xi. 3, and 1 Sam. xvi. 7</A>.

 Christ and his doctrine and doings desire nothing but <I>righteous
 judgment;</I> if truth and justice may but pass the sentence, Christ 
 and his cause will carry the day. We must not judge concerning any by 
 their <I>outward appearance,</I> not by their titles, the figure they 
 make in the world, and their fluttering show, but by their intrinsic 
 worth, and the gifts and graces of God's Spirit in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ discourses with them here concerning <I>himself,</I> whence 
 he came, and whither he was going, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:25-36"><I>v.</I> 25-36</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Whence he came,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:25-31"><I>v.</I> 25-31</A>.

 In the account of this observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The objection concerning this stated by some of the inhabitants of 
 Jerusalem, who seem to have been of all others most prejudiced against 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 One would think that those who lived at the fountain-head of knowledge 
 and religion should have been most ready to receive the Messiah: but it 
 proved quite contrary. Those that have plenty of the means of knowledge 
 and grace, if they are not <I>made better</I> by them, are commonly 
 <I>made worse;</I> and our Lord Jesus has often met with the least 
 welcome from those that one would expect the best from. But it was not
 without some just cause that it came into a proverb, <I>The nearer the 
 church the further from God.</I> These people of Jerusalem showed their 
 ill-will to Christ,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> By their reflecting on the rulers, because they let him 
 alone: <I>Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</I> The multitude of 
 the people that came up out of the country to the feast did not suspect 
 there was any design on foot against him, and therefore they said, 
 <I>Who goes about to kill thee?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 But those of Jerusalem knew the plot, and irritated their rulers to put 
 it into execution: "<I>Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</I> Why 
 do they not do it then? Who hinders them? They say that they have a
 mind to get him out of the way, and yet, lo, <I>he speaketh boldly,</I> 
 and <I>they say nothing to him;</I> do <I>the rulers know indeed that 
 this is the very Christ?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Here they slyly and maliciously insinuate two things, to exasperate the 
 rulers against Christ, when indeed they needed to spur. 

 1. That by conniving at his preaching they <I>brought their authority 
 into contempt.</I> "Must a man that is condemned by the 
 <I>sanhedrim</I> as a deceiver be permitted to <I>speak boldly,</I> 
 without any check or contradiction? This makes their sentence to be but 
 <I>brutem fulmen--a vain menace;</I> if our rulers will suffer 
 themselves to be thus trampled upon, they may thank themselves if none 
 stand in awe of them and their laws." Note, The worst of persecutions 
 have often been carried on under colour of the necessary support of 
 authority and government. 

 2. That hereby they brought <I>their judgment</I> into <I>suspicion. Do 
 they know that this is the Christ?</I> It is spoken ironically, "How 
 came they to change their mind? What new discovery have they lighted 
 on? They give people occasion to think that they believe him to be the 
 Christ, and it behoves them to act vigorously against him to clear 
 themselves from the suspicion." Thus the rulers, who had made the 
 people enemies to Christ, made them <I>seven times more the children of 
 hell than themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:15">Matt. xxiii. 15</A>.

 When religion and the profession of Christ's name are <I>out of
 fashion,</I> and consequently <I>out of repute,</I> many are strongly 
 tempted to persecute and oppose them, only that they may not be thought 
 to favour them and incline to them. And for this reason apostates, and
 the degenerate offspring of good parents, have been sometimes worse 
 than others, as it were to wipe off the stain of their profession. It 
 was strange that the rulers, thus irritated, did not seize Christ; but 
 his hour was not yet come; and God can tie men's hands to admiration, 
 though he should not turn their hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> By their exception against his being the Christ, in 
 which appeared more malice than matter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 "If the rulers think him to be the Christ, we neither can nor will 
 believe him to be so, for we have this argument against it, that <I>we 
 know this man, whence he is; but when Christ comes no man knows whence 
 he is.</I>" Here is a fallacy in the argument, for the propositions are 
 not body <I>ad idem--adapted to the same view of the subject.</I> 

 1. If they speak of his <I>divine nature,</I> it is true that when 
 Christ comes <I>no man knows whence he is,</I> for he is a priest after 
 the order of Melchizedek, who was <I>without descent,</I> and <I>his 
 goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:2">Mic. v. 2</A>.

 But then it is not true that as for this man they knew whence he was, 
 for they knew not his divine nature, nor how <I>the Word</I> was 
 <I>made flesh.</I> 

 2. If they speak of his <I>human nature,</I> it is true that they knew 
 whence he was, who was his mother, and where he was bred up; but then 
 it is false that ever it was said of the Messiah that none should know 
 whence he was, for it was known before <I>where he should be born,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:4,5">Matt. ii. 4, 5</A>.

 Observe,

 (1.) How they <I>despised him,</I> because they knew <I>whence he
 was.</I> Familiarity breeds contempt, and we are apt to disdain the 
 <I>use</I> of those whom we know the <I>rise of.</I> Christ's own 
 received him not, because he was <I>their own,</I> for which very 
 reason they should the rather have loved him, and been thankful that 
 their nation and their age were honoured with his appearance. 

 (2.) How they endeavoured unjustly to fasten the ground of their 
 prejudice upon the scriptures, as if they countenanced them, when there 
 was no such thing. <I>Therefore</I> people err concerning Christ,
 because they <I>know not the scripture.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Christ's answer to this objection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He spoke freely and boldly, he <I>cried in the temple, as 
 he taught,</I> he spoke this louder than the rest of his discourse, 

 1. To express his earnestness, being <I>grieved for the hardness of
 their hearts.</I> There may be a vehemency in contending for the truth 
 where yet there is no intemperate heat nor passion. We may instruct 
 gainsayers with warmth, and yet with <I>meekness.</I> 

 2. The priests and those that were prejudiced against him, did not come 
 near enough to hear his preaching, and therefore he must speak louder 
 than ordinary what he will have them to hear. Whoever has ears to hear, 
 let him hear this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> His answer to their cavil is, 

 1. By way of <I>concession,</I> granting that they did or might know 
 his origin as to the flesh: "<I>You both know me, and you know whence I 
 am.</I> You know I am of your own nation, and one of yourselves." It is 
 no disparagement to the doctrine of Christ that there is that in it 
 which is level to the capacities of the meanest, plain truths, 
 discovered even by nature's light, of which we may say, We know whence 
 they are. "<I>You know me,</I> you think you know me; but you are
 mistaken; you take me to be the carpenter's son, and born at Nazareth, 
 but it is not so." 

 2. By way of <I>negation,</I> denying that that which they did see in 
 him, and know of him, was all that was to be known; and therefore, if 
 they looked no further, they judged by the outward appearance only.
 They knew <I>whence</I> he came perhaps, and <I>where</I> he had his 
 birth, but he will tell them what they knew not, <I>from whom</I> he 
 came.

 (1.) That he did not <I>come of himself;</I> that he did not run 
 without sending, nor come as a private person, but with a public 
 character. 

 (2.) That he was sent of his Father; this is twice mentioned: <I>He 
 hath sent me.</I> And again, "<I>He hath sent me,</I> to say what I 
 say, and do what I do." This he was himself well assured of, and 
 therefore knew that his Father would bear him out; and it is well for 
 us that we are assured of it too, that we may with holy confidence go 
 to God by him. 

 (3.) That he was <I>from his Father,</I> <B><I>par autou 
 eimi</I></B>--<I>I am from him;</I> not only sent from him as a servant 
 from his master, but from him by eternal generation, as a son from his 
 father, by essential emanation, as the beams from the sun. 

 (4.) <I>That the Father who sent him is true;</I> he had promised to 
 give the Messiah, and, though the Jews had forfeited the promise, yet 
 he that made the promise is <I>true,</I> and has performed it. He had 
 promised that the Messiah should see his seed, and be successful in his 
 undertaking; and, though the generality of the Jews reject him and his 
 gospel, yet he <I>is true,</I> and will fulfil the promise in the
 calling of the Gentiles. 

 (5.) That these unbelieving Jews did <I>not know the Father: He that 
 sent me, whom you know not.</I> There is much ignorance of God even 
 with many that have a <I>form of knowledge;</I> and the true reason why 
 people reject Christ is because they do not <I>know God;</I> for there 
 is such a harmony of the divine attributes in the work of redemption, 
 and such an admirable agreement between natural and revealed religion, 
 that the right knowledge of the former would not only admit, but 
 introduce, the latter. 

 (6.) Our Lord Jesus was intimately acquainted with the Father that 
 <I>sent him: but I know him.</I> He knew him so well that he was not at 
 all <I>in doubt</I> concerning his mission from him, but perfectly 
 <I>assured</I> of it; nor at all <I>in the dark</I> concerning the work 
 he had to do, but perfectly <I>apprized</I> of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Matt. xi. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The provocation which this gave to his enemies, who hated him 
 because he <I>told them the truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 <I>They sought therefore to take him,</I> to lay violent hands on him, 
 not only to do him a mischief, but some way or other to be the death of 
 him; but by the restraint of an invisible power it was prevented; 
 nobody touched him, <I>because his hour was not yet come;</I> this was 
 not their reason why they did it not, but God's reason why he hindered 
 them from doing it. Note, <I>First,</I> The faithful preachers of the
 truths of God, though they behave themselves with ever so much prudence 
 and meekness, must expect to be hated and persecuted by those who think 
 themselves tormented by their testimony, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> God has wicked men in a chain, and, whatever mischief 
 they <I>would do,</I> they <I>can do</I> no more than God will suffer 
 them to do. The malice of persecutors is <I>impotent</I> even when it 
 is most <I>impetuous,</I> and, when Satan <I>fills their hearts,</I> 
 yet God <I>ties their hands. Thirdly,</I> God's servants are sometimes 
 wonderfully protected by indiscernible unaccountable means. Their 
 enemies do not do the mischief they designed, and yet neither they 
 themselves nor any one else can tell why they do not. <I>Fourthly,</I>
 Christ had <I>his hour</I> set, which was to put a period to his day 
 and work on earth; so have all his people and all his ministers, and, 
 till that hour comes, the attempts of their enemies against them are 
 ineffectual, and their day shall be lengthened as long as their Master 
 has any work for them to do; nor can all the powers of hell and earth 
 prevail against them, until they have <I>finished their 
 testimony.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] The good effect which Christ's discourse had, notwithstanding 
 this, upon some of his hearers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>Many of the people believed on him.</I> As he was set for the fall 
 of some, so for the rising again of others. Even where the gospel meets
 with opposition there may yet be a great deal of good done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:2">1 Thess. ii. 2</A>.
 
 Observe here, <I>First, Who</I> they were that believed; not a few, but
 many, more than one would have expected when the stream ran so strongly
 the other way. But these <I>many</I> were <I>of the people,</I>
 <B><I>ek tou ochlou</I></B>--<I>of the multitude,</I> the crowd, the
 inferior sort, the mob, the rabble, some would have called them. We
 must not measure the prosperity of the gospel by its success among the
 great ones; nor much ministers say that they labour in vain, though
 none but the <I>poor,</I> and those of no <I>figure,</I> receive the
 gospel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:26">1 Cor. i. 26</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> What <I>induced</I> them to believe: the <I>miracles
 which he did,</I> which were not only the accomplishment of the 
 Old-Testament prophecies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:5,6">Isa. xxxv. 5, 6</A>),

 but an argument of a divine power. He that had an ability to do that
 which none but God <I>can do,</I> to control and overrule the powers of 
 nature, no doubt had authority to enact that which none but God can 
 <I>enact,</I> a law that shall <I>bind conscience,</I> and a covenant 
 that shall <I>give life. Thirdly,</I> How <I>weak</I> their faith was: 
 they do not positively assert, as the Samaritans did, <I>This is indeed 
 the Christ,</I> but they only argue, <I>When Christ comes will he do 
 more miracles than these?</I> They take it for granted that Christ will 
 come, and, when he comes, will do many miracles. "Is not this he then?
 In him we see, though not all the worldly pomp we have fancied, yet all 
 the divine power we have <I>believed</I> the Messiah should appear in; 
 and therefore why may not this be he?" They <I>believe</I> it, but have 
 not courage to own it. Note, Even weak faith may be true faith, and so 
 <I>accounted,</I> so <I>accepted,</I> by the Lord Jesus, who 
 <I>despises not the day of small things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Whither he was going,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:32-36"><I>v.</I> 32-36</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The design of the Pharisees and chief priests against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 <I>First,</I> The provocation given them was that they had information 
 brought them by their spies, who insinuated themselves into the 
 conversation of the people, and gathered stories to carry to their 
 jealous masters, that <I>the people murmured such things concerning 
 him,</I> that there were many who had a respect and value for him, 
 notwithstanding all they had done to render him odious. Though the 
 people did but whisper these things, and had not courage to speak out, 
 yet the Pharisees were enraged at it. The equity of that government is 
 justly <I>suspected</I> by others which is so <I>suspicious</I> of 
 itself as to take notice of, or be influenced by, the secret, various, 
 uncertain <I>mutterings</I> of the common people. The Pharisees valued 
 themselves very much upon the respect of the people, and were sensible 
 that if Christ did thus <I>increase</I> they must <I>decrease. 
 Secondly,</I> The project they laid hereupon was to seize Jesus, and 
 take him into custody: <I>They sent officers to take him,</I> not to 
 take up those who murmured concerning him and frighten them; no, the 
 most effectual way to disperse the flock is to <I>smite the 
 shepherd.</I> The Pharisees seem to have been the ringleaders in this 
 prosecution, but they, <I>as such,</I> had no power, and therefore they 
 god the <I>chief priests,</I> the judges of the ecclesiastical court, 
 to join with them, who were ready enough to do so. The Pharisees were 
 the great pretenders to <I>learning,</I> and the <I>chief priests</I> 
 to <I>sanctify.</I> As <I>the world by wisdom knew not God,</I> but the 
 greatest philosophers were guilty of the greatest blunders in natural 
 religion, so the Jewish church by their wisdom knew not Christ, but 
 their greatest rabbin were the greatest fools concerning him, nay, they 
 were the most inveterate enemies to him. Those wicked rulers had their 
 officers, officers of their court, church-officers, whom they employed 
 to take Christ, and who were ready to go on their errand, though it was 
 an ill errand. If Saul's footmen will not <I>turn and fall upon the 
 priests of the Lord,</I> he has a herdsman that will,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The discourse of our Lord Jesus hereupon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>):

 <I>Yet a little while I am with you, and then I go to him that sent me; 
 you shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, thither you 
 cannot come.</I> These words, like the pillar of cloud and fire, have a 
 <I>bright</I> side and a <I>dark</I> side.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> They have a <I>bright side</I> towards our Lord Jesus 
 himself, and speak abundance of comfort to him and all his faithful 
 followers that are exposed to difficulties and dangers for his sake. 
 Three things Christ here comforted himself with:--

 1. That he had but <I>a little time</I> to continue here in this
 troublesome world. He sees that he is never likely to have a quiet day 
 among them; but the best of it is his warfare will shortly be 
 accomplished, and then he shall be <I>no more in this world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:11"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 11</A>.

 Whomsoever we are <I>with</I> in this world, friends or foes, it is but
 a <I>little while</I> that we shall be with them; and it is a matter of 
 comfort to those who are <I>in</I> the world, but not <I>of</I> it, and 
 therefore are hated by it and sick of it, that they shall not be <I>in 
 it always,</I> they shall not be <I>in it long.</I> We must be 
 <I>awhile</I> with those that are pricking briars and grieving thorns; 
 but thanks be to God, it is but a little while, and we shall be out of 
 their reach. Our days being <I>evil,</I> it is well they are 
 <I>few.</I>

 2. That, when he should quit this troublesome world, he should <I>go to
 him that sent him; I go.</I> Not, "I am driven away by force," but, "I 
 voluntarily <I>go;</I> having finished my embassy, I return to him on 
 whose errand I came. When I have done my work with you, then, and not 
 till then, I go to him <I>that sent me,</I> and will <I>receive me,</I> 
 will prefer me, as ambassadors are preferred when they return." Their 
 rage against him would not only not hinder him from, but would hasten 
 him to the glory and joy that were set before him. Let those who suffer 
 for Christ comfort themselves with this, that they have a God to go to, 
 and are going to him, going apace, to be for ever with him. 

 3. That, though they persecuted him here, wherever he went, yet none of 
 their persecutions could follow him to heaven: <I>You shall seek me, 
 and shall not find me.</I> It appears, by their enmity to his followers 
 when he was gone, that if they could have reached him they would have 
 persecuted him: "But you cannot enter into that temple as you do into 
 this." <I>Where I am,</I> that is, where I then <I>shall be;</I> but he 
 expressed it thus because, even when he was on earth, by his divine 
 nature and divine affections he was in heaven,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:13"><I>ch.</I> iii. 13</A>.

 Or it denotes that he should be <I>so soon</I> there that he was as
 good as there already. Note, It adds to the happiness of glorified 
 saints that they are out of the reach of the devil and all his wicked 
 instruments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> These words have a <I>black and dark side</I> towards 
 those wicked Jews that hated and persecuted Christ. They now longed to 
 be rid of him, <I>Away with him from the earth;</I> but let them know, 

 1. That according to their choice so shall their doom be. They were 
 industrious to <I>drive him</I> from them, and their sin shall be their 
 punishment; he will not trouble them long, yet a little while and he 
 will <I>depart</I> from them. It is just with God to forsake those that 
 think his presence a burden. They that are weary of Christ need no more 
 to make them miserable than to have <I>their wish.</I> 

 2. That they would certainly repent their choice when it was too late.

 (1.) They should in vain seek the presence of the Messiah: "<I>You 
 shall seek me, and shall not find me.</I> You shall expect the 
 <I>Christ to come,</I> but your eyes shall fail with looking for him, 
 and you shall never find him." Those who rejected the true Messiah when 
 he did come were justly abandoned to a miserable and endless 
 expectation of one that should never come. Or, it may refer to the 
 final rejection of sinners from the favours and grace of Christ at the 
 great day: those who now seek Christ shall find him, but the day is 
 coming when those who now refuse him <I>shall seek him, and shall not 
 find him.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:28">Prov. i. 28</A>.

 They will in vain cry, <I>Lord, Lord, open to us.</I> Or, perhaps, 
 these words might be fulfilled in the despair of some of the Jews, who 
 possibly might be convinced and not converted, who would wish in vain 
 to see Christ, and to hear him preach again; but the day of grace is 
 over

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:22">Luke xvii. 22</A>);
 
 yet this is not all.
 
 (2.) They should in vain expect a place in heaven: <I>Where I am,</I> 
 and where all believers shall be with me, <I>thither ye cannot 
 come.</I> Not only because they are <I>excluded</I> by the just and 
 irreversible sentence of the judge, and the sword of the angel at every 
 gate of the new Jerusalem, to keep <I>the way of the tree of life</I> 
 against those who have <I>no right to enter,</I> but because they are 
 disabled by their own iniquity and infidelity: <I>You cannot come,</I> 
 because you <I>will not.</I> Those who hate to be where Christ is, in 
 his word and ordinances on earth, are very unfit to be where he is in 
 his glory in heaven; for indeed heaven would be no heaven to them, such 
 are the antipathies of an unsanctified soul to the felicities of that 
 state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>37  In the last day, that great <I>day</I> of the feast, Jesus stood
 and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and
 drink.
 &nbsp; 38  He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of
 his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
 &nbsp; 39  (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on
 him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet <I>given;</I>
 because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
 &nbsp; 40  Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying,
 said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
 &nbsp; 41  Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ
 come out of Galilee?
 &nbsp; 42  Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed
 of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
 &nbsp; 43  So there was a division among the people because of him.
 &nbsp; 44  And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands
 on him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's discourse, with the explication of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:37-39"><I>v.</I> 37-39</A>.

 It is probable that these are only short hints of what he enlarged 
 upon, but they have in them the substance of the whole gospel; here is 
 a <I>gospel invitation to come to Christ,</I> and a <I>gospel 
 promise</I> of comfort and happiness in him. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>When</I> he gave this invitation: <I>On the last day</I> of the 
 feast of tabernacles, <I>that great day.</I> The <I>eighth day,</I> 
 which concluded that solemnity, was to be a <I>holy convocation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:36">Lev. xxiii. 36</A>.
 
 Now on this day Christ published this gospel-call, because

 (1.) Much people were gathered together, and, if the invitation were
 given to <I>many,</I> it might be hoped that <I>some</I> would accept 
 of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:20">Prov. i. 20</A>.

 Numerous assemblies give opportunity of doing the more good.

 (2.) The people were now returning to their homes, and he would give
 them this to carry away with them as his parting word. When a great 
 congregation is to be dismissed, and is about to scatter, as here, it 
 is affecting to think that in all probability they will never come all 
 together again in this world, and therefore, if we can say or do any 
 thing to help them to heaven, that must be the time. It is good to be 
 lively at the close of an ordinance. Christ made this offer <I>on the 
 last day of the feast.</I>

 [1.] To those who had turned a deaf ear to his preaching on the 
 foregoing days of this sacred week; he will try them once more, and, if 
 they will yet hear his voice, they shall live.

 [2.] To those who perhaps might never have such another offer made 
 them, and therefore were concerned to accept of this; it would be half 
 a year before there would be another feast, and in that time they would 
 many of them be in their graves. <I>Behold now is the accepted 
 time.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>How</I> he gave this invitation: <I>Jesus stood and cried,</I> 
 which denotes, 

 (1.) His great earnestness and importunity. His heart was upon it, to 
 bring poor souls in to himself. The erection of his body and the 
 elevation of his voice were indications of the intenseness of his mind. 
 Love to souls will make preachers lively. 

 (2.) His desire that all might take notice, and take hold of this 
 invitation. He <I>stood, and cried,</I> that he might the better be 
 heard; for this is what every one that hath ears is concerned to hear. 
 Gospel truth seeks no corners, because it fears no trials. The heathen 
 oracles were delivered privately by them that <I>peeped and 
 muttered;</I> but the oracles of the gospel were proclaimed by one that 
 <I>stood, and cried.</I> How sad is the case of man, that he must be 
 <I>importuned</I> to be happy, and how wonderful the grace of Christ, 
 that he will <I>importune</I> him! <I>Ho, every one,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1">Isa. lv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The invitation itself is very general: <I>If any man</I> thirst, 
 whoever he be, he is invited to Christ, be he high or low, rich or 
 poor, young or old, bond or free, Jew or Gentile. It is also very 
 <I>gracious: "If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink.</I> If 
 any man desires to be truly and eternally happy, let him apply himself 
 to me, and be ruled by me, and I will undertake to make him so."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The persons invited are such as <I>thirst,</I> which may be 
 understood, either, 

 [1.] Of the <I>indigence</I> of their cases; either as to their 
 <I>outward</I> condition (if any man be destitute of the comforts of 
 this life, or fatigued with the crosses of it, let his poverty and 
 afflictions draw him to Christ for that peace which the world can 
 neither give nor take away), or as to their <I>inward</I> state: "If 
 any man want spiritual blessings, he may be supplied by me." Or, 

 [2.] Of the <I>inclination</I> of their souls and their desires towards 
 a spiritual happiness. If any man hunger and thirst after 
 righteousness, that is, truly desire the good will of God towards him, 
 and the good work of God in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The invitation itself: <I>Let him come to me.</I> Let him not go 
 to the ceremonial law, which would neither <I>pacify</I> the conscience 
 nor <I>purify it,</I> and therefore could not make the <I>comers 
 thereunto perfect,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:1">Heb. x. 1</A>.

 Nor let him go to the heathen philosophy, which does but beguile men,
 lead them into a wood, and leave them there; but let him <I>go to 
 Christ,</I> admit his doctrine, submit to his discipline, believe in 
 him; come to him as the fountain of living waters, the giver of all 
 comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The satisfaction promised: "Let him come <I>and drink,</I> he 
 shall have what he comes for, and abundantly more, shall have that 
 which will not only <I>refresh,</I> but <I>replenish,</I> a soul that 
 desires to be happy."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. A gracious promise annexed to this gracious call 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>He that believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow</I>--

 (1.) See here what it is to come to Christ: It is <I>to believe on him, 
 as the scripture hath said;</I> it is to receive and entertain him as 
 he is offered to us in the gospel. We must not frame a Christ according 
 to our fancy, but believe in a Christ according to the scripture. 

 (2.) See how thirsty souls, that come to Christ, shall be made <I>to 
 drink.</I> Israel, that believed Moses, drank of the <I>rock that 
 followed them,</I> the streams followed; but believers drink of a rock 
 <I>in them, Christ in them;</I> he is in them a <I>well of living 
 water,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:14"><I>ch.</I> iv. 14</A>.
 
 Provision is made not only for their <I>present</I> satisfaction, but
 for their <I>continual perpetual</I> comfort. Here is, 

 [1.] <I>Living water, running</I> water, which the Hebrew language 
 calls <I>living,</I> because still in motion. The graces and comforts 
 of the Spirit are compared to <I>living</I> (meaning <I>running</I>) 
 <I>water,</I> because they are the active quickening principles of 
 spiritual life, and the earnests and beginnings of eternal life. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:13">Jer. ii. 13</A>.

 [2.] <I>Rivers</I> of living water, denoting both plenty and constancy.
 The comfort flows in both <I>plentifully</I> and <I>constantly</I> as a 
 river; strong as a stream to bear down the oppositions of doubts and 
 fears. There is a fulness in Christ of grace for grace. 

 [3.] These flow out <I>of his belly,</I> that is, out of his heart or 
 soul, which is the subject of the Spirit's working and the seat of his 
 government. There <I>gracious principles</I> are planted; and out of
 the heart, in which the Spirit dwells, flow the <I>issues of life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:23">Prov. iv. 23</A>.

 There divine comforts are lodged, and the <I>joy</I> that a <I>stranger 
 doth not intermeddle with. He that believes has the witness in 
 himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:10">1 John v. 10</A>.

 <I>Sat lucis intus--Light abounds within.</I> Observe, further, where
 there are <I>springs</I> of grace and comfort in the soul that will 
 <I>send forth streams: Out of his belly shall flow rivers. First,</I> 
 Grace and comfort will produce good actions, and a holy heart will be 
 seen in a holy life; the tree is known by its fruits, and the fountain 
 by its streams. <I>Secondly,</I> They will <I>communicate 
 themselves</I> for the benefit of others; a good man is a common good. 
 His <I>mouth</I> is a <I>well of life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:11">Prov. x. 11</A>.
 
 It is not enough that we <I>drink waters out of our own cistern,</I> 
 that we ourselves take the comfort of the grace given us, but we must 
 let our <I>fountains</I> be <I>dispersed abroad,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:15,16">Prov. v. 15, 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those words, <I>as the scripture hath said,</I> seem to refer to some 
 promise in the Old Testament to this purport, and there are many; as 
 that God would <I>pour out</I> his Spirit, which is a metaphor borrowed 
 from waters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:23,Joe+2:28,Isa+44:3,Zec+12:10">Prov. i. 23;
 Joel ii. 28; Isa. xliv. 3; Zech. xii. 10</A>);

 that the <I>dry land</I> should become <I>springs of water</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:18">Isa. xli. 18</A>);
 
 that there should be <I>rivers in the desert</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:19">Isa. xliii. 19</A>);
 
 that gracious souls should be like a <I>spring of water</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:11">Isa. lviii. 11</A>);
 
 and the church a <I>well of living water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:15">Cant. iv. 15</A>.

 And here may be an allusion to the waters issuing out of Ezekiel's 
 temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+47:1">Ezek. xlvii. 1</A>.
 
 Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:1">Rev. xxii. 1</A>,
 
 and see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:8">Zech. xiv. 8</A>.

 Dr. Lightfoot and others tell us it was a custom of the Jews, which 
 they received by tradition, <I>the last day of the feast</I> of 
 tabernacles to have a solemnity, which they called <I>Libatio 
 aqu&aelig;--The pouring out of water.</I> They fetched a golden vessel 
 of water from the pool of Siloam, brought it into the temple with sound 
 of trumpet and other ceremonies, and, upon the ascent to the altar, 
 poured it out before the Lord with all possible expressions of joy. 
 Some of their writers make the water to signify <I>the law,</I> and 
 refer to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:3,55:1">Isa. xii. 3; lv. 1</A>.

 Others, <I>the Holy Spirit.</I> And it is thought that our Saviour 
 might here allude to this custom. Believers shall have the comfort, not 
 of a vessel of water fetched from a pool, but of a river flowing from 
 themselves. The joy of the law, and the pouring out of the water, which 
 signified this, are not to be compared with the joy of the gospel in 
 the wells of salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Here is the evangelist's exposition of this promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>This spoke he of the Spirit:</I> not of any outward advantages
 accruing to believers (as perhaps some misunderstood him), but of the 
 gifts, graces, and comforts of the Spirit. See how scripture is the 
 best interpreter of scripture. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is promised to <I>all that believe</I> on Christ that they 
 shall <I>receive the Holy Ghost.</I> Some received his miraculous gifts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:17,18">Mark xvi. 17, 18</A>);

 all receive his sanctifying graces. The gift of the Holy Ghost is one 
 of the great blessings promised in the new covenant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:39">Acts ii. 39</A>),

 and, if <I>promised,</I> no doubt <I>performed</I> to all that have an 
 interest in that covenant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The Spirit dwelling and working in believers is as a <I>fountain 
 of living</I> running <I>water,</I> out of which plentiful streams 
 flow, cooling and cleansing as water, mollifying and moistening as 
 water, making them fruitful, and others joyful; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:5"><I>ch.</I> iii. 5</A>.

 When the apostles spoke so <I>fluently</I> of the things of God, as the
 Spirit gave them utterance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:4">Acts ii. 4</A>),

 and afterwards preached and wrote the gospel of Christ with such a 
 <I>flood</I> of divine eloquence, then this was fulfilled, <I>Out of 
 his belly shall flow rivers.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) This plentiful effusion of the Spirit was yet the matter of a
 promise; for <I>the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not 
 yet glorified.</I> See here 

 [1.] That <I>Jesus was not yet glorified.</I> It was certain that he 
 should be glorified, and he was ever worthy of all honour; but he was 
 as yet in a state of humiliation and contempt. He had never forfeited 
 the glory he had before all worlds, nay, he had <I>merited</I> a 
 further glory, and, besides his <I>hereditary</I> honours, might claim 
 the <I>achievement</I> of a <I>mediatorial</I> crown; and yet all this 
 is in reversion. Jesus is now <I>upheld</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa. xlii. 1</A>),

 is now <I>satisfied</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:11">Isa. liii. 11</A>),
 
 is now <I>justified</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16">1 Tim. iii. 16</A>),

 but he is <I>not yet glorified.</I> And, if Christ must wait for his 
 glory, let not us think it much to wait for ours.

 [2.] That <I>the Holy Ghost was not yet given.</I> <B><I>oupo gar hen 
 pneuma</I></B>--<I>for the Holy Ghost was not yet.</I> The Spirit of 
 God was from eternity, for in the beginning he <I>moved upon the face 
 of the waters.</I> He was in the Old-Testament prophets and saints, and 
 Zacharias and Elisabeth were both <I>filled with the Holy Ghost.</I> 
 This therefore must be understood of the eminent, plentiful, and 
 general effusion of the Spirit which was promised,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:28">Joel ii. 28</A>,
 
 and accomplished,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1">Acts ii. 1</A>,

 &c. <I>The Holy Ghost was not yet given</I> in that visible manner that
 was intended. If we compare the clear knowledge and strong grace of the
 disciples of Christ themselves, after the day of Pentecost, with their 
 darkness and weakness before, we shall understand in what sense <I>the 
 Holy Ghost was not yet given;</I> the earnests and first-fruits of the 
 Spirit were given, but the full harvest was not yet come. That which is 
 most properly called the <I>dispensation of the Spirit</I> did not yet 
 commence. The <I>Holy Ghost</I> was <I>not yet given</I> in such rivers 
 of living water as should issue forth to water the whole earth, even 
 the Gentile world, not in the <I>gifts of tongues,</I> to which perhaps 
 this promise principally refers. 

 [3.] That the reason why <I>the Holy Ghost was not given</I> was 
 because <I>Jesus was not yet glorified. First,</I> The death of Christ
 is sometimes called his glorification

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:31"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 31</A>);

 for in his cross he conquered and triumphed. Now the gift of the Holy
 Ghost was purchased by the blood of Christ: this was the <I>valuable 
 consideration</I> upon which the <I>grant</I> was grounded, and 
 therefore till this <I>price was paid</I> (though many other gifts were 
 bestowed upon its being <I>secured</I> to be paid) the Holy Ghost was 
 not given. <I>Secondly,</I> There was not so much need of the Spirit, 
 while Christ himself was here upon earth, as there was when he was 
 gone, to supply the want of him. <I>Thirdly,</I> The giving of the Holy 
 Ghost was to be both an <I>answer</I> to Christ's <I>intercession</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:16"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 16</A>),

 and an <I>act</I> of his <I>dominion;</I> and therefore till he is
 glorified, and enters upon both these, the Holy Ghost is not given. 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> The conversion of the Gentiles was the glorifying of 
 Jesus. When certain Greeks began to enquire after Christ, he said, 
 <I>Now is the Son of man glorified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:23"><I>ch.</I> xii. 23</A>.

 Now the time when the gospel should be propagated in the nations was
 not yet come, and therefore there was as yet no occasion for the
 <I>gift of tongues,</I> that <I>river of living water.</I> But observe,
 though the Holy Ghost was not yet given, yet he was <I>promised;</I> it
 was now the great <I>promise of the Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:4">Acts i. 4</A>.

 Though the gifts of Christ's grace are <I>long deferred,</I> yet they
 are <I>well secured:</I> and, while we are waiting for the good 
 promise, we have the promise to live upon, which <I>shall speak and 
 shall not lie.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The consequents of this discourse, what entertainment it met with; 
 in general, it occasioned differences: <I>There was a division among 
 the people because of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 There was a <I>schism,</I> so the word is; there were diversities of 
 opinions, and those managed with heat and contention; various 
 sentiments, and those such as set them at <I>variance.</I> Think we 
 that Christ came to send peace, that all would unanimously embrace his 
 gospel? No, the effect of the preaching of his gospel would be 
 <I>division,</I> for, while some are <I>gathered to it,</I> others will 
 be <I>gathered against it;</I> and this will put things into a 
 <I>ferment,</I> as here; but this is no more the fault of the gospel 
 than it is the fault of a wholesome medicine that it stirs up the 
 <I>peccant</I> humours in the body, in order to the discharge of them. 
 Observe what the debate was:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Some were <I>taken with him,</I> and well affected to him: <I>Many 
 of the people, when they heard this saying,</I> heard him with such 
 compassion and kindness invite poor sinners to him, and with such 
 authority engage to make them happy, that they could not but think 
 highly of him. 

 (1.) Some of them said, <I>O, a truth this is the prophet,</I> that 
 prophet whom Moses spoke of to the fathers, who should be <I>like unto 
 him;</I> or, This is <I>the prophet</I> who, according to the received 
 notions of the Jewish church, is to be the harbinger and forerunner of 
 the Messiah; or, <I>This is truly a prophet,</I> one divinely inspired 
 and sent of God. 

 (2.) Others went further, and said, <I>This is the Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),
 
 not the <I>prophet</I> of the Messiah, but the Messiah himself. The 
 Jews had at this time a more than ordinary expectation of the Messiah, 
 which made them ready to say upon every occasion, <I>Lo, here is 
 Christ,</I> or <I>Lo, he is there;</I> and this seems to be only the 
 effect of some such confused and floating notions which caught at the 
 first appearance, for we do not find that these people became his 
 disciples and followers; a good opinion of Christ is far short of a 
 lively faith in Christ; many give Christ a good word that give him no 
 more. These here said, <I>This is the prophet,</I> and <I>this is the 
 Christ,</I> but could not persuade themselves to leave all and follow 
 him; and so this their testimony to Christ was but a testimony 
 <I>against themselves.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Others were <I>prejudiced against him.</I> No sooner was this great 
 truth started, that <I>Jesus is the Christ,</I> than immediately it was 
 contradicted and argued against: and this one thing, that his rise and 
 origin were (as they took it for granted) out of Galilee, was thought 
 enough to answer all the arguments for his being the Christ. For, 
 <I>shall Christ come out of Galilee?</I> Has not <I>the scripture said 
 that Christ comes of the seed of David?</I> See here, 

 (1.) A laudable knowledge of the scripture. They were so far in the 
 right, that the Messiah was to be a <I>rod out of the stem of Jesse</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1">Isa. xi. 1</A>),
 
 that out of Bethlehem should <I>arise the Governor,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:2">Mic. v. 2</A>.

 This even the common people knew by the traditional expositions which 
 their scribes gave them. Perhaps the people who had these scriptures so 
 ready to object against Christ were not alike knowing in other parts of 
 holy writ, but had had these put into their mouths by their leaders, to 
 fortify their prejudices against Christ. Many that espouse some
 corrupt notions, and spend their zeal in defence of them, seem to be 
 very ready in the scriptures, when indeed they know little more than 
 those scriptures which they have been taught to <I>pervert.</I> 

 (2.) A culpable ignorance of our Lord Jesus. They speak of it as 
 certain and past dispute that <I>Jesus was of Galilee,</I> whereas by 
 enquiring of himself, or his mother, or his disciples, or by consulting 
 the genealogies of the family of David, or the register at Bethlehem, 
 they might have known that he was the Son of David, and a native of 
 Bethlehem; but <I>this they willingly are ignorant of.</I> Thus gross 
 falsehoods in matters of fact, concerning persons and things, are often 
 taken up by prejudiced and partial men, and great resolves founded upon 
 them, even in the same place and the same age wherein the persons live 
 and the things are done, while the truth might easily be found out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Others were <I>enraged against him,</I> and they <I>would have taken 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 Though what he said was most sweet and gracious, yet they were 
 exasperated against him for it. Thus did our Master suffer ill for 
 saying and doing well. <I>They would have taken him;</I> they hoped 
 somebody or other would seize him, and, if they had thought no one else 
 would, they would have done it themselves. They <I>would have taken 
 him;</I> but no man <I>laid hands on him,</I> being restrained by an 
 invisible power, because his hour was not come. As the malice of 
 Christ's enemies is always <I>unreasonable,</I> so sometimes the 
 suspension of it is <I>unaccountable.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>45  Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees;
 and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
 &nbsp; 46  The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
 &nbsp; 47  Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
 &nbsp; 48  Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
 &nbsp; 49  But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.

 being one of them,)
 &nbsp; 51  Doth our law judge <I>any</I> man, before it hear him, and know
 what he doeth?
 &nbsp; 52  They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee?
 Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
 &nbsp; 53  And every man went unto his own house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The chief priests and Pharisees are here in a close cabal, contriving 
 how to suppress Christ; though this was the <I>great day of the 
 feast,</I> they attended not the religious services of the day, but 
 left them to the vulgar, to whom it was common for those great 
 ecclesiastics to consign and turn over the business of devotion, while 
 they thought themselves better employed in the affairs of 
 church-policy. They sat in the council-chamber, expecting Christ to be 
 brought a prisoner to them, as they had issued out warrants for 
 apprehending him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 Now here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What passed between them and their own officers, who returned 
 without him, <I>re infecta</I>--<I>having done nothing.</I> 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The reproof they gave the officers for not executing the warrant 
 they gave them: <I>Why have you not brought him?</I> He appeared 
 publicly; the people were many of them disgusted, and would have 
 assisted them in taking him; this was <I>the last day of the feast,</I> 
 and they would not have such another opportunity; "why then did you 
 neglect your duty?" It vexed them that those who were their own 
 creatures, who depended on them, and on whom they depended, into whose 
 minds they had instilled prejudices against Christ, should thus 
 disappoint them. Note, Mischievous men fret that they cannot do the 
 mischief they would, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:10,Ne+6:16">Ps. cxii. 10; Neh. vi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reason which the officers gave for the non-execution of their 
 warrant: <I>Never man spoke like this man,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.
 
 Now,

 (1.) This was a very great truth, that <I>never any man spoke with</I> 
 that wisdom, and power, and grace, that convincing clearness, and that 
 charming sweetness, wherewith Christ spoke; none of the prophets, no, 
 not Moses himself. 

 (2.) The very officers that were sent to take him were taken with him, 
 and acknowledged this. Though they were probably men who had no quick 
 sense of reason or eloquence, and certainly had no inclination to think 
 well of Jesus, yet so much <I>self-evidence</I> was there in what 
 Christ said that they could not but prefer him before all those that 
 sat in Moses's seat. Thus Christ was preserved by the power God has 
 upon the consciences even of bad men. 

 (3.) They said this to their lords and masters, who could not endure to 
 hear any thing that tended to the honour of Christ and yet could not 
 avoid hearing this. Providence ordered it so that this should be said
 to them, that it might be a vexation in their sin and an aggravation of 
 their sin. Their own officers, who could not be suspected to be biassed 
 in favour of Christ, are witnesses against them. This testimony of 
 theirs should have made them reflect upon themselves, with this 
 thought, "Do we know what we are doing, when we are hating and 
 persecuting one that speaks so admirably well?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The Pharisees endeavour to secure their officers to their interest, 
 and to beget in them prejudices against Christ, to whom they saw them 
 begin to be well affected. They suggest two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That if they embrace the gospel of Christ they will <I>deceive 
 themselves</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>):

 <I>Are you also deceived?</I> Christianity has, from its first rise, 
 been represented to the world as a great cheat upon it, and they that 
 embraced it as men <I>deceived,</I> then when they began to be 
 <I>undeceived.</I> Those that looked for a Messiah in external pomp 
 thought those deceived who believed in a Messiah that appeared in 
 poverty and disgrace; but the event declares that none were ever more 
 shamefully deceived, nor put a greater cheat upon themselves, than 
 those who promised themselves worldly wealth and secular dominion with 
 the Messiah. Observe what a <I>compliment</I> the Pharisees paid to 
 these officers: "<I>Are you also deceived?</I> What! men of your sense, 
 and thought, and figure; men that know better than to be imposed upon 
 by every pretender and upstart teacher?" They endeavour to prejudice 
 them against Christ by persuading them to think well of themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That they will <I>disparage themselves.</I> Most men, even in 
 their religion, are willing to be governed by the example of those of 
 the <I>first rank;</I> these officers therefore, whose preferments, 
 such as they were, gave them a <I>sense of honour,</I> are desired to 
 consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That, if they become disciples of Christ, they go contrary to 
 those who were persons of quality and reputation: "<I>Have any of the 
 rulers, or of the Pharisees, believed on him?</I> You know they have 
 not, and you ought to be bound up by their judgment, and to 
 <I>believe</I> and <I>do</I> in religion according to the will of your 
 superiors; will you be wiser than they?" Some of the rulers did embrace 
 Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:18,Joh+4:53">Matt. ix. 18; <I>ch.</I> iv. 53</A>),

 and more believed in him, but wanted courage to confess him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:42"><I>ch.</I> xii. 42</A>);

 but, when the interest of Christ runs low in the world, it is common
 for its adversaries to represent it as lower than really it is. But it 
 was too true that few, very few, of them did. Note, <I>First,</I> The 
 cause of Christ has seldom had rulers and Pharisees on its side. It 
 needs not secular supports, nor proposes secular advantages, and 
 therefore neither courts nor is courted by the great men of this world. 
 <I>Self-denial</I> and the <I>cross</I> are hard lessons to 
 <I>rulers</I> and Pharisees. <I>Secondly,</I> This has confirmed many
 in their prejudices against Christ and his gospel, that the rulers and 
 Pharisees have been no friends to them. Shall <I>secular</I> men 
 pretend to be more concerned about <I>spiritual</I> things than 
 spiritual men themselves, or to see further into religion than those 
 who make its study their profession? If <I>rulers</I> and 
 <I>Pharisees</I> do not believe in Christ, they that do believe in him 
 will be the most singular, unfashionable, ungenteel people in the 
 world, and quite out of the way of preferment; thus are people 
 foolishly swayed by <I>external motives</I> in matters of <I>eternal 
 moment,</I> are willing to be damned for fashion-sake, and to go to 
 hell in compliment to the <I>rulers</I> and <I>Pharisees.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That they will link themselves with the despicable vulgar sort of 
 people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>But this people, who know not the law, are cursed,</I> meaning 
 especially those that were well-affected to the doctrine of Christ. 
 Observe, <I>First,</I> How scornfully and disdainfully they speak of 
 them: <I>This people.</I> It is not <B><I>laos</I></B>, this 
 <I>lay-people,</I> distinguished from them that were the clergy, but 
 <B><I>ochlos outos</I></B>, this <I>rabble-people,</I> this pitiful, 
 scandalous, scoundrel people, whom they disdained to <I>set with the 
 dogs of their flock</I> though God had set them with the lambs of his. 
 If they meant the <I>commonalty of the Jewish nation,</I> they were the 
 seed of Abraham, and in covenant with God, and not to be spoken of with 
 such contempt. The church's common interests are betrayed when any one 
 part of it studies to render the other mean and despicable. If they 
 meant the <I>followers of Christ,</I> though they were generally 
 persons of small figure and fortune, yet by owning Christ they 
 discovered such a sagacity, integrity, and interest in the favours of 
 Heaven, as made them truly great and considerable. Note, As the wisdom 
 of God has often chosen base things, and things which are despised, so 
 the folly of men has commonly debased and despised those whom God has 
 chosen. <I>Secondly,</I> How unjustly they reproach them as ignorant
 of the word of God: <I>They know not the law;</I> as if none knew the 
 law but those that knew it <I>from them,</I> and no scripture-knowledge 
 were current but what came out of their mint; and as if none knew the 
 law but such as were observant of their canons and traditions. Perhaps 
 many of those whom they thus despised <I>knew the law,</I> and the 
 prophets too, better than they did. Many a plain, honest, unlearned 
 disciple of Christ, by meditation, experience, prayers, and especially 
 obedience, attains to a more clear, sound, and useful knowledge of the 
 word of God, than some great scholars with all their wit and learning. 
 Thus David came to understand <I>more than the ancients</I> and <I>all 
 his teachers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:99,100">Ps. cxix. 99, 100</A>.

 If the common people did not <I>know the law,</I> yet the chief priests
 and Pharisees, of all men, should not have upbraided them with this; 
 for whose fault was it but theirs, who should have <I>taught them 
 better,</I> but, instead of that, <I>took away the key of 
 knowledge?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:52">Luke xi. 52</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> How magisterially they pronounce sentence upon them:
 they are <I>cursed,</I> hateful to God, and all wise men; 
 <B><I>epikatartoi</I></B>--<I>an execrable</I> people. It is well that 
 their saying they were cursed did not make them so, for the <I>curse 
 causeless shall not come.</I> It is a usurpation of God's prerogative, 
 as well as great uncharitableness, to say of any particular persons, 
 much more of any body of people, that they are reprobates. We are 
 unable to <I>try,</I> and therefore unfit to <I>condemn,</I> and our 
 rule is, <I>Bless, and curse not.</I> Some think they meant no more 
 than that the people were <I>apt to be deceived</I> and <I>made fools 
 of;</I> but they use this odious word, They are <I>cursed,</I> to 
 express their own indignation, and to frighten their officers from 
 having any thing to do with them; thus the language of hell, in our 
 profane age, calls every thing that is displeasing <I>cursed,</I> and 
 <I>damned,</I> and <I>confounded.</I> Now, for aught that appears, 
 these officers had their convictions baffled and stifled by these 
 suggestions, and they never enquire further after Christ; one word from 
 a <I>ruler</I> or <I>Pharisee</I> will sway more with many than the 
 true reason of things, and the great interests of their souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What passed between them and Nicodemus, a member of their own body, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>,

 &c. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The just and rational objection which Nicodemus made against their 
 proceedings. Even in their corrupt and wicked sanhedrim God left not 
 himself quite <I>without</I> witness against their enmity; nor was the 
 vote against Christ carried <I>nemine 
 contradicente</I>--<I>unanimously.</I>Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Who it was that appeared against them; it was Nicodemus, <I>he 
 that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>.

 Observe, concerning him,

 [1.] That, though he had been with Jesus, and taken him for his 
 teacher, yet he retained his place in the council, and his vote among 
 them. Some impute this to his <I>weakness</I> and cowardice, and think 
 it was his fault that he did not quit his place, but Christ had never 
 said to him, <I>Follow me,</I> else he would have done as others that 
 left all to follow him; therefore it seems rather to have been his 
 <I>wisdom</I> not immediately to throw up his place, because there he 
 might have opportunity of serving Christ and his interest, and stemming 
 the tide of the Jewish rage, which perhaps he did more than we are 
 aware of. He might there be as Hushai among Absalom's counsellors, 
 instrumental to <I>turn their counsels into foolishness.</I> Though we 
 must in no case deny our Master, yet we may wait for an opportunity of 
 confessing him to the best advantage. God has his remnant among all 
 sorts, and many times finds, or puts, or makes, some good in the worst 
 places and societies. There was Daniel in Nebuchadnezzar's court, and 
 Nehemiah in Artaxerxes's. 

 [2.] That though at first he came to Jesus <I>by night,</I> for fear of 
 being known, and still continued in his post; yet, when there was 
 occasion, he boldly appeared in defence of Christ, and opposed the 
 whole council that were set against him. Thus many believers who at 
 first were timorous, and ready to <I>flee at the shaking of a leaf,</I> 
 have at length, by divine grace, grown courageous, and able to <I>laugh 
 at the shaking of a spear.</I> Let none justify the disguising of their 
 faith by the example of Nicodemus, unless, like him, they be ready upon 
 the first occasion openly to appear in the cause of Christ, though they 
 stand alone in it; for so Nicodemus did here, and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:39"><I>ch.</I> xix. 39</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What he alleged against their proceedings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>):

 <I>Doth our law judge any man before it hear him</I> (<B><I>akouse par
 autou</I></B>--<I>hear from himself</I>) and <I>know what he doeth?</I>
 By no means, nor doth the law of any civilized nation allow it.
 Observe,

 [1.] He prudently argues from the principles of their own law, and an
 incontestable rule of justice, that no man is to be condemned
 <I>unheard.</I> Had he urged the excellency of Christ's doctrine or the
 evidence of his miracles, or repeated to them his divine discourse with
 him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:1-21"><I>ch.</I> iii.</A>),

 it had been but to <I>cast pearls before swine,</I> who would
 <I>trample them under their feet,</I> and would <I>turn again and rend 
 him;</I> therefore he waives them. 

 [2.] Whereas they had reproached the people, especially the followers 
 of Christ, as <I>ignorant of the law,</I> he here tacitly retorts the 
 charge upon themselves, and shows how ignorant they were of some of the 
 first principles of the law, so unfit were they to give law to others. 
 
 [3.] The law is here said to <I>judge,</I> and <I>hear,</I> and 
 <I>know,</I> when magistrates that govern and are governed by it 
 <I>judge,</I> and <I>hear,</I> and <I>know;</I> for they are the 
 <I>mouth of the law,</I> and whatsoever they bind and loose according 
 to the law is justly said to be bound and loosed by the law. 

 [4.] It is highly fit that none should come under the <I>sentence</I> 
 of the law, till they have first by a fair trial undergone the 
 <I>scrutiny</I> of it. Judges, when they receive the complaints of the
 accuser, must always reserve in their minds room for the defence of the 
 accused, for they have two ears, to remind them to hear both sides; 
 this is said to be the manner of the Romans, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:18">Acts xxv. 18</A>.

 The method of our law is <I>Oyer</I> and <I>Terminer,</I> first to
 <I>hear</I> and then to <I>determine.</I>

 [5.] Persons are to be judged, not by what is <I>said</I> of them, but 
 by what they <I>do. Our law</I> will not ask what men's opinions are of 
 them, or out-cries against them, but, What have they done? What 
 <I>overt-acts</I> can they be convicted of? Sentence must be given,
 <I>secundum allegata et probata--according to what is alleged and 
 proved.</I> Facts, and not faces, must be known in judgment; and the 
 <I>scale</I> of justice must be used before the <I>sword</I> of 
 justice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now we may suppose that the motion Nicodemus made in the house upon 
 this was, That Jesus should be desired to come and give them an account 
 of himself and his doctrine, and that they should favour him with an 
 impartial and unprejudiced hearing; but, though none of them could 
 gainsay his maxim, none of them would second his motion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What was said to this objection. Here is no direct reply given to 
 it; but, when they could not resist the force of his argument, they 
 fell foul upon him, and what was to seek in <I>reason</I> they made up 
 in railing and reproach. Note, It is a sign of a bad cause when men 
 cannot bear to <I>hear reason,</I> and take it as an affront to be 
 reminded of its maxims. Whoever are <I>against reason</I> give cause to 
 suspect that <I>reason</I> is <I>against them.</I> See how they taunt 
 him: <I>Art thou also of Galilee?</I>

 Some think he was well enough served for continuing among those whom he 
 knew to be enemies to Christ, and for his speaking no more on the 
 behalf of Christ than what he might have said on behalf of the greatest 
 criminal-that he should not be condemned unheard. Had he said, "As for 
 this Jesus, I have heard him myself, and know he is a <I>teacher come 
 from God,</I> and you in opposing him fight against God," as he ought 
 to have said, he could not have been more abused than he was for this 
 feeble effort of his tenderness for Christ. As to what they said to 
 Nicodemus, we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How <I>false</I> the grounds of their arguing were, for, 

 [1.] They suppose that Christ was of Galilee, and this was false, and 
 if they would have been at the pains of an impartial enquiry they would 
 have found it so. 

 [2.] They suppose that because most of his disciples were Galileans 
 they were all such, whereas he had abundance of disciples in Judea. 
 
 [3.] They suppose that out of Galilee no prophet had <I>risen,</I> and 
 for this appeal to Nicodemus's search; yet this was false too: Jonah 
 was of Gath-hepher, Nahum an Elkoshite, both of Galilee. Thus do they 
 <I>make lies their refuge.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How <I>absurd</I> their arguings were upon these grounds, such as 
 were a shame to <I>rulers</I> and <I>Pharisees.</I> 

 [1.] Is any man of worth and virtue ever the worse for the poverty and 
 obscurity of his country? The Galileans were the seed of Abraham; 
 barbarians and Scythians are the seed of Adam; and <I>have we not all 
 one Father?</I> 

 [2.] Supposing no prophet had risen out of Galilee, yet it is not 
 impossible that any should arise thence. If Elijah was the first 
 prophet of Gilead (as perhaps he was), and if the Gileadites were 
 called <I>fugitives,</I> must it therefore be questioned whether he was 
 a prophet or no?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The hasty adjournment of the court hereupon. They broke up the 
 assembly in confusion, and with precipitation, and <I>every man went to 
 his own house.</I> They met to take <I>counsel together against the 
 Lord and his Anointed,</I> but they <I>imagined a vain think;</I> and 
 not only he that sits in heaven laughed at them, but we may sit on
 earth and laugh at them too, to see all the policy of the close cabal 
 broken to pieces with one plain honest word. They were not willing to 
 hear Nicodemus, because they could not answer him. As soon as they 
 perceived they had one such among them, they saw it was to no purpose 
 to go on with their design, and therefore put off the debate to a more 
 convenient season, when he was absent. Thus the counsel of the Lord is 
 made to stand, in spite of the devices in the hearts of men.</P>
