 Though in the history hitherto this evangelist seems industriously to 
 have declined the recording of such passages as had been related by the 
 other evangelists, yet, when he comes to the sufferings and death of 
 Christ, instead of passing them over, as one ashamed of his Master's 
 chain and cross, and looking upon them as the blemishes of his story, 
 he repeats what had been before related, with considerable 
 enlargements, as one that desired to know nothing but Christ and him 
 crucified, to glory in nothing save in the cross of Christ. In the 
 story of this chapter we have, 

 I. he remainder of Christ's trial before Pilate, which was tumultuous
 and confused, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:1-15">ver. 1-15</A>.

 II. Sentence given, and execution done upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>.

 III. The title over his head, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>.
 
 IV. The parting of his garment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:23,24">ver. 23, 24</A>.
 
 V. The care he took of his mother, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:25-27">ver. 25-27</A>.

 VI. The giving him vinegar to drink, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:28,29">ver. 28, 29</A>.
 
 VII. His dying word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:30">ver. 30</A>.
 
 VIII. The piercing of his side, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:31-37">ver. 31-37</A>.
 
 IX. The burial of his body, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+19:38-42">ver. 38-42</A>.

 O that in meditating on these things we may experimentally know the 
 power of Christ's death, and the fellowship of his sufferings!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 2  And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put <I>it</I> on
 his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
 &nbsp; 3  And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with
 their hands.
 &nbsp; 4  Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them,
 Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no
 fault in him.
 &nbsp; 5  Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the
 purple robe. And <I>Pilate</I> saith unto them, Behold the man!
 &nbsp; 6  When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they
 cried out, saying, Crucify <I>him,</I> crucify <I>him.</I> Pilate saith
 unto them, Take ye him, and crucify <I>him:</I> for I find no fault in
 him.
 &nbsp; 7  The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought
 to die, because he made himself the Son of God.
 &nbsp; 8  When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more
 afraid;
 &nbsp; 9  And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus,
 Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
 &nbsp; 10  Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me?
 knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have
 power to release thee?
 &nbsp; 11  Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power <I>at all</I> against
 me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that
 delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.
 &nbsp; 12  And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the
 Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not
 C&aelig;sar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against
 C&aelig;sar.
 &nbsp; 13  When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus
 forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is
 called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
 &nbsp; 14  And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the
 sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!
 &nbsp; 15  But they cried out, Away with <I>him,</I> away with <I>him,</I>
 crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King?
 The chief priests answered, We have no king but C&aelig;sar.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a further account of the unfair trial which they gave to our 
 Lord Jesus. The prosecutors carrying it on with great confusion among 
 the people, and the judge with great confusion in his own breast, 
 between both the narrative is such as is not easily reduced to method; 
 we must therefore take the parts of it as they lie.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The judge abuses the prisoner, though he declares him innocent, and 
 hopes therewith to pacify the prosecutors; wherein his intention, if 
 indeed it was good, will by no means justify his proceedings, which 
 were palpably unjust.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He ordered him to be whipped as a criminal,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 <I>Pilate,</I> seeing the people so outrageous, and being disappointed 
 in his project of releasing him upon the people's choice, <I>took 
 Jesus, and scourged him,</I> that is, appointed the lictors that 
 attended him to do it. Bede is of opinion that Pilate scourged Jesus
 himself with his own hands, because it is said, <I>He took him and 
 scourged him,</I> that it might be done favourably. Matthew and Mark 
 mention his scourging after his condemnation, but here it appears to 
 have been before. Luke speaks of Pilate's offering to <I>chastise him, 
 and let him go,</I> which must be before sentence. This scourging of 
 him was designed only to pacify the Jews, and in it Pilate put a 
 compliment upon them, that he would take their word against his own 
 sentiments so far. The Roman scourgings were ordinarily very severe, 
 not limited, as among the Jews, to <I>forty stripes;</I> yet this pain 
 and shame Christ submitted to for our sakes.

 (1.) <I>That the scripture might be fulfilled,</I> which spoke of his 
 being <I>stricken, smitten, and afflicted,</I> and <I>the chastisement 
 of our peace</I> being <I>upon him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:5">Isa. liii. 5</A>),

 of his giving his back to the smiters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:6">Isa. l. 6</A>),

 of the ploughers ploughing upon his back,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:3">Ps. cxxix. 3</A>.
 
 He himself likewise had foretold it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:19,Mk+10:34,Lu+18:33">Matt. xx. 19; 
 Mark x. 34; Luke xviii. 33</A>.

 (2.) <I>That by his stripes we might be healed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:4">1 Pet. ii. 4</A>.

 We deserved to have been chastised <I>with whips and scorpions,</I> and
 <I>beaten with many stripes,</I> having known our Lord's will and not 
 done it; but Christ underwent the stripes for us, bearing the rod of 
 his Father's wrath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:1">Lam. iii. 1</A>.

 Pilate's design in scourging him was that he might not be condemned, 
 which did not take effect, but intimated what was God's design, that 
 his being scourged might prevent our being condemned, we having 
 fellowship in his sufferings, and this did take effect: the physician 
 scourged, and so the patient healed. 

 (3.) That stripes, for his sake, might be sanctified and made easy to 
 his followers; and they might, as they did, rejoice in that shame 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:41,16:22,25">Acts v. 41; xvi. 22, 25</A>),
 
 as Paul did, who was <I>in stripes above measure,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:23">2 Cor. xi. 23</A>.

 Christ's stripes take out the sting of theirs, and alter the property 
 of them. <I>We are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned 
 with the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:32">1 Cor. xi. 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He turned him over to his soldiers, to be ridiculed and made sport 
 with as a fool 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>):

 <I>The soldiers,</I> who were the governor's life-guard, <I>put a crown 
 of thorns upon his head;</I> such a crown they thought fittest for such 
 a king; <I>they put on him a purple robe,</I> some old threadbare coat 
 of that colour, which they thought good enough to be the badge of his 
 royalty; and they complimented him with, <I>Hail, king of the Jews</I> 
 (like people like king), and then <I>smote him with their 
 hands.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) See here the baseness and injustice of Pilate, that he would 
 suffer one whom he believed an innocent person, and if so an excellent 
 person, to be thus abused and trampled on by his own servants. Those 
 who are under the arrest of the law ought to be under the protection of 
 it; and their being secured is to be their security. But Pilate did
 this, 

 [1.] To oblige his soldiers' merry humour, and perhaps his own too, 
 notwithstanding the gravity one might have expected in a judge.
 <I>Herod,</I> as well as <I>his men of war,</I> had just before done 
 the same,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:11">Luke xxiii. 11</A>.

 It was as good as a stage-play to them, now that it was a festival 
 time; as the Philistines made sport with Samson. 

 [2.] To oblige the Jews' malicious humour, and to gratify them, who 
 desired that all possible disgrace might be done to Christ, and the 
 utmost indignities put upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) See here the rudeness and insolence of the soldiers, how perfectly 
 lost they were to all justice and humanity, who could thus triumph over 
 a man in misery, and one that had been in reputation for wisdom and 
 honour, and never did any thing to forfeit it. But thus hath Christ's 
 holy religion been basely misrepresented, dressed up by bad men at 
 their pleasure, and so exposed to contempt and ridicule, as Christ was 
 here. 

 [1.] They clothe him with a mock-robe, as if it were a sham and a jest, 
 and nothing but the product of a heated fancy and a crazed imagination. 
 And as Christ is here represented as a king in conceit only, so is his 
 religion as a concern in conceit only, and God and the soul, sin and 
 duty, heaven and hell, are with many all chimeras. 

 [2.] They crown him with thorns; as if the religion of Christ were a 
 perfect penance, and the greatest pain and hardship in the world; as if 
 to submit to the control of God and conscience were to thrust one's 
 head into a thicket of thorns; but this is an unjust imputation; 
 <I>thorns and snares are in the way of the froward,</I> but roses and 
 laurels in religion's ways.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) See here the wonderful condescension of our Lord Jesus in his 
 sufferings for us. Great and generous minds can bear any thing better 
 than ignominy, any toil, any pain, any loss, rather than reproach; yet 
 this the great and holy Jesus submitted to for us. See and admire, 

 [1.] The invincible patience of a sufferer, leaving us an example of 
 contentment and courage, evenness, and easiness of spirit, under the 
 greatest hardships we may meet with in the way of duty. 

 [2.] The invincible love and kindness of a Saviour, who not only 
 cheerfully and resolutely went through all this, but voluntarily 
 undertook it for us and for our salvation. Herein he commended his 
 love, that he would not only die for us, but die as a fool dies. 
 <I>First,</I> He <I>endured the pain;</I> not the pangs of death only, 
 though in the death of the cross these were most exquisite; but, as if 
 these were too little, he submitted to those previous pains. Shall we 
 complain of a thorn in the flesh, and of being buffeted by affliction, 
 because we need it to hide pride from us, when Christ humbled himself 
 to bear those thorns in the head, and those buffetings, to save and 
 teach us?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:7">2 Cor. xii. 7</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> He <I>despised the shame,</I> the shame of a fool's 
 coat, and the mock-respect paid him, with, <I>Hail, king of the 
 Jews.</I> If we be at any time ridiculed for well-doing, let us not be 
 ashamed, but glorify God, for thus we are partakers of Christ's 
 sufferings. He that bore these sham honours was recompensed with real 
 honours, and so shall we, if we patiently suffer shame for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Pilate, having thus abused the prisoner, presents him to the 
 prosecutors, in hope that they would now be satisfied, and drop the 
 prosecution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Here he proposes two things to their consideration:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he had not found any thing in him which made him obnoxious to 
 the Roman government 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>I find no fault in him;</I> <B><I>oudemian aitian 
 heurisko</I></B>--<I>I do not find in him the least fault,</I> or 
 <I>cause of accusation.</I> Upon further enquiry, he repeats the 
 declaration he had made,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:38"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 38</A>.

 Hereby he condemns himself; if he found no fault in him, why did he
 scourge him, why did he suffer him to be abused? None ought to suffer 
 ill but those that do ill; yet thus many banter and abuse religion, who 
 yet, if they be serious, cannot but own they find no fault in it. If he 
 found no fault in him, why did he bring him out to his prosecutors, and 
 not immediately release him, as he ought to have done? If Pilate had 
 consulted his own conscience only, he would neither have scourged 
 Christ nor crucified him; but, thinking to trim the matter, to please 
 the people by scourging Christ, and save his conscience by not 
 crucifying him, behold he does both; whereas, if he had at first 
 resolved to crucify him, he need not have scourged him. It is common 
 for those who think to keep themselves from greater sins by venturing 
 upon less sins to run into both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he had done that to him which would make him the less dangerous 
 to them and to their government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He brought him out to them, wearing the crown of thorns, his head and 
 face all bloody, and said, "<I>Behold the man</I> whom you are so 
 jealous of," intimating that though his having been so popular might 
 have given them some cause to fear that his interest in the country 
 would lessen theirs, yet he had taken an effectual course to prevent 
 it, by treating him as a slave, and exposing him to contempt, after 
 which he supposed the people would never look upon him with any 
 respect, nor could he ever retrieve his reputation again. Little did 
 Pilate think with what veneration even these sufferings of Christ would 
 in after ages be commemorated by the best and greatest of men, who 
 would glory in that cross and those stripes which he thought would have 
 been to him and his followers a perpetual and indelible reproach.

 (1.) Observe here our Lord Jesus shows himself dressed up in all the 
 marks of ignominy. He came forth, willing to be made a spectacle, and 
 to be hooted at, as no doubt he was when he came forth in this garb, 
 knowing that he was set for a <I>sign that should be spoken 
 against,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:34">Luke ii. 34</A>.

 Did he go forth thus bearing our reproach? Let us go forth to him
 <I>bearing his reproach,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:13">Heb. xiii. 13</A>.

 (2.) How Pilate shows him: <I>Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man.
 He saith unto them:</I> so the original is; and, the immediate
 antecedent being <I>Jesus,</I> I see no inconvenience in supposing
 these to be Christ's own words; he said, "<I>Behold the man</I> against 
 whom you are so exasperated." But some of the Greek copies, and the 
 generality of the translators, supply it as we do, Pilate saith unto 
 them, with a design to appease them, <I>Behold the man;</I> not so much 
 to move their pity, Behold a man worthy your compassion, as to silence 
 their jealousies, Behold a man not worthy your suspicion, a man from 
 whom you can henceforth fear no danger; his crown is <I>profaned, and 
 cast to the ground,</I> and now all mankind will make a jest of him. 
 The word however is very affecting: <I>Behold the man.</I> It is good 
 for every one of us, with an eye of faith, to behold the man Christ 
 Jesus in his sufferings. <I>Behold this king with the crown wherewith
 his mother crowned him,</I> the crown of thorns, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:11">Cant. iii. 11</A>.

 "Behold him, and be suitably affected with the sight. Behold him, and 
 mourn because of him. Behold him, and love him; be still <I>looking 
 unto Jesus.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The prosecutors, instead of being pacified, were but the more 
 exasperated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Observe here their clamour and outrage. <I>The chief priests,</I> 
 who headed the mob, <I>cried out</I> with fury and indignation, and 
 their officers, or servants, who must say as they said, joined with 
 them in crying, <I>Crucify him, crucify him.</I> The common people 
 perhaps would have acquiesced in Pilate's declaration of his innocency, 
 but their leaders, the priests, <I>caused them to err.</I> Now by this 
 it appears that their malice against Christ was, 

 (1.) Unreasonable and most absurd, in that they offer not to make good 
 their charges against him, nor to object against the judgment of Pilate 
 concerning him; but, though he be innocent, he must be crucified. 

 (2.) It was insatiable and very cruel. Neither the extremity of his 
 scourging, nor his patience under it, nor the tender expostulations of 
 the judge, could mollify them in the least; no, nor could the jest into 
 which Pilate had turned the cause, put them into a pleasant humour.
 
 (3.) It was violent and exceedingly resolute; they will have it their 
 own way, and hazard the governor's favour, the peace of the city, and 
 their own safety, rather than abate of the utmost of their demands.
 Were they so violent in running down our Lord Jesus, and in crying, 
 <I>Crucify him, crucify him?</I> and shall not we be vigorous and 
 zealous in advancing his name, and in crying, <I>Crown him, Crown 
 him?</I> Did their hatred of him sharpen their endeavours against him?
 and shall not our love to him quicken our endeavours for him and his 
 kingdom?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The check Pilate gave to their fury, still insisting upon the 
 prisoner's innocency: "<I>Take you him and crucify him,</I> if he must 
 be crucified." This is spoken ironically; he knew they could not, they 
 durst not, crucify him; but it is as if he should say, "You shall not 
 make me a drudge to your malice; I cannot with a safe conscience 
 crucify him." A good resolve, if he would but have stuck to it. He 
 found no fault in him, and therefore should not have continued to 
 parley with the prosecutors. Those that would be safe from sin should
 be deaf to temptation. Nay, he should have secured the prisoner from 
 their insults. What was he armed with power for, but to protect the 
 injured? The guards of governors ought to be the guards of justice. But 
 Pilate had not courage enough to act according to his conscience; and 
 his cowardice betrayed him into a snare.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The further colour which the prosecutors gave to their demand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>We have a law, and by our law,</I> if it were but in our power to 
 execute it, <I>he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of 
 God.</I> Now here observe, 

 (1.) They <I>made their boast of the law,</I> even when <I>through 
 breaking the law they dishonoured God,</I> as is charged upon the Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:23">Rom. ii. 23</A>.

 They had indeed an excellent law, far exceeding the statutes and
 judgments of other nations; but in vain did they boast of their law, 
 when they abused it to such bad purposes.

 (2.) They discover a restless and inveterate malice against our Lord 
 Jesus. When they could not incense Pilate against him by alleging that 
 he pretended himself a king, they urged this, that he pretended himself 
 a God. Thus they turn every stone to take him off. 

 (3.) They pervert the law, and make that the instrument of their 
 malice. Some think they refer to a law made particularly against 
 Christ, as if, being a law, it must be executed, right or wrong; 
 whereas there is a woe to them that <I>decree unrighteous decrees,</I> 
 and that <I>write the grievousness which they have prescribed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:1">Isa. x. 1</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:16">Mic. vi. 16</A>.

 But it should seem they rather refer to the law of Moses; and if so,
 
 [1.] It was true that blasphemers, idolaters, and false prophets, were
 to be put to death by that law. Whoever falsely pretended to be the Son
 of God was guilty of blasphemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:16">Lev. xxiv. 16</A>.

 But then, 

 [2.] It was false that Christ pretended to be the Son of God, for he 
 really was so; and they ought to have enquired into the proofs he 
 produced of his being so. If he said that he was the Son of God, and 
 the scope and tendency of his doctrine were not to draw people from 
 God, but to bring them to him, and if he confirmed his mission and 
 doctrine by miracles, as undoubtedly he did, beyond contradiction, by 
 their law they ought to <I>hearken to him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:18,19">Deut. xviii. 18, 19</A>),

 and, if they did not, they were to be <I>cut off.</I> That which was 
 his honour, and might have been their happiness, if they had not stood 
 in their own light, they impute to him as a crime, for which he ought 
 not to be crucified, for this was no death inflicted by their law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The judge brings the prisoner again to his trial, upon this new 
 suggestion. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The concern Pilate was in, when he heard this alleged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 When he heard that his prisoner pretended not to royalty only, but to 
 deity, he was <I>the more afraid.</I> This embarrassed him more than 
 ever, and made the case more difficult both ways; for, 

 (1.) There was the more danger of offending the people if he should 
 acquit him, for he knew how jealous that people were for the unity of 
 the Godhead, and what aversion they now had to other gods; and 
 therefore, though he might hope to pacify their rage against a 
 pretended king, he could never reconcile them to a pretended God. "If 
 this be at the bottom of the tumult," thinks Pilate, "it will not be 
 turned off with a jest." 

 (2.) There was the more danger of offending his own conscience if he 
 should condemn him. "Is he one" (thinks Pilate) "that makes himself 
 <I>the Son of God?</I> and what if it should prove that he is so? What 
 will become of me then?" Even natural conscience makes men afraid of 
 being found <I>fighting against God.</I> The heathen had some fabulous 
 traditions of incarnate deities appearing sometimes in mean 
 circumstances, and treated ill by some that paid dearly for their so 
 doing. Pilate fears lest he should thus run himself into a 
 premunire.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His further examination of our Lord Jesus thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 That he might give the prosecutors all the fair play they could desire, 
 he resumed the debate, went into the judgment-hall, and asked Christ, 
 <I>Whence art thou?</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The place he chose for this examination: He <I>went into the 
 judgment-hall</I> for privacy, that he might be out of the noise and 
 clamour of the crowd, and might examine the thing the more closely. 
 Those that would find out the truth as it is in Jesus must get out of 
 the noise of prejudice, and retire as it were into the judgment-hall, 
 to converse with Christ alone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The question he put to him: <I>Whence art thou?</I> Art thou from 
 men or from heaven? From beneath or from above? He had before asked 
 directly, <I>Art thou a King?</I> But here he does not directly ask, 
 <I>Art thou the Son of God?</I> lest he should seem to meddle with 
 divine things too boldly. But in general, "<I>Whence art thou?</I> 
 Where wast thou, and in what world hadst thou a being, before thy 
 coming into this world?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The silence of our Lord Jesus when he was examined upon this head; 
 but <I>Jesus gave him no answer.</I> This was not a sullen silence, in 
 contempt of the court, nor was it because he knew not what to say; but, 
 
 [1.] It was a patient silence, that the scripture might be fulfilled, 
 <I>as a sheep before the shearers is dumb, so he opened not his 
 mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:7">Isa. liii. 7</A>.

 This silence loudly bespoke his submission to his Father's will in his
 present sufferings, which he thus accommodated himself to, and composed 
 himself to bear. He was silent, because he would say nothing to hinder 
 his sufferings. If Christ had avowed himself a God as plainly as he 
 avowed himself a king, it is probable that Pilate would not have 
 condemned him (for he was afraid at the mention of it by the 
 prosecutors); and the Romans, though they triumphed over the <I>kings 
 of the nations</I> they conquered, yet stood in awe of their gods. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>.

 <I>If they had known</I> him to be the <I>Lord of glory,</I> they would
 <I>not have crucified him;</I> and how then could we have been saved?
 
 [2.] It was a prudent silence. When the chief priests asked him, <I>Art 
 thou the Son of the Blessed?</I> he answered, <I>I am,</I> for he knew 
 they went upon the scriptures of the Old Testament which spoke of the 
 Messiah; but when Pilate asked him he knew he did not understand his 
 own question, having no notion of the Messiah, and of his being the 
 <I>Son of God,</I> and therefore to what purpose should he reply to him 
 whose head was filled with the pagan theology, to which he would have 
 turned his answer?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The haughty check which Pilate gave him for his silence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 "<I>Speakest thou not unto me?</I> Dost thou put such an affront upon 
 me as to stand mute? What <I>knowest thou not</I> that, as president of 
 the province, <I>I have power,</I> if I think fit, <I>to crucify thee, 
 and have power,</I> if I think fit, to <I>release thee?</I>" Observe 
 here, 

 [1.] How Pilate magnified himself, and boasts of his own authority, as 
 not inferior to that of Nebuchadnezzar, of whom it is said that <I>whom 
 he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:19">Dan. v. 19</A>.

 Men in power are apt to be puffed up with their power, and the more 
 absolute and arbitrary it is the more it gratifies and humours their 
 pride. But he magnifies his power to an exorbitant degree when he 
 boasts that he has power to crucify one whom he had declared innocent, 
 for no prince or potentate has authority to do wrong. <I>Id possumus, 
 quod jure possumus--We can do that only which we can do justly.</I> 
 
 [2.] How he tramples upon our blessed Saviour: <I>Speakest thou not 
 unto me?</I> He reflects upon him, <I>First,</I> As if he were 
 undutiful and disrespectful to those in authority, not speaking when he 
 was spoken to. <I>Secondly,</I> As if he were ungrateful to one that 
 had been tender of him: "Speakest thou not to me who have laboured to 
 secure thy release?" <I>Thirdly,</I> As if he were unwise for himself: 
 "Wilt thou not speak to clear thyself to one that is willing to clear 
 thee?" If Christ had indeed sought to save his life, now had been his 
 time to have spoken; but that which he had to do was to lay down his 
 life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Christ's pertinent answer to this check, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>,
 
 where,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He boldly rebukes his arrogance, and rectifies his mistake: "Big 
 as thou lookest and talkest, <I>thou couldest have no power at all 
 against me,</I> no power to scourge, no power to crucify, <I>except it 
 were given thee from above.</I>" Though Christ did not think fit to 
 answer him when he was impertinent (then <I>answer not a fool according 
 to his folly, lest thou also be like him</I>), yet he did think fit to 
 answer him when he was imperious; then <I>answer a fool according to 
 his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:4,5">Prov. xxvi. 4, 5</A>.

 When Pilate used his power, Christ silently submitted to it; but, when 
 he grew proud of it, he made him know himself: "All the power thou hast 
 is given thee from above," which may be taken two ways:--<I>First,</I> 
 As reminding him that his power in general, as a magistrate, was a 
 limited power, and he could do no more than God would suffer him to do. 
 God is the fountain of power; and the <I>powers that are,</I> as they 
 are ordained by him and derived from him, so they are subject to him. 
 They ought to go no further than his law directs them; they can go no 
 further than his providence permits them. They are God's hand and his 
 sword,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:13,14">Ps. xvii. 13, 14</A>.

 Though the axe may <I>boast itself against him that heweth
 therewith,</I> yet still it is but a tool, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:5,15">Isa. x. 5, 15</A>.

 Let the proud oppressors know that there is <I>a higher than they,</I>
 to whom they are accountable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:8">Eccl. v. 8</A>.

 And let this silence the murmurings of the oppressed, <I>It is the 
 Lord.</I> God has bidden Shimei curse David; and let it comfort them 
 that their persecutors can do no more than God will let them. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12,13">Isa. li. 12, 13</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> As informing him that his power against him in 
 particular, and all the efforts of that power, were <I>by the 
 determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>.

 Pilate never fancied himself to look so great as now, when he sat in 
 judgment upon such a prisoner as this, who was looked upon by many as 
 the <I>Son of God</I> and king of Israel, and had the fate of so great 
 a man at his disposal; but Christ lets him know that he was herein but 
 an instrument in God's hand, and could no nothing against him, but by 
 the appointment of Heaven,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:27,28">Acts iv. 27, 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He mildly excuses and extenuates his sin, in comparison with the 
 sin of the ringleaders: "<I>Therefore he that delivered me unto 
 thee</I> lies under greater guilt; for thou as a magistrate hast 
 <I>power from above,</I> and art in thy place, thy sin is less than 
 theirs who, from envy and malice, urge thee to abuse thy power."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> It is plainly intimated that what Pilate did was sin, a 
 great sin, and that the force which the Jews put upon him, and which he 
 put upon himself in it, would not justify him. Christ hereby intended a 
 hint for the awakening of his conscience and the increase of the fear 
 he was now under. The guilt of others will not acquit us, nor will it 
 avail in the great day to say that others were worse than we, for we 
 are not to be judged by comparison, but must <I>bear our own 
 burden.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Yet theirs that delivered him to Pilate was the 
 greater sin. By this it appears that all sins are not equal, but some
 more heinous than others; some comparatively as gnats, others as 
 camels; some as motes in the eyes, others as beams; some as pence, 
 others as pounds.  <I>He that delivered Christ to Pilate</I> was 
 either,

 1. The people of the Jews, who cried out, <I>Crucify him, crucify
 him.</I> They had seen Christ's miracles, which Pilate had not; to them 
 the Messiah was first sent; they were his own; and to them, who were 
 now enslaved, a Redeemer should have been most welcome, and therefore 
 it was much worse in them to appear against him than in Pilate. 

 2. Or rather he means Caiaphas in particular, who was at the head of
 the conspiracy against Christ, and first advised his death,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:49,50"><I>ch.</I> xi. 49, 50</A>.

 The sin of Caiaphas was abundantly greater than the sin of Pilate. 
 Caiaphas prosecuted Christ from pure enmity to him and his doctrine, 
 deliberately and of malice prepense. Pilate condemned him purely for 
 fear of the people, and it was a hasty resolution which he had not time 
 to cool upon. 

 3. Some think Christ means Judas; for, though he did not immediately
 deliver him into the hands of Pilate, yet he betrayed him to those that 
 did. The sin of Judas was, upon many accounts, greater than the sin of 
 Pilate. Pilate was a stranger to Christ; Judas was his friend and 
 follower. Pilate found no fault in him, but Judas knew a great deal of 
 good of him. Pilate, though biassed, was not bribed, but Judas took a 
 <I>reward against the innocent;</I> the sin of Judas was a leading sin, 
 and let in all that followed. He was a <I>guide to them that took 
 Jesus.</I> So great was the sin of Judas that <I>vengeance suffered him 
 not to live;</I> but when Christ said this, or soon after, he was gone 
 <I>to his own place.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Pilate struggles with the Jews to deliver Jesus out of their hands, 
 but in vain. We hear no more after this of any thing that passed 
 between Pilate and the prisoner; what remains lay between him and the 
 prosecutors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Pilate seems more zealous than before to get Jesus discharged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Thenceforth,</I> from this time, and for this reason, because Christ 
 had given him that answer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 which, though it had a rebuke in it, yet he took kindly; and, though 
 Christ found fault with him, he still continued to find no fault in 
 Christ, but <I>sought to release him,</I> desired it, endeavoured it. 
 <I>He sought to release him;</I> he contrived how to do it handsomely 
 and safely, and so as not to disoblige the priests. It never does well 
 when our resolutions to do our duty are swallowed up in projects how to 
 do it plausibly and conveniently. If Pilate's policy had not prevailed 
 above his justice, he would not have been long seeking to release him, 
 but would have done it. <I>Fiat justitia, ruat c&oelig;lum</I>--<I>Let
 justice be done, though heaven itself should fall.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The Jews were more furious than ever, and more violent to get Jesus 
 crucified. Still they carry on their design with noise and clamour as 
 before; so now they cried out. They would have it thought that the 
 commonalty was against him, and therefore laboured to get him cried 
 down by a multitude, and it is no hard matter to pack a mob; whereas, 
 if a fair poll had been granted, I doubt not but it would have been 
 carried by a great majority for the releasing of him. A few madmen may 
 out-shout many wise men, and then fancy themselves to speak the sense 
 (when it is but the nonsense) of a nation, or of all mankind; but it is 
 not so easy a thing to change the sense of the people as it is to 
 misrepresent it, and to change their cry. Now that Christ was in the 
 hands of his enemies his friends were shy and silent, and disappeared, 
 and those that were against him were forward to show themselves so; and 
 this gave the chief priests an opportunity to represent it as the 
 concurring vote of all the Jews that he should be crucified. In this 
 outcry they sought two things:--

 (1.) To blacken the prisoner as an enemy to C&aelig;sar. He had refused 
 the kingdoms of this world and the glory of them, had declared his 
 kingdom not to be of this world, and yet they will have it that he 
 <I>speaks against C&aelig;sar;</I> <B><I>antilegei</I></B>--<I>he 
 opposes C&aelig;sar,</I> invades his dignity and sovereignty. It has 
 always been the artifice of the enemies of religion to represent it as 
 hurtful to kings and provinces, when it would be highly beneficial to 
 both. 

 (2.) To frighten the judge, as no friend to C&aelig;sar: "If thou 
 <I>let this man go</I> unpunished, and let him go on, <I>thou art not 
 C&aelig;sar's friend,</I> and therefore false to thy trust and the duty 
 of thy place, obnoxious to the emperor's displeasure, and liable to be 
 turned out." They intimate a threatening that they would inform against 
 him, and get him displaced; and here they touched him in a sensible and 
 very tender part. But, of all people, these Jews should not have 
 pretended a concern for C&aelig;sar, who were themselves so ill 
 affected to him and his government. They should not talk of being 
 friends to C&aelig;sar, who were themselves such back friends to him; 
 yet thus a pretended zeal for that which is good often serves to cover 
 a real malice against that which is better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. When other expedients had been tried in vain, Pilate slightly 
 endeavoured to banter them out of their fury, and yet, in doing this, 
 betrayed himself to them, and yielded to the rapid stream, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:13-15"><I>v.</I> 13-15</A>.
 
 After he had stood it out a great while, and seemed now as if he would 
 have made a vigorous resistance upon this attack 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 he basely surrendered. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What it was that shocked Pilate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>When he heard that saying,</I> that he could not be true to 
 C&aelig;sar's honour, nor sure of C&aelig;sar's favour, if he did not 
 put Jesus to death, then he thought it was time to look about him. All 
 they had said to prove Christ a malefactor, and that therefore it was 
 Pilate's duty to condemn him, did not move him, but he still kept to 
 his conviction of Christ's innocency; but, when they urged that it was 
 his interest to condemn him, then he began to yield. Note, Those that 
 bind up their happiness in the favour of men make themselves an easy 
 prey to the temptations of Satan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What preparation was made for a definitive sentence upon this 
 matter: <I>Pilate brought Jesus forth,</I> and he himself in great 
 state took the chair. We may suppose that he called for his robes, that 
 he might look big, and then <I>sat down in the judgment-seat.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Christ was condemned with all the ceremony that could be. 
 <I>First,</I> To bring us off at God's bar, and that all believers 
 through Christ, being judged here, might be acquitted in the court of 
 heaven. <I>Secondly,</I> To take off the terror of pompous trials, 
 which his followers would be brought to for his sake. Paul might the 
 better stand at C&aelig;sar's judgment-seat when his Master had stood there
 before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Notice is here taken of the place and time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The place where Christ was condemned: in a <I>place 
 called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha,</I> probably the place 
 where he used to sit to try causes or criminals. Some make 
 <I>Gabbatha</I> to signify an <I>enclosed place,</I> fenced against the 
 insults of the people, whom therefore he did the less need to fear; 
 others an <I>elevated place,</I> raised that all might see him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It was the preparation of the passover, and <I>about the sixth 
 hour.</I> Observe, 

 1. The day: It was the preparation of the passover, that is, for the 
 passover-sabbath, and the solemnities of that and the rest of the days
 of the feast of unleavened bread. This is plain from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:54">Luke xxiii. 54</A>,

 <I>It was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</I> So that this
 preparation was for the sabbath. Note, Before the passover there ought 
 to be preparation. This is mentioned as an aggravation of their sin, in 
 persecuting Christ with so much malice and fury, that it was when they 
 should have been purging out the old leaven, to get ready for the 
 passover; but the better the day the worse the deed. 

 2. The hour: <I>It was about the sixth hour.</I> Some ancient Greek and
 Latin manuscripts read it about the third hour, which agrees with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:25">Mark xv. 25</A>.

 And it appears by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:45">Matt. xxvii. 45</A>

 that he was upon the cross before the sixth hour. But it should seem
 to come in here, not as a precise determination of the time, but as an
 additional aggravation of the sin of his prosecutors, that they were
 pushing on the prosecution, not only on a solemn day, the <I>day of the
 preparation,</I> but, from the third to the sixth hour (which was, as
 we call it, church-time) on that day, they were employed in this
 wickedness; so that for this day, though they were priests, they
 dropped the temple-service, for they did not leave Christ till the
 sixth hour, when the darkness began, which frightened them away. Some 
 think that the sixth hour, with this evangelist, is, according to the 
 Roman reckoning and ours, six of the clock in the morning, answering to 
 the Jews' first hour of the day; this is very probable, that Christ's 
 trial before Pilate was at the height about six in the morning, which 
 was then a little after sun-rising.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The rencounter Pilate had with the Jews, both priests and people, 
 before he proceeded to give judgment, endeavouring in vain to stem the 
 tide of their rage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He saith unto the Jews, <I>Behold your king.</I> This is a reproof 
 to them for the absurdity and malice of their insinuating that this 
 Jesus made himself a king: "<I>Behold your king,</I> that is, him whom 
 you accuse as a pretender to the crown. Is this a man likely to be
 dangerous to the government? I am satisfied he is not, and you may be 
 so too, and let him alone." Some think he hereby upbraids them with 
 their secret disaffection to C&aelig;sar: "You would have this man to be
 your king, if he would but have headed a rebellion against C&aelig;sar." But
 Pilate, though he was far from meaning so, seems as if he were the 
 voice of God to them. Christ, now crowned with thorns, is, as a king at 
 his coronation, offered to the people: "<I>Behold your king,</I> the 
 king whom God hath set upon his holy hill of Zion;" but they, instead 
 of entering into it with acclamations of joyful consent, protest 
 against him; they will not have a king of God's choosing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] They cried out with the greatest indignation, <I>Away with him, 
 away with him,</I> which speaks disdain as well as malice, <B><I>aron, 
 aron</I></B>--"<I>Take him,</I> he is none of ours; we disown him for 
 our kinsman, much more for our king; we have not only no veneration for 
 him, but no compassion; <I>away with him</I> out of our sight:" for so 
 it was written of him, he is one <I>whom the nation abhors</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:7">Isa. xlix. 7</A>),
 
 and they <I>hid as it were their faces from him</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2,3">Isa. liii. 2, 3</A>.
 
 <I>Away with him from the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:22">Acts xxii. 22</A>.

 This shows, <I>First,</I> How we deserved to have been treated at God's 
 tribunal. We were by sin become odious to God's holiness, which cried,
 <I>Away with them, away with them,</I> for God is <I>of purer eyes than 
 to behold iniquity.</I> We were also become obnoxious to God's justice, 
 which cried against us, "<I>Crucify them, crucify them,</I> let the 
 sentence of the law be executed." Had not Christ interposed, and been 
 thus rejected of men, we had been for ever rejected of God.
 <I>Secondly,</I> It shows how we ought to treat our sins. We are often 
 in scripture said to crucify sin, in conformity to Christ's death. Now 
 they that crucified Christ did it with detestation. With a pious 
 indignation we should run down sin in us, as they with an impious 
 indignation ran him down who was made sin for us. The true penitent 
 casts away from him his transgressions, <I>Away with them, away with 
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:20,30:22">Isa. ii. 20; xxx. 22</A>),

 <I>crucify them, crucify them;</I> it is not fit that they should live 
 in my soul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hos+14:8">Hos. xiv. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Pilate, willing to have Jesus released, and yet that it should be 
 their doing, asks them, <I>Shall I crucify your king?</I> In saying 
 this, he designed either, <I>First,</I> To stop their mouths, by 
 showing them how absurd it was for them to reject one who offered 
 himself to them to be their king at a time when they needed one more 
 than ever. Have they no sense of slavery? No desire of liberty? No 
 value for a deliverer? Though he saw no cause to fear him, they might 
 see cause to hope for something from him; since crushed and sinking 
 interests are ready to catch at any thing. Or, <I>Secondly,</I> To stop 
 the mouth of his own conscience. "If this Jesus be a king" (thinks 
 Pilate), "he is only kin of the Jews, and therefore I have nothing to 
 do but to make a fair tender of him to them; if they refuse him, and 
 will have their king crucified, what is that to me?" He banters them 
 for their folly in expecting a Messiah, and yet running down one that 
 bade so fair to be he.</P>

 We have here sentence of death passed upon our Lord Jesus, and 
 execution done soon after. A mighty struggle Pilate had had within him 
 between his convictions and his corruptions; but at length his 
 convictions yielded, and his corruptions prevailed, the fear of man 
 having a greater power over him than the fear of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>Pilate gave judgment</I> against Christ, and signed the warrant 
 for his execution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 We may see here, 

 1. How Pilate sinned against his conscience: he had again and again 
 pronounced him innocent, and yet at last condemned him as guilty. 
 Pilate, since he came to be governor, had in many instances disobliged 
 and exasperated the Jewish nation; for he was a man of a haughty and 
 implacable spirit, and extremely wedded to his humour. He had seized 
 upon the Corban, and spent it upon a water-work; he had brought into 
 Jerusalem shields stamped with C&aelig;sar's image, which was very 
 provoking to the Jews; he had sacrificed the lives of many to his 
 resolutions herein. Fearing therefore that he should be complained of 
 for these and other insolences, he was willing to gratify the Jews. Now 
 this makes the matter much worse. If he had been of an easy, soft, and 
 pliable disposition, his yielding to so strong a stream had been the 
 more excusable; but for a man that was so wilful in other things, and 
 of so fierce a resolution, to be overcome in a thing of this nature, 
 shows him to be a bad man indeed, that could better bear the wronging 
 of his conscience than the crossing of his humour.

 2. How he endeavoured to transfer the guilt upon the Jews. He 
 <I>delivered him</I> not to his own officers (as usual), but to the 
 prosecutors, the chief priests and elders; so excusing the wrong to his 
 own conscience with this, that it was but a permissive condemnation, 
 and that he did not put Christ to death, but only connived at those 
 that did it. 

 3. How Christ was <I>made sin for us.</I> We deserved to have been
 condemned, but Christ was condemned for us, that to us there might be 
 <I>no condemnation.</I> God was now entering into judgment with his 
 Son, that he might not enter into judgment with his servants.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Judgment was no sooner given than with all possible expedition the 
 prosecutors, having gained their point, resolved to lose not time lest 
 Pilate should change his mind, and order a reprieve (those are enemies 
 to our souls, the worst of enemies, that hurry us to sin, and then 
 leave us no room to undo what we have done amiss), and also lest there 
 should be <I>an uproar among the people,</I> and they should find a 
 greater number against them than they had with so much artifice got to 
 be for them. It were well if we would be thus expeditious in that which 
 is good, and not stay for more difficulties.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They immediately hurried away the prisoner. The chief priests 
 greedily flew upon the prey which they had been long waiting for; now 
 it is drawn into their net. Or <I>they,</I> that is, the soldiers who 
 were to attend the execution, they took him and led him away, not to 
 the place whence he came, and thence to the place of execution, as is 
 usual with us, but directly to the place of execution. Both the priests
 and the soldiers joined in leading him away. Now was the <I>Son of man
 delivered into the hands of men,</I> wicked and unreasonable men. By
 the law of Moses (and in appeals by our law) the prosecutors were to be
 the executioners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:7">Deut. xvii. 7</A>.

 And the priests here were proud of the office. His being <I>led 
 away</I> does not suppose him to have made any opposition, but <I>the 
 scripture must be fulfilled,</I> he was <I>led as a sheep to the 
 slaughter,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:32">Acts viii. 32</A>.

 We deserved to have been <I>led forth with the workers of iniquity</I> 
 as criminals to execution,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:5">Ps. cxxv. 5</A>.

 But he was led forth for us, that we might escape.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To add to his misery, they obliged him as long as he was able, to 
 carry his cross 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 according to the custom among the Romans; hence <I>Furcifer</I> was 
 among them a name of reproach. Their crosses did not stand up 
 constantly, as our gibbets do in the places of execution, because the 
 malefactor was nailed to the cross as it lay along upon the ground, and 
 then it was lifted up, and fastened in the earth, and removed when the 
 execution was over, and commonly buried with the body; so that every 
 one that was crucified had a cross of his own. Now Christ's carrying 
 his cross may be considered, 

 (1.) As a part of his sufferings; he endured the cross literally. It 
 was a long and thick piece of timber that was necessary for such a use, 
 and some think it was neither seasoned nor hewn. The blessed body of 
 the Lord Jesus was tender, and unaccustomed to such burdens; it had now 
 lately been harassed and tired out; his shoulders were sore with the 
 stripes they had given him; every jog of the cross would renew his 
 smart, and be apt to strike the thorns he was crowned with into his 
 head; yet all this he patiently underwent, and it was but the 
 <I>beginning of sorrows.</I> 

 (2.) As answering the type which went before him; Isaac, when he was to 
 be offered, carried the wood on which he was to be bound and with which 
 he was to be burned. 

 (3.) As very significant of his undertaking, the Father having <I>laid 
 upon him the iniquity of us all</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:6">Isa. liii. 6</A>),

 and he having to <I>take away sin</I> by <I>bearing it in his own body 
 upon the tree,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:24">1 Pet. ii. 24</A>.

 He had said in effect, <I>On me be the curse;</I> for he was made a
 curse for us, and therefore on him was the cross. 

 (4.) As very instructive to us. Our Master hereby taught all his 
 disciples to take up their cross, and follow him. Whatever cross he 
 calls us out to bear at any time, we must remember that he bore the 
 cross first, and, by bearing it for us, bears it off from us in great 
 measure, for thus he hath made <I>his yoke easy, and his burden 
 light.</I> He bore that end of the cross that had the curse upon it; 
 this was the heavy end; and hence all that are his are enabled to call 
 their afflictions for him <I>light,</I> and <I>but for a 
 moment.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They brought him to the place of execution: He <I>went forth,</I> 
 not dragged against his will, but voluntary in his sufferings. He went 
 forth out of the city, for he was <I>crucified without the gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:12">Heb. xiii. 12</A>.

 And, to put the greater infamy upon his sufferings, he was brought to
 the common place of execution, as one in all points <I>numbered among 
 the transgressors,</I> a place called <I>Golgotha, the place of a 
 skull,</I> where they threw dead men's skulls and bones, or where the 
 heads of beheaded malefactors were left,--a place <I>ceremonially 
 unclean;</I> there Christ suffered, because he was <I>made sin for 
 us,</I> that he might <I>purge our consciences from dead works,</I> and 
 the pollution of them. If one would take notice of the traditions of 
 the elders, there are two which are mentioned by many of the ancient 
 writers concerning this place:--

 (1.) That Adam was buried here, and that this was the place of his 
 skull, and they observe that where death triumphed over the first Adam 
 there the second Adam triumphed over him. Gerhard quotes for this 
 tradition Origen, Cyprian, Epiphanius, Austin, Jerome, and others. 

 (2.) That this was that mountain in the land of Moriah on which Abraham 
 offered up Isaac, and the ram was a ransom for Isaac.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. There they crucified him, and the other malefactors with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 <I>There they crucified him.</I> Observe 

 (1.) What death Christ died; the death of the cross, a bloody, painful, 
 shameful death, a cursed death. He was nailed to the cross, as a 
 sacrifice bound to the altar, as a Saviour fixed for his undertaking; 
 his ear nailed to God's door-post, to serve him for ever. He was lifted 
 up as the brazen serpent, hung between heaven and earth because we were 
 unworthy of either, and abandoned by both. His hands were stretched out 
 to invite and embrace us; he hung upon the tree some hours, dying 
 gradually in the full use of reason and speech, that he might actually 
 resign himself a sacrifice. 

 (2.) In what company he died: <I>Two others with him.</I> Probably 
 these would not have been executed at that time, but at the request of 
 the chief priests, to add to the disgrace of our Lord Jesus, which 
 might be the reason why one of them reviled him, because their death 
 was hastened for his sake. Had they taken two of his disciples, and 
 crucified them with him, it had been an honour to him; but, if such as 
 they had been partakers with him in suffering, it would have looked as 
 if they had been undertakers with him in satisfaction. Therefore it
 was ordered that his fellow-sufferers should be the worst of sinners, 
 that he might <I>bear our reproach,</I> and that the merit might appear 
 to be his only. This exposed him much to the people's contempt and 
 hatred, who are apt to judge of persons by the lump, and are not 
 curious in distinguishing, and would conclude him not only malefactor 
 because he was yoked with malefactors, but the worst of the three 
 because put in the midst. But thus the scripture was fulfilled, <I>He 
 was numbered among the transgressors.</I> He did not die at the altar 
 among the sacrifices, nor mingle his blood with that of bulls and 
 goats; but he died among the criminals, and mingled his blood with 
 theirs who were sacrificed to public justice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And now let us pause awhile, and with an eye of faith look upon Jesus. 
 Was ever sorrow like unto his sorrow? See him who was clothed with 
 glory stripped of it all, and clothed with shame-him who was the 
 <I>praise of angels</I> made a <I>reproach of men</I>--him who had been 
 with eternal delight and joy in the bosom of his Father now in the 
 extremities of pain and agony. See him bleeding, see him struggling, 
 see him dying, see him and love him, love him and live to him, and 
 study what we shall render.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  And Pilate wrote a title, and put <I>it</I> on the cross. And the
 writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
 &nbsp; 20  This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where
 Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in
 Hebrew, <I>and</I> Greek, <I>and</I> Latin.
 &nbsp; 21  Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write
 not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the
 Jews.
 &nbsp; 22  Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
 &nbsp; 23  Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his
 garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also
 <I>his</I> coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top
 throughout.
 &nbsp; 24  They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it,
 but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might
 be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and
 for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the
 soldiers did.
 &nbsp; 25  Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
 mother's sister, Mary the <I>wife</I> of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
 &nbsp; 26  When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple
 standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman,
 behold thy son!
 &nbsp; 27  Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from
 that hour that disciple took her unto his own <I>home.</I>
 &nbsp; 28  After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now
 accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I
 thirst.
 &nbsp; 29  Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled
 a sponge with vinegar, and put <I>it</I> upon hyssop, and put <I>it</I> to
 his mouth.
 &nbsp; 30  When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It
 is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are some remarkable circumstances of Christ's dying more fully 
 related than before, which those will take special notice of who covet 
 to know Christ and him crucified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The title set up over his head. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The inscription itself which Pilate wrote, and ordered to be fixed 
 to the top of the cross, declaring the cause for which he was 
 crucified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Matthew called it, <B><I>aitia</I></B>--<I>the accusation;</I> Mark and
 Luke called it <B><I>epigraphe</I></B>--<I>the inscription;</I> John 
 calls it by the proper Latin name, <B><I>titlos</I></B>--<I>the 
 title:</I> and it was this, <I>Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the 
 Jews,</I> Pilate intended this for his reproach, that he, being 
 <I>Jesus of Nazareth,</I> should pretend to be king of the Jews, and 
 set up in competition with C&aelig;sar, to whom Pilate would thus 
 recommend himself, as very jealous for his honour and interest, when he 
 would treat but a titular king, a king in metaphor, as the worst of 
 malefactors; but God overruled this matter,

 (1.) That it might be a further testimony to the innocency of our Lord 
 Jesus; for here was an accusation which, as it was worded, contained no 
 crime. If this be all they have to lay to his charge, surely he has 
 done nothing worthy of death or of bonds. 

 (2.) That it might show forth his dignity and honour. This is Jesus a 
 Saviour, <B><I>Nazoraios</I></B>, the blessed Nazarite, sanctified to 
 God; this is the <I>king of the Jews, Messiah the prince,</I> the 
 <I>sceptre</I> that <I>should rise out of Israel,</I> as Balaam had 
 foretold; dying for the good of his people, as Caiaphas had foretold. 
 Thus all these three bad men witnessed to Christ, though they meant not 
 so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The notice taken of this inscription 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Many of the Jews read it,</I> not only those of Jerusalem, but those 
 out of the country, and from other countries, strangers and proselytes, 
 that came up to worship at the feast. Multitudes read it, and it 
 occasioned a great variety of reflections and speculations, as men 
 stood affected. Christ himself was set for a sign, a title. Here are 
 two reasons why the title was so much read:--

 (1.) Because the place where Jesus was crucified, though without the 
 gate, was yet <I>nigh the city,</I> which intimates that if it had been 
 any great distance off they would not have been led, no not by their 
 curiosity, to go and see it, and read it. It is an advantage to have 
 the means of knowing Christ brought to our doors.

 (2.) Because it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin, which made 
 it legible by all; they all understood one or other of these languages, 
 and none were more careful to bring up their children to read than the 
 Jews generally were. It likewise made it the more considerable; 
 everyone would be curious to enquire what it was which was so 
 industriously published in the three most known languages. In the 
 Hebrew the oracles of God were recorded; in Greek the learning of the 
 philosophers; and in Latin the laws of the empire. In each of these 
 Christ is proclaimed king, in whom are hid all the treasures of 
 revelation, wisdom, and power. God so ordering it that this should be 
 written in the three then most known tongues, it was intimated thereby 
 that Jesus Christ should be a Saviour to all nations, and not to the 
 Jews only; and also that every nation should hear <I>in their own 
 tongue the wonderful works</I> of the Redeemer. Hebrew, Greek, and 
 Latin, were the vulgar languages at that time in this part of the 
 world; so that this is so far from intimating (as the Papists would 
 have it) that the scripture is still to be retained in these three 
 languages, that on the contrary it teaches us that the knowledge of 
 Christ ought to be diffused throughout every nation in their own 
 tongue, as the proper vehicle of it, that people may converse as freely 
 with the scriptures as they do with their neighbours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The offence which the prosecutors took at it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 They would not have it written, <I>the king of the Jews;</I> but that 
 he said of himself, <I>I am the king of the Jews.</I> Here they show 
 themselves,

 (1.) Very spiteful and malicious against Christ. It was not enough to 
 have him crucified, but they must have his name crucified too. To 
 justify themselves in giving him such bad treatment, they thought 
 themselves concerned to give him a bad character, and to represent him 
 as a usurper of honours and powers that he was not entitled to. 

 (2.) Foolishly jealous of the honour of their nation. Though they were 
 a conquered and enslaved people, yet they stood so much upon the 
 punctilio of their reputation that they scorned to have it said that 
 this was their king. 

 (3.) Very impertinent and troublesome to Pilate. They could not but be
 sensible that they had forced him, against his mind, to condemn Christ, 
 and yet, in such a trivial thing as this, they continue to tease him; 
 and it was so much the worse in that, though they had charged him with 
 pretending to be the king of the Jews, yet they had not proved it, nor 
 had he ever said so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The judge's resolution to adhere to it: "<I>What I have written I 
 have written,</I> and will not alter it to humour them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Hereby an affront was put upon the chief priests, who would still 
 be dictating. It seems, by Pilate's manner of speaking, that he was 
 uneasy in himself for yielding to them, and vexed at them for forcing 
 him to it, and therefore he was resolved to be cross with them; and by 
 this inscription he insinuates, 

 [1.] That, notwithstanding their pretences, they were not sincere in 
 their affections to C&aelig;sar and his government; they were willing 
 enough to have a king of the Jews, if they could have one to their 
 mind. 

 [2.] That such a king as this, so mean and despicable, was good enough 
 to be the king of the Jews; and this would be the fate of all that 
 should dare to oppose the Roman power. 

 [3.] That they had been very unjust and unreasonable in prosecuting 
 this Jesus, when there was no fault to be found in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Hereby honour was done to the Lord Jesus. Pilate stuck to it with 
 resolution, that he was the king of the Jews. What he had written was 
 what God had first written, and therefore he could not alter it; for 
 thus it was written, that Messiah the prince should be <I>cut off,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:26">Dan. ix. 26</A>.

 This therefore is the true cause of his death; he dies because the king 
 of Israel must die, must thus die. When the Jews reject Christ, and 
 will not have him for their king, Pilate, a Gentile, sticks to it that 
 he is a king, which was an earnest of what came to pass soon after, 
 when the Gentiles submitted to the kingdom of the Messiah, which the 
 unbelieving Jews had rebelled against.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The dividing of his garments among the executioners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.
 
 Four soldiers were employed, who, <I>when they had crucified Jesus,</I> 
 had nailed him to the cross, and lifted it up, and him upon it, and 
 nothing more was to be done than to wait his expiring through the 
 extremity of pain, as, with us, when the prisoner is turned off, then 
 they went to make a dividend of his clothes, each claiming an equal 
 share, and so they <I>made four parts,</I> as nearly of the same value 
 as they could, <I>to every soldier a part;</I> but <I>his coat,</I> or 
 upper garment whether cloak or gown, being a pretty piece of curiosity, 
 <I>without seam, woven from the top throughout,</I> they agreed to 
 <I>cast lots for it.</I> Here observe, 

 1. The shame they put upon our Lord Jesus, in stripping him of his
 garments before they crucified him. The shame of nakedness came in
 with sin. He therefore who was made sin for us bore that shame, to roll 
 away our reproach. He was stripped, that we might be clothed with 
 <I>white raiment</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:18">Rev. iii. 18</A>),

 and that when we are unclothed <I>we may not be found naked.</I> 

 2. The wages with which these soldiers paid themselves for crucifying 
 Christ. They were willing to do it for his old clothes. Nothing is to
 be done so bad, but there will be found men bad enough to do it for a 
 trifle. Probably they hoped to make more than ordinary advantage of
 his clothes, having heard of cures wrought by the touch of the hem of 
 his garment, or expecting that his admirers would give any money for 
 them.

 3. The sport they made about his seamless coat. We read not of any
 thing about him valuable or remarkable but this, and this not for the 
 richness, but only the variety of it, for it was <I>woven from the top 
 throughout;</I> there was no curiosity therefore in the shape, but a 
 designed plainness. Tradition says, his mother wove it for him, and 
 adds this further, that it was made for him when he was a child, and, 
 like the Israelites' clothes in the wilderness, <I>waxed not old;</I> 
 but this is a groundless fancy. The soldiers thought it a pity to rend 
 it, for then it would unravel, and a piece of it would be good for 
 nothing; they would <I>therefore cast lots for it.</I> While Christ was 
 in his dying agonies, they were merrily dividing his spoils. The 
 preserving of Christ's seamless coat is commonly alluded to to show the 
 care all Christians ought to take that they rend not the church of 
 Christ with strifes and divisions; yet some have observed that the 
 reason why the soldiers would not rend Christ's coat was not out of any 
 respect to Christ, but because each of them hoped to have it entire for 
 himself. And so many cry out against schism, only that they may engross 
 all the wealth and power to themselves. Those who opposed Luther's 
 separation from the church of Rome urged much the <I>tunica 
 inconsutilis--the seamless coat;</I> and some of them laid so much 
 stress upon it that they were called the <I>Inconsutilist&aelig;--The 
 seamless.</I> 

 4. The fulfilling of the scripture in this. David, in spirit, foretold
 this very circumstance of Christ's sufferings, in that passage,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:18">Ps. xxii. 18</A>.

 The event so exactly answering the prediction proves,

 (1.) That <I>the scripture</I> is the word of God, which foretold
 contingent events concerning Christ so long before, and they came to 
 pass according to the prediction. 

 (2.) That Jesus is the true Messiah; for in him all the Old-Testament
 prophecies concerning the Messiah had, and have, their full 
 accomplishment. <I>These things therefore the soldiers did.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The care that he took of his poor mother.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His mother attends him to his death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>There stood by the cross,</I> as near as they could get, <I>his 
 mother,</I> and some of his relations and friends with her. At first, 
 they stood near, as it is said here; but afterwards, it is probable, 
 the soldiers forced them to stand afar off, as it is said in Matthew 
 and Mark: or they themselves removed out of the ground. 

 (1.) See here the tender affection of these pious women to our Lord 
 Jesus in his sufferings. When all his disciples, except John, has 
 forsaken him, they continued their attendance on him. Thus <I>the 
 feeble were as David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:8">Zech. xii. 8</A>):

 they were not deterred by the fury of the enemy nor the horror of the 
 sight; they could not rescue him nor relieve him, yet they attended 
 him, to show their good-will. It is an impious and blasphemous 
 construction which some of the popish writers put upon the virgin Mary 
 standing by the cross, that thereby she contributed to the satisfaction 
 he made for sin no less than he did, and so became a joint-mediatrix 
 and co-adjutrix in our salvation.

 (2.) We may easily suppose what an affliction it was to these poor 
 women to see him thus abused, especially to the blessed virgin. Now was 
 fulfilled Simeon's word, <I>A sword shall pierce through thy own 
 soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:35">Luke ii. 35</A>.

 His torments were her tortures; she was upon the rack, while he was
 upon the cross; and her heart bled with his wounds; and <I>the 
 reproaches wherewith they reproached</I> him fell on those that 
 attended him.

 (3.) We may justly admire the power of divine grace in supporting these 
 women, especially the virgin Mary, under this heavy trial. We do not 
 find his mother wringing her hands, or tearing her hair, or rending her 
 clothes, or making an outcry; but, with a wonderful composure, 
 <I>standing by the cross,</I> and her friends with her. Surely she and 
 they were strengthened by a divine power to this degree of patience; 
 and surely the virgin Mary had a fuller expectation of his resurrection 
 than the rest had, which supported her thus. We know not what we can 
 bear till we are tried, and then we know who has said, <I>My grace is 
 sufficient for thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He tenderly provides for his mother at his death. It is probable 
 that Joseph, her husband, was long since dead, and that her son Jesus 
 had supported her, and her relation to him had been her maintenance; 
 and now that he was dying what would become of her? He saw her standing 
 by, and knew her cares and griefs; and he saw John standing not far 
 off, and so he settled a new relation between his beloved mother and 
 his beloved disciple; for he said to her, "<I>Woman, behold thy 
 son,</I> for whom henceforward thou must have a motherly affection;" 
 and to him, "<I>Behold thy mother,</I> to whom thou must pay a filial 
 duty." And so <I>from that hour,</I> that hour never to be forgotten, 
 <I>that disciple took her to his own home.</I> See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The care Christ took of his dear mother. He was not so much taken 
 up with a sense of his sufferings as to forget his friends, all whose 
 concerns he bore upon his heart. His mother, perhaps, was so taken up 
 with his sufferings that she thought not of what would become of her; 
 but he admitted that thought. <I>Silver and gold he had none</I> to 
 leave, no estate, real or personal; his clothes the soldiers had 
 seized, and we hear no more of the bag since Judas, who had carried it, 
 hanged himself. He had therefore no other way to provide for his mother 
 than by his interest in a friend, which he does here. 

 [1.] He calls her <I>woman,</I> not mother, not out of any disrespect 
 to her, but because mother would have been a cutting word to her that 
 was already wounded to the heart with grief; like Isaac saying to 
 Abraham, <I>My father.</I> He speaks as one that was <I>now no more in 
 this world,</I> but was already dead to those in it that were dearest 
 to him. His speaking in this seemingly slight manner to his mother, as 
 he had done formerly, was designed to obviate and give a check to the 
 undue honours which he foresaw would be given to her in the Romish 
 church, as if she were a joint purchaser with him in the honours of the 
 Redeemer. 

 [2.] He directs her to look upon John as her son: "Behold him as thy 
 son, who stands there by thee, and be as a mother to him." See here, 
 <I>First,</I> An instance of divine goodness, to be observed for our 
 encouragement. Sometimes, when God removes one comfort from us, he 
 raises up another for us, perhaps where we looked not for it. We read 
 of children which the church shall have after she has lost the other, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:21">Isa. xlix. 21</A>.

 Let none therefore reckon all gone with one cistern dried up, for from
 the same fountain another may be filled. <I>Secondly,</I> An instance 
 of filial duty, to be observed for our imitation. Christ has here 
 taught children to provide, to the utmost of their power, for the 
 comfort of their aged parents. When David was in distress, he took care 
 of his parents, and found out a shelter for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:3">1 Sam. xxii. 3</A>);

 so the Son of David here. Children at their death, according to their 
 ability, should provide for their parents, if they survive them, and 
 need their kindness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The confidence he reposed in the beloved disciple. It is to him he 
 says, <I>Behold thy mother,</I> that is, I recommend her to thy care, 
 be thou as a son to her to guide her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:18">Isa. li. 18</A>);

 and <I>forsake her not when she is old,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:22">Prov. xxiii. 22</A>.
 
 Now, 

 [1.] This was an honour put upon John, and a testimony both to his 
 prudence and to his fidelity. If he who knows all things had not known 
 that John loved him, he would not have made him his mother's guardian. 
 It is a great honour to be employed for Christ, and to be entrusted 
 with any of his interest in the world. But, 

 [2.] It would be a care and some charge to John; but he cheerfully 
 accepted it, <I>and took her to his own home,</I> not objecting the 
 trouble nor expense, nor his obligations to his own family, nor the 
 ill-will he might contract by it. Note, Those that truly love Christ, 
 and are beloved of him, will be glad of an opportunity to do any 
 service to him or his. <I>Nicephoras's Eccl. Hist. lib. 2 cap. 3,</I>
 saith that the virgin Mary lived with John at Jerusalem eleven years, 
 and then died. Others, that she lived to remove with him to 
 Ephesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The fulfilling of the scripture, in the giving of him vinegar to 
 drink, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How much respect Christ showed to the scripture 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>Knowing that all things</I> hitherto <I>were accomplished, that the 
 scripture might be fulfilled,</I> which spoke of his drinking in his 
 sufferings, <I>he saith, I thirst,</I> that is, he called for 
 drink.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It was not at all strange that he was thirsty; we find him 
 <I>thirsty</I> in a journey 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:6,7"><I>ch.</I> iv. 6, 7</A>),

 and now thirsty when he was just at his journey's end. Well might he
 thirst after all the toil and hurry which he had undergone, and being 
 now in the agonies of death, ready to expire purely by the loss of 
 blood and extremity of pain. The torments of hell are represented by a 
 violent thirst in the complaint of the rich man that begged for a 
 <I>drop of water to cool his tongue.</I> To that everlasting thirst we 
 had been condemned, had not Christ suffered for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) But the reason of his complaining of it is somewhat surprising; it 
 is the only word he spoke that looked like complaint of his outward 
 sufferings. When they scourged him, and crowned him with thorns, he did 
 not cry, O my head! or, My back! But now he cried, <I>I thirst.</I> 
 For, 

 [1.] He would thus express <I>the travail of his soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:11">Isa. liii. 11</A>.
 
 He thirsted after the glorifying of God, and the accomplishment of the 
 work of our redemption, and the happy issue of his undertaking.

 [2.] He would thus take care to see the scripture fulfilled. Hitherto, 
 all had been accomplished, and he knew it, for this was the thing he 
 had carefully observed all along; and now he called to mind one thing 
 more, which this was the proper season for the performance of. By this 
 it appears that he was the Messiah, in that not only the scripture was 
 punctually fulfilled in him, but it was strictly eyed by him. By this 
 it appears <I>that God was with him of a truth</I>--that in all he did 
 he went exactly according to the word of God, taking care <I>not to 
 destroy, but to fulfil, the law and the prophets.</I> Now, 
 <I>First,</I> The scripture had foretold his thirst, and therefore he 
 himself related it, because it could not otherwise be known, saying, 
 <I>I thirst;</I> it was foretold that his tongue should cleave to his 
 jaws,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:15">Ps. xxii. 15</A>.

 Samson, an eminent type of Christ, when he was laying <I>the 
 Philistines heaps upon heaps,</I> was himself <I>sore athirst</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:18">Judg. xv. 18</A>);

 so was Christ, when he was upon the cross, <I>spoiling principalities 
 and powers. Secondly,</I> The scripture had foretold that in his thirst 
 he should have vinegar given him to drink, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:21">Ps. lxix. 21</A>.

 They had given him vinegar to drink before they crucified him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:34">Matt. xxvii. 34</A>),

 but the prophecy was not exactly fulfilled in that, because that was 
 not in his thirst; therefore now he said, <I>I thirst,</I> and called 
 for it again: then he would not drink, but now he received it Christ 
 would rather court an affront than see any prophecy unfulfilled. This
 should satisfy us under all our trials, that the will of God is done, 
 and the word of God accomplished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See how little respect his persecutors showed to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):
 
 <I>There was set a vessel full of vinegar,</I> probably according to 
 the custom at all executions of this nature; or, as others think, it 
 was now set designedly for an abuse to Christ, instead of the cup of 
 wine which they used to give <I>to those that were ready to perish;</I> 
 with this <I>they filled a sponge,</I> for they would not allow him a 
 cup, <I>and they put it upon hyssop,</I> a hyssop-stalk, and with this 
 heaved it to his mouth; <B><I>hyssopo perithentes</I></B>--<I>they 
 stuck it round with hyssop;</I> so it may be taken; or, as others, they 
 mingled it with hyssop-water, and this they gave him to drink when he 
 was thirsty; a drop of water would have cooled his tongue better than a 
 draught of vinegar: yet this he submitted to for us. <I>We had taken 
 the sour grapes,</I> and <I>thus his teeth were set on edge;</I> we had 
 forfeited all comforts and refreshments, and therefore they were 
 withheld from him. When heaven denied him a beam of light earth denied
 him a drop of water, and put vinegar in the room of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The dying word wherewith he breathed out his soul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>When he had received the vinegar,</I> as much of it as he thought 
 fit, <I>he said, It is finished;</I> and, with that, <I>bowed his head, 
 and gave up the ghost.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he said, and we may suppose him to say it with triumph and 
 exultation, <B><I>Tetelestai</I></B>--<I>It is finished,</I> a 
 comprehensive word, and a comfortable one. 

 (1.) <I>It is finished,</I> that is, the malice and enmity of his 
 persecutors had now done their worst; <I>when he had received</I> that 
 last indignity in <I>the vinegar they gave him, he said,</I> "This is 
 the last; I am now going out of their reach, <I>where the wicked cease 
 from troubling.</I>" 

 (2.) <I>It is finished,</I> that is, the counsel and commandment of his 
 Father concerning his sufferings were now fulfilled; it was a 
 <I>determinate counsel,</I> and he took care to see every iota and
 tittle of it exactly answered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>.

 He had said, when he entered upon his sufferings, <I>Father, thy will
 be done;</I> and now he saith with pleasure, <I>It is done.</I> It was 
 <I>his meat and drink to finish his work</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:34"><I>ch.</I> iv. 34</A>),

 and the meat and drink refreshed him, when they gave him gall and
 vinegar.

 (3.) <I>It is finished,</I> that is, all the types and prophecies of
 the Old Testament, which pointed at the sufferings of the Messiah, were 
 accomplished and answered. He speaks as if, now that <I>they had given 
 him the vinegar,</I> he could not bethink himself of any word in the 
 Old Testament that was to be fulfilled between him and his death but it 
 had its accomplishment; such as, his being <I>sold for thirty pieces of 
 silver, his hands and feet being pierced, his garments divided, 
 &c.;</I> and now that this is done. <I>It is finished.</I> 

 (4.) <I>It is finished,</I> that is, the ceremonial law is abolished, 
 and a period put to the obligation of it. The substance is now come,
 and all the shadows are done away. Just now <I>the veil is rent, the 
 wall of partition is taken down,</I> even <I>the law of commandments 
 contained in ordinances,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14,15">Eph. ii. 14, 15</A>.
 
 The Mosaic economy is dissolved, <I>to make way for a better hope.</I>
 
 (5.) <I>It is finished,</I> that is, sin is finished, and an end made
 of transgression, by <I>the bringing in of an everlasting
 righteousness.</I> It seems to refer to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24">Dan. ix. 24</A>.

 <I>The Lamb of God was sacrificed to take away the sin of the
 world,</I> and it is done,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:26">Heb. ix. 26</A>.

 (6.) <I>It is finished,</I> that is, his sufferings were now finished, 
 both those of his soul and those of his body. The storm is over, the 
 worst is past; all his pains and agonies are at an end, and he is just 
 going to paradise, entering upon <I>the joy set before him.</I> Let all 
 that <I>suffer for Christ,</I> and with Christ, comfort themselves with 
 this, <I>that yet a little while</I> and they also shall say, <I>It is 
 finished.</I> 

 (7.) <I>It is finished,</I> that is, his life was now finished, he was 
 just ready to breathe his last, and <I>now he is no more in this 
 world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:11"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 11</A>.

 This is like that of blessed Paul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:7">2 Tim. iv. 7</A>),

 <I>I have finished my course,</I> my race is run, my glass is out, 
 <I>mene, mene--numbered</I> and <I>finished.</I> This we must all come 
 to shortly. 

 (8.) <I>It is finished,</I> that is, the work of man's redemption and 
 salvation is now completed, at least the hardest part of the 
 undertaking is over; a full satisfaction is made to the justice of God, 
 a fatal blow given to the power of Satan, a fountain of grace opened 
 that shall ever flow, a foundation of peace and happiness laid that 
 shall never fail. Christ had now gone through with his work, and 
 <I>finished it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:4"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 4</A>.

 For, <I>as for God, his work is perfect; when I begin,</I> saith he,
 <I>I will also make an end.</I> And, as in the purchase, so in the 
 application of the redemption, <I>he that has begun a good work will 
 perform it;</I> the mystery of God shall be finished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What he did: <I>He bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</I> He was 
 voluntary in dying; for he was not only the sacrifice, but the priest 
 and the offerer; and the <I>animus offerentis--the mind of the 
 offerer,</I> was all in all in the sacrifice. Christ showed his will
 in his sufferings, <I>by which will we are sanctified.</I> 

 (1.) <I>He gave up the ghost.</I> His life was not forcibly extorted 
 from him, but freely resigned. He had said, <I>Father, into thy hands I 
 commit my spirit,</I> thereby expressing the intention of this act. I 
 give up myself as a <I>ransom for many;</I> and, accordingly, he did 
 give up his spirit, paid down the price of pardon and life at his 
 Father's hands. <I>Father, glorify thy name.</I> 

 (2.) <I>He bowed his head.</I> Those that were crucified, in dying 
 stretched up their heads to gasp for breath, and did not drop their 
 heads till they had breathed their last; but Christ, to show himself 
 active in dying, <I>bowed his head</I> first, composing himself, as it 
 were, to fall asleep. God <I>had laid upon him the iniquity of us 
 all,</I> putting it upon the head of this great sacrifice; and some 
 think that by this bowing of his head he would intimate his sense of 
 the weight upon him. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:4,40:12">Ps. xxxviii. 4; xl. 12</A>.

 The bowing of his head shows his submission to his Father's will, and
 his obedience to death. He accommodated himself to his dying work, as 
 Jacob, <I>who gathered up his feet into the bed, and then yielded up 
 the ghost.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the
 bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for
 that sabbath day was a high day,) besought Pilate that their
 legs might be broken, and <I>that</I> they might be taken away.
 &nbsp; 32  Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and
 of the other which was crucified with him.
 &nbsp; 33  But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead
 already, they brake not his legs:
 &nbsp; 34  But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and
 forthwith came there out blood and water.
 &nbsp; 35  And he that saw <I>it</I> bare record, and his record is true:
 and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.
 &nbsp; 36  For these things were done, that the scripture should be
 fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
 &nbsp; 37  And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him
 whom they pierced.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This passage concerning the piercing of Christ's side after his death 
 is recorded only by this evangelist.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Observe the superstition of the Jews, which occasioned it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):
 
 <I>Because it was the preparation for the sabbath, and that sabbath 
 day,</I> because it fell in the passover-week, <I>was a high day,</I> 
 that they might show a veneration for the sabbath, they would <I>not 
 have the dead bodies to remain on the crosses on the sabbath-day,</I> 
 but <I>besought Pilate that their legs might be broken,</I> which would 
 be a certain, but cruel dispatch, and that then they might be buried 
 out of sight. Note here, 

 1. The esteem they would be thought to have for the approaching 
 sabbath, because it was one of the days of unleavened bread, and (some 
 reckon) the day of the offering of the first-fruits. Every sabbath day 
 is a holy day, and a good day, but this was a high day, <B><I>megale 
 hemera</I></B>--<I>a great day.</I> Passover sabbaths are high days; 
 sacrament-days, supper-days, communion-days are high days, and there 
 ought to be more than ordinary preparation for them, that these may be 
 high days indeed to us, <I>as the days of heaven.</I> 

 2. The reproach which they reckoned it would be to that day if the dead
 bodies should be left hanging on the crosses. Dead bodies were not to
 be left at any time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:23">Deut. xxi. 23</A>);

 yet, in this case, the Jews would have left the Roman custom to take
 place, had it not been an extraordinary day; and, many strangers from 
 all parts being then at Jerusalem, it would have been an offence to 
 them; nor could they well bear the sight of Christ's crucified body, 
 for, unless their consciences were quite seared, when the heat of their 
 rage was a little over, they would upbraid them. 

 3. Their petition to Pilate, that their bodies, now as good as dead,
 might be dispatched; not by strangling or beheading them, which would 
 have been a compassionate hastening of them out of their misery, like 
 the <I>coup de grace</I> (as the French call it) to those that are 
 broken upon the wheel, <I>the stroke of mercy,</I> but by the breaking 
 of their legs, which would carry them off in the most exquisite pain.
 Note,

 (1.) <I>The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</I> 

 (2.) The pretended sanctity of hypocrites is abominable. These Jews 
 would be thought to bear a great regard for the sabbath, and yet had 
 not regard to justice and righteousness; they made no conscience of 
 bringing an innocent and excellent person to the cross, and yet 
 scrupled letting a dead body hang upon the cross.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The dispatching of <I>the two thieves that were crucified with 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Pilate was still gratifying the Jews, and gave orders as they desired; 
 <I>and the soldiers came,</I> hardened against all impressions of pity, 
 <I>and broke the legs of the two thieves,</I> which, no doubt, extorted 
 from them hideous outcries, and made them die according to the bloody 
 disposition of Nero, so as to feel themselves die. One of these thieves 
 was a penitent, and had received from Christ an assurance that he 
 should shortly be with him in paradise, and yet died in the same pain 
 and misery that the other thief did; for <I>all things come alike to 
 all.</I> Many go to heaven that <I>have bands in their death,</I> and 
 <I>die in the bitterness of their soul.</I> The extremity of dying 
 agonies is no obstruction to the living comforts that wait for holy 
 souls on the other side death. Christ died, and went to paradise, but 
 appointed a guard to convey him thither. This is the order of going to 
 heaven--<I>Christ, the first-fruits</I> and forerunner, <I>afterwards 
 those that are Christ's.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The trial that was made whether Christ was dead or no, and the 
 putting of it out of doubt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They supposed him to be dead, and therefore <I>did not break his 
 legs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 (1.) That Jesus died in less time than persons crucified ordinarily 
 did. The structure of his body, perhaps, being extraordinarily fine and 
 tender, was the sooner broken by pain; or, rather, it was to show that 
 he laid down his life of himself, and could die when he pleased, though 
 his hands were nailed. Though he yielded to death, yet he was not 
 conquered. 

 (2.) That his enemies were satisfied he was really dead. The Jews, who 
 stood by to see the execution effectually done, would not have omitted 
 this piece of cruelty, if they had not been sure he was got out of the 
 reach of it.

 (3.) <I>Whatever devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord 
 shall stand.</I> It was fully designed to break his legs, but, God's 
 counsel being otherwise, see how it was prevented.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Because they would be sure he was dead they made such an experiment 
 as would put it past dispute. <I>One of the soldiers with a spear
 pierced his side,</I> aiming at his heart, <I>and forthwith came
 there out blood and water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The soldier hereby designed to decide the question whether he was 
 dead or no, and by this honourable wound in his side to supersede the 
 ignominious method of dispatch they took with the other two. Tradition 
 says that this soldier's name was <I>Longinus,</I> and that, having 
 some distemper in his eyes, he was immediately cured of it, by some 
 drops of blood that flowed out of Christ's side falling on them: 
 significant enough, if we had any good authority for the story.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) But God had a further design herein, which was,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] To give an evidence of the truth of his death, in order to the 
 proof of his resurrection. If he was only in a trance or swoon, his 
 resurrection was a sham; but, by this experiment, he was certainly 
 dead, for this spear broke up the very fountains of life, and, 
 according to all the law and course of nature, it was impossible a 
 human body should survive such a wound as this in the vitals, and such 
 an evacuation thence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] To give an illustration of the design of his death. There was much 
 of mystery in it, and its being solemnly attested 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>)

 intimates there was something miraculous in it, that <I>the blood and 
 water</I> should come out distinct and separate from the same wound; at 
 least it was very significant; this same apostle refers to it as a very 
 considerable thing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:6,8">1 John v. 6, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> the opening of his side was significant. When we would 
 protest our sincerity, we wish there were a window in our hearts, that 
 the thoughts and intents of them might be visible to all. Through this 
 window, opened in Christ's side, you may look into his heart, and see 
 love flaming there, love strong as death; see our names written there. 
 Some make it an allusion to the opening of Adam's side in innocency. 
 When Christ, the second Adam, was fallen into a deep sleep upon the 
 cross, then was his side opened, and out of it was his church taken, 
 which he espoused to himself. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:30,32">Eph. v. 30, 32</A>.

 Our devout poet, Mr. George Herbert, in his poem called <I>The
 Bag,</I> very affectingly brings in our Saviour, when his side was 
 pierced, thus speaking to his disciples:--</P>

 <I>Secondly, The blood and water</I> that flowed out of it were 
 significant. 

 1. They signified the two great benefits which all believers partake of
 through Christ-justification and sanctification; blood for remission, 
 water for regeneration; blood for atonement, water for purification. 
 Blood and water were used very much under the law. Guilt contracted
 must be expiated by blood; stains contracted must be done away by 
 <I>the water of purification.</I> These two must always go together. 
 <I>You are sanctified, you are justified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11">1 Cor. vi. 11</A>.
 
 Christ has joined them together, and we must not think to put them
 asunder. They both flowed from the pierced side of our Redeemer. To 
 Christ crucified we owe both merit for our justification, and Spirit 
 and grace for our sanctification; and we have as much need of the 
 latter as of the former, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:30">1 Cor. i. 30</A>.

 2. They signified the two great ordinances of baptism and the Lord's
 supper, by which those benefits are represented, sealed, and applied, 
 to believers; they both owe their institution and efficacy to Christ. 
 It is not the water in the font that will be to us <I>the washing of 
 regeneration,</I> but the water out of the side of Christ; not the 
 blood of the grape that will pacify the conscience and refresh the 
 soul, but the blood out of the side of Christ. Now was the rock smitten

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:4">1 Cor. x. 4</A>),

 now was the fountain opened 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:1">Zech. xiii. 1</A>),
 
 now were the wells of salvation digged,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:3">Isa. xii. 3</A>.

 Here <I>is the river, the streams whereof make glad the city of our 
 God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The attestation of the truth of this by an eye-witness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 the evangelist himself. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What a competent witness he was of the matters of fact. 

 (1.) What he bore record of he saw; he had it not by hearsay, nor was 
 it only his own conjecture, but he was an eyewitness of it; it is 
 <I>what we have seen and looked upon</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1,2Pe+1:16">1 John i. 1; 2 Pet. i. 16</A>),

 and <I>had perfect understanding of,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:3">Luke i. 3</A>.

 (2.) What he saw he faithfully bore record of; as a faithful witness, 
 he told not only the truth, but the whole truth; and did not only 
 attest it by word of mouth, but left it upon record in writing, <I>in 
 perpetuam rei memoriam--for a perpetual memorial.</I> 

 (3.) <I>His record is</I> undoubtedly <I>true;</I> for he wrote not 
 only from his own personal knowledge and observation, but from the 
 dictates of the Spirit of truth, that leads into all truth. 

 (4.) He had himself a full assurance of the truth of what he wrote, and 
 did not persuade others to believe that which he did not believe 
 himself: <I>He knows that he saith true.</I> 

 (5.) He <I>therefore</I> witnessed these things, <I>that we might 
 believe;</I> he did not record them merely for his own satisfaction or 
 the private use of his friends, but made them public to the world; not 
 to please the curious nor entertain the ingenious, but to draw men to 
 believe the gospel in order to their eternal welfare.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What care he showed in this particular instance. That we may be well 
 assured of the truth of Christ's death, he saw his heart's blood, his 
 life's blood, let out; and also of the benefits that flow to us from 
 his death, signified by the blood and water which came out of his side. 
 Let this silence the fears of weak Christians, and encourage their 
 hopes, <I>iniquity shall not be their ruin,</I> for there came both 
 water and blood out of Christ's pierced side, both to justify and 
 sanctify them; and if you ask, How can we be sure of this? You may be 
 sure, for <I>he that saw it bore record.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The accomplishment of the scripture in all this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>That the scripture might be fulfilled,</I> and so both the honour of 
 the Old Testament preserved and the truth of the New Testament 
 confirmed. Here are two instances of it together:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The scripture was fulfilled in the preserving of his legs from being 
 broken; therein that word was fulfilled, <I>A bone of him shall not be 
 broken.</I> 

 (1.) There was a promise of this made indeed to all <I>the 
 righteous,</I> but principally pointing at <I>Jesus Christ the 
 righteous</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:20">Ps. xxxiv. 20</A>):

 <I>He keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken.</I> And David, 
 in spirit, says, <I>All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto 
 thee?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:10">Ps. xxxv. 10</A>.

 (2.) There was a type of this in the paschal lamb, which seems to be
 specially referred to here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:46">Exod. xii. 46</A>):

 <I>Neither shall you break a bone thereof;</I> and it is repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:12">Num. ix. 12</A>),

 <I>You shall not break any bone of it;</I> for which law the will of 
 the law-maker is the reason, but the antitype must answer the type. 
 <I>Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:7">1 Cor. v. 7</A>.

 He is <I>the Lamb of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:29"><I>ch.</I> i. 29</A>),

 and, as the true passover, his bones were kept unbroken. This
 commandment was given concerning his bones, when dead, as of Joseph's,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:22">Heb. xi. 22</A>.

 (3.) There was a significancy in it; the strength of the body is in the 
 bones. The Hebrew word for the bones signifies the strength, and 
 therefore <I>not a bone of Christ must be broken,</I> to show that 
 though <I>he be crucified in weakness</I> his strength to save is not 
 at all broken. Sin breaks our bones, as it broke David's 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:8">Ps. li. 8</A>);
 
 but it did not break Christ's bones; he stood firm under the burden, 
 mighty to save.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>The scripture was fulfilled in the piercing of his side</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>They shall look on me whom they had pierced;</I> so it is written,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:10">Zech. xii. 10</A>.

 And there the same that pours out the Spirit of grace, and can be no
 less than the God of the holy prophets, says, <I>They shall look upon 
 me,</I> which is here applied to Christ, <I>They shall look upon 
 him.</I> 

 (1.) It is here implied that the Messiah shall be pierced; and here it 
 had a more full accomplishment than in <I>the piercing of his hands and 
 feet;</I> he was pierced by <I>the house of David</I> and <I>the 
 inhabitants of Jerusalem, wounded in the house of his friends,</I> as 
 it follows,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:6">Zech. xiii. 6</A>.

 (2.) It is promised that <I>when the Spirit is poured out they shall
 look on him and mourn.</I> This was in part fulfilled when many of
 those that were his betrayers and murderers <I>were pricked to the
 heart,</I> and brought to believe in him; it will be further fulfilled,
 in mercy, <I>when all Israel shall be saved;</I> and, in wrath, when
 those who persisted in their infidelity shall <I>see him whom they have
 pierced, and wail because of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:7">Rev. i. 7</A>.

 But it is applicable to us all. We have all been guilty of piercing
 the Lord Jesus, and are all concerned with suitable affections to look 
 on him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>38  And after this Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, being a disciple of
 Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he
 might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave <I>him</I> leave.
 He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
 &nbsp; 39  And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to
 Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about
 a hundred pound <I>weight.</I>

 clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the burial of the blessed body of our Lord 
 Jesus. The solemn funerals of great men are usually looked at with 
 curiosity; the mournful funerals of dear friends are attended with 
 concern. Come and see an extraordinary funeral; never was the like! 
 Come and see a burial that conquered the grave, and buried it, a burial 
 that beautified the grave and softened it for all believers. <I>Let us 
 turn aside now, and see this great sight.</I> Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The body begged, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 This was done by the interest of <I>Joseph of Ramah,</I> or 
 <I>Arimathea,</I> of whom no mention is made in all the New-Testament 
 story, but only in the narrative which each of the evangelists gives us 
 of Christ's burial, wherein he was chiefly concerned. Observe, 

 1. The character of this Joseph. He was a disciple of Christ
 <I>incognito--in secret,</I> a better friend to Christ than he would 
 willingly be known to be. It was his honour that he was a disciple of 
 Christ; and some such there are, that are themselves great men, and 
 unavoidably linked with bad men. But it was his weakness that he was so 
 secretly, when he should have confessed Christ before men, yea, though 
 he had lost his preferment by it. Disciples should openly own 
 themselves, yet Christ may have many that are his disciples sincerely, 
 though secretly; better secretly than not at all, especially if, like 
 Joseph here, they grow stronger and stronger. Some who in less trials 
 have been timorous, yet in greater have been very courageous; so Joseph 
 here. He concealed his affection to Christ <I>for fear of the Jews,</I> 
 lest they should put him out of the synagogue, at least out of the 
 sanhedrim, which was all they could do. To Pilate the governor he 
 <I>went boldly,</I> and yet <I>feared the Jews.</I> The impotent malice 
 of those that can but censure, and revile, and clamour, is sometimes 
 more formidable even to wise and good men than one would think. 

 2. The part he bore in this affair. He, having by his place access to
 Pilate, desired leave of him to dispose of the body. His mother and 
 dear relations had neither spirit nor interest to attempt such a thing. 
 His disciples were gone; if nobody appeared, the Jews or soldiers would 
 bury him with the thieves; therefore God raised up this gentleman to 
 interpose in it, that the scripture might be fulfilled, and the decorum 
 owing to his approaching resurrection maintained. Note, When God has 
 work to do he can find out such as are proper to do it, and embolden 
 them for it. Observe it as an instance of the humiliation of Christ,
 that his dead body lay at the mercy of a heathen judge, and must be 
 begged before it could be buried, and also that Joseph would not take 
 the body of Christ till he had asked and obtained leave of the 
 governor; for in those things wherein the power of the magistrate is 
 concerned we must ever pay a deference to that power, and peaceably 
 submit to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The embalming prepared, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 This was done by Nicodemus, another person of quality, and in a public 
 post. He brought a <I>mixture of myrrh and aloes,</I> which some think 
 were bitter ingredients, to preserve the body, others fragrant ones, to 
 perfume it. Here is. 

 1. The character of Nicodemus, which is much the same with that of
 Joseph; he was a secret friend to Christ, though not his constant 
 follower. He at first <I>came to Jesus by night,</I> but now owned him 
 publicly, as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:50,51"><I>ch.</I> vii. 50, 51</A>.

 That grace which at first is like a bruised reed may afterwards become
 like a strong cedar, and the trembling lamb <I>bold as a lion.</I> See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:4">Rom. xiv. 4</A>.

 It is a wonder that Joseph and Nicodemus, men of such interest, did not 
 appear sooner, and solicit Pilate not to condemn Christ, especially 
 seeing him so loth to do it. Begging his life would have been a nobler
 piece of service than begging his body. But Christ would have none of 
 his friends to endeavour to prevent his death when his hour was come. 
 While his persecutors were forwarding the accomplishment of the 
 scriptures, his followers must not obstruct it.

 2. The kindness of Nicodemus, which was considerable, though of a
 different nature. Joseph served Christ with his interest, Nicodemus 
 with his purse. Probably, they agreed it between them, that, while one 
 was procuring the grant, the other should be preparing the spices; and 
 this for expedition, because they were straitened in time. But why did
 they make this ado about Christ's dead body? 

 (1.) Some think we may see in it the weakness of their faith. A firm 
 belief of the resurrection of Christ on the third day would have saved 
 them this care and cost, and have been more acceptable than all spices. 
 Those bodies indeed to whom the grave is a long home need to be clad 
 accordingly; but what need of such furniture of the grave for one that, 
 like a way-faring man, did but turn aside into it, to <I>tarry for a 
 night or two?</I> 

 (2.) However, we may plainly see in it the strength of their love. 
 Hereby they showed the value they had for his person and doctrine, and 
 that it was not lessened by the reproach of the cross. Those that had
 been so industrious to profane his crown, and lay his honour in the 
 dust, might already see that they had imagined a vain thing; for, as 
 God had done him honour in his sufferings, so did men too, even great 
 men. They showed not only the charitable respect of committing his body 
 to the earth, but the honourable respect shown to great men. This they 
 might do, and yet believe and look for his resurrection; nay, this they 
 might do in the belief and expectation of it. Since God designed honour 
 for this body, they would put honour upon it. However, we must do our 
 duty according as the present day and opportunity are, and leave it to 
 God to fulfil his promises in his own way and time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The body got ready, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 They <I>took it</I> into some house adjoining, and, having washed it 
 from blood and dust, <I>wound it in linen clothes</I> very decently, 
 with the spices melted down, it is likely, into an ointment, as <I>the 
 manner of the Jews is to bury,</I> or to <I>embalm</I> (so Dr. 
 Hammond), as we sear dead bodies. 

 1. Here was care taken of Christ's body: It was <I>wound in linen
 clothes.</I> Among clothing that belongs to us, Christ put on even the 
 grave-clothes, to make them easy to us, and to enable us to call them 
 our wedding-clothes. They wound the body <I>with the spices,</I> for 
 <I>all his garments,</I> his grave-clothes not excepted, <I>smell of 
 myrrh and aloes</I> (the spices here mentioned) <I>out of the ivory 
 palaces</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:8">Ps. xlv. 8</A>),

 and an ivory palace the sepulchre hewn out of a rock was to Christ.
 Dead bodies and graves are noisome and offensive; hence sin is compared
 to a <I>body of death</I> and an <I>open sepulchre;</I> but Christ's
 sacrifice, being to God as a sweet-smelling savour, hath taken away our
 pollution. No ointment or perfume can rejoice the heart so as the grave
 of our Redeemer does, where there is faith to perceive the fragrant
 odours of it. 

 2. In conformity to this example, we ought to have regard to the dead
 bodies of Christians; not to enshrine and adore their relics, no, not 
 those of the most eminent saints and martyrs (nothing like that was 
 done to the dead body of Christ himself), but carefully to deposit 
 them, the dust in the dust, as those who believe that the dead bodies 
 of the saints are still united to Christ and designed for glory and 
 immortality at the last day. The resurrection of the saints will be in 
 virtue of Christ's resurrection, and therefore in burying them we 
 should have an eye to Christ's burial, for he, being dead, thus 
 speaketh. <I>Thy dead men shall live,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:19">Isa. xxvi. 19</A>.

 In burying our dead it is not necessary that in all circumstances we
 imitate the burial of Christ, as if we must be buried in linen, and in 
 a garden, and be embalmed as he was; but his being buried after <I>the 
 manner of the Jews</I> teaches us that in things of this nature we 
 should conform to the usages of the country where we live, except in 
 those that are superstitious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The grave pitched upon, in a garden which belonged to Joseph of 
 Arimathea, very near the place where he was crucified. There was a 
 sepulchre, or vault, prepared for the first occasion, but not yet used.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That Christ was buried without the city, for thus the manner of the 
 Jews was to bury, not in their cities, much less in their synagogues, 
 which some have thought better than our way of burying: yet there was 
 then a peculiar reason for it, which does not hold now, because the 
 touching of a grave contracted a ceremonial pollution: but now that the 
 resurrection of Christ has altered the property of the grave, and done 
 away its pollution for all believers, we need not keep at such a 
 distance from it; nor is it incapable of a good improvement, to have 
 the congregation of the dead in the church-yard, encompassing the 
 congregation of the living in the church, since they also are dying, 
 and in <I>the midst of life we are in death.</I> Those that would not 
 superstitiously, but by faith, visit the holy sepulchre, must go forth 
 out of the noise of this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That Christ was buried in a garden. Observe, 

 (1.) That Joseph had his sepulchre in his garden; so he contrived it, 
 that it might be a memento, 

 [1.] To himself while living; when he was taking the pleasure of his 
 garden, and reaping the products of it, let him think of dying, and be 
 quickened to prepare for it. The garden is a proper place for 
 meditation, and a sepulchre there may furnish us with a proper subject 
 for meditation, and such a one as we are loth to admit in the midst of 
 our pleasures. 

 [2.] To his heirs and successors when he was gone. It is good to 
 acquaint ourselves with the <I>place of our fathers' sepulchres;</I> 
 and perhaps we might make our own less formidable if we made theirs 
 more familiar.

 (2.) That in a sepulchre in a garden Christ's body was laid. In the 
 garden of Eden death and the grave first received their power, and now 
 in a garden they are conquered, disarmed, and triumphed over. In a 
 garden Christ began his passion, and from a garden he would rise, and 
 begin his exaltation. Christ fell to the ground <I>as a corn of
 wheat</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:24"><I>ch.</I> xii. 24</A>),

 and therefore was sown in a garden among the seeds, for <I>his dew is
 as the dew of herbs,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:19">Isa. xxvi. 19</A>.
 
 He is the <I>fountain of gardens,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:15">Cant. iv. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he was buried in a new sepulchre. This was so ordered 

 (1.) For the honour of Christ; he was not a common person, and 
 therefore must not mix with common dust He that was born from a 
 virgin-womb must rise from a virgin-tomb. 

 (2.) For the confirming of the truth of his resurrection, that it might 
 not be suggested that it was not he, but some other that rose now, when 
 many bodies of saints arose; or, that he rose by the power of some 
 other, as the man that was raised by the touch of Elisha's bones, and 
 not by his own power. He that has <I>made all things new</I> has 
 new-made the grave for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The funeral solemnized 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):

 <I>There laid they Jesus,</I> that is, the dead body of Jesus. Some 
 think the calling of this <I>Jesus</I> intimates the inseparable union 
 between the divine and human nature. Even this dead body was
 <I>Jesus--a Saviour,</I> for his death is our life; Jesus is still the 
 same,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:8">Heb. xiii. 8</A>.

 There they laid him because it was the preparation day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Observe here the deference which the Jews paid to the sabbath, and 
 to the day of preparation. Before the passover-sabbath they had a 
 solemn day of preparation. This day had been ill kept by the chief 
 priests, who called themselves the church, but was well kept by the 
 disciples of Christ, who were branded as dangerous to the church; and 
 it is often so. 

 (1.) They would not put off the funeral till the sabbath day, because 
 the sabbath is to be a day of holy rest and joy, with which the 
 business and sorrow of a funeral do not well agree. 

 (2.) They would not drive it too late on the day of preparation for the 
 sabbath. What is to be done the evening before the sabbath should be so 
 contrived that it may neither intrench upon sabbath time, nor indispose 
 us for sabbath work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Observe the convenience they took of an adjoining sepulchre; the 
 sepulchre they made use of was <I>nigh at hand.</I> Perhaps, if they 
 had had time, they would have carried him to Bethany, and buried him 
 among his friends there. And I am sure he had more right to have been 
 buried in the chief of the sepulchres of the sons of David than any of 
 the kings of Judah had; but it was so ordered that he should be laid in 
 a sepulchre nigh at hand, 

 (1.) Because he was to lie there but awhile, as in an inn, and 
 therefore he took the first that offered itself.

 (2.) Because this was a new sepulchre. Those that prepared it little 
 thought who should handsel it; but the wisdom of God has reaches 
 infinitely beyond ours, and he makes what use he pleases of us and all 
 we have.

 (3.) We are hereby taught not to be over-curious in the place of our 
 burial. Where the tree falls, why should it not lie? For Christ was 
 buried in the sepulchre that was next at hand. It was faith in the 
 promise of Canaan that directed the Patriarch's desires to be carried 
 thither for a burying-place; but now, since that promise is superseded 
 by a better, that care is over.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus without pomp or solemnity is the body of Jesus laid in the cold 
 and silent grave. Here lies our surety under arrest for our debts, so 
 that if he be released his discharge will be ours. Here is the Sun of 
 righteousness set for awhile, to rise again in greater glory, and set 
 no more. Here lies a seeming captive to death, but a real conqueror 
 over death; for here lies death itself slain, and the grave conquered. 
 <I>Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory.</I></P>
