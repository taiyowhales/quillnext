 righteousness was fulfilled, before he himself began to fulfil all 
 righteousness. Here is,

 I. The wise men's solicitous enquiry after Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 III. Christ's flight into Egypt, to avoid the cruelty of Herod,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
 Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
 Jerusalem,
 &nbsp; 2  Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we
 have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
 &nbsp; 3  When Herod the king had heard <I>these things,</I> he was
 troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
 &nbsp; 4  And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of
 the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be
 born.
 &nbsp; 5  And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it
 is written by the prophet,
 &nbsp; 6  And thou Bethlehem, <I>in</I> the land of Juda, art not the least
 among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor,
 that shall rule my people Israel.
 &nbsp; 7  Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired
 of them diligently what time the star appeared.
 &nbsp; 8  And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search
 diligently for the young child; and when ye have found <I>him,</I>
 bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was a <I>mark of humiliation</I> put upon the Lord Jesus that, 
 though he was the <I>Desire of all nations,</I> yet his coming into the 
 world was little observed and taken notice of, his birth was obscure 
 and unregarded: herein he emptied himself, and made himself of no 
 reputation. If the Son of God must be brought into the world, one might 
 justly expect that he should be received with all the ceremony 
 possible, that crowns and sceptres should immediately have been laid at 
 his feet, and that the high and mighty princes of the world should have 
 been his humble servants; such a Messiah as this the Jews expected, but 
 we see none of all this; he <I>came into the world,</I> and the 
 <I>world knew him not;</I> nay, he <I>came to his own,</I> and <I>his 
 own received him not;</I> for having undertaken to make satisfaction to 
 his Father for the wrong done him <I>in his honour</I> by the sin of 
 man, he did it by denying himself in, and despoiling himself of, the 
 honours undoubtedly due to an incarnate Deity; yet, as afterward, so in 
 his birth, some rays of glory darted forth in the midst of the greatest 
 instances of his abasement. Though <I>there was the hiding of his 
 power,</I> yet he had <I>horns coming out of his hand</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:4">Hab. iii. 4</A>)
 
 enough to condemn the world, and the Jews especially, for their
 stupidity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first who took notice of Christ after his birth were the shepherds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:15">Luke ii. 15</A>,

 &c.), who saw and heard glorious things concerning him, and <I>made
 them known abroad,</I> to the amazement of all that heard them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 After that, Simeon and Anna spoke of him, by the Spirit, to all that
 were disposed to heed what they said,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:38">Luke ii. 38</A>.

 Now, one would think, these hints should have been taken by the men of
 Judah and the <I>inhabitants of Jerusalem,</I> and they should with 
 both arms have embraced the long-looked-for Messiah; but, for aught 
 that appears, he continued nearly two years after at Bethlehem, and no 
 further notice was taken of him till these wise men came. Note, Nothing 
 will awaken those that are resolved to be regardless. Oh the amazing 
 stupidity of these Jews! And no less that of many who are called 
 Christians! Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When this enquiry was made concerning Christ. It was <I>in the days 
 of Herod the king.</I> This Herod was an Edomite, made king of Judea by 
 Augustus and Antonius, the then chief rulers of the Roman state, a man 
 made up of falsehood and cruelty; yet he was complimented with the 
 title of <I>Herod the Great.</I> Christ was born in the 35th year of 
 his reign, and notice is taken of this, to show that the <I>sceptre</I> 
 had now <I>departed from Judah,</I> and <I>the lawgiver from between 
 his feet;</I> and therefore now was the time for Shiloh to come, and 
 <I>to him shall the gathering of the people be:</I> witness these wise 
 men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Who and what these <I>wise men</I> were; they are here called 
 <B><I>Magoi</I></B>--<I>Magicians.</I> Some that it in a good sense; the
 <I>Magi</I> among the <I>Persians</I> were their philosophers and their 
 priests; nor would they admit any one for their king who had not first 
 been enrolled among the <I>Magi;</I> others think they dealt in 
 unlawful arts; the word is used of Simon, the sorcerer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:9,11">Acts viii. 9, 11</A>),
 
 and of Elymas, the sorcerer
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:6">Acts xiii. 6</A>),

 nor does the scripture use it in any other sense; and then it was an
 early instance and presage of Christ's victory over the devil, when 
 those who had been so much his devotees became the early adorers even 
 of the infant Jesus; so soon were trophies of his victory over the 
 powers of darkness erected. Well, whatever sort of wise men they were 
 before, now they began to be <I>wise men</I> indeed when they set 
 themselves to enquire after Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This we are sure of, 

 1. That they were Gentiles, and not belonging to the commonwealth of 
 Israel. The Jews regarded not Christ, but these Gentiles enquired him 
 out. Note, Many times those who are nearest to the means, are furthest 
 from the end. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:11,12"><I>ch.</I> viii. 11, 12</A>.

 The respect paid to Christ by these Gentiles was a happy presage and
 specimen of what would follow when those who were <I>afar off</I>
 should be <I>made nigh by Christ.</I> 

 2. That they were <I>scholars.</I> They dealt in arts, curious arts;
 good scholars should be good Christians, and <I>then</I> they complete 
 their <I>learning</I> when they <I>learn Christ.</I> 

 3. That they were <I>men of the east,</I> who were noted for their
 <I>soothsaying,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:6">Isa. ii. 6</A>.
 
 Arabia is called the land of <I>the east</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:6">Gen. xxv. 6</A>),

 and the <I>Arabians</I> are called <I>men of the east,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:3">Judg. vi. 3</A>.
 
 The presents they brought were the products of that country; the
 Arabians had done homage to David and Solomon as types of Christ. 
 Jethro and Job were of that country. More than this we have not to say 
 of them. The traditions of the Romish church are frivolous, that they 
 were in number three (though one of the ancients says that they were 
 fourteen), that they were kings, and that they lie buried in Colen,
 thence called the <I>three kings of Colen;</I> we covet not to be wise 
 above what is written.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What induced them to make this enquiry. They, in their country, 
 which was in the <I>east,</I> had seen an <I>extraordinary star,</I> 
 such as they had not seen before; which they took to be an indication 
 of an extraordinary person born in the land of <I>Judea,</I> over which 
 land this star was seen to hover, in the nature of a comet, or a meteor 
 rather, in the lower regions of the air; this differed so much from
 any thing that was common that they concluded it to signify something 
 uncommon. Note, Extraordinary appearances of God in the creatures 
 should put us upon enquiring after his mind and will therein; Christ 
 foretold <I>signs in the heavens.</I> The birth of Christ was notified 
 to the Jewish shepherds by <I>an angel,</I> to the Gentile philosophers 
 by a <I>star:</I> to both God spoke in their own language, and in the 
 way they were best acquainted with. Some think that the light which the 
 shepherds saw shining round about them, the night after Christ was 
 born, was the very same which to the wise men, who lived at such a 
 distance, appeared as a star; but this we cannot easily admit, because 
 the same star which they had seen in the <I>east</I> they saw a great 
 while after, leading them to the house where Christ lay; it was a 
 candle set up on purpose to guide them to Christ. The idolaters 
 worshipped the stars as the <I>host of heaven,</I> especially the 
 <I>eastern</I> nations, whence the planets have the names of their 
 idol-gods; we read of a particular <I>star</I> they had in veneration, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:26">Amos v. 26</A>.

 Thus the stars that had been misused came to be put to the right use,
 to lead men to Christ; the gods of the heathen became his servants. 
 Some think this star put them in mind of Balaam's prophecy, that a star 
 should come out of Jacob, pointing at a <I>sceptre,</I> that shall 
 <I>rise out of Israel;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:17">Num. xxiv. 17</A>.

 Balaam came from the <I>mountains of the east,</I> and was one of their
 <I>wise men.</I> Others impute their enquiry to the general expectation 
 entertained at that time, in those <I>eastern</I> parts, of some great 
 prince to appear. Tacitus, in his history (<I>lib.</I> 5), takes notice 
 of it; <I>Pluribus persuasio inerat, antiquis sacerdotum literis 
 contineri, eo ipso tempore fore, ut valesceret oriens, profectique 
 Jud&aelig;a rerum potirentur--A persuasion existed in the minds of many 
 that some ancient writings of the priests contained a prediction that 
 about that time an eastern power would prevail, and that persons 
 proceeding from Judea would obtain dominion. Suetonius</I> also, in the 
 life of <I>Vespasian,</I> speaks of it; so that this extraordinary 
 phenomenon was construed as pointing to <I>that king;</I> and we may 
 suppose a divine impression made upon their minds, enabling them to 
 interpret this star as a signal given by Heaven of the birth of 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How they prosecuted this enquiry. <I>They came from the</I> east to 
 Jerusalem, in further quest of this prince. Wither shall they come to 
 enquire for the king of the Jews, but to Jerusalem, the mother-city, 
 <I>whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord?</I> They might 
 have said, "If such a prince be born, we shall hear of him shortly in 
 our own country, and it will be time enough then to pay our homage to 
 him." But so impatient were they to be better acquainted with him, that 
 they took a long journey on purpose to enquire after him. Note, Those 
 who truly desire to know Christ, and find him, will not regard pains or 
 perils in seeking after him. <I>Then shall we know, if we follow on to 
 know the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Their question is, <I>Where is he that is born king of the Jews?</I> 
 They do not ask, <I>whether there were such a one born?</I> (they are 
 sure of that, and speak of it with assurance, so strongly was it set 
 home upon their hearts); but, <I>Where is he born?</I> Note, Those who 
 know <I>something</I> of Christ cannot but covet to <I>know more</I> of 
 him. They call Christ the <I>King of the Jews,</I> for so the Messiah 
 was expected to be: and he is Protector and Ruler of all the spiritual 
 Israel, he is <I>born a King.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To this question they doubted not but to have a ready answer, and to 
 find all Jerusalem worshipping at the feet of this new king; but they 
 come from door to door with this question, and no man can give them any 
 information. Note, There is more gross ignorance in the world, and in 
 the church too, than we are aware of. Many that we think should direct 
 us to Christ are themselves strangers to him. They ask, as the spouse 
 of the daughters of Jerusalem, <I>Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?</I> 
 But they are never the wiser. However, like the spouse, they pursue the 
 enquiry, <I>Where is he that is born king of the Jews?</I> Are they 
 asked, "Why do ye make this enquiry?" It is because they have <I>seen 
 his star in the east.</I> Are they asked, "What business have ye with 
 him? What have the men of the <I>east</I> to do with the <I>King of the 
 Jews?</I>" They have their answer ready, <I>We are come to worship 
 him.</I> They conclude he will, in process of time, be <I>their 
 king,</I> and therefore they will betimes ingratiate themselves with 
 him and with those about him. Note, Those in whose hearts the day-star 
 is risen, to give them any thing of the knowledge of Christ, must make 
 it their business to worship him. Have we seen Christ's star? Let us 
 study to give him honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. How this enquiry was treated at Jerusalem. News of it at last came 
 to court; and <I>when Herod heard it he was troubled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He could not be a stranger to the prophecies of the <I>Old 
 Testament,</I> concerning the Messiah and his kingdom, and the times 
 fixed for his appearing by Daniel's weeks; but, having himself reigned 
 so long and so successfully, he began to hope that those promises would 
 for ever fail, and that his kingdom would be established and 
 perpetuated in spite of them. What a damp therefore must it needs be 
 upon him, to hear talk of this King being born, now, when the time 
 fixed for his appearing had come! Note, Carnal wicked hearts dread 
 nothing so much as the fulfilling of the scriptures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But though Herod, an Edomite, was troubled, one would have thought 
 Jerusalem should rejoice greatly to hear that her King comes; yet, it 
 seems, <I>all Jerusalem,</I> except the few there that <I>waited for 
 the consolation of Israel, were troubled with</I> Herod, and were 
 apprehensive of I know not what ill consequences of the birth of this 
 new king, that it would involve them in war, or restrain their lusts; 
 they, for their parts, desired no king but Herod; no, not the Messiah 
 himself. Note, The slavery of sin is foolishly preferred by many to the 
 glorious liberty of the children of God, only because they apprehend 
 some present difficulties attending that necessary revolution of the 
 government in the soul. Herod and Jerusalem were thus troubled, from a 
 mistaken notion that the kingdom of the Messiah would clash and 
 interfere with the secular powers; whereas the star that proclaimed him 
 king plainly intimated that his kingdom was heavenly, and not of this 
 lower world. Note, The reason why the kings of the earth, and the 
 people, oppose the kingdom of Christ, is because they do not know it, 
 but err concerning it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. What assistance they met with in this enquiry from the scribes and 
 the priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>.

 Nobody can pretend to tell where the King of the Jews is, but Herod 
 enquires where it was expected <I>he should be born.</I> The persons he 
 consults are, the chief priests, who were teachers by office; and the 
 scribes, who made it their business to study the law; their <I>lips 
 must keep knowledge,</I> but then the people must <I>enquire the law at 
 their mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>.

 It was generally known that Christ should be <I>born at Bethlehem</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:42">John vii. 42</A>);

 but Herod would have counsel's opinion upon it, and therefore applies
 himself to the proper persons; and, that he might be the better 
 satisfied, he has them altogether, <I>all the chief priests, and all 
 the scribes;</I> and <I>demands of them</I> what was the place, 
 according to the scriptures of the Old Testament, <I>where Christ 
 should be born?</I> Many a good question is put with an ill design, so 
 was this by Herod.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The priests and scribes need not take any long time to give an answer 
 to this query; nor do they differ in their opinion, but all agree that 
 the Messiah must be <I>born in Bethlehem, the city of David,</I> here 
 called <I>Bethlehem of Judea,</I> to distinguish it from another city 
 of the same name in the land of Zebulun, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:15">Josh. xix. 15</A>.

 <I>Bethlehem</I> signifies the <I>house of bread;</I> the fittest place
 for him to be born in who is the true manna, <I>the bread which came
 down from heaven,</I> which was <I>given for the life of the world.</I>
 The proof they produce is taken from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:2">Mic. v. 2</A>,

 where it is foretold that though <I>Bethlehem be little among the
 thousands of Judah</I> (so it is in <I>Micah</I>), no very populous 
 place, yet it shall be found <I>not the least among the princes of 
 Judah</I> (so it is here); for Bethlehem's honour lay not, as that of 
 other cities, in the multitude of the people, but in the magnificence 
 of the princes it produced. Though, upon some accounts, Bethlehem was
 little, yet herein it had the pre-eminence above all the cities of 
 Israel, that <I>the Lord shall count, when he writes up the people, 
 that this man,</I> even <I>the man Christ Jesus, was born there,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:6">Ps. lxxxvii. 6</A>.

 <I>Out of thee shall come a Governor,</I> the <I>King of the Jews.</I>
 Note, Christ will be a <I>Saviour</I> to those only who are willing to 
 take him for their <I>Governor.</I> Bethlehem was the <I>city of 
 David,</I> and David the glory of Bethlehem; there, therefore, must 
 David's son and successor be born. There was a famous well at 
 <I>Bethlehem,</I> by the gate, which David longed to drink of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:15">2 Sam. xxiii. 15</A>);

 in Christ we have not only bread enough and to spare, but may come and
 take also <I>of the water of life freely.</I> Observe here how Jews and 
 Gentiles compare notes about Jesus Christ. The Gentiles know the time 
 of his birth by a star; the Jews know the place of it by the 
 scriptures; and so they are capable of informing one another. Note, It 
 would contribute much to the increase of knowledge, if we did thus 
 mutually communicate what we know. Men grow rich by bartering and 
 exchanging; so, if we have knowledge to communicate to others, they 
 will be ready to communicate to us; thus many shall discourse, shall 
 <I>run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The bloody project and design of Herod, occasioned by this 
 enquiry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Herod was now an old man, and had reigned thirty-five years; this king 
 was but newly born, and not likely to enterprise any thing considerable 
 for many years; yet Herod is jealous of him. Crowned heads cannot 
 endure to think of successors, much less of rivals; and therefore 
 nothing less than the blood of this infant king will satisfy him; and 
 he will not give himself liberty to think that, if this new-born child 
 should be indeed the Messiah, in opposing him, or making any attempts 
 upon him, he would <I>be found fighting against God,</I> than which 
 nothing is more vain, nothing more dangerous. Passion has got the 
 mastery of reason and conscience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 
 
 1. See how cunningly he laid the project

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>).

 <I>He privily called the wise men,</I> to talk with them about this
 matter. He would not openly own his fears and jealousies; it would be 
 his disgrace to let the wise men know them, and dangerous to let the 
 people know them. Sinners are often tormented with secret fears, which
 they keep to themselves. Herod learns of the wise men the <I>time when 
 the star appeared,</I> that he might take his measures accordingly; and 
 then employs them to enquire further, and bids them bring him an 
 account. All this might look suspicious, if he had not covered it with
 a show of religion: <I>that I may come and worship him also.</I> Note, 
 The greatest wickedness often conceals itself under a mask of piety.
 Absalom cloaks his rebellious project with a vow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See how strangely he was befooled and infatuated in this, that he 
 trusted it with the wise men, and did not choose some other managers, 
 that would have been true to his interests. It was but seven miles from 
 Jerusalem; how easily might he have sent spies to watch the wise men, 
 who might have been as soon there to destroy the child as they to 
 worship him! Note, God can hide from the eyes of the church's enemies 
 those methods by which they might easily destroy the church; when he 
 intends to <I>lead princes away spoiled,</I> his way is to <I>make the 
 judges fools.</I></P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the
 star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came
 and stood over where the young child was.
 &nbsp; 10  When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
 joy.
 &nbsp; 11  And when they were come into the house, they saw the young
 child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him:
 and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him
 gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
 &nbsp; 12  And being warned of God in a dream that they should not
 return to Herod, they departed into their own country another
 way.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the wise men's humble attendance upon this new-born 
 <I>King of the Jews,</I> and the honours they paid him. From Jerusalem 
 they went to Bethlehem, resolving to <I>seek till they should find;</I> 
 but it is very strange that they went alone; that not one person of the 
 court, church, or city, should accompany them, if not in conscience, 
 yet in civility to them, or touched with a curiosity to see this young 
 prince. As <I>the queen of the south,</I> so <I>the wise men of the 
 east,</I> will <I>rise up in judgment against</I> the men of that 
 generation, and of this too, <I>and will condemn them;</I> for they 
 <I>came from a far country,</I> to worship Christ; while the Jews, his 
 kinsmen, would not stir a step, would not go to the next town to bid 
 him welcome. It might have been a discouragement to these wise men to 
 find him whom they sought thus neglected at home. Are we come so far to 
 honour <I>the King of the Jews,</I> and do the Jews themselves put such 
 a slight upon him and us? Yet they persist in their resolution. Note, 
 We must continue our attendance upon Christ, though we be alone in it; 
 whatever others do, we must <I>serve the Lord;</I> if they will not go 
 to heaven with us, yet we must not go to hell with them. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See how they found out Christ by the same star that they had seen in 
 their own country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. How graciously God directed them. By the first appearance of the
 star they were given to understand where they might enquire for this 
 King, and then it disappeared, and they were left to take the usual 
 methods for such an enquiry. Note, Extraordinary helps are not to be 
 expected where ordinary means are to be had. Well, they had traced the 
 matter as far as they could; they were upon their journey to Bethlehem, 
 but that is a populous town, where shall they find him when they come 
 thither? Here they were at a loss, at their wit's end, but not at their 
 faith's end; they believed that God, who had brought them thither by 
 his word, would not leave them there; nor did he; for, behold, <I>the 
 star which they saw in the east went before them.</I> Note, If we go on 
 as far as we can in the way of duty, God will direct and enable us to 
 do that which of ourselves we cannot do; <I>Up, and be doing, and the 
 Lord will be with thee. Vigilantibus, non dormientibus, succurit 
 lex--The law affords its aid, not to the idle, but to the active.</I> 
 The star had left them a great while, yet now returns. They who follow 
 God in the dark shall find that light is sown, is reserved, for them. 
 Israel was led by a pillar of fire to <I>the promised land,</I> the 
 wise men by a star to <I>the promised Seed,</I> who is himself <I>the 
 bright and morning Star,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:16">Rev. xxii. 16</A>.

 God would rather <I>create a new thing</I> than leave those at a loss 
 who diligently and faithfully sought him. This star was the token of 
 God's presence with them; for he is light, and goes before his people 
 as their Guide. Note, If we by faith eye God in all our ways, we may 
 see ourselves under his conduct; he <I>guides with his eye</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:8">Ps. xxxii. 8</A>),

 and said to them, <I>This is the way, walk in it:</I> and there is a 
 day-star that arises in the hearts of those that enquire after Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:19">2 Pet. i. 19</A>.

 2. Observe how joyfully they followed God's direction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>).

 <I>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</I>
 Now they saw they were not deceived, and had not taken this long 
 journey in vain. <I>When the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.</I> 
 Now they were sure that God was with them, and the tokens of his 
 presence and favour cannot but fill with joy unspeakable the souls of 
 those that know how to value them. Now they could laugh at the Jews in 
 Jerusalem, who, probably, had laughed at them as coming on a fool's 
 errand. The watchmen can give the spouse no tidings of her beloved; yet 
 it <I>is but a little that she passes from them, and she finds him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:3,4">Cant. iii. 3, 4</A>.

 We cannot expect too little from man, nor too much from God. What a
 transport of joy these wise men were in upon this sight of the star; 
 none know so well as those who, after a long and melancholy night of 
 temptation and desertion, under the power of a <I>Spirit of 
 bondage,</I> at length <I>receive the spirit of adoption, witnessing 
 with their spirits that they are the children of God;</I> this is light 
 out of darkness; it is life from the dead. Now they had reason to hope 
 for a sight of <I>the Lord's Christ</I> speedily, of the <I>Sun of 
 righteousness,</I> for they see <I>the Morning Star.</I> Note, We 
 should be glad of every thing that will show us the way to Christ. This 
 star was sent to meet the wise men, and to conduct them into the 
 presence chamber of the King; by this master of ceremonies they were 
 introduced, to have their audience. Now God fulfills his promise of 
 meeting those that are disposed to <I>rejoice and work 
 righteousness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:5">Isa. lxiv. 5</A>),

 and they fulfill his precept. <I>Let the hearts of those rejoice that
 seek the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:3">Ps. cv. 3</A>.

 Note, God is pleased sometimes to favour young converts with such
 tokens of his love as are very encouraging to them, in reference to the 
 difficulties they meet with at their setting out of the ways of 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See how they made their address to him when they had found him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 We may well imagine their expectations were raised to find this royal 
 babe, though slighted by the nation, yet honourably attended at home; 
 and what a disappointment it was to them when they found a cottage was 
 his palace, and his own poor mother all the retinue he had! Is this
 <I>the Saviour of the world?</I> Is this <I>the King of the Jews,</I> 
 nay, and <I>the Prince of the kings of the earth?</I> Yes, this is he, 
 who, <I>though he was rich,</I> yet, <I>for our sakes, became</I> thus 
 <I>poor.</I> However, these wise men were so wise as to see through 
 this veil, and in this despised babe to discern <I>the glory as of the 
 Only-begotten of the Father;</I> they did not think themselves balked 
 or baffled in their enquiry; but, as having found the King they sought, 
 they presented themselves first, and then their gifts, to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They presented themselves to him: <I>they fell down, and worshipped 
 him.</I> We do not read that they gave such honour to Herod, though he 
 was in the height of his royal grandeur; but to this babe they gave 
 this honour, not only as to a king (then they would have done the same 
 to Herod), but as to a God. Note, All that have found Christ fall down 
 before him; they adore him, and submit themselves to him. <I>He is thy 
 Lord, and worship thou him.</I> It will be the wisdom of the wisest of 
 men, and by this it will appear they know Christ, and understand 
 themselves and their true interests, if they be humble, faithful 
 worshippers of the Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>They presented their gifts to him.</I> In the eastern nations, 
 when they did homage to their kings, they made them presents; thus the 
 subjection of the kings of Sheba to Christ is spoken of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:10">Ps. lxxii. 10</A>),

 <I>They shall bring presents, and offer gifts.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:6">Isa. lx. 6</A>.

 Note, With ourselves, we must give up all that we have to Jesus Christ;
 and if we be sincere in the surrender of ourselves to him, we shall not 
 be unwilling to part with what is dearest to us, and most valuable, to 
 him and for him; nor are our gifts accepted, unless we first present 
 ourselves to him living sacrifices. <I>God had respect to Abel, and</I> 
 then to <I>his offering.</I> The gifts they presented were, <I>gold, 
 frankincense, and myrrh,</I> money, and money's-worth. Providence sent
 this for a seasonable relief to Joseph and Mary in their present poor 
 condition. These were the products of their own country; what God 
 favours us with, we must honour him with. Some think there was a 
 significancy in their gifts; they offered him <I>gold,</I> as a king, 
 paying him tribute, <I>to C&aelig;sar, the things that are 
 C&aelig;sar's; frankincense,</I> as God, for they honoured God with the 
 smoke of incense; and <I>myrrh,</I> as a Man that should die, for 
 <I>myrrh</I> was used in embalming dead bodies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. See how they left him when they had made their address to him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Herod appointed them to <I>bring him word</I> what discoveries they had 
 made, and, it is probable, they would have done so, if they had not 
 been countermanded, not suspecting their being thus made his tools in a 
 wicked design. Those that mean honestly and well themselves are easily 
 made to believe that others do so too, and cannot think the world is as 
 bad as it really is; but <I>the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out 
 of temptation.</I> We do not find that the wise men promised to come 
 back to Herod, and, if they had, it must have been with the usual 
 proviso, <I>If God permit;</I> God did not permit them, and prevented 
 the mischief Herod designed to the Child Jesus, and the trouble it 
 would have been to the wise men to have been made involuntarily 
 accessory to it. They were <I>warned of God,</I> 
 <B><I>chrematisthentes</I></B>--<I>oraculo vel responso accepto--by an 
 oracular intimation.</I> Some think it intimates that they asked 
 counsel of God, and that this was the answer. Note, Those that act 
 cautiously, and are afraid of sin and snares, if they apply themselves 
 to God for direction, may expect to be led in the right way. They were 
 <I>warned not to return to Herod,</I> nor to Jerusalem; those were 
 unworthy to have reports brought them concerning Christ, that might 
 have seen with their own eyes, and would not. <I>They departed into 
 their own country another way,</I> to bring the tidings to their 
 countrymen; but it is strange that we never hear any more of them, and 
 that they or theirs did not afterwards attend <I>him</I> in the temple, 
 whom they had worshipped in the cradle. However, the direction they had 
 from God in their return would be a further confirmation of their faith 
 in this Child, <I>as the Lord from heaven.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
 appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young
 child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there
 until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to
 destroy him.
 &nbsp; 14  When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by
 night, and departed into Egypt:
 &nbsp; 15  And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be
 fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
 Out of Egypt have I called my son.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's flight into Egypt to avoid the cruelty of Herod, 
 and this was the effect of the wise men's enquiry after him; for, 
 before that, the obscurity he lay in was his protection. It was but 
 little respect (compared with what should have been) that was paid to 
 Christ in his infancy: yet even that, instead of honouring him among 
 his people, did but expose him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now here observe,

 I. The command given to Joseph concerning it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Joseph knew neither the danger the child was in, nor how to escape it; 
 but God by <I>an angel,</I> tells him both <I>in a dream,</I> as before 
 he directed him in like manner what to do,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:20"><I>ch.</I> i. 20</A>.

 Joseph, before his alliance to Christ, had not been wont to converse
 with angels as now. Note, those that are spiritually related to Christ
 by faith have that communion and correspondence with Heaven which 
 before they were strangers to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Joseph is here told what their danger was: <I>Herod will seek the 
 young child to destroy him.</I> Note, God is acquainted with all the 
 cruel projects and purposes of the enemies of his church. <I>I know thy
 rage against me,</I> saith God to Sennacherib, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:28">Isa. xxxvii. 28</A>.

 How early was the blessed Jesus involved in trouble! Usually, even
 those whose riper years are attended with toils and perils have a
 peaceable and quiet infancy; but it was not so with the blessed Jesus:
 his life and sufferings began together; he was born <I>a man striven
 with,</I> as Jeremiah was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:10">Jer. xv. 10</A>),

 who was <I>sanctified from the womb,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:5">Jer. i. 5</A>.

 Both Christ the head, and the church his body, agree in saying, <I>Many
 a time have they afflicted me, from my youth up.</I> Pharaoh's cruelty
 fastens upon the Hebrews' children, and a great red dragon stands ready
 to <I>devour the man-child as soon as it should be born,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:4">Rev. xii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is directed what to do, to escape the danger; <I>Take the young 
 child, and flee into Egypt.</I> Thus early must Christ give an example 
 to his own rule 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:23"><I>ch.</I> x. 23</A>):

 <I>When they persecute you in one city, flee to another.</I> He that
 came to die for us, when <I>his hour was not yet come,</I> fled for his
 own safety. Self-preservation, being a branch of the law of nature, is
 eminently a part of the law of God. <I>Flee;</I> but why <I>into
 Egypt?</I> Egypt was infamous for idolatry, tyranny, and enmity to the
 people of God; it had been a house of bondage to Israel, and
 particularly cruel to the infants of Israel; in Egypt, as much as in
 Ramah, <I>Rachel had been weeping for her children;</I> yet that is
 appointed to be a place of refuge to the holy child Jesus. Note, God,
 when he pleases, can make the worst of places serve the best of
 purposes; for <I>the earth is the Lord's,</I> he makes what use he
 pleases of it: sometimes the earth <I>helps the woman</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:16">Rev. xii. 16</A>.
 
 God, who made Moab a shelter to his outcasts, makes Egypt a refuge for
 his Son. This may be considered,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As a trial of faith of Joseph and Mary. They might be tempted to 
 think, "If this child be the Son of God, as we are told he is, has he 
 no other way to secure himself from a man that is a worm, than by such 
 a mean and inglorious retreat as this? Cannot he summon legions of
 angels to be his life-guard, or cherubim with flaming swords to keep 
 this <I>tree of life?</I> Cannot he strike Herod dead, or wither the 
 hand that is stretched out against him, and so save us the trouble of 
 this remove?" They had been lately told that he should be <I>the glory 
 of his people Israel;</I> and is the land of Israel so soon become too
 hot for him? But we find not that they made any such objections; their 
 faith, being tried, was found firm, they believe <I>this is the Son of 
 God,</I> though they see no miracle wrought for his preservation; but 
 they are put to the use of ordinary means. Joseph had great honour put 
 upon him in being the husband of the blessed virgin; but that honour 
 has trouble attending it, as all honours have in this world; Joseph 
 must <I>take the young child,</I> and carry him <I>into Egypt;</I> and 
 now it appeared how well God had provided for <I>the young child and 
 his mother,</I> in appointing Joseph to stand in so near a relation to 
 them; now the gold which the wise men brought would stand them in stead 
 to bear their charges. God foresees his people's distresses, and 
 provides against them beforehand. God intimates the continuance of his 
 care and guidance, when he saith, <I>Be thou there until I bring thee 
 word,</I> so that he must expect to hear from God again, and not stir 
 without fresh orders. Thus God will keep his people still in a 
 dependence upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) As an instance of the humiliation of our Lord Jesus. As there was 
 no room for him in the inn in Bethlehem, so there was no quiet room for 
 him in the land of Judea. Thus was he banished from the earthly Canaan, 
 that we, who for sin were banished from the heavenly Canaan, might not 
 be for ever expelled. If we and our infants be at any time in straits, 
 let us remember the straits Christ in his infancy was brought into, and 
 be reconciled to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) As a token of God's displeasure against the Jews, who took so 
 little notice of him; justly does he leave those who have slighted him. 
 We have also here an earnest of his favour to the Gentiles, to whom the 
 apostles were to bring the gospel when the Jews rejected it. If Egypt 
 entertain Christ when he is forced out of Judea, it will not be long 
 ere it be said, <I>Blessed be Egypt my people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:25">Isa. xix. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joseph's obedience to this command, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The journey would be inconvenient and perilous both to the young child 
 and to his mother; they were but poorly provided for it, and were 
 likely to meet with cold entertainment in Egypt: yet Joseph <I>was not 
 disobedient to the heavenly vision,</I> made no objection, nor was 
 dilatory in his disobedience. As soon as he had received his orders, he 
 immediately <I>arose,</I> and went away <I>by night,</I> the same 
 night, as it should seem, that he received the orders. Note, Those that 
 would make <I>sure</I> work of their obedience must make <I>quick</I> 
 work of it. Now Joseph went out, as his father Abraham did, with an
 implicit dependence upon God, <I>not knowing whither he went,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:8">Heb. xi. 8</A>.

 Joseph and his wife, having little, had little to care of in this
 remove. An abundance encumbers a necessary flight. If rich people have 
 the advantage of the poor while they possess what they have, the poor 
 have the advantage of the rich when they are called to part with 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Joseph took the young child and his mother.</I> Some observe, that 
 <I>the young child</I> is put first, as the principal person, and Mary 
 is called, not <I>the wife of Joseph,</I> but, which was her great 
 dignity, <I>the mother of the young child.</I> This was not the first 
 Joseph that was driven from Canaan to Egypt for a shelter from the 
 anger of his brethren; this Joseph ought to be welcome there for the 
 sake of that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If we may credit tradition, at their entrance into Egypt, happening to 
 go into a temple, all the images of their gods were overthrown by an 
 invisible power, and fell, like Dagon before the ark, according to that 
 prophecy, <I>The Lord shall come into Egypt, and the idols of Egypt 
 shall be moved at his presence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:1">Isa. xix. 1</A>.

 They continued in Egypt till the death of Herod, which, some think, was
 seven years, others think, not so many months. There they were at a 
 distance from the temple and the service of it, and in the midst of 
 idolaters; but God sent them thither, and will <I>have mercy, and not 
 sacrifice.</I> Though they were far from the temple of the Lord, they 
 had with them the Lord of the temple. A forced absence from God's 
 ordinances, and a forced presence with wicked people, may be the lot, 
 are not the sin, yet cannot but be the grief, of good people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The fulfilling of the scripture in all this--that scripture

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:1">Hos. xi. 1</A>),

 <I>Out of Egypt have I called my son.</I> Of all the evangelists,
 Matthew takes most notice of the fulfilling of the scripture in what 
 concerned Christ, because his gospel was first published among the 
 Jews, with whom that would add much strength and lustre to it. Now this 
 word of the prophet undoubtedly referred to the deliverance of Israel 
 out of Egypt, in which God owned them for his son, his first-born

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:22">Exod. iv. 22</A>);

 but it is here applied, by way of analogy, to Christ, the Head of the
 church. Note, The scripture has many accomplishments, so full and 
 copious is it, and so well ordered in all things. God is every day 
 fulfilling the scripture. Scripture is not of private interpretation: 
 we must give it its full latitude. "<I>When Israel was a child, then I 
 loved him;</I> and, though <I>I loved him,</I> I suffered him to be a 
 great while in Egypt; but, because <I>I loved him,</I> in due time I 
 called him out of Egypt." They that read this must, in their thoughts, 
 not only look back, but look forward; <I>that which has been shall be 
 again</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:9">Eccl. i. 9</A>);

 and the manner of expression intimates this; for it is not said, I
 called <I>him,</I> but I called <I>my son,</I> out of Egypt. Note, It is
 no new thing for God's sons to be in Egypt, in a strange land, in a 
 house of bondage; but they shall be fetched out. They may be hid in 
 Egypt, but they shall not be left there. All the elect of God, being by 
 nature children of wrath, are born in a spiritual Egypt, and in 
 conversion are effectually called out. It might be objected against 
 Christ that he had been in Egypt. Must <I>the Sun of righteousness</I> 
 arise out of that land of darkness! But this shows that to be no 
 strange thing; Israel was brought out of Egypt, to be advanced to the 
 highest honours; and this is but doing the same thing.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,
 was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children
 that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two
 years old and under, according to the time which he had
 diligently enquired of the wise men.
 &nbsp; 17  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
 prophet, saying,
 &nbsp; 18  In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping,
 and great mourning, Rachel weeping <I>for</I> her children, and would
 not be comforted, because they are not.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Herod's resentment of the departure of the wise men. He waited long 
 for their return; he hopes, though they be slow, they will be sure, and 
 he shall crush this rival at his first appearing; but he hears, upon 
 enquiry, that they are gone off another way, which increases his 
 jealousy, and makes him suspect they are in the interest of this new 
 King, which made him <I>exceedingly wroth;</I> and he is the more 
 desperate and outrageous for his being disappointed. Note, Inveterate 
 corruption swells the higher for the obstructions it meets with in a 
 sinful pursuit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His political contrivance, notwithstanding this, to take off him
 that is <I>born King of the Jews.</I> If he could not reach him by a 
 particular execution, he doubted not but to involve him in a general 
 stroke, which, like the sword of war, should <I>devour one as well as 
 another.</I> This would be sure work; and thus those that would destroy 
 <I>their own</I> iniquity must be sure to destroy <I>all</I> their 
 iniquities. Herod was an Edomite, enmity to Israel was bred in the bone 
 with him. Doeg was an Edomite, who, for David's sake, <I>slew all the 
 priests of the Lord.</I> It was strange that Herod could find any so 
 inhuman as to be employed in such a bloody and barbarous piece of work; 
 but wicked hands never want wicked tools to work with. Little children 
 have always been taken under the special protection, not only of human 
 laws, but of human nature; yet these are sacrificed to the rage of this 
 tyrant, under whom, as under Nero, innocence is the least security.
 Herod was, throughout his reign, a bloody man; it was not long before, 
 that he destroyed the whole Sanhedrim, or bench of judges; but blood to 
 the blood-thirsty is like drink to those in a dropsy; <I>Quo plus sunt 
 pot&aelig;, plus sitiuntur aqu&aelig;--The more they drink, the more
 thirsty they become.</I> Herod was now about seventy years old, so that 
 an infant, at this time <I>under two years old,</I> was not likely ever 
 to give him any disturbance. Nor was he a man over fond of his own 
 children, or of their preferment, having formerly slain two of his own 
 sons, Alexander and Aristobulus, and his son Antipater after this, but 
 five days before he himself died; so that it was purely to gratify his 
 own brutish lusts of pride and cruelty that he did this. All is fish 
 that comes to his net.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, What large measures he took, 

 1. As to time; He <I>slew all from two years old and under.</I> It is
 probable that the blessed Jesus was at this time not a year old; yet 
 Herod took in all the infants <I>under two years old,</I> that he might 
 be sure not to miss of his prey. He cares not how many heads fall, 
 which he allows to be innocent, provided that escape not which he 
 supposes to be guilty. 

 2. As to place; He kills all the male children, not only <I>in
 Bethlehem,</I> but <I>in all the coasts thereof,</I> in all the 
 villages of that city. This was being <I>overmuch wicked,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:17">Eccl. vii. 17</A>.

 Hate, an unbridled wrath, armed with an unlawful power, often
 transports men to the most absurd and unreasonable instances of 
 cruelty. It was no unrighteous thing for God to permit this; every life 
 is forfeited to his justice as soon as it commences; that sin which 
 entered by one man's disobedience, introduced death with it; and we are 
 not to suppose any thing more than that common guilt, we are not to 
 suppose that these children <I>were sinners above all that were in 
 Israel,</I> because they suffered such things. <I>God's judgments are a 
 great deep.</I> The diseases and deaths of little children are proofs 
 of original sin. But we must look upon this murder of the infants under 
 another character: it was their martyrdom. How early did persecution 
 commence against Christ and his kingdom! <I>Think ye that he came to 
 send peace on the earth?</I> No, <I>but a sword,</I> such a sword as 
 this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:34,35"><I>ch.</I> x. 34, 35</A>.

 A passive testimony was hereby given to the Lord Jesus. As when he was
 in the womb, he was witnessed to by a child's leaping in the womb for 
 joy at his approach, so now, at <I>two years old,</I> he had 
 contemporary witnesses to him of the same age. They shed their blood 
 for him, who afterwards shed his for them. These were the infantry of 
 <I>the noble army of martyrs.</I> If these infants were thus baptized 
 with blood, though it were their own, into the church triumphant, it 
 could not be said but that, with what they got in heaven, they were 
 abundantly recompensed for what they lost on earth. <I>Out of the 
 mouths of these babes and sucklings God did perfect his praise;</I> 
 otherwise, <I>it is not good to the Almighty that he should thus 
 afflict.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The tradition of the Greek church (and we have it in the &AElig;thiopic
 missal) is, that the number of the children slain was 14,000; but that 
 is very absurd. I believe, if the births of the male children in the 
 weekly bills were computed, there would not be found so many <I>under 
 two years old,</I> in one of the most populous cities in the world, 
 that was not near a fortieth part of it. But it is an instance of the 
 vanity of tradition. It is strange that Josephus does not relate this 
 story; but he wrote long after St. Matthew, and it is probable that he 
 <I>therefore</I> would not relate it, because he would not so far 
 countenance the Christian history; for he was a zealous Jew; but, to be 
 sure, if it had not been true and well attested, he would have 
 contested it. Macrobius, a heathen writer, tells us, that when Augustus 
 C&aelig;sar heard that Herod, among the children he order to be slain
 <I>under two years old,</I> slew his own son, he passed this jest upon 
 him, That it was better to be Herod's swine than his son. The usage of 
 the country forbade him to kill a swine, but nothing could restrain him 
 from killing his son. Some think that he had a young child at nurse in 
 Bethlehem; others think that, through mistake, two events are 
 confounded--the murder of the infants, and the murder of his son
 Antipater. But for the church of Rome to put the Holy Innocents, as 
 they call them, into their calendar, and observe a day in memory of 
 them, while they have so often, by their barbarous massacres, 
 justified, and even out--one Herod, is but to do as their predecessors
 did, who built the tombs of the prophets, while they themselves filled 
 up the same measure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some observe another design of Providence in the murder of the infants. 
 By all the prophecies of the Old Testament it appears that Bethlehem 
 was the place, and this the time, of the Messiah's nativity; now all 
 the children of Bethlehem, born at this time, being murdered, and Jesus 
 only escaping, none but Jesus could pretend to be the Messiah. Herod 
 now thought he had baffled all the Old Testament prophecies, had 
 defeated the indications of the star, and the devotions of the wise 
 men, by ridding the country of this new King; having burnt the hive, he 
 concludes he had killed the master bee; but God in heaven <I>laughs</I> 
 at him, <I>and has</I> him <I>in derision.</I> Whatever crafty cruel 
 devices are in men's hearts, <I>the counsel of the Lord shall 
 stand.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The fulfilling of scripture in this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>);

 <I>Then was fulfilled</I> that prophecy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:15">Jer. xxxi. 15</A>),

 <I>A voice was heard in Ramah.</I> See and adore the fulness of the 
 scripture! That prediction was accomplished in Jeremiah's time, when 
 Nebuzaradan, after he had destroyed Jerusalem, brought all his 
 prisoners to Ramah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+40:1">Jer. xl. 1</A>),

 and there disposed of them as he pleased, for the sword, or for
 captivity. Then was the cry <I>in Ramah heard</I> to Bethlehem (for 
 those two cities, the one in Judah's lot, and the other in Benjamin's, 
 were not far asunder); but now the prophecy is again fulfilled in the 
 great sorrow that was for the death of these infants. The scripture was 
 fulfilled,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In the place of this mourning. The noise of it was heard from 
 Bethlehem to Ramah; for Herod's cruelty extended itself to <I>all the 
 coasts of Bethlehem,</I> even into the lot of Benjamin, among the 
 children of Rachel. Some think the country about Bethlehem was called 
 <I>Rachel,</I> because there she died, and was buried. Rachel's 
 sepulchre was hard by Bethlehem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:16,19,1Sa+10:2">Gen. xxxv. 16, 19.
 Compare 1 Sam. x. 2</A>.
 
 Rachel had her heart much set upon children: the son she died in
 travail of she called <I>Benoni--the son of her sorrow.</I> These
 mothers were like Rachel, lived near Rachel's grave, and many of them 
 descended from Rachel; and therefore their lamentations are elegantly 
 represented by <I>Rachel's weeping.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In the degree of this mourning. It was <I>lamentation and mourning, 
 and great mourning;</I> all little enough to express the sense they had 
 of this aggravated calamity. There was a great cry in Egypt when the 
 first-born were slain, and so there was here when the youngest was 
 slain; for whom we naturally have a particular tenderness. Here was a 
 representation of this world we live in. We hear in it <I>lamentation, 
 and weeping, and mourning,</I> and see <I>the tears of the 
 oppressed,</I> some upon one account, and some upon another. Our ways 
 lie through a <I>vale of tears.</I> This sorrow was so great, that they 
 <I>would not be comforted.</I> They hardened themselves in it, and took 
 a pleasure in their grief. Blessed be God, there is no occasion of 
 grief in this world, no, not that which is supplied by sin itself, that 
 will justify us in refusing to <I>be comforted!</I> They <I>would not 
 be comforted, because they are not,</I> that is, <I>they are not</I> in 
 the land of the living, <I>are not</I> as they were, in their mothers' 
 embraces. If, indeed, <I>they were not,</I> there might be some excuse 
 for sorrowing as though we had no hope; but we know they are not lost, 
 but gone before; if we forget that <I>they are,</I> we lose the best 
 ground of our comfort, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:13">1 Thess. iv. 13</A>.

 Some make this grief of the Bethlehemites to be a judgment upon them
 for their contempt of Christ. They that would not rejoice for the
 birth of the Son of God, are justly made to weep for the death of their 
 own sons; for they only <I>wondered</I> at the tidings the shepherds 
 brought them, but did not <I>welcome</I> them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The quoting of this prophecy might serve to obviate an objection which 
 some would make against Christ, upon this sad providence. "Can the 
 Messiah, who is to be the Consolation of Israel, be introduced with all 
 this lamentation?" Yes, for so it was foretold, and the scripture must 
 be accomplished. And besides, if we look further into this prophecy, we 
 shall find that <I>the bitter weeping</I> in Ramah was but a prologue 
 to the greatest joy, for it follows, <I>Thy work shall be rewarded, and 
 there is hope in thy end.</I> The worse things are, the sooner they 
 will mend. Unto them a child was born, sufficient to repair their 
 losses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord
 appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
 &nbsp; 20  Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and
 go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the
 young child's life.
 &nbsp; 21  And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and
 came into the land of Israel.
 &nbsp; 22  But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judea in the
 room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither:
 notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside
 into the parts of Galilee:
 &nbsp; 23  And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it
 might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be
 called a Nazarene.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's return out of Egypt into the <I>land of 
 Israel</I> again. Egypt may serve to sojourn in, or take shelter in, 
 for a while, but not to abide in. Christ was <I>sent to the lost sheep 
 of the house of Israel,</I> and therefore to them he must return. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What it was that made way for his return-- the death of Herod, which
 happened not long after the murder of the infants; some think not above 
 three months. Such quick work did divine vengeance make! Note, Herods 
 must die; proud tyrants, that were the terror of the mighty, and the 
 oppressors of the godly, <I>in the land of the living,</I> their day 
 must come to fall, and down to the pit they must go. <I>Who art thou 
 then, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die?</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12,13">Isa. li. 12, 13</A>)

 especially considering that at death, not only their envy and hatred
 are perished

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:6">Eccl. ix. 6</A>),
 
 and they cease from troubling
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:17">Job iii. 17</A>),

 but they are punished. Of all sins, the guilt of innocent blood fills
 the measure soonest. It is a dreadful account which Josephus gives of 
 the death of this same Herod (<I>Antiq.</I> 17.146-199), that he was 
 seized with a disease which burned him inwardly with an inexpressible 
 torture; that he was insatiably greedy of meat; had the colic, and 
 gout, and dropsy; such an intolerable stench attended his disease, that 
 none could come near him: and so passionate and impatient was he, that 
 he was a torment to himself, and a terror to all that attended him: his 
 innate cruelty, being thus exasperated, made him more barbarous than 
 ever; having ordered his own son to be put to death, he imprisoned many 
 of the nobility and gentry, and ordered that as soon as he was dead 
 they should be killed; but that execution was prevented. See what kind
 of men have been the enemies and persecutors of Christ and his 
 followers! Few have opposed Christianity but such as have first 
 divested themselves of humanity, as Nero and Domitian.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The orders given from heaven concerning their return, and Joseph's 
 obedience to those orders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>.

 God had sent Joseph into Egypt, and there he staid till the same that 
 brought him thither ordered him thence. Note, In all our removes, it is 
 good to see our way plain, and God going before us; we should not move 
 either one way or the other without order. These orders were sent him 
 by an angel. Note, Our intercourse with God, if it be kept up on our 
 part, shall be kept up on his, wherever we are. No place can exclude
 God's gracious visits. Angels come to Joseph in Egypt, to Ezekiel in
 Babylon, and to John in Patmos. Now, 

 1. The angel informs him of the death of Herod and his accomplices:
 <I>They are dead, which sought the young Child's life.</I> They are 
 dead, but the young Child lives. Persecuted saints sometimes live to
 tread upon the graves of their persecutors. Thus did the church's King 
 weather the storm, and many a one has the church in like manner 
 weathered. <I>They are dead,</I> to wit, Herod and his son Antipater, 
 who, though there were mutual jealousies between them, yet, probably, 
 concurred in seeking the destruction of this new King. If Herod first 
 kill Antipater, and then die himself, the coasts are cleared, and 
 <I>the Lord is known by the judgments which he executes,</I> when one 
 wicked instrument is in the ruin of another. 

 2. He directs him what to do. He must <I>go</I> and return <I>to the
 land of Israel;</I> and he did so without delay; not pleading the 
 tolerably good settlement he had in Egypt, or the inconveniences of the 
 journey, especially if, as is supposed, it was in the beginning of 
 winter that Herod died. God's people follow his direction whithersoever 
 he leads them, wherever he lodges them. Did we but look upon the world 
 as our Egypt, the place of our bondage and banishment, and heaven only 
 as our Canaan, our home, our rest, we should as readily <I>arise,</I> 
 and depart thither, when we are called for, as Joseph did out of 
 Egypt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The further direction he had from God, which way to steer, and 
 where to fix in the land of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 God could have given him these instructions with the former, but God 
 reveals his mind to his people by degrees, to keep them still waiting 
 on him, and expecting to hear further from him. These orders Joseph 
 received <I>in a dream,</I> probably, as those before, by the 
 ministration of an angel. God could have signified his will to Joseph 
 by the Child Jesus, but we do not find that in those removes he either 
 takes notice, or gives notice, of any thing that occurred; surely it 
 was because <I>in all things it behoved him to be made like his 
 brethren;</I> being <I>a Child,</I> he <I>spake as a child,</I> and did 
 <I>as a child,</I> and drew a veil over his infinite knowledge and 
 power; as a child he <I>increased in wisdom.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the direction given this holy, royal family, is, 

 1. That it might not settle in Judea,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Joseph might think that Jesus, being <I>born in Bethlehem,</I> must be
 brought up there; yet he is prudently <I>afraid</I> for <I>the young 
 Child,</I> because <I>he hears that Archelaus reigns in</I> Herod's 
 stead, not over all the kingdom as his father did, but only over Judea, 
 the other provinces being put into other hands. See what a succession 
 of enemies there is to fight against Christ and his church! If one
 drop off, another presently appears, to keep up the old enmity. But for 
 this reason Joseph must not take the young Child into Judea. Note, God 
 will not thrust his children into the mouth of danger, but when it is 
 for his own glory and their trial; for <I>precious in the sight of the 
 Lord are the</I> life and the death <I>of his saints; precious is their 
 blood</I> to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That it must settle in Galilee, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 There Philip now ruled, who was a mild, quiet, man. Note, The 
 providence of God commonly so orders it, that his people shall not want 
 a quiet retreat from the storm and from the tempest; when one climate 
 becomes hot and scorching, another shall be kept more cool and 
 temperate. Galilee lay far north; Samaria lay between it and Judea; 
 thither they were sent, to Nazareth, a city upon a hill, in the centre 
 of the lot of Zebulun; there the mother of our Lord lived, when she 
 conceived that <I>holy thing;</I> and, probably, Joseph lived there 
 too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:26,27">Luke i. 26, 27</A>.

 Thither they were sent, and there they were well known, and were among
 their relations; the most proper place for them to be in. There they 
 continued, and from thence our Saviour was called <I>Jesus of 
 Nazareth,</I> which was to <I>the Jews a stumbling-block,</I> for, 
 <I>Can any good thing come</I> out of <I>Nazareth?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this is said to be fulfilled what was <I>spoken by the prophets, He 
 shall be called a Nazarene.</I> Which may be looked upon, 

 (1.) As a man of honour and dignity, though primarily it signifies no 
 more than <I>a man of Nazareth;</I> there is an allusion or mystery in 
 speaking it, speaking Christ to be,

 [1.] The <I>Man, the Branch,</I> spoken of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1">Isa. xi. 1</A>.

 The word there is <I>Netzar,</I> which signifies either a 
 <I>branch,</I> or <I>the city of Nazareth;</I> in being denominated 
 from that <I>city,</I> he is declared to be that Branch.

 [2.] It speaks him to be the <I>great Nazarite;</I> of whom the legal
 Nazarites were a type and figure (especially Samson,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:5">Judg. xiii. 5</A>),

 and Joseph, who is called a <I>Nazarite among his brethren</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:26">Gen. xlix. 26</A>),

 and to whom that which was prescribed concerning the Nazarites, has
 reference,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:2">Num. vi. 2</A>,

 &c. Not that Christ was, <I>strictly, a Nazarite,</I> for he drank
 wine, and touched dead bodies; but he was <I>eminently</I> so, both as 
 he was singularly holy, and as he was by a solemn designation and 
 dedication set apart to the honour of God in the work of our 
 redemption, as Samson was to save Israel. And it is a name we have all 
 reason to rejoice in, and to know him by. Or, 

 (2.) As a name of reproach and contempt. To be called a
 <I>Nazarene,</I> was to be called a <I>despicable man,</I> a man from 
 whom no good was to be expected, and to whom no respect was to be paid.
 The devil first fastened this name upon Christ, to render him mean, and 
 prejudice people against him, and it stuck as a nickname to him and his 
 followers. Now this was not particularly foretold by any one prophet, 
 but, in general, it was <I>spoken by the prophets,</I> that he should 
 be <I>despised and rejected of men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2,3">Isa. liii. 2, 3</A>),

 a <I>Worm, and no man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:6,7">Ps. xxii. 6, 7</A>),

 that he should be an <I>Alien to his brethren</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:7,8">Ps. lxix. 7, 8</A>.

 Let no name of reproach for religion's sake seem hard to us, when our
 Master was himself called a <I>Nazarene.</I></P>
