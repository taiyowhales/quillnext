 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And <I>Jesus</I> entered and passed through Jericho.
 &nbsp; 2 And, behold, <I>there was</I> a man named Zacch&aelig;us, which was the
 chief among the publicans, and he was rich.
 &nbsp; 3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the
 press, because he was little of stature.
 &nbsp; 4 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
 him: for he was to pass that <I>way.</I>
 &nbsp; 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him,
 and said unto him, Zacch&aelig;us, make haste, and come down; for to
 day I must abide at thy house.
 &nbsp; 6 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
 &nbsp; 7 And when they saw <I>it,</I> they all murmured, saying, That he
 was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
 &nbsp; 8 And Zacch&aelig;us stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord,
 the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any
 thing from any man by false accusation, I restore <I>him</I> fourfold.
 &nbsp; 9 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
 house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.
 &nbsp; 10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which
 was lost.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Many, no doubt, were converted to the faith of Christ of whom no 
 account is kept in the gospels; but the conversion of some, whose case 
 had something in it extraordinary, is recorded, as this of Zaccheus. 
 Christ passed through Jericho, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This city was build under a curse, yet Christ honoured it with his 
 presence, for the gospel <I>takes away the curse.</I> Though it ought 
 not to have been built, yet it was not therefore a sin to live in it 
 when it was built. Christ was now going from the other side Jordan to 
 Bethany near Jerusalem, to raise Lazarus to life; when he was going to 
 do one good work he contrived to do many by the way. He did good both 
 to the <I>souls</I> and to the <I>bodies</I> of people; we have here an 
 instance of the former. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who, and what, this Zaccheus was. His name bespeaks him a Jew. 
 <I>Zaccai</I> was a common name among the Jews; they had a famous 
 rabbi, much about this time, of that name. Observe, 

 1. His calling, and the post he was in: <I>He was the chief among the
 publicans,</I> receiver-general; other publicans were officers under 
 him; he was, as some think, farmer of the customs. We often read of 
 publicans coming to Christ; but here was one that was <I>chief</I> of 
 the publicans, was in authority, that enquired after him. God has his 
 remnant among all sorts. Christ came to save even the <I>chief of 
 publicans.</I> 

 2. His circumstances in the world were very considerable: <I>He was
 rich.</I> The inferior publicans were commonly men of broken fortunes, 
 and low in the world; but he that was <I>chief of the publicans</I> had 
 raised a good estate. Christ had lately shown how <I>hard</I> it is for 
 <I>rich people to enter into the kingdom of God,</I> yet presently 
 produces an instance on one rich man that had been lost, and was found, 
 and that not as the prodigal by being reduced to want.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he came in Christ's way, and what was the occasion of his 
 acquaintance with him. 

 1. He had a great <I>curiosity to see Jesus,</I> what kind of a man he
 was, having heard great talk of him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It is natural to us to come in sight, if we can, of those whose fame 
 has filled our ears, as being apt to imagine there is something 
 extraordinary in their countenances; at least, we shall be able to say 
 hereafter that we have seen such and such <I>great men.</I> But the eye 
 is <I>not satisfied with seeing.</I> We should now <I>seek to see 
 Jesus</I> with an eye of faith, to see <I>who he is;</I> we should 
 address ourselves in holy ordinances with this in our eye, <I>We would 
 see Jesus.</I> 

 2. He could not get his curiosity gratified in this matter because he
 was <I>little,</I> and the crowd was <I>great.</I> Christ did not study 
 to <I>show himself,</I> was not carried on men's shoulders (as the pope 
 is in procession), that all men might see him; neither he nor his 
 kingdom <I>came with observation.</I> He did not ride in an open 
 chariot, as princes do, but, as <I>one of us,</I> he was <I>lost in a 
 crowd;</I> for that was the day of his humiliation. Zaccheus was
 <I>low of stature,</I> and over-topped by all about him, so that he 
 could not get a sight of Jesus. Many that are little of stature have 
 large souls, and are lively in spirit. Who would not rather be a 
 Zaccheus than a Saul, though he was <I>higher by head and shoulders</I> 
 than all about him? Let not those that are little of stature <I>take 
 thought</I> of adding <I>cubits</I> to it. 

 3. Because he would not disappoint his curiosity he <I>forgot his
 gravity,</I> as chief of the publicans, and <I>ran before,</I> like a 
 boy, and <I>climbed up into a sycamore-tree, to see him.</I> Note, 
 Those that sincerely desire a sight of Christ will use the proper means 
 for gaining a sight of him, and will break through a deal of difficulty 
 and opposition, and be willing to take pains to see him. Those that 
 find themselves <I>little</I> must take all the advantages they can get 
 to <I>raise themselves</I> to a sight of Christ, and not be ashamed to 
 own that they need them, and all little enough. Let not dwarfs despair, 
 with good help, by aiming high to reach high.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The notice Christ took of him, the call he gave him to a further 
 acquaintance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and the efficacy of that call, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 1. Christ <I>invited himself</I> to Zaccheus's house, not doubting of 
 his hearty welcome there; nay, wherever Christ comes, as he brings his 
 own <I>entertainment</I> along with him, so he brings his own 
 <I>welcome;</I> he opens the heart, and inclines it to receive him.
 Christ <I>looked</I> up into the tree, and <I>saw</I> Zaccheus. He came 
 to look upon Christ, and resolved to take particular notice of him, but 
 little thought of being taken notice of by Christ. That was an honour 
 too great, and too far above his merit, for him to have any thought of.
 See how Christ <I>prevented</I> him with the blessings of his goodness, 
 and <I>outdid</I> his expectations; and see how he <I>encouraged</I> 
 very weak beginnings, and helped them forward. He that had a mind to 
 know Christ shall be <I>known of him;</I> he that only courted to see 
 him shall be admitted to converse with him. Note, Those that are 
 faithful in a little shall be entrusted with more. And sometimes those 
 that come to hear the word of Christ, as Zaccheus did, only for 
 curiosity, beyond what they thought of, have their consciences 
 awakened, and their hearts changed. Christ called him <I>by name, 
 Zaccheus,</I> for he knows his chosen <I>by name; are they not in his 
 book?</I> He might ask, as Nathanael did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:48">John i. 48</A>),

 <I>Whence knowest thou me?</I> But before he climbed the sycamore-tree 
 Christ saw him, and knew him. He bade him <I>make haste, and come 
 down.</I> Those that Christ calls must <I>come down,</I> must humble 
 themselves, and not think to climb to heaven by any righteousness of 
 their own; and they must <I>make haste</I> and come down, for delays 
 are dangerous. Zaccheus must not hesitate, but hasten; he knows it is
 not a matter that needs consideration whether he should welcome such a 
 guest to his house. He must <I>come down,</I> for Christ intends this 
 day to <I>bait at his house,</I> and stay an hour or two with him.
 <I>Behold, he stands at the door and knocks.</I> 

 2. Zaccheus was <I>overjoyed</I> to have such an honour put upon his
 house

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>He made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully;</I> and his 
 receiving him <I>into his house</I> was an indication and token of his 
 receiving him <I>into his heart.</I> Note, When Christ <I>calls</I> to 
 us we must <I>make haste</I> to answer his calls; and when he <I>comes 
 to us</I> we must <I>receive him joyfully. Lift up your heads, O ye 
 gates.</I> We may well <I>receive him joyfully</I> who brings all good 
 along with him, and, when he takes possession of the soul, opens 
 springs of joy there which shall flow to eternity. How often has Christ 
 said to us, <I>Open to me,</I> when we have, with the spouse, made 
 excuses! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:2,3">Cant. v. 2, 3</A>.

 Zaccheus's forwardness to receive Christ will shame us. We have not now
 Christ to entertain in our houses, but we have his disciples, and what 
 is done to them he takes as done to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The offence which the people took at this <I>kind greeting</I> 
 between Christ and Zaccheus. Those narrow-souled censorious Jews 
 <I>murmured,</I> saying that he was <I>gone to be a guest with a man 
 that is a sinner,</I> <B><I>para hamartolo andri</I></B>--<I>with a
 sinful man;</I> and were not they themselves sinful men? Was it not 
 Christ's errand into the world to seek and save <I>men</I> that are 
 <I>sinners?</I> But Zaccheus they think to be a sinner above all men 
 that dwelt in Jericho, such a sinner as was not fit to be conversed 
 with. Now this was very unjust to blame Christ for going <I>to his 
 house;</I> for, 

 1. Though he was a <I>publican,</I> and many of the publicans were
 <I>bad men,</I> it did not therefore follow that they were <I>all 
 so.</I> We must take heed of condemning men in the lump, or by common 
 fame, for at God's bar every man will be judged as he is. 

 2. Though he <I>had been a sinner,</I> it did not therefore follow
 that he was now as bad as he had been; though they knew his past life 
 to be bad, Christ might know his present frame to be good. God allows 
 room for repentance, and so must we. 

 3. Though he was <I>now a sinner,</I> they ought not to blame Christ
 for going to him, because he was in <I>no danger</I> of getting hurt by 
 a sinner, but in <I>great hopes</I> of doing good to a sinner; whither 
 should the physician go but to the sick? Yet see how that which is 
 <I>well done</I> may be <I>ill construed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The proofs which Zaccheus gave publicly that, though he had been a 
 <I>sinner,</I> he was now a <I>penitent,</I> and a true <I>convert,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He does not expect to be justified by his works as the Pharisee who 
 boasted of what he had done, but by his <I>good works</I> he will, 
 through the grace of God, evidence the <I>sincerity</I> of his 
 <I>faith</I> and <I>repentance;</I> and here he declares what his 
 determination was. He made this declaration <I>standing,</I> that he 
 might be seen and heard by those who murmured at Christ for coming to 
 his house; <I>with the mouth confession is made</I> of repentance as 
 well as faith. He <I>stood,</I> which denotes his saying it 
 deliberately and with solemnity, in the nature of a vow to God. He 
 addressed himself to Christ in it, not to the people (they were not to 
 be his judges), but to the Lord, and he <I>stood</I> as it were at his 
 bar. What we do that is good we must do <I>as unto him;</I> we must 
 appeal to him, and approve ourselves to him, in our integrity, in all 
 our good purposes and resolutions. He makes it appear that there is a 
 change <I>in his heart</I> (and that is repentance), for there is a 
 change in his way. His resolutions are of second-table duties; for 
 Christ, upon all occasions, laid great stress on them: and they are 
 such as are suited to his condition and character; for in them will 
 best appear the truth of our repentance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Zaccheus had a good estate, and, whereas he had been in it hitherto 
 laying up treasure for himself, and doing hurt to himself, now he 
 resolves that for the future he will be all towards God, and do good to 
 others with it: <I>Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the 
 poor.</I> Not, "I <I>will</I> give it by my will when I die," but, "I 
 <I>do</I> give it now." Probably he had heard of the command of trial 
 which Christ gave to another rich man to sell what he had, and give to 
 the poor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:21">Matt. xix. 21</A>),

 and how he broke with Christ upon it. "But so will not I," saith 
 Zaccheus; "I agree to it at the first word; though hitherto I have been 
 uncharitable to the poor, now I will relieve them, and give so much the 
 more for having neglected the duty so long, even the <I>half of my 
 goods.</I>" This is a very large proportion to be set apart for works 
 of piety and charity. The Jews used to say that a fifth part of a man's 
 income yearly was very fair to be given to pious uses, and about that 
 share the law directed; but Zaccheus would go much further, and give 
 one moiety to the poor, which would oblige him to retrench all his 
 extravagant expenses, as his retrenching these would enable him to 
 relieve many with his superfluities. If we were but more temperate and 
 self-denying, we should be more charitable; and, were we content with 
 less ourselves, we should have the more to give to them that need. This 
 he mentions here as a fruit of his repentance. Note, It well becomes 
 converts to God to be charitable to the poor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Zaccheus was conscious to himself that he had not gotten all he had 
 honestly and fairly, but some by indirect and unlawful means, and of 
 what he had gotten by such means he promises to make restitution: "If 
 <I>I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation,</I> or if I 
 have wronged any man in the way of my business as a <I>publican,</I> 
 exacting more than was appointed, I promise to restore him 
 <I>four-fold.</I>" This was the restitution that a thief was to make, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:1">Exod. xxii. 1</A>.

 (1.) He seems plainly to own that he had <I>done wrong;</I> his office,
 as a publican, gave him opportunity to do wrong, imposing upon the 
 merchants to curry favour with the government. True penitents will own 
 themselves not only in general guilty before God, but will particularly 
 reflect upon that which has been their own iniquity, and which, by 
 reason of their business and employment in the world, has most easily 
 beset them. 

 (2.) That he had done wrong <I>by false accusation;</I> this was the 
 temptation of the publicans, which John Baptist had warned them of 
 particularly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:14"><I>ch.</I> iii. 14</A>.

 They had the ear of the government, and every thing would be stretched
 in favour of the revenue, which gave them an opportunity of gratifying 
 their revenge if they bore a man an ill will.

 (3.) He promises to restore <I>four-fold,</I> as far as he could 
 recollect or find by his books that he had <I>wronged any man.</I> He 
 does not say, "If I be sued, and compelled to it, I will make 
 restitution" (some are <I>honest</I> when they cannot help it); but he 
 will do it <I>voluntarily:</I> It shall be <I>my own act and deed.</I> 
 Note, Those who are convinced of having done wrong cannot evidence the 
 sincerity of their repentance but by <I>making restitution.</I> 
 Observe, He does not think that his giving half his estate to the poor 
 will atone for the wrong he has done. God <I>hates robbery for 
 burnt-offerings,</I> and we must first <I>do justly</I> and then 
 <I>love mercy.</I> It is no charity, but hypocrisy, to give that which 
 is <I>none of our own;</I> and we are not to reckon that our own which 
 we have not come honestly by, nor that our own which is not so when all 
 our debts are paid, and restitution made for wrong done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Christ's <I>approbation</I> and <I>acceptance</I> of Zaccheus's 
 conversion, by which also he cleared himself from any imputation in 
 going to be a guest with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Zaccheus is declared to be now a <I>happy man.</I> Now he is turned 
 from sin to God; now he has bidden Christ welcome to his house, and is 
 become an honest, charitable, good man: <I>This day is salvation come 
 to this house.</I> Now that he is <I>converted</I> he is in effect 
 <I>saved,</I> saved from his sins, from the guilt of them, from the 
 power of them; all the benefits of salvation are his. Christ is come 
 <I>to his house,</I> and, where Christ comes, he brings salvation along 
 with him. He is, and will be, the <I>Author of eternal salvation</I> to 
 all that own him as Zaccheus did. Yet this is not all. Salvation this 
 day <I>comes to his house.</I> 

 (1.) When Zaccheus becomes a convert, he will be, more than he had 
 been, a <I>blessing to his house.</I> He will bring the means of grace 
 and salvation to his house, for he is a <I>son of Abraham</I> indeed 
 now, and therefore, like Abraham, will teach his household to <I>keep 
 the way of the Lord. He that is greedy of gain troubles his own 
 house,</I> and brings a curse upon it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:9">Hab. ii. 9</A>),

 but he that is charitable to the poor does a kindness to his own house, 
 and brings a blessing upon it and salvation to it, temporal at least, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:3">Ps. cxii. 3</A>.

 (2.) When Zaccheus is brought to Christ himself his <I>family</I> also
 become related to Christ, and his children are admitted members of his 
 church, and so <I>salvation comes to his house,</I> for that he is <I>a 
 son of Abraham,</I> and therefore interested in God's covenant with 
 Abraham, that <I>blessing</I> of Abraham which comes upon the 
 publicans, <I>upon the Gentiles,</I> through faith, that God will be a 
 God <I>to them and to their children;</I> and therefore, when he 
 believes, <I>salvation comes</I> to his house, as the gaoler's to whom 
 it was said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, <I>and thou shalt be 
 saved, and thy house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:31">Acts xvi. 31</A>.

 Zaccheus is by birth a son of Abraham, but, being a publican, he was
 deemed a heathen; they are put upon a level, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:17">Matt. xviii. 17</A>.

 And as such the Jews were shy of conversing with him, and expected
 Christ should be so; but he shows that, being a true penitent, he is 
 become <I>rectus in curia--upright in court,</I> as good a son of 
 Abraham as if he had never been an publican, which therefore ought not 
 to be mentioned against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What Christ had done to make him, in particular, a happy man, was 
 consonant to the great design and intention of his coming into the 
 world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 With the same argument he had before justified his conversing with
 publicans, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:13">Matt. ix. 13</A>.

 There he pleaded that he came to <I>call sinners to repentance;</I> now 
 that he came to <I>seek and save that which was lost,</I> <B><I>to 
 apololos</I></B>--<I>the lost thing.</I> Observe,

 (1.) The <I>deplorable case</I> of the <I>sons of men:</I> they were 
 <I>lost;</I> and here the whole race of mankind is spoken of as <I>one 
 body.</I> Note, The whole world of mankind, by the fall, is become a 
 <I>lost world:</I> lost as a city is lost when it has revolted to the 
 rebels, as a traveller is lost when he has missed his way in a 
 wilderness, as a sick man is lost when his disease is incurable, or as 
 a prisoner is lost when sentence is passed upon him.

 (2.) The <I>gracious design</I> of the <I>Son of God:</I> he came to
 <I>seek and save,</I> to seek in order to saving. He came from heaven 
 to earth (a long journey), to <I>seek</I> that which was <I>lost</I> 
 (which had <I>wandered and gone astray</I>), and to bring it back 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:11,12">Matt. xviii. 11, 12</A>),

 and to <I>save</I> that which was lost, which was perishing, and in a 
 manner destroyed and cut off. Christ undertook the cause when it was 
 given up for <I>lost:</I> undertook to bring those to themselves that 
 were <I>lost</I> to God and all goodness. Observe, Christ <I>came</I> 
 into this lost world to seek and save it. His design was to 
 <I>save,</I> when <I>there was not salvation in any other.</I> In 
 prosecution of that design, he <I>sought,</I> took all probable means 
 to effect that salvation. He seeks those that were not worth seeking 
 to; he seeks those that sought him not, and asked not for him, as 
 Zaccheus here.</P>

 thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.
 &nbsp; 12 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far
 country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
 &nbsp; 13 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten
 pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.
 &nbsp; 14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,
 saying, We will not have this <I>man</I> to reign over us.
 &nbsp; 15 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having
 received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be
 called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might
 know how much every man had gained by trading.
 &nbsp; 16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
 pounds.
 &nbsp; 17 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou
 hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten
 cities.
 &nbsp; 18 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained
 five pounds.
 &nbsp; 19 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.
 &nbsp; 20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, <I>here is</I> thy pound,
 which I have kept laid up in a napkin:
 &nbsp; 21 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou
 takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst
 not sow.
 &nbsp; 22 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge
 thee, <I>thou</I> wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere
 man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not
 sow:
 &nbsp; 23 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that
 at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?
 &nbsp; 24 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the
 pound, and give <I>it</I> to him that hath ten pounds.
 &nbsp; 25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)
 &nbsp; 26 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be
 given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be
 taken away from him.
 &nbsp; 27 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign
 over them, bring hither, and slay <I>them</I> before me.

 Our Lord Jesus is now upon his way to Jerusalem, to his last passover, 
 when he was to suffer and die; now here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the expectations of his friends were <I>raised</I> upon this 
 occasion: <I>They thought that the kingdom of God would immediately 
 appear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 The Pharisees expected it about this time
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:20"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 20</A>),

 and, it seems, so did Christ's own disciples; but they both had a
 mistaken notion of it. The Pharisees thought that it must be introduced 
 by some other temporal prince or potentate. The disciples thought that 
 their Master would introduce it, but with temporal pomp and power, 
 which, with the power he had to work miracles, they knew he could 
 clothe himself with in a short time, whenever he pleased. Jerusalem,
 they concluded, must be the seat of his kingdom, and therefore, now 
 that he is going directly thither, they doubt not but in a little time 
 to see him upon the throne there. Note, Even good men are subject to 
 mistakes concerning the kingdom of Christ, and to form wrong notions of 
 it, and are ready to think that will <I>immediately</I> appear which is 
 reserved for hereafter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How their expectations were <I>checked,</I> and the mistakes 
 <I>rectified</I> upon which they were founded; and this he does in 
 three things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They expected that he should appear in his glory now 
 <I>presently,</I> but he tells them that he must not be publicly 
 installed in his kingdom for a great while yet. He is like <I>a certain 
 nobleman</I> <B><I>anthropos tis eugenes</I></B>--<I>a certain man of
 high birth</I> (so Dr. Hammond), for he is the Lord from heaven, and is 
 entitled by birth to the kingdom; but he <I>goes into a far country, to 
 receive for himself a kingdom.</I> Christ must go to heaven, to sit 
 down at the right hand of the Father there, and to receive from him 
 <I>honour and glory,</I> before the Spirit was poured out by which his 
 kingdom was to be set up on earth, and before a church was to be set up 
 for him in the Gentile world. He must receive the kingdom, and then 
 <I>return.</I> Christ returned when the Spirit was poured out, when 
 Jerusalem was destroyed, by which time that generation, both of friends 
 and enemies, which he had personally conversed with, was wholly worn 
 off by death, and gone to give up their account. But his chief return 
 here meant is that at the great day, of which we are yet in 
 expectation. That which they thought would <I>immediately appear,</I> 
 Christ tells them will not appear till this same Jesus who is taken 
 into heaven shall <I>in like manner come again;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:11">Acts i. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They expected that his apostles and immediate attendants should be 
 advanced to dignity and honour, that they should all be made princes 
 and peers, privy-counsellors and judges, and have all the pomp and 
 preferments of the court and of the town. But Christ here tells them 
 that, instead of this, he designed them to be <I>men of business;</I> 
 they must expect no other preferment in this world than that of the 
 trading end of the town; he would set them up with a stock under their 
 hands, that they might employ it themselves, in serving him and the 
 interest of his kingdom among men. That is the true honour of a 
 Christian and a minister which, if we be as we ought to be truly 
 ambitious of it, will enable us to look upon all temporal honours with 
 a holy contempt. The apostles had dreamed of <I>sitting on his right 
 hand and on his left in his kingdom,</I> enjoying ease after their 
 present toil and honour after the present contempt put upon them, and 
 were pleasing themselves with this dream; but Christ tells them that 
 which, if they understood it aright, would fill them with care, and 
 concern, and serious thoughts, instead of those <I>aspiring</I> ones 
 with which they filled their heads.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They have a <I>great work</I> to do now. Their Master leaves them, 
 to receive his kingdom, and, at parting, he gives each of them a 
 <I>pound,</I> which the margin of our common bibles tells us amounts in 
 our money to <I>three pounds</I> and <I>half a crown;</I> this 
 signifies the same thing with the talents in the parable that is 
 parallel to this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:1-46">Matt. xxv.</A>),

 all the gifts with which Christ's apostles were endued, and the
 advantages and capacities which they had of serving the interests of 
 Christ in the world, and others, both ministers and Christians, like 
 them in a lower degree. But perhaps it is in the parable thus 
 represented to make them the more humble; their honour in this world is 
 only that of <I>traders,</I> and that not of first-rate merchants, who 
 have vast stocks to begin upon, but that of poor traders, who must take 
 a great deal of care and pains to make any thing of what they have. He 
 gave these pounds to his servants, not to buy rich liveries, much less 
 robes, and a splendid equipage, for themselves to appear in, as they 
 expected, but with this charge: <I>Occupy till I come.</I> Or, as it 
 might much better be translated, <I>Trade till I come,</I> 
 <B><I>Pragmateusasthe</I></B>--<I>Be busy.</I> So the word properly 
 signifies. "You are sent forth to preach the gospel, to set up a church 
 for Christ in the world, to bring the nations to the obedience of 
 faith, and to build them up in it. <I>You shall receive power to do 
 this,</I> for you shall be filled with the <I>Holy Ghost,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:8">Acts i. 8</A>.

 When Christ <I>breathed on</I> the eleven disciples, saying, <I>Receive
 ye the Holy Ghost,</I> then he delivered them <I>ten pounds.</I> "Now," 
 saith he, "mind your business, and make a business of it; set about it 
 in good earnest, and stick to it. Lay out yourselves to do all the good 
 you can to the souls of men, and to gather them in to Christ." Note,

 [1.] All Christians have <I>business</I> to do for Christ in this 
 world, and ministers especially; the former were not <I>baptized,</I> 
 nor the latter <I>ordained,</I> to be <I>idle.</I>

 [2.] Those that are called to business for Christ he furnishes with 
 gifts necessary for their business; and, on the other hand, from those 
 to whom he gives power he expects service. He delivers the 
 <I>pounds</I> with this charge, Go work, go trade. <I>The manifestation 
 of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:7">1 Cor. xii. 7</A>.

 And <I>as every one has received the gift,</I> so let him <I>minister
 the same,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:10">1 Pet. iv. 10</A>.

 [3.] We must continue to mind our business <I>till our Master
 comes,</I> whatever difficulties or oppositions we may meet with in it; 
 those only that <I>endure to the end</I> shall <I>be saved.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They have a <I>great account</I> to make shortly. These servants 
 are <I>called to him,</I> to show what use they made of the gifts they 
 were dignified with, what service they had done for Christ, and what 
 good to the souls of men, <I>that he might know what every man had 
 gained by trading.</I> Note,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They that trade diligently and faithfully in the service of Christ 
 shall be <I>gainers.</I> We cannot say so of the business of the world; 
 many a labouring tradesman has been a loser; but those that trade for 
 Christ shall be <I>gainers;</I> though <I>Israel be not gathered,</I> 
 yet they <I>will be glorious.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The conversion of souls is the <I>winning</I> of them; every true 
 convert is clear gain to Jesus Christ. Ministers are but factors for 
 him, and to him they must give account what fish they have enclosed in 
 the gospel-net, what guests they have prevailed with to come to the 
 wedding-supper; that is, what they have <I>gained by trading.</I> Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The <I>good account</I> which was given by <I>some</I> of 
 the servants, and the master's approbation of them. Two such are 
 instanced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:16,19"><I>v.</I> 16, 19</A>.

 1. They had both made considerable improvements, but not both 
 <I>alike;</I> one had gained <I>ten pounds</I> by his trading, and 
 another <I>five.</I> Those that are diligent and faithful in serving 
 Christ are commonly blessed in being made blessings to the places where 
 they live. They shall <I>see the travail of their soul,</I> and not 
 <I>labour in vain.</I> And yet all that are alike <I>faithful</I> are 
 not alike <I>successful.</I> And perhaps, though they were both 
 faithful, it is intimated that one of them took more pains, and applied 
 himself more closely to his business, than the other, and sped 
 accordingly. Blessed Paul was surely this servant that gained <I>ten 
 pounds,</I> double to what any of the rest did, for he <I>laboured more 
 abundantly than they all,</I> and <I>fully preached the gospel of 
 Christ.</I> 

 2. They both acknowledged their obligations to their Master for
 entrusting them with these abilities and opportunities to do him 
 service: Lord, it is not <I>my</I> industry, but <I>thy</I> pound, that 
 has gained <I>ten pounds.</I> Note, God must have all the glory of all 
 our gains; <I>not unto us,</I> but unto him, must be <I>the praise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:1">Ps. cxv. 1</A>.
 
 Paul, who gained the <I>ten pounds,</I> acknowledges, "<I>I
 laboured, yet not I. By the grace of God, I am what I am,</I> and do
 what I do; and <I>his grace was not in vain,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:10">1 Cor. xv. 10</A>.

 He will not speak of what he had done, but of what God <I>had done by 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:18">Rom. xv. 18</A>.

 3. They were both commended for their fidelity and industry: <I>Well
 done, thou good servant,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 And to the other he <I>said likewise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Note, They who do that which is good shall have <I>praise of the same.
 Do well,</I> and Christ will say to thee, <I>Well done:</I> and, if he 
 says <I>Well done,</I> the matter is not great who says otherwise. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:7">Gen. iv. 7</A>.

 4. They were <I>preferred</I> in proportion to the improvement they
 had made: "<I>Because thou hast been faithful in a very little,</I> and 
 didst not say, 'As good sit still as go to trade with one pound, what 
 can one do with so small a stock?' but didst humbly and honestly apply 
 thyself to the improvement of that, <I>have thou authority over ten 
 cities.</I>" Note, Those are in a fair way to rise who are content to 
 begin low. <I>He that has used the office of a deacon well purchaseth
 to himself a good degree,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:13">1 Tim. iii. 13</A>.

 Two things are hereby promised the apostles:--

 (1.) That when they have taken pains to <I>plant</I> many churches they
 shall have the satisfaction and honour of presiding in them, and 
 governing among them; they shall have great respect paid them, and have 
 a great interest in the love and esteem of good Christians. <I>He that 
 keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof;</I> and he that 
 <I>laboureth in the word and doctrine</I> shall be <I>counted worthy of 
 double honour.</I> 

 (2.) That, when they have served their generation, according to the 
 will of Christ, though they pass through this world despised and 
 trampled upon, and perhaps pass out of it under disgrace and 
 persecution as the apostles did, yet in the other world they shall 
 reign as kings with Christ, shall sit with him on his throne, shall 
 have <I>power over the nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:26">Rev. ii. 26</A>.

 The happiness of heaven will be a much greater advancement to a good 
 minister or Christian than it would be to a poor tradesman, that with 
 much ado had cleared ten pounds, to be made governor of ten cities. He 
 that had gained but <I>five pounds</I> had dominion over <I>five 
 cities.</I> This intimates that there are <I>degrees of glory</I> in 
 heaven; every vessel will be alike <I>full,</I> but not alike 
 <I>large.</I> And the degrees of glory there will be according to the 
 degrees of usefulness here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The <I>bad account</I> that was given by <I>one</I> of 
 them, and the sentence passed upon him for his slothfulness and 
 unfaithfulness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>,

 &c.

 1. He owned that he had not <I>traded</I> with the pound with which he
 had been entrusted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Lord, behold, here is thy pound;</I> it is true, I have not made it 
 <I>more,</I> but withal I have not made it <I>less;</I> I have kept it 
 safely <I>laid up in a napkin.</I>" This represents the carelessness of 
 those who have gifts, but never lay out themselves to do good with 
 them. It is all one to them whether the interests of Christ's kingdom 
 sink or swim, go backward or forward; for their parts, they will take 
 no care about it, no pains, be at no expenses, run no hazard. Those are 
 the servants that lay up their pound <I>in a napkin</I> who think it 
 enough to say that they have done no hurt in the world, but <I>did no 
 good.</I> 

 2. He justified himself in his omission, with a plea that made the
 matter worse and not better

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>I feared thee, because thou art an austere man,</I> rigid and
 severe, <B><I>anthropos austeros ei</I></B>. <I>Austere</I> is the 
 Greed word itself: a <I>sharp</I> man: <I>Thou takest up that which
 thou laidst not down.</I> He thought that his master put a hardship 
 upon his servants when he required and expected the improvement of 
 their pounds, and that it was <I>reaping where he did not sow;</I> 
 whereas really it was reaping where he <I>had sown,</I> and, as the 
 husbandman, expecting in proportion to what he had sown. He had no 
 reason to <I>fear</I> his master's austerity, nor blame his 
 expectations, but this was a mere sham, a frivolous groundless excuse 
 for his idleness, which there was no manner of colour for. Note, The 
 pleas of slothful professors, when they come to be examined, will be 
 found more to their <I>shame</I> than in their <I>justification.</I> 

 3. His excuse is turned upon him: <I>Out of thine own mouth will I
 judge thee, thou wicked servant,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 He will be <I>condemned</I> by his crime, but <I>self-condemned</I> by 
 his plea. "If thou didst look upon it as hard that I should expect the
 profit of thy trading, which would have been the greater profit, yet, 
 if thou hadst had any regard to my interest, thou mightest have put my 
 money <I>into the bank,</I> into some of the funds, that I might have 
 had, not only <I>my own,</I> but my own <I>with usury,</I> which, 
 though a <I>less</I> advantage, would have been <I>some.</I>" If he 
 durst not <I>trade</I> for fear of <I>losing</I> the principal, and so 
 being made accountable to his lord for it though it was lost, which he 
 pretends, yet that would be no excuse for his not setting it out to 
 interest, where it would be sure. Note, Whatever may be the pretences
 of slothful professors, in excuse of their slothfulness, the true 
 reason of it is a reigning indifference to the interests of Christ and 
 his kingdom, and their coldness therein. They care not whether
 religion gets around or loses ground, so they can but live at ease. 

 4. His pound is taken from him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 It is fit that those should <I>lose</I> their gifts who will not 
 <I>use</I> them, and that those who have dealt falsely should be no 
 longer trusted. Those who will not serve their Master with what he 
 bestows upon them, why should they be suffered to serve themselves with 
 it? <I>Take from him the pound.</I> 

 5. It is given to him that had the <I>ten pounds.</I> When this was
 objected against by the standers-by, because he had so much already 
 (<I>Lord, he has ten pounds,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),
 
 it is answered
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 <I>Unto every one that hath shall be given.</I> It is the rule of 
 justice, 

 (1.) That those should be most encouraged who have been most 
 industrious, and that those who have laid out themselves most to do 
 good should have their opportunities of doing good <I>enlarged,</I> and 
 be put into a higher and more extensive sphere of usefulness. To him 
 that hath gotten shall more be given, that he may be in a capacity to 
 get more. 

 (2.) That those who have their gifts, as if they had them not, who have 
 them to no purpose, who do no good with them, should be deprived of 
 them. To those who endeavour to increase the grace they have, God will 
 impart more; those who neglect it, and suffer it to decline, can expect 
 no other than that God should do so too. This needful warning Christ 
 gives to his disciples, lest, while they were gaping for honours on 
 earth, they should neglect their business, and so come short of their 
 happiness in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Another thing they expected was, that, when the kingdom of God 
 should appear, the body of the Jewish nation would immediately fall in 
 with it, and submit to it, and all their aversions to Christ and his 
 gospel would immediately vanish; but Christ tells them that, after his 
 departure, the generality of them would persist in their obstinacy and 
 rebellion, and it would be their ruin. This is shown here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In the message which his citizens sent after him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They not only opposed him, while he was in obscurity; but, when he was 
 gone into glory, to be invested in his kingdom, then they continued 
 their enmity to him, protested against his dominion, and said, <I>We 
 will not have this man to reign over us.</I> 

 [1.] This was fulfilled in the prevailing infidelity of the Jews after 
 the ascension of Christ, and the setting up of the gospel kingdom. They 
 would not submit their necks to his yoke, nor touch the top of his 
 golden sceptre. They said, <I>Let us break his bands in sunder,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-3,Ac+4:26">Ps. ii. 1-3; Acts iv. 26</A>.

 [2.] It speaks the language of all unbelievers; they could be content
 that Christ should <I>save them,</I> but they will not have him to 
 <I>reign over them;</I> whereas Christ is a Saviour to those only to 
 whom he is a prince, and who are willing to obey him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In the sentence passed upon them at his return: <I>Those mine 
 enemies bring hither,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 When his faithful subjects are preferred and rewarded, then he will 
 take vengeance on his enemies, and particularly on the Jewish nation, 
 the doom of which is here read. When Christ had set up his gospel 
 kingdom, and thereby put reputation upon the gospel ministry, then he 
 comes to <I>reckon with</I> the Jews; then it is remembered against 
 them that they had particularly disclaimed and protested against his 
 kingly office, when they said, <I>We have no king but C&aelig;sar,</I> 
 nor would own him for their king. They appealed to C&aelig;sar, and to 
 C&aelig;sar they shall go; C&aelig;sar shall be their ruin. Then the 
 <I>kingdom of God appeared</I> when vengeance was taken on those 
 irreconcileable enemies to Christ and his government; they were 
 <I>brought forth and slain before him.</I> Never was so much slaughter 
 made in any war as in the wars of the Jews. That nation lived to see 
 Christianity victorious in the Gentile world, in spite of their enmity 
 and opposition to it, and then it was <I>taken away as dross.</I> The 
 wrath of Christ came upon them to the uttermost

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15,16">1 Thess. ii. 15, 16</A>),

 and their destruction redounded very much to the honour of Christ and 
 the peace of the church. But this is applicable to all others who
 <I>persist</I> in their infidelity, and will undoubtedly perish in it.
 Note, 

 [1.] Utter ruin will certainly be the portion of all Christ's enemies; 
 in the day of vengeance they shall all be brought <I>forth,</I> and 
 <I>slain before him. Bring them hither,</I> to be made a spectacle to 
 saints and angels; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:22,24">Josh. x. 22, 24</A>.

 <I>Bring them hither,</I> that they may see the glory and happiness of
 Christ and his followers, whom they hated and persecuted. <I>Bring
 them hither,</I> to have their frivolous pleas overruled, and to 
 receive sentence according to their merits. Bring them, and <I>slay 
 them before me,</I> as Agag before Samuel. The Saviour whom they have 
 slighted will stand by and see them slain, and not interpose on their 
 behalf.

 [2.] Those that <I>will not have Christ to reign over them</I> shall be 
 reputed and dealt with as his enemies. We are ready to think that none 
 are Christ's enemies but persecutors of Christianity, or scoffers at 
 least; but you see that those will be accounted so that dislike the 
 terms of salvation, will not submit to Christ's yoke, but will be their 
 own masters. Note, Whoever will not be <I>ruled</I> by the grace of 
 Christ will inevitably be ruined by the wrath of Christ.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
 Bethany, at the mount called <I>the mount</I> of Olives, he sent two
 of his disciples,
 &nbsp; 30 Saying, Go ye into the village over against <I>you;</I> in the
 which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet
 never man sat: loose him, and bring <I>him hither.</I>
 &nbsp; 31 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose <I>him?</I> thus shall ye
 say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.
 &nbsp; 32 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he
 had said unto them.
 &nbsp; 33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said
 unto them, Why loose ye the colt?
 &nbsp; 34 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
 &nbsp; 35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments
 upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.
 &nbsp; 36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
 &nbsp; 37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the
 mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to
 rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works
 that they had seen;
 &nbsp; 38 Saying, Blessed <I>be</I> the King that cometh in the name of the
 Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
 &nbsp; 39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto
 him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
 &nbsp; 40 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if
 these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry
 out.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the same account of Christ's riding in some sort of 
 triumph (such as it was) into Jerusalem which we had before in Matthew 
 and Mark; let us therefore here only observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jesus Christ was forward and willing to suffer and die for us. He 
 went forward, <I>bound in the spirit, to Jerusalem,</I> knowing very 
 well the <I>things</I> that should <I>befal him there,</I> and yet 
 <I>he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 He was the foremost of the company, as if he longed to be upon the 
 spot, longed to engage, to take the field, and to enter upon action. 
 Was he so forward to suffer and die for us, and shall we draw back from 
 any service we are capable of doing for him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It was no ways inconsistent either with Christ's humility or with 
 his present state of humiliation to make a <I>public entry</I> into 
 Jerusalem a little before he died. Thus he made himself to be the more 
 taken notice of, that the ignominy of his death might appear the 
 greater.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ is entitled to a dominion over all the creatures, and may 
 use them when and as he pleases. No man has a property in his estate 
 against Christ, but that <I>his</I> title is prior and superior. Christ 
 sent to fetch an <I>ass</I> and her <I>colt</I> from their 
 <I>owner's</I> and <I>master's crib,</I> when he had occasion for their 
 service, and might do so, for all the <I>beasts of the forest are 
 his,</I> and the tame beasts too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ has all men's hearts both under his eye and in his hand. He 
 could influence those to whom the ass and the colt belonged to consent 
 to their taking them away, as soon as they were told that the Lord had 
 occasion for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Those that go on Christ's errands are sure to speed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>They that were sent found</I> what he told them they should find, 
 and the owners willing to part with them. It is a comfort to Christ's 
 messengers that they shall bring what they are sent for, if indeed the 
 Lord has occasion for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The disciples of Christ, who fetch that for him from others which 
 he has occasion for, and which they have not, should not think that 
 enough, but, whatever they have themselves wherewith he may be served 
 and honoured, they should be ready to serve him with it. Many can be 
 willing to attend Christ at other people's expense who care not to be 
 at any charge upon him themselves; but those disciples not only fetched 
 the ass's colt for him, but <I>cast their</I> own <I>garments upon the 
 colt,</I> and were willing that they should be used for his 
 trappings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Christ's triumphs are the matter of his disciples' praises. When 
 Christ came nigh to Jerusalem, God put it of a sudden into the hearts 
 of the <I>whole multitude of the disciples,</I> not of the twelve only, 
 but abundance more, that were disciples at large, <I>to rejoice and 
 praise God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 and the <I>spreading of their clothes in the way</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>)

 was a common expression of joy, as at the feast of tabernacles. 
 Observe, 

 1. What was the matter or occasion of their joy and praise. They
 praised God <I>for all the mighty works they had seen,</I> all the 
 miracles Christ had wrought, especially the <I>raising of Lazarus,</I> 
 which is particularly mentioned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:17,18">John xii. 17, 18</A>.

 That brought others to mind, for fresh miracles and mercies should 
 revive the remembrance of the former.

 2. How they expressed their joy and praise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>Blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord.</I> Christ
 is <I>the king;</I> he <I>comes in the name of the Lord,</I> clothed 
 with a divine authority, commissioned from heaven to <I>give law</I> 
 and treat of <I>peace. Blessed be he.</I> Let us <I>praise him,</I> let 
 God <I>prosper him.</I> He is <I>blessed</I> for ever, and we will 
 speak well of him. <I>Peace in heaven.</I> Let the God of heaven send 
 peace and success to his undertaking, and then there will be <I>glory 
 in the highest.</I> It will redound to the glory of the most high God; 
 and the angels, the glorious inhabitants of the upper world, will give 
 him the glory of it. Compare this song of the saints on earth with that 
 of the angels,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:14"><I>ch.</I> ii. 14</A>.

 They both agree to give glory to God in the highest. There the praises
 of both centre; the angels say, <I>On earth peace,</I> rejoicing in the 
 benefit which men on earth have by Christ; the saints say, <I>Peace in 
 heaven,</I> rejoicing in the benefit which the angels have by Christ. 
 Such is the communion we have with the holy angels that, as <I>they</I> 
 rejoice in the <I>peace on earth,</I> so <I>we</I> rejoice in the 
 <I>peace in heaven,</I> the <I>peace</I> God <I>makes in his high 
 places</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+25:2">Job xxv. 2</A>),

 and both in Christ, who hath reconciled all things to himself, whether 
 <I>things on earth or things in heaven.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. Christ's triumph's, and his disciples' joyful praises of them, 
 are the vexation of proud Pharisees, that are enemies to him and his 
 kingdom. There were some Pharisees among <I>the multitude</I> who were 
 so far from joining with them that they were enraged at them, and, 
 Christ being a famous example of humility, they thought that he would 
 not admit such acclamations as these, and therefore expected that he 
 should <I>rebuke his disciples,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 But it is the honour of Christ that, as he despises the contempt of the 
 proud, so he accepts the praises of the humble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. Whether men praise Christ or no he will, and shall, and must be 
 praised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 <I>If these should hold their peace,</I> and not speak the praises of 
 the Messiah's kingdom, <I>the stones would immediately cry out,</I> 
 rather than that Christ should not be praised. This was, in effect, 
 literally fulfilled, when, upon men's reviling Christ upon the cross, 
 instead of praising him, and his own disciples' sinking into a profound 
 silence, the <I>earth did quake and the rocks rent.</I> Pharisees would 
 silence the praises of Christ, but they cannot gain their point; for as 
 God can <I>out of stones raise up children unto Abraham,</I> so he can 
 out of the mouths of those children perfect praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>41  And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over
 it,
 &nbsp; 42 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
 day, the things <I>which belong</I> unto thy peace! but now they are
 hid from thine eyes.
 &nbsp; 43 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall
 cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee
 in on every side,
 &nbsp; 44 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children
 within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon
 another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
 &nbsp; 45 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that
 sold therein, and them that bought;
 &nbsp; 46 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of
 prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.
 &nbsp; 47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and
 the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,
 &nbsp; 48 And could not find what they might do: for all the people
 were very attentive to hear him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The great Ambassador from heaven is here making his public entry into 
 Jerusalem, not to be <I>respected</I> there, but to be <I>rejected;</I> 
 he knew what a nest of vipers he was throwing himself into, and yet see 
 here two instances of his love to that place and his concern for 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>tears he shed</I> for the <I>approaching ruin</I> of the 
 <I>city</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 <I>When he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it.</I> 
 Probably, it was when he was coming down the descent of the hill from 
 the <I>mount of Olives,</I> where he had a full view of the city, the 
 large extent of it, and the many stately structures in it, and his eye 
 affected his heart, and his heart his eye again. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What a tender spirit Christ was of; we never read that he laughed, 
 but we often find him in tears. In this very place his father David 
 wept, and those that were with him, though he and they were <I>men of 
 war.</I> There are cases in which it is no disparagement to the 
 stoutest of men to melt into tears.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That Jesus Christ <I>wept</I> in the midst of his triumphs, 
 <I>wept</I> when all about him were <I>rejoicing,</I> to show how 
 little he was elevated with the applause and acclamation of the people. 
 Thus he would teach us to <I>rejoice with trembling,</I> and <I>as 
 though we rejoiced not.</I> If Providence do not stain the beauty of 
 our triumphs, we may ourselves see cause to sully it with our 
 sorrows.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he <I>wept over Jerusalem.</I> Note, There are cities to be 
 wept over, and none to be more lamented than Jerusalem, that had been 
 the holy city, and the joy of the whole earth, if it be degenerated. 
 But why did Christ weep at the sight of Jerusalem? Was it because 
 "Yonder is the city in which I must be betrayed and bound, scourged and 
 spit upon, condemned and crucified?" No, he himself gives us the reason 
 of his tears.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Jerusalem has not improved the day of her opportunities. He wept, 
 and said, <I>If thou hadst known, even thou at least in this thy 
 day,</I> if thou wouldst but yet know, while the gospel is preached to 
 thee, and salvation offered thee by it; if thou wouldest at length 
 bethink thyself, and understand <I>the things that belong to thy 
 peace,</I> the making of thy peace with God, and the securing of thine 
 own spiritual and eternal welfare--but thou <I>dost not know the day of
 thy visitation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 The manner of speaking is abrupt: <I>If thou hadst known! O that thou 
 hadst,</I> so some take it; like that <I>O that my people had hearkened 
 unto me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:13,Isa+48:18">Ps. lxxxi. 13; Isa. xlviii. 18</A>.

 Or, <I>If thou hadst known, well;</I> like that of the <I>fig-tree,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:9"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 9</A>.

 How happy had it been for thee! Or, "If thou hadst known, thou wouldest
 have wept for thyself, and I should have no occasion to weep for thee, 
 but should have rejoiced rather." What he says lays all the blame of 
 Jerusalem's impending ruin upon herself. Note, 

 [1.] There are things which <I>belong to our peace,</I> which we are 
 all concerned to <I>know</I> and <I>understand;</I> the way how peace 
 is made, the offers made of peace, the terms on which we may have the 
 benefit of peace. The things that belong to our peace are those things 
 that relate to our present and future welfare; these we must know with 
 application.

 [2.] There is a <I>time of visitation</I> when those things which 
 <I>belong to our peace</I> may be <I>known by us,</I> and known to good 
 purpose. When we enjoy the means of grace in great plenty, and have the 
 word of God powerfully preached to us--when the Spirit strives with us, 
 and our own consciences are startled and awakened--then is the <I>time 
 of visitation,</I> which we are concerned to improve. 

 [3.] With those that have long neglected the time of their visitation, 
 if at length, if at last, in this their day, their eyes be opened, and 
 they bethink themselves, all will be well yet. Those shall not be 
 refused that come into the vineyard <I>at the eleventh hour.</I>

 [4.] It is the amazing folly of multitudes that enjoy the means of 
 grace, and it will be of fatal consequence to them, that they do not 
 improve the day of their opportunities. The <I>things of their 
 peace</I> are revealed to them, but are not minded or regarded by them; 
 they <I>hide their eyes</I> from them, as if they were not worth taking 
 notice of. They are not aware of the <I>accepted time</I> and the 
 <I>day of salvation,</I> and to let it slip and perish through mere 
 carelessness. None are so <I>blind</I> as those that will not 
 <I>see;</I> nor have any the things of their peace more certainly 
 hidden from their eyes than those that turn their back upon them.

 [5.] The sin and folly of those that persist in a contempt of gospel 
 grace are a great grief to the Lord Jesus, and should be so to us. He 
 looks with weeping eyes upon lost souls, that continue impenitent, and 
 run headlong upon their own ruin; he had rather that they would <I>turn 
 and live</I> than <I>go on and die,</I> for he is not willing that any 
 should perish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Jerusalem cannot escape the day of her desolation. The <I>things 
 of her peace</I> are now in a manner hidden from her eyes; they will be 
 shortly. Not but that after this the gospel was preached to them by the 
 apostles; <I>all the house of Israel</I> were called to <I>know 
 assuredly</I> that Christ was their <I>peace</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:36">Acts ii. 36</A>),

 and multitudes were convinced and converted. But as to the body of the 
 nation, and the leading part of it, they were sealed up under unbelief; 
 God had <I>given them the spirit of slumber,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8">Rom. xi. 8</A>.

 They were so prejudiced and enraged against the gospel, and those few 
 that did embrace it then, that nothing less than a miracle of divine 
 grace (like that which converted Paul) would work upon them; and it 
 could not be expected that such a miracle should be wrought, and so 
 they were justly given up to <I>judicial</I> blindness and hardness. 
 The <I>peaceful things</I> are not <I>hidden from the eyes</I> of 
 particular persons; but it is too late to think now of the nation of 
 the Jews, <I>as such,</I> becoming a Christian nation, by embracing 
 Christ. And therefore they are marked for ruin, which Christ here 
 foresees and foretels, as the certain consequence of their rejecting 
 Christ. Note, Neglecting the great salvation of ten brings temporal 
 judgments upon a people; it did so upon Jerusalem in less than forty 
 years after this, when all that Christ here foretold was exactly 
 fulfilled. 

 [1.] The Romans besieged the city, <I>cast a trench about it, compassed 
 it round,</I> and <I>kept their</I> inhabitants in <I>on every 
 side.</I> Josephus relates that Titus ran up a wall in a very short 
 time, which surrounded the city, and cut off all hopes of escaping.

 [2.] They <I>laid it even with the ground.</I> Titus commanded his 
 soldiers to <I>dig up the city,</I> and the whole compass of it was 
 levelled, except three towers; see Josephus's history of the wars of 
 the Jews, 5. 356-360; 7.

 1. Not only the city, but the citizens were laid even with the ground 
 (<I>thy children within thee),</I> by the cruel slaughters that were 
 made of them: and there was scarcely one stone <I>left upon 
 another.</I> This was for their crucifying Christ; this was because 
 they <I>knew not the day of their visitation.</I> Let other cities and 
 nations take warning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The <I>zeal he showed</I> for the <I>present purification of the 
 temple.</I> Though it must be destroyed ere long, it does not therefore 
 follow that no care must be taken of it in the mean time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ cleared it of those who profaned it. He went straight to the 
 temple, and <I>began to cast out the buyers and sellers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.
 
 Hereby (though he was represented as an enemy to the temple, and that 
 was the crime laid to his charge before the high priest) he made it to 
 appear that he had a truer love for the temple than they had who had 
 such a veneration for its corban, its treasury, as a sacred thing; for 
 its purity was more its glory than its wealth was. Christ gave reason 
 for his dislodging the temple-merchants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.

 The temple is a <I>house of prayer,</I> set apart for communion with 
 God: the <I>buyers</I> and <I>sellers</I> made it a <I>den of 
 thieves</I> by the fraudulent bargains they made there, which was by no 
 means to be suffered, for it would be a distraction to those who came 
 there to pray.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He put it to the best use that ever it was put to, for he <I>taught 
 daily in the temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 Note, It is not enough that the corruptions of a church be purged out, 
 but the preaching of the gospel must be encouraged. Now, when Christ 
 preached in the temple, observe here,

 (1.) How spiteful the church-rulers were against him; how industrious
 to seek an <I>opportunity, or pretence</I> rather, to do him a mischief 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>):

 <I>The chief priests and scribes, and the chief of the people,</I> the 
 great sanhedrim, that should have attended him, and summoned the people 
 too to attend him, <I>sought to destroy him,</I> and put him to death. 
 
 (2.) How respectful the common people were to him. They were <I>very 
 attentive to hear him.</I> He spent most of his time in the country, 
 and did not then preach in the temple, but, when he did, the people 
 paid him great respect, attended on his preaching with diligence, and 
 let no opportunity slip of hearing him, attended to it with care, and 
 would not lose a word. Some read it, <I>All the people as they heard
 him, took his part;</I> and so it comes in very properly as a reason 
 why his enemies <I>could not find what they might</I> do against him; 
 they saw the people ready to fly in their faces if they offered him any 
 violence. Till his hour was come his interest in the common people 
 protected him; but, when his hour was come, the chief priests' 
 influence upon the common people delivered him up.</P>
