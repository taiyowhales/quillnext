 The evangelist having, in the foregoing chapters, given us a specimen 
 of our Lord's preaching, proceeds now to give some instances of the 
 miracles he wrought, which prove him a Teacher come from God, and the 
 great Healer of a diseased world. In this chapter we have, 

 I. Christ's cleansing of a leper,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes
 followed him.
 &nbsp; 2  And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying,
 Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
 &nbsp; 3  And Jesus put forth <I>his</I> hand, and touched him, saying, I
 will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
 &nbsp; 4  And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy
 way, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses
 commanded, for a testimony unto them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first verse refers to the close of the foregoing sermon: the people 
 that heard him were <I>astonished at his doctrine;</I> and the effect 
 was, that <I>when he came down from the mountain, great multitudes 
 followed him;</I> though he was so strict a Lawgiver, and so faithful a 
 Reprover, they diligently attended him, and were loth to disperse, and 
 go from him. Note, They to whom Christ has manifested himself, cannot 
 but desire to be better acquainted with him. They who know much of 
 Christ should covet to know more; and <I>then shall we know, if we</I> 
 thus <I>follow on to know the Lord.</I> It is pleasing to see people so 
 well affected to Christ, as to think they can never hear enough of him; 
 so well affected to the best things, as thus to flock after good 
 preaching, and to <I>follow the Lamb</I> withersoever he goes. Now was
 Jacob's prophecy concerning the Messiah fulfilled, that <I>unto him 
 shall the gathering of the people be;</I> yet they who gathered to him 
 did not cleave to him. They who followed him closely and constantly 
 were but few, compared with the multitudes that were but followers at 
 large.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:1-4">these verses</A>

 we have an account of Christ's <I>cleansing a leper.</I> It should
 seem, by comparing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:40,Lu+5:12">Mark i. 40, and Luke v. 12</A>,

 that this passage, though placed, by St. Matthew, after the sermon on
 the mount, because he would give account of his doctrine first, and 
 then of his miracles, happened some time before; but that is not at all 
 material. This is fitly recorded with the first of Christ's miracles,

 1. Because the leprosy was looked upon, among the Jews, as a particular
 mark of God's displeasure: hence we find Miriam, Gehazi, and Uzziah, 
 smitten with leprosy for some one particular sin; and therefore Christ, 
 to show that he came to turn away the wrath of God, by taking away sin, 
 began with the cure of a leper. 

 2. Because this disease, as it was supposed to come immediately from 
 the hand of God, so also it was supposed to be removed immediately by 
 his hand, and therefore it was not attempted to be cured by physicians, 
 but was put under the inspection of the priests, the Lord's ministers, 
 who waited to see what God would do. And its being in a garment, or in 
 the walls of a house, was altogether supernatural: and it should seem 
 to be a disease of a quite different nature from what we now call the 
 leprosy. The king of Israel said, <I>Am I God,</I> that I am sent to, 
 to <I>recover a man of a leprosy?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:7">2 Kings v. 7</A>.

 Christ proved himself God, by recovering many from the leprosy, and
 authorizing his disciples, in his name, to do so too

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:8"><I>ch.</I> x. 8</A>),

 and it is put among the proofs of his being the Messiah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:5"><I>ch.</I> xi. 5</A>.

 He also showed himself to be the Saviour of his people from their sins;
 for though every disease is both the fruit of sin, and a figure of it,
 as the disorder of the soul, yet the leprosy was in a special manner
 so; for it contracted such a pollution, and obliged to such a
 separation from holy things, as no other disease did; and therefore in
 the laws concerning it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+13:1-14:57">Lev. xiii. and xiv.</A>),

 it is treated, not as a sickness, but as an uncleanness; the priest was
 to pronounce the party clean or unclean, according to the indications: 
 but the honour of making the lepers clean was reserved for Christ, who 
 was to do it as the <I>High Priest of our profession;</I> he comes to 
 do that which the <I>law could not do, in that it was weak through the 
 flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Rom. viii. 3</A>.

 The law discovered sin (for by the law is the knowledge of sin), and
 pronounced sinners unclean; it shut them up

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:23">Gal. iii. 23</A>),

 as the priest did the leper, but could go no further; it could not
 <I>make the comers thereunto perfect.</I> But Christ takes away sin; 
 cleanses us from it, and so <I>perfecteth for ever them that are 
 sanctified.</I> Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The leper's address to Christ. If this happened, as it is here 
 placed, after the sermon on the mount, we may suppose that the leper, 
 though shut out by his disease from the cities of Israel, yet got 
 within hearing of Christ's sermon, and was encouraged by it to make his 
 application to him; for he that taught <I>as one having authority,</I> 
 could heal so; and therefore he <I>came and worshipped him,</I> as one 
 clothed with a divine power. His address is, <I>Lord, if thou wilt, 
 thou canst make me clean.</I> The cleaning of him may be 
 considered,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As a temporal mercy; a mercy to the body, delivering it from a 
 disease, which, though it did not threaten life, embittered it. And so 
 it directs us, not only to apply ourselves to Christ, who has power 
 over bodily diseases, for the cure of them, but it also teaches us in 
 what manner to apply ourselves to him; with an assurance of his power, 
 believing that he is as able to cure diseases now, as he was when on 
 earth, but with a submission to his will; <I>Lord, if thou wilt, thou 
 canst.</I> As to temporal mercies, we cannot be so sure of God's 
 <I>will</I> to bestow them, as we may of his <I>power,</I> for his 
 <I>power</I> in them is unlimited by a regard to his glory and our 
 good: when we cannot be sure of his will, we may be sure of his wisdom 
 and mercy, to which we may cheerfully refer ourselves; <I>Thy will be 
 done:</I> and this makes the expectation easy, and the event, when it 
 comes, comfortable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As a typical mercy. Sin is the leprosy of the soul; it shuts us out 
 from communion with God, to which that we may be restored, it is
 necessary that we be cleansed from this leprosy, and this ought to be 
 our great concern. Now observe, It is our comfort when we apply 
 ourselves to Christ, as the great Physician, that if he will, he can 
 make us clean; and we should, with an humble, believing boldness, go to 
 him and tell him so. That is, 

 (1.) We must rest ourselves upon his power; we must be confident of 
 this, that Christ <I>can</I> make us clean. No guilt is so great but 
 that there is a sufficiency in his righteousness to atone for it; no 
 corruption so strong, but there is a sufficiency in his grace to subdue 
 it. God would not appoint a physician to his hospital that is not 
 <I>par negotio--every way qualified for the undertaking.</I> 

 (2.) We must recommend ourselves to his pity; we cannot demand it as a 
 debt, but we must humbly request it as a favour; "<I>Lord, if thou 
 wilt.</I> I throw myself at thy feet, and if I perish, I will perish 
 there."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's answer to this address, which was very kind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>He put forth his hand and touched him.</I> The leprosy was a 
 noisome, loathsome disease, yet Christ touched him; for he did not 
 disdain to converse with publicans and sinners, to do them good. There 
 was a ceremonial pollution contracted by the touch of a leper; but 
 Christ would show, that when he conversed with sinners, he was in no 
 danger of being infected by them, for the prince of this world had 
 nothing in him. If we touch pitch, we are defiled; but Christ was 
 <I>separate from sinners,</I> even when he lived among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He said, <I>I will, be thou clean.</I> He did not say, as Elisha to 
 Naaman, <I>Go, wash in Jordan;</I> did not put him upon a tedious, 
 troublesome, chargeable course of a physic, but spake the word and 
 healed him. 

 (1.) Here is a word of kindness, <I>I will;</I> I am as willing to help 
 thee, as thou art to be helped. Note, They who by faith apply 
 themselves to Christ for mercy and grace, may be sure that he is 
 willing, freely willing, to give them the mercy and grace they come to 
 him for. Christ is a Physician, that does not need to be sought for, he 
 is always in the way; does not need to be urged, while we are yet 
 speaking, he hears; does not need to be fed, he heals freely, not for
 price nor reward. He has given all possible demonstration, that he is
 as willing as he is able to save sinners. 

 (2.) A word of power, <I>Be thou clean.</I> Both a power of authority, 
 and a power of energy, are exerted in this word. Christ heals by a word 
 of command to us; <I>Be thou clean;</I> "Be willing to be clean, and 
 use the means; cleanse thyself from all filthiness;" but there goes 
 along with this a word of command concerning us, a word that does the 
 work; <I>I will that thou be clean.</I> Such a word as this is 
 necessary to the cure, and effectual for it; and the Almighty grace 
 which speaks it, shall not be wanting to those who truly desire it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The happy change hereby wrought: <I>Immediately his leprosy was 
 cleansed.</I> Nature works gradually, but the God of nature works 
 immediately; he speaks it, it is done; and yet he works effectually; he 
 <I>commands, and it stands fast.</I> One of the first miracles Moses 
 wrought, was curing himself of a leprosy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:7">Exod. iv. 7</A>),

 for the priests under the law offered sacrifices first for their own
 sin; but one of Christ's first miracles was curing another of leprosy, 
 for he had no sin of his own to atone for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The after-directions Christ gave him. It is fit that they who are 
 cured by Christ should ever after be ruled by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>See thou tell no man;</I> "Tell no man till thou has shown 
 thyself to the priest, and he has pronounced thee clean; and so thou 
 hast a legal proof, both that thou wast before a leper, and art now 
 thoroughly cleansed." Christ would have his miracles to appear in their 
 full light and evidence, and not to be published till they could appear 
 so. Note, They that preach the truths of Christ should be able to prove 
 them; to defend what they preach, and <I>convince gainsayers. "Tell no 
 man, till thou hast showed thyself to the priest,</I> lest if he hear 
 who cured thee, he should out of spite deny to give thee a certificate 
 of the cure, and so keep thee under confinement." Such were the priests 
 in Christ's time, that they who had any thing to do with them had need 
 to have been as wise as serpents.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>Go show thyself to the priest,</I> according to the law, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+14:2">Lev. xiv. 2</A>.

 Christ took care to have the law observed, lest he should give offence,
 and to show that he will have order kept up, and good discipline and 
 respect paid to those that are in office. It may be of use to those 
 that are cleansed of their spiritual leprosy, to have recourse to 
 Christ's ministers, and to open their case to them, that they may 
 assist them in their enquiries into their spiritual state, and advise, 
 and comfort, and pray for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>Offer the gift that Moses commanded,</I> in token of thankfulness 
 to God, and recompence to the priest for his pains; and this <I>for a 
 testimony unto them;</I> either, 

 (1.) Which <I>Moses commanded for a testimony:</I> the ceremonial laws 
 were testimonies of God's authority over them, care of them, and of 
 that grace which should afterwards be revealed. Or, 

 (2.) "Do thou offer it for a testimony, and let the priest know who
 cleansed thee, and how; and it shall be a testimony, that there is one 
 among them who does that which the high priest cannot do. Let it remain 
 upon record as a witness of my power, and a testimony for me <I>to</I> 
 them, if they will use it and improve it; but <I>against</I> them, if 
 they will not:" for so Christ's word and works are testimonies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto
 him a centurion, beseeching him,
 &nbsp; 6  And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,
 grievously tormented.
 &nbsp; 7  And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
 &nbsp; 8  The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that
 thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and
 my servant shall be healed.
 &nbsp; 9  For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and
 I say to this <I>man,</I> Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and
 he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 10  When Jesus heard <I>it,</I> he marvelled, and said to them that
 followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith,
 no, not in Israel.
 &nbsp; 11  And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and
 west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in
 the kingdom of heaven.
 &nbsp; 12  But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
 darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
 &nbsp; 13  And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou
 hast believed, <I>so</I> be it done unto thee. And his servant was
 healed in the selfsame hour.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of Christ's curing the centurion's servant of a 
 palsy. This was done at Capernaum, where Christ now dwelt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:13"><I>ch.</I> iv. 13</A>.

 Christ went about doing good, and came home to do good too; every place 
 he came to was the better for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The persons Christ had now to do with were,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A <I>centurion;</I> he was a supplicant, a Gentile, a Roman, an 
 officer of the army; probably commander-in-chief of that part of the 
 Roman army which was quartered at Capernaum, and kept garrison there. 
 
 (1.) Though he was a soldier (and a little piety commonly goes a great 
 way with men of that profession), yet he was a godly man; he was 
 eminently so. Note, God has his remnant among all sorts of people. No 
 man's calling or place in the world will be an excuse for his unbelief 
 and impiety; none shall say in the great day, I had been religious, if 
 I had not been a soldier; for such there are among the <I>ransomed of 
 the Lord.</I> And sometimes where grace conquers the unlikely, it is 
 more than a conqueror; this soldier that was good, was very good.

 (2.) Though he was a Roman soldier, and his very dwelling among the 
 Jews was a badge of their subjection to the Roman yoke, yet Christ, who 
 was <I>King of the Jews,</I> favoured him; and therein has taught us to 
 do good to our enemies, and not needlessly to interest ourselves in 
 national enmities. 

 (3.) Though he was a Gentile, yet Christ countenanced him. It is true, 
 he went not to any of the Gentile towns (it was the land of Canaan that 
 was Immanuel's land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:8">Isa. viii. 8</A>),

 yet he received addresses from Gentiles; now good old Simeon's word
 began to be fulfilled, that he should be <I>a light to lighten the 
 Gentiles,</I> as well as <I>the glory of his people Israel.</I> 
 Matthew, in annexing this cure to that of the leper, who was a Jew, 
 intimates this; the leprous Jews Christ touched and cured, for he 
 preached personally to them; but the paralytic Gentiles he cured at a 
 distance; for to them he did not go in person, but <I>sent his word and 
 healed them;</I> yet in them he was more magnified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>The centurion's servant;</I> he was the patient. In this also it 
 appears, that there is no respect of persons with God; for <I>in Christ 
 Jesus,</I> as there is <I>neither circumcision nor uncircumcision,</I> 
 so there is <I>neither bond nor free.</I> He is as ready to heal the 
 poorest servant, as the richest master; for himself <I>took upon him 
 the form of a servant,</I> to show his regard to the meanest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now in the story of the cure of this servant, we may observe an 
 intercourse or interchanging of graces, very remarkable between Christ 
 and the centurion. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The grace of the centurion working towards Christ. Can any good 
 thing come out of a Roman soldier? any thing tolerable, much less any 
 thing laudable? Come and see, and you will find abundance of good 
 coming out of this centurion that was eminent and exemplary. Observe, 

 1. His affectionate address to Jesus Christ, which speaks,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A pious regard to our great Master, as one able and willing to 
 succour and relieve poor petitioners. He came to him <I>beseeching 
 him,</I> not as Naaman the Syrian (a centurion too) came to Elisha, 
 demanding a cure, taking state, and standing upon points of honour; but 
 with cap in hand as a humble suitor. By this it seems that he saw more 
 in Christ than appeared at first view; saw that which commanded 
 respect, though to those who looked no further, his visage was marred 
 more than any man's. The officers of the army, being comptrollers of 
 the town, no doubt made a great figure, yet he lays by the thoughts of 
 his post of honour, when he addresses himself to Christ, and comes 
 <I>beseeching him.</I> Note, the greatest of men must turn beggars, 
 when they have to do with Christ. He owns Christ's sovereignty, in 
 calling him Lord, and referring the case to him, and to his will, and 
 wisdom, by a modest remonstrance, without any formal and express 
 petition. He knew he had to do with a wise and gracious Physician, to 
 whom the opening of the malady was equivalent to the most earnest 
 request. A humble confession of our spiritual wants and diseases shall 
 not fail of an answer of peace. Pour out thy complaint, and mercy shall 
 be poured out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) A charitable regard to his poor servant. We read of many that came 
 to Christ for their children, but this is the only instance of one that 
 came to him for a servant: <I>Lord, my servant lieth at home sick.</I> 
 Note, it is the duty of masters to concern themselves for their 
 servants, when they are in affliction. The palsy disabled the servant 
 for his work, and made him as troublesome and tedious as any distemper 
 could, yet he did not turn him away when he was sick (as that Amalekite 
 did his servants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:13">1 Sam. xxx. 13</A>),

 did not send him to his friends, not let him lie by neglected, but 
 sought out the best relief he could for him; the servant could not have 
 done more for the master, than the master did here for the servant. The 
 centurion's servants were very dutiful to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and here we see what made them so; he was very kind to them, and that
 made them the more cheerfully obedient to him. As we must not despise
 the <I>cause of our servants, when they contend with us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:13,15">Job xxxi. 13, 15</A>),

 so we must not despise their case when God contends with them; for we
 are made in the same mould, by the same hand, and stand upon the same 
 level with them before God, and must not set them <I>with the dogs of 
 our flock.</I> The centurion applies not to witches or wizards for his 
 servant, but to Christ. The palsy is a disease in which the physician's 
 skill commonly fails; it was therefore a great evidence of his faith in 
 the power of Christ, to come to him for a cure, which was above the 
 power of natural means to effect. Observe, How pathetically he
 represents his servant's case as very sad; he is <I>sick of the 
 palsy,</I> a disease which commonly makes the patient senseless of 
 pain, but this person was <I>grievously tormented;</I> being young, 
 nature was strong to struggle with the stroke, which made it painful.
 (It was not <I>paralysis simplex,</I> but <I>scorbutica</I>). We should 
 thus concern ourselves for the souls of our children, and servants, 
 that are spiritually sick of the palsy, the dead-palsy, the dumb palsy; 
 senseless of spiritual evils, inactive in that which is spiritually 
 good, and bring them to the means of healing and health.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Observe his great humility and self-abasement. After Christ had 
 intimated his readiness to come and heal his servants 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 he expressed himself with the more humbleness of mind. Note, Humble 
 souls are made more humble, by Christ's gracious condescensions to 
 them. Observe what was the language of his humility; <I>Lord, I am not
 worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 which speaks mean thoughts of himself, and high thoughts of our Lord
 Jesus. He does not say, "My servant is not worthy that thou shouldest 
 come into his chamber, because it is in the garret;" But <I>I am not 
 worthy that thou shouldest come into my house.</I> The centurion was a 
 great man, yet he owned his unworthiness before God. Note, Humility 
 very well becomes persons of quality. Christ now made but a mean figure 
 in the world, yet the centurion, looking upon him as a prophet, <I>yea, 
 more than a prophet,</I> paid him this respect. Note, We should have a 
 value and veneration for what we see of God, even in those who, in 
 outward condition, are every way our inferiors. The centurion came to 
 Christ with a petition, and therefore expressed himself thus humbly. 
 Note, In all our approaches to Christ, and to God through Christ, it 
 becomes us to abase ourselves, and to lie low in the sense of our own 
 unworthiness, as mean creatures and as vile sinners, to do any thing 
 for God, to receive any good from him, or to have any thing to do with 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Observe his great faith. The more humility the more faith; the more 
 diffident we are of ourselves, the stronger will be our confidence in 
 Jesus Christ. He had an assurance of faith not only that Christ could 
 cure his servant, but,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he could cure him at a distance. There needed not any 
 physical contact, as in natural operations, nor any application to the 
 part affected; but the cure, he believed, might be wrought, without 
 bringing the physician and patient together. We read afterwards of 
 those, who brought the <I>man sick of the palsy to Christ,</I> through 
 much difficulty, and set him before him; and Christ commended their 
 faith for a <I>working</I> faith. This centurion did not bring his man 
 <I>sick of the palsy,</I> and Christ commended his faith for a 
 <I>trusting</I> faith: true faith is accepted of Christ, though 
 variously appearing: Christ puts the best construction upon the 
 different methods of religion that people take, and thereby has taught 
 us to do so too. This centurion believed, and it is undoubtedly true,
 that the power of Christ knows no limits, and therefore nearness and 
 distance are alike to him. Distance of place cannot obstruct either the 
 knowing or working of him that <I>fills all places. Am I a God at hand, 
 says the Lord, and not a God afar off?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:23">Jer. xxiii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That he could cure him with a <I>word,</I> not send him a 
 medicine, much less a charm; but <I>speak the word only,</I> and I do 
 not question but <I>my servant shall be healed.</I> Herein he owns him 
 to have a divine power, an authority to command all the creatures and 
 powers of nature, which enables him to do whatsoever he pleases in the 
 kingdom of nature; as at first he raised that kingdom by an almighty 
 word, when he said, <I>Let there be light.</I> With men, saying and 
 doing are two things; but not so with Christ, who is therefore the 
 <I>Arm of the Lord,</I> because he is the <I>eternal Word.</I> His 
 saying, <I>Be ye warmed and filled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:16">Jam. ii. 16</A>),

 and healed, warms, and fills and heals.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The centurion's faith in the power of Christ he here illustrates by the 
 dominion he had, as a centurion, over his soldiers, as a master over 
 his servants; he says to one, <I>Go, and he goes, &c.</I> They were all 
 at his beck and command, so as that he could by them execute things at 
 a distance; his word was a law to them--<I>dictum factum;</I>
 well-disciplined soldiers know that the commands of their officers are 
 not to be disputed, but obeyed. Thus could Christ speak, and it is 
 done; such a power had he over all bodily diseases. The centurion had 
 this command over his soldiers, though he was himself a <I>man under 
 authority;</I> not a commander-in-chief, but a subaltern officer; much 
 more had Christ this power, who is the supreme and sovereign Lord of 
 all. The centurion's servants were very obsequious, would go and come 
 at every the least intimation of their master's mind. Now, 

 [1.] Such servants we all should be to God: we must go and come at his 
 bidding, according to the directions of his word, and the disposals of 
 his providence; run where he sends us, return when he remands us, and 
 do what he appoints. <I>What saith my Lord unto his servant?</I> When 
 his will crosses our own, his must take place, and our own be set 
 aside.

 [2.] Such servants bodily diseases are to Christ. They seize us when he 
 sends them; they leave us when he calls them back; they have that 
 effect upon us, upon our bodies, upon our souls, that he orders. It is 
 a matter of comfort to all that belong to Christ, for whose good his 
 power is exerted and engaged, that every disease has his commission, 
 executes his command, is under his control, and is made to serve the 
 intentions of his grace. They need not fear sickness, nor what it can 
 do, who see it in the hand of so good a Friend.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the grace of Christ appearing towards this centurion; for 
 to the gracious he will show himself gracious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He complies with his address at the first word. He did but tell him 
 his servant's case, and was going on to beg a cure, when Christ 
 prevented him, with this good word, and comfortable word, <I>I will 
 come and heal him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 not <I>I will come and see him</I>--that had evinced him a kind 
 Saviour; but, <I>I will come and heal him</I>--that shows him a mighty, 
 an almighty Saviour; it was a great word, but no more than he could 
 make good; for he has <I>healing under his wings;</I> his coming is 
 healing. They who wrought miracles by a derived power, did not speak 
 thus positively, as Christ did, who wrought them by his own power, as 
 one that had authority. When a minister is sent for to a sick friend, 
 he can but say, <I>I will come and pray for him;</I> but Christ says, 
 <I>I will come and heal him:</I> it is well that Christ can do more for 
 us than our ministers can. The centurion desired he would heal his 
 servant; he says, <I>I will come and heal him;</I> thus expressing more 
 favour than he did either ask or think of. Note, Christ often outdoes 
 the expectations of poor supplicants. See an instance of Christ's 
 humility, that he would make a visit to a poor soldier. He would not go 
 down to see a nobleman's sick child, who insisted upon his coming down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:47-49">John iv. 47-49</A>),

 but he proffers to go down to see a sick servant; thus does he regard
 <I>the low estate</I> of his people, and give <I>more abundant honour 
 to that part which lacked.</I> Christ's humility, in being willing to 
 come, gave an example to him, and occasioned his humility, in owning 
 himself unworthy to have him come. Note, Christ's gracious 
 condescensions to us, should make us the more humble and self-abasing 
 before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He commends his faith, and takes occasion from it to speak a kind 
 word of the poor Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>.

 See what great things a strong but self-denying faith can obtain from 
 Jesus Christ, even of general and public concern.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As to the centurion himself; he not only approved him and accepted 
 him (that honour have all true believers), but he admired him and 
 applauded him: that honour great believers have, as Job; there is 
 <I>none like unto him in the earth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Christ admired him, not for his greatness, but for his graces. 
 <I>When Jesus heard it, he marvelled;</I> not as if it were to him new 
 and surprising, he knew the centurion's faith, for he wrought it; but 
 it was great and excellent, rare and uncommon, and Christ spoke of it 
 as wonderful, to teach us what to admire; not worldly pomp and 
 decorations, but the beauty of holiness, and the ornaments which are 
 <I>in the sight of God of great price.</I> Note, The wonders of grace 
 should affect us more than the wonders of nature or providence, and 
 spiritual attainments more than any achievements in this world. Of 
 those that are <I>rich in faith,</I> not of those that are <I>rich in 
 gold and silver,</I> we should say that they have <I>gotten all this 
 glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:1">Gen. xxxi. 1</A>.

 But whatever there is admirable in the faith of any, it must redound to
 the glory of Christ, who will shortly be himself <I>admired in all them 
 that believe,</I> as having done in and for them <I>marvellous 
 things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He <I>applauded</I> him in what he said to <I>them that 
 followed.</I> All believers shall be, <I>in the other world,</I> but 
 some believers are, <I>in this world,</I> confessed and acknowledged by 
 Christ before men, in his eminent appearances for them and with them. 
 <I>Verily, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</I> Now 
 this speaks, <I>First, Honour to the centurion;</I> who, though not a 
 son of Abraham's loins, was an heir of Abraham's faith, and Christ 
 found it so. Note, The thing that Christ seeks is <I>faith,</I> and 
 wherever it is, he finds it, though but <I>as a grain of 
 mustard-seed.</I> He had not found <I>so great faith,</I> all things 
 considered, and in proportion to the means; as the poor widow is said 
 to <I>cast in more than they all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:3">Luke xxi. 3</A>.

 Though the centurion was a Gentile, yet he was thus commended. Note, We
 must be so far from grudging, that we must be forward, to give those
 their due praise, that are not within our denomination or pale.
 <I>Secondly,</I> It speaks <I>shame to Israel,</I> to whom pertained
 <I>the adoption, the glory, the covenants,</I> and all the assistances
 and encouragements of faith. Note, When <I>the Son of man comes,</I>
 he <I>finds</I> little <I>faith,</I> and, therefore, he finds so little
 <I>fruit.</I> Note, the attainments of some, who have had but little
 helps for their souls, will aggravate the sin and ruin of many, that
 have had great plenty of the means of grace, and have not made a good
 improvement of them. Christ said this <I>to those that followed</I>
 him, if by any means he might provoke them to a holy emulation, as Paul
 speaks,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:14">Rom. xi. 14</A>.

 They were Abraham's seed; in jealousy for that honour, let them not
 suffer themselves to be outstripped by a Gentile, especially in that 
 grace for which Abraham was eminent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) As to others. Christ takes occasion from hence to make a 
 comparison between Jews and Gentiles, and tells them two things, which 
 could not but be very surprising to them who had been taught that 
 <I>salvation was of the Jews.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That <I>a great many of the Gentiles should be saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 The faith of the centurion was but a specimen of the conversion of the 
 Gentiles, and a preface to their adoption into the church. This was a
 topic our Lord Jesus touched often upon; he speaks it with assurance; 
 <I>I say unto you,</I> "I that know all men;" and he could not say any 
 thing more pleasing to himself, or more displeasing to the Jews; an 
 intimation of this kind enraged the Nazarenes against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:27">Luke iv. 27</A>.
 
 Christ gives us here an <I>idea, First,</I> of the <I>persons</I> that
 shall be <I>saved;</I> many <I>from the east and the west:</I> he had 
 said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:14"><I>ch.</I> vii. 14</A>),

 <I>Few there be that find the way of life;</I> and yet here <I>many
 shall come.</I> Few at one time, and in one place; yet, when they come 
 altogether, they will be a great many. We now see but here and there 
 one brought to grace; but we shall shortly see the Captain of our 
 salvation <I>bringing many sons to glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10">Heb. ii. 10</A>.

 He will come with <I>ten thousands of his saints</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">Jude 14</A>),

 with such a company as <I>no man can number</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>);

 <I>with nations of them that are saved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:24">Rev. xxi. 24</A>.

 They shall come <I>from the east</I> and <I>from the west;</I> places
 far distant from each other; and yet they shall all meet at the right
 hand of Christ, the Centre of their unity. Note, God has his remnant
 in all places; <I>from the rising of the sun, to the going down of the
 same,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:11">Mal. i. 11</A>.

 The elect will be gathered from the four winds,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:31"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 31</A>.

 They are <I>sown in the earth,</I> some scattered in every corner of
 the field. The Gentile world lay <I>from east to west,</I> and they are 
 especially meant here; though they were <I>strangers to the covenant of 
 promise</I> now, and had been long, yet who knows what <I>hidden 
 ones</I> God had among them then? As in Elijah's time in Israel 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:14">1 Kings xix. 14</A>),

 soon after which they flocked into the church in great multitudes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:3,4">Isa. lx. 3, 4</A>.

 Note, When we come to heaven, as we shall miss a great many there, that
 we thought had been going thither, so we shall meet a great many there, 
 that we did not expect. <I>Secondly,</I> Christ gives us an idea of the 
 <I>salvation itself.</I> They shall come, shall come together, shall 
 come together to Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1">2 Thess. ii. 1</A>.

 1. They shall be admitted <I>into the kingdom of grace</I> on earth,
 into the covenant of grace made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; they
 shall be <I>blessed with faithful Abraham,</I> whose blessing comes
 upon the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:14">Gal. iii. 14</A>.
 
 This makes Zaccheus a son of Abraham,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:9">Luke xix. 9</A>.

 2. They shall be admitted into the <I>kingdom of glory in heaven.</I>
 They shall come cheerfully, flying <I>as doves to their windows;</I> 
 they shall sit down to rest from their labours, as having done their 
 day's work; sitting denotes <I>continuance:</I> while we <I>stand,</I> 
 we are <I>going;</I> where we <I>sit,</I> we mean to <I>stay;</I> 
 heaven is a <I>remaining</I> rest, it is a <I>continuing</I> city; they 
 shall <I>sit down,</I> as upon a throne 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:21">Rev. iii. 21</A>);

 as <I>at a table;</I> that is the metaphor here; they shall sit down to
 be <I>feasted;</I> which denotes both <I>fulness</I> of 
 <I>communication,</I> and <I>freedom</I> and familiarity of communion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:30">Luke xxii. 30</A>.

 They shall <I>sit down with Abraham.</I> They who in this world were
 ever so far distant from each other in time, place, or outward 
 condition, shall all meet together in heaven; ancients and moderns, 
 Jews and Gentiles, rich and poor. The rich man in hell <I>sees</I> 
 Abraham, but Lazarus <I>sits down with him,</I> leaning on his breast. 
 Note, Holy society is a part of the felicity of heaven; and they on 
 whom the ends of the world are come, and who are most obscure, shall 
 share in glory with the renowned patriarchs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That a great many of the Jews should perish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> A strange sentence passed; <I>The children of the kingdom 
 shall be cast out;</I> the Jews that persist in unbelief, though they 
 were by birth <I>children of the kingdom,</I> yet shall be cut off from 
 being members of the visible church: <I>the kingdom of God,</I> of 
 which they boasted that they were <I>the children,</I> shall be taken 
 from them, and they shall become <I>not a people,</I> not <I>obtaining 
 mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:20,Ro+9:31">Rom. xi. 20; ix. 31</A>.

 In the great day it will not avail men to have been <I>children of the
 kingdom,</I> either as Jews or as Christians; for men will then be 
 judged, not by what they were <I>called,</I> but by what they <I>were. 
 If children</I> indeed, <I>then heirs;</I> but many are children in 
 profession, in the family, but not of it, that will come short of the 
 inheritance. Being born of professing parents denominates us 
 <I>children of the kingdom;</I> but if we rest in that, and have 
 nothing else to show for heaven but that, we shall be <I>cast 
 out.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> A strange punishment for <I>the workers of iniquity</I>
 described; <I>They shall be cast into outer darkness,</I> the darkness 
 of those that are without, of the Gentiles that were out of the church; 
 into that the Jews were cast, and into worse; they were blinded, and 
 hardened, and filled with terrors, as the apostle shows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8-10">Rom. xi. 8-10</A>.
 
 A people so unchurched and given up to spiritual judgments, are in
 <I>utter darkness</I> already: but it looks further, to the state of 
 damned sinners in hell, to which the other is a dismal preface. <I>They 
 shall be cast out</I> from God, and all true comfort, and <I>cast into 
 darkness.</I> In hell there is fire, but no light; it is <I>utter 
 darkness;</I> darkness in extremity; the highest degree of darkness, 
 without any remainder, or mixture, or hope, of light; not the least 
 gleam or glimpse of it; it is darkness that results from their being 
 shut out of heaven, the land of light; they who are <I>without,</I> are 
 in <I>the regions of darkness;</I> yet that is not the worst of it, 
 <I>there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</I> 

 1. In hell there will be great grief, floods of tears shed to no
 purpose; anguish of spirit preying eternally upon the vitals, in the 
 sense of the wrath of God, is the torment of the damned. 

 2. Great indignation: damned sinners will <I>gnash their teeth</I> for 
 spite and vexation, <I>full of the fury of the Lord;</I> seeing with 
 envy the happiness of others, and reflecting with horror upon the 
 former possibility of their own being happy, which is now past.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He cures his servant. He not only commends his application to him, 
 but grants him that for which he applied, which was a real answer, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What Christ said to him: he said that which made the cure as great 
 a favour to him as it was to his servant, and much greater; <I>As thou 
 hast believed, so be it done to thee.</I> The servant got a cure of his 
 disease, but the master got the confirmation and approbation of his 
 faith. Note, Christ often gives encouraging answers to his praying 
 people, when they are interceding for others. It is kindness to us, to 
 be heard for others. God turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed 
 for his friends, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:10">Job xlii. 10</A>.

 It was a great honour which Christ put upon this centurion, when he
 gave him a blank, as it were; <I>Be it done as thou believest.</I> What 
 could he have more? Yet what was said to him is said to us all, 
 <I>Believe, and ye shall receive; only believe.</I> See here the power 
 of Christ, and the power of faith. As Christ can <I>do</I> what he 
 will, so an active believer may <I>have</I> what he will from Christ; 
 the oil of grace multiplies, and stays not till the vessels of faith 
 fail.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What was the effect of this saying: the prayer of faith was a 
 prevailing prayer, it ever was so, and ever will be so; it appears, by 
 the suddenness of the cure, that it was <I>miraculous:</I> and by its 
 coincidence with Christ's saying, that the miracle was <I>his; he 
 spake, and it was done;</I> and this was a proof of his omnipotence, 
 that he has a long arm. It is the observation of a learned physician, 
 that the diseases Christ cured were chiefly such as were the most 
 difficult to be cured by any natural means, and particularly the palsy. 
 <I>Omnis paralysis, pr&aelig;sertim vetusta, aut incurabilis est, aut
 difficilis curatu, etiam pueris: atque soleo ego dicere, morbos omnes 
 qui Christo curandi fuerunt propositi, difficillimos sua matura curatu 
 esse--Every kind of palsy, especially of long continuance, is either
 incurable, or is found to yield with the utmost difficulty to medical 
 skill, even in young subjects; so that I have frequently remarked, that 
 all the diseases which were referred to Christ for cure appear to have 
 been of the most obstinate and hopeless kind.</I> Mercurialis <I>De 
 Morbis Puerorum,</I> lib. 2. cap. 5.</P>

 They who pretend to be critical in the Harmony of the evangelists, 
 place this passage, and all that follows to the end of 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:14-9:38"><I>ch.</I> ix.</A>

 before the sermon on the mount, according to the order which Mark and
 Luke observe in placing it. Dr. Lightfoot places only this passage 
 before the sermon on the mount, and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,

 &c. after. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A particular account of the cure of <I>Peter's wife's mother,</I> 
 who was ill <I>of a fever;</I> in which observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The <I>case,</I> which was nothing extraordinary; fevers are the 
 most common distempers; but, the patient being a near relation of 
 Peter's, it is recorded as an instance of Christ's peculiar care of, 
 and kindness to, the families of his disciples. Here we find,

 (1.) That Peter had a <I>wife,</I> and yet <I>was called to be an 
 apostle of Christ;</I> and Christ countenanced the marriage state, by 
 being thus kind to his <I>wife's</I> relations. The church of Rome, 
 therefore, which forbids ministers to marry, goes contrary to that 
 apostle from whom they pretend to derive an infallibility. 

 (2.) That Peter had a <I>house,</I> though Christ had not,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Thus was the disciple better provided for than his Lord. 

 (3.) That he had a house at Capernaum, though he was originally of 
 Bethsaida; it is probably, he removed to Capernaum, when Christ removed 
 thither, and made that his principal residence. Note, It is worth while 
 to change our quarters, that we may be near to Christ, and have 
 opportunities of converse with him. When the ark removes, Israel must 
 remove and go after it. 

 (4.) That he had his <I>wife's mother</I> with him in his family, which 
 is an example to yoke-fellows to be kind to one another's relations as 
 their own. Probably, this good woman was old, and yet was respected and 
 taken care of, as old people ought to be, with all possible tenderness.
 
 (5.) That she lay ill <I>of a fever.</I> Neither the strength of youth,
 nor the weakness and coldness of age, will be a fence against diseases 
 of this kind. The palsy was a chronical disease, the fever an acute 
 disease, but both were brought to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The <I>cure,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 (1.) How it was <I>effected; He touched her hand;</I> not to know the 
 disease, as the physicians do, by the pulse, but to heal it. This was 
 an intimation of his kindness and tenderness; he is <I>himself touched 
 with the feeling of our infirmities;</I> it likewise shows the way of 
 spiritual healing, by the exerting of the power of Christ with his 
 word, and the application of Christ to ourselves. The scripture 
 <I>speaks the word,</I> the Spirit gives the touch, touches the heart, 
 touches the hand. 

 (2.) How it was <I>evidenced:</I> this showed that the <I>fever left 
 her, she arose, and ministered to them.</I> By this it appears,

 [1.] That the mercy was perfected. They that recover from fevers by the 
 power of nature are commonly weak and feeble, and unfit for business a 
 great while after; to show therefore that this cure was above the power 
 of nature, she was immediately so well as to go about the business of 
 the house.

 [2.] That the mercy was sanctified; and the mercies that are so are 
 indeed perfected. Though she was thus dignified by a peculiar favour, 
 yet she does not assume importance, but is as ready to wait at table, 
 if there be occasion, as any servant. They must be humble whom Christ 
 has honoured; being thus delivered, she studies what she shall render. 
 It is very fit that they whom Christ hath healed should minister unto 
 him, as his humble servants, all their days.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a general account of the many cures that Christ wrought. 
 This cure of Peter's mother-in-law brought him abundance of patients. 
 "He healed such a one; why not me? Such a one's friend, why not mine?" 
 Now we are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 (1.) <I>He cast out devils; cast out the</I> evil <I>spirits with his 
 word.</I> There may be much of Satan's agency, by the divine 
 permission, in those diseases of which natural causes may be assigned, 
 as in Job's boils, especially in the diseases of the mind; but, about 
 the time of Christ's being in the world, there seems to have been more 
 than ordinary letting loose of the devil, to possess and vex the bodies 
 of people; he came, <I>having great wrath, for he knew that his time 
 was short;</I> and God wisely ordered it so, that Christ might have the 
 fairer and more frequent opportunities of showing his power over Satan, 
 and the purpose and design of his coming into the world, which was to 
 disarm and dispossess Satan, to break his power, and to destroy his 
 works; and his success was as glorious as his design was gracious. 

 (2.) <I>He healed all that were sick;</I> all without exception, though 
 the patient was ever so mean, and the case ever so bad.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How the scripture was herein fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The accomplishment of the Old-Testament prophecies was the great thing 
 Christ had in his eye, and the great proof of his being the Messiah: 
 among other things, it was written of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:4">Isa. liii. 4</A>),

 <I>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows:</I> it is
 referred to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:24">1 Pet. ii. 24</A>,

 and there it is construed, <I>he hath borne our sins;</I> here it is
 referred to, and is construed, <I>he hath borne our sicknesses;</I> our 
 sins make our sicknesses our griefs; Christ bore away sin by the merit 
 of his death, and bore away sickness by the miracles of his life; nay, 
 though those miracles are ceased, we may say, that <I>he bore our 
 sicknesses</I> then, <I>when he bore our sins in his own body upon the 
 tree;</I> for sin is both the cause and the sting of sickness. Many are 
 the diseases and calamities to which we are liable in the body: and 
 there is more, in this one line of the gospels, to support and comfort 
 us under them, than in all the writings of the philosophers--that Jesus 
 Christ <I>bore our sicknesses, and carried our sorrows;</I> he bore 
 them before us; though he was never sick, yet he was hungry, and 
 thirsty, and weary, and troubled in spirit, sorrowful and very heavy; 
 he bore them for us in his <I>passion,</I> and bears them with us in 
 <I>compassion,</I> being <I>touched with the feeling of our 
 infirmities:</I> and thus he bears them off from us, and makes them sit 
 light, if it be not our own fault. Observe how emphatically it is 
 expressed here: <I>Himself took our infirmities, and bare our 
 sicknesses;</I> he was both able and willing to interpose in that 
 matter, and concerned to deal with <I>our infirmities and 
 sicknesses,</I> as our Physician; that part of the calamity of the 
 human nature was his particular care, which he evidenced by his great 
 readiness to cure diseases; and he is no less powerful, no less tender 
 now, for we are sure that never were any the worse for going to 
 heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave
 commandment to depart unto the other side.
 &nbsp; 19  And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will
 follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
 &nbsp; 20  And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the
 birds of the air <I>have</I> nests; but the Son of man hath not where
 to lay <I>his</I> head.
 &nbsp; 21  And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me
 first to go and bury my father.
 &nbsp; 22  But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury
 their dead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Christ's removing to <I>the other side of the sea of Tiberias,</I> 
 and his ordering his disciples, whose boats attended him, to get their 
 transport-vessels ready, in order to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The influences of this Sun of righteousness were not to be confined to 
 one place, but diffused all the country over; he must go about to do 
 good; the necessities of souls called to him, <I>Come over, and help 
 us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:9">Acts xvi. 9</A>);

 he removed <I>when he saw great multitudes about him.</I> Though by
 this it appeared that they were desirous to have him there, he knew 
 there were others as desirous to have him with them, and they must have 
 their share of him: his being acceptable and useful in one place was no 
 objection against, but a reason for, his going to another. Thus he 
 would try the multitudes that were <I>about him,</I> whether their zeal 
 would carry them to follow him, and attend on him, when his preaching 
 was removed to some distance. Many would be glad of such helps, if they 
 could have them at next door, who will not be at the pains to follow 
 them to <I>the other side;</I> and thus Christ shook off those who were 
 less zealous, and the perfect were made manifest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's communication with two, who, upon his remove to <I>the 
 other side,</I> were loth to stay behind, and had a mind to follow him, 
 not as others, who were his followers at large, but to come into close 
 discipleship, which the most were shy of; for it carried such a face of 
 strictness as they could not like, nor be well reconciled to; but here 
 is an account of two who seemed desirous to come into communion, and 
 yet were not right; which is here given as a specimen of the hindrances 
 by which many are kept from closing with Christ, and cleaving to him; 
 and a warning to us, to set out in following Christ, so as that we may 
 not come short; to lay such a foundation, as that our building may 
 stand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's managing of two different tempers, one quick and 
 eager, the other dull and heavy; and his instructions are adapted to 
 each of them, and designed for our use.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is one that was <I>too hasty in promising;</I> and he was <I>a 
 certain scribe</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 a scholar, a learned man, one of those that studied and expounded the 
 law; generally we find them in the gospels to be men of no good 
 character; usually coupled with the Pharisees, as enemies to Christ and 
 his doctrine. <I>Where is the scribe?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:20">1 Cor. i. 20</A>.

 He is very seldom following Christ; yet here was one that bid pretty
 fair for discipleship, a <I>Saul among the prophets.</I> Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How he expressed his forwardness; <I>Master, I will follow thee, 
 whithersoever thou goest.</I> I know not how any man could have spoken 
 better. His profession of a self-dedication to Christ is, 

 [1.] Very ready, and seems to be <I>ex mero motu--from his unbiased 
 inclination:</I> he is not called to it by Christ, nor urged by any of 
 the disciples, but, of his own accord, he proffers himself to be a 
 close follower of Christ; he is not a pressed man, but a volunteer.

 [2.] Very resolute; he seems to be at a point in this matter; he does 
 not say, "I have a mind to <I>follow thee;</I>" but, "I am determined, 
 <I>I will</I> do it." 

 [3.] It was unlimited and without reserve; "<I>I will follow thee 
 whithersoever thou goest;</I> not only to <I>the other side</I> of the 
 country, but if it were to the utmost regions of the world." Now we 
 should think ourselves sure of such a man as this; and yet it appears, 
 by Christ's answer, that his resolution was rash, his ends low and 
 carnal: either he did not consider at all, or not that which was to be 
 considered; he saw the miracles Christ wrought, and hoped he would set 
 up a temporal kingdom, and he wished to apply betimes for a share in 
 it. Note, There are many resolutions for religion, produced by some 
 sudden pangs of conviction, and taken up without due consideration, 
 that prove abortive, and come to nothing: soon ripe, soon rotten.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How Christ tried his forwardness, whether it were sincere or not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He let him know that this <I>Son of man,</I> whom he is so eager to 
 follow, <I>has not where to lay his head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Now from this account of Christ's deep poverty, we observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That it is strange in itself, that the Son of God, when he came 
 into the world, should put himself into such a very low condition, as 
 to want the convenience of a certain resting-place, which the meanest 
 of the creatures have. If he would <I>take our nature upon him,</I> one 
 would think, he should have taken it in its best estate and 
 circumstances: no, he takes it in its worst. See here, <I>First,</I> 
 How well provided for the inferior creatures are: <I>The foxes have 
 holes;</I> though they are not only not useful, but hurtful, to man, 
 yet God provides holes for them in which they are earthed: man 
 endeavours to destroy them, but thus they are sheltered; their holes 
 are their castles. <I>The birds of the air,</I> though they take no 
 care for themselves, yet are taken care of, and <I>have nests</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:17">Ps. civ. 17</A>);

 <I>nests</I> in the field; some of them <I>nests</I> in the house; in 
 God's courts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:3">Ps. lxxxiv. 3</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> How poorly the Lord Jesus was provided for. It may
 encourage us to trust God for necessaries, that the beasts and birds
 have such good provision; and may comfort us, if we want necessaries,
 that our Master did so before us. Note, Our Lord Jesus, when he was
 here in the world, submitted to the disgraces and distresses of extreme
 poverty; <I>for our sakes he became poor,</I> very poor. He had not a
 settlement, had not a place of repose, not a house of his own, to put
 his head in, not a pillow of his own, to lay his head on. He and his
 disciples lived upon the charity of well-disposed people, that 
 <I>ministered to him of their substance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:2">Luke viii. 2</A>.

 Christ submitted to this, not only that he might in all respects humble
 himself, and fulfil the scriptures, which spake of him as <I>poor and 
 needy,</I> but that he might show us the vanity of worldly wealth, and 
 teach us to look upon it with a holy contempt; that he might purchase 
 better things for us, and so <I>make us rich,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:9">2 Cor. viii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It is strange that such a declaration should be made on this 
 occasion. When a scribe offered to follow Christ, one would think he 
 would have encouraged him, and said, <I>Come, and I will take care of 
 thee;</I> one scribe might be capable of doing him more credit and 
 service than twelve fishermen: but Christ saw his heart, and answered 
 to the thoughts of that, and therein teaches us all how to come to 
 Christ. <I>First,</I> The scribe's resolve seems to have been sudden; 
 and Christ would have us, when we take upon us a profession of 
 religion, to <I>sit down and count the cost</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:28">Luke xiv. 28</A>),

 to do it intelligently, and with consideration, and choose the way of
 godliness, not because we know no other, but because we know no better. 
 It is no advantage to religion, to take men by surprise, ere they are 
 aware. They that take up a profession <I>in a pang,</I> will throw it
 off again <I>in a fret;</I> let them, therefore, <I>take time,</I> and 
 they will have <I>done the sooner:</I> let him that will follow Christ 
 know the worst of it, and expect to lie hard, and fare hard.
 <I>Secondly,</I> His resolve seems to have been from a worldly, 
 covetous principle. He saw what abundance of cures Christ wrought, and 
 concluded that he had large fees, and would get an estate quickly, and 
 therefore he would follow him in hopes of growing rich with him; but 
 Christ rectifies his mistake, and tells him, he was so far from growing 
 rich, that he had not a place to <I>lay his head on;</I> and that if he 
 follow him, he cannot expect to fare better than he fared. Note, Christ 
 will accept none for his followers that aim at worldly advantages in 
 following him, or design to make any thing but heaven of their 
 religion. We have reason to think that this scribe, hereupon, <I>went 
 away sorrowful,</I> being disappointed in a bargain which he thought 
 would turn to account; he is not for following Christ, unless he can 
 <I>get by him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is another that was too <I>slow in performing.</I> Delay in 
 execution is as bad, on the one hand, as precipitancy in resolution is 
 on the other hand; when we have taken time to consider, and then have 
 determined, let it never be said, we left that to be done to-morrow, 
 which we could do to-day. This candidate for the ministry was one of 
 Christ's disciples already 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 a follower of him at large. Clemens Alexandrinus tells us, from an 
 ancient tradition, that this was Philip; he seems to be better 
 qualified and disposed than the former; because not so confident and 
 presumptuous: a bold, eager, over-forward temper is not the most 
 promising in religion; sometimes the last are first, and the first 
 last. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The excuse that this disciple made, to defer an immediate 
 attendance on Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 "<I>Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</I> Before I come 
 to be a close and constant follower of thee, let me be allowed to 
 perform this last office of respect to my father; and in the mean time, 
 let it suffice to be a hearer of thee now and then, when I can spare 
 time." His father (some think) was now sick, or dying, or dead; others 
 think, he was only aged, and not likely in a course of nature, to 
 continue long; and he desired leave to attend upon him in his sickness, 
 at his death, and to his grave, and then he would be at Christ's 
 service. This seemed a reasonable request, and yet it was not right. He 
 had not the zeal he should have had for the work, and therefore pleaded 
 this, because it seemed a plausible plea. Note, An unwilling mind never 
 wants an excuse. The meaning of <I>Non vacat</I> is, <I>Non placet--The 
 want of leisure is the want of inclination.</I> We will suppose it to 
 come from a true filial affection and respect for his father, yet still 
 the preference should have been given to Christ. Note, Many are
 hindered <I>from</I> and <I>in</I> the way of serious godliness, by an 
 over-concern for their families and relations; these lawful things undo 
 us all, and our duty to God is neglected, and postponed, under colour 
 of discharging our debts to the world; here therefore we have need to 
 double our guard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ's disallowing of this excuse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);

 <I>Jesus said to him, Follow me;</I> and, no doubt, power accompanied 
 this word to him, as to others, and he did <I>follow Christ,</I> and 
 cleaved to him, as Ruth to Naomi, when the scribe, in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:19,20">verses before</A>,

 like Orpah, took leave of him. That said, <I>I will follow thee;</I> to
 this Christ said, <I>Follow me;</I> comparing them together, it is
 intimated that we are brought to Christ by the force of his call to us, 
 not of our promises to him; it is <I>not of him that willeth, nor of 
 him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy;</I> he calls whom he 
 will, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:16">Rom. ix. 16</A>.

 And further, Note, Though chosen vessels may make excuses, and delay
 their compliance with divine calls a great while, yet Christ will at 
 length answer their excuses, conquer their unwillingness, and bring 
 them to his feet; when Christ calls, he will overcome, and make the 
 call effectual,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:10">1 Sam. iii. 10</A>.

 His excuse is laid aside as insufficient; <I>Let the dead bury their
 dead.</I> It is a proverbial expression; "Let one dead man bury 
 another: rather let them lie unburied, than that the service of Christ 
 should be neglected. <I>Let the dead</I> spiritually <I>bury the
 dead</I> corporally; let worldly offices be left to worldly people; do 
 not thou encumber thyself with them. Burying the dead, and especially a 
 dead father, is a good work, but it is not thy work at this time: it 
 may be done as well by others, that are not called and qualified, as 
 thou art, to be employed for Christ; thou hast something else to do, 
 and must not defer that." Note, Piety to God must be preferred before 
 piety to parents, though that is a great and needful part of our 
 religion. The Nazarites, under the law, were not to mourn for their own 
 parents, because they were <I>holy to the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:6-8">Num. vi. 6-8</A>);

 nor was the high priest to <I>defile himself for the dead,</I> no, not
 for <I>his own father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:11,12">Lev. xxi. 11, 12</A>.

 And Christ requires of those who would follow him, that they <I>hate
 father and mother</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:26">Luke xiv. 26</A>);

 love them less than God; we must comparatively neglect and disesteem
 our nearest relations, when they come in competition with Christ, and 
 either our doing for him, or our suffering for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed
 him.
 &nbsp; 24  And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea,
 insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was
 asleep.
 &nbsp; 25  And his disciples came to <I>him,</I> and awoke him, saying,
 Lord, save us: we perish.
 &nbsp; 26  And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little
 faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and
 there was a great calm.
 &nbsp; 27  But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this,
 that even the winds and the sea obey him!
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ had given sailing orders to his disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 that they should <I>depart to the other side of the sea of 
 Tiberias,</I> into the country of Gadara, in the tribe of Gad, which 
 lay east of Jordan; thither he would go to rescue a poor creature that 
 was possessed <I>with a legion of devils,</I> though he foresaw how he 
 should be affronted there. Now. 

 1. He chose to go by water. It had not been much about, if he had gone
 by land; but he chose to cross the lake, that he might have occasion to 
 manifest himself the God <I>of the sea</I> as well as of <I>the dry 
 land,</I> and to show that <I>all power is his, both in heaven and in 
 earth.</I> It is a comfort to those <I>who go down to the sea in 
 ships,</I> and are often in perils there, to reflect that they have a 
 Saviour to trust in, and pray to, who knows what it is to be at sea, 
 and to be in storms there. But observe, when he went to sea, he had no 
 yacht or pleasure-boat to attend him, but made use of his disciples' 
 fishing-boats; so poorly was he accommodated in all respects. 

 2. <I>His disciples followed him;</I> the twelve kept close to him, 
 when others staid behind upon the <I>terra firma,</I> where there was 
 sure footing. Note, They, and they only, will be found the true
 disciples of Christ, that are willing to go to sea with him, to follow 
 him into dangers and difficulties. Many would be content to go the 
 land-way to heaven, that will rather stand still, or go back, than 
 venture upon a dangerous sea; but those that would rest with Christ 
 hereafter must follow him now wherever he leads them, into a ship or 
 into a prison, as well as into a palace. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The peril and perplexity of the disciples in this voyage; and in 
 this appeared the truth of what Christ had just now said, that those 
 who follow him must count upon difficulties, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>There arose a very great storm,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Christ could have prevented this storm, and have ordered them a 
 pleasant passage, but that would not have been so much for his glory 
 and the confirmation of their faith as their deliverance was: this 
 storm was <I>for their sakes,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:4">John xi. 4</A>.

 One would have expected, that having Christ with them, they should have
 had a very favourable gale, but it is quite otherwise; for Christ would 
 show that they who are passing with him over the ocean of this world to 
 the other side, must expect storms by the way. The church is <I>tossed 
 with tempests</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:11">Isa. liv. 11</A>);

 it is only the upper region that enjoys a perpetual calm, this lower
 one is ever and anon disturbed and disturbing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Jesus Christ <I>was asleep in this storm.</I> We never read of 
 Christ's sleeping but at this time; he was in watchings often, and 
 continued all night in prayer to God: this was a sleep, not of 
 security, like Jonah's in a storm, but of holy serenity, and dependence 
 upon his Father: he slept to show that he was really and truly man, and 
 subject to the sinless infirmities of our nature: his work made him 
 weary and sleepy, and he had no guilt, no fear within, to disturb his 
 repose. Those that can lay their heads upon the pillow of a clear 
 conscience, may sleep quietly and sweetly in a storm 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:8">Ps. iv. 8</A>),

 as Peter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:6">Acts xii. 6</A>.

 He slept at this time, to try the faith of his disciples, whether they
 could trust him when he seemed to slight them. He slept not so much
 with a desire to be refreshed, as with a design to be awaked.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The poor disciples, though used to the sea, were in a great fright,
 and in their fear <I>came to</I> their Master,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Whither else should they go? It was well they had him so near them.
 They <I>awoke him</I> with their prayers; <I>Lord, save us, we 
 perish.</I> Note, They who would learn to pray must go to sea. Imminent 
 and sensible dangers will drive people to him who alone can help in 
 time of need. Their prayer has life in it, <I>Lord, save us, we 
 perish.</I> 

 (1.) Their petition is, <I>Lord, save us.</I> They believed he 
 <I>could</I> save them; they begged he <I>would,</I> Christ's errand 
 into the world was <I>to save,</I> but those only <I>shall be saved 
 that call on the name of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:21">Acts ii. 21</A>.

 They who by faith are interested in the eternal salvation wrought out
 by Christ, may with a humble confidence apply themselves to him for 
 temporal deliverances. Observe, They call him, <I>Lord,</I> and then
 pray, <I>Save us.</I> Note, Christ will save none but those that are 
 willing to take him for their Lord; for he is a Prince and a Saviour.

 (2.) Their plea is, <I>We perish;</I> which was,

 [1.] The language of their fear; they looked upon their case as 
 desperate, and gave up all for lost; they had received a sentence of 
 death within themselves, and this they plead, "<I>We perish,</I> if 
 thou dost not save us; look upon us therefore with pity."

 [2.] It was the language of their fervency; they pray as men in 
 earnest, that beg for their lives; it becomes us thus to strive and 
 wrestle in prayer; <I>therefore</I> Christ slept, that he might draw 
 out this importunity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The power and grace of Jesus Christ put forth for their succour: 
 then the Lord Jesus awaked, as one refreshed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:65">Ps. lxxviii. 65</A>.

 Christ may sleep when his church is in a storm, but he will not
 outsleep himself: the time, the set time to favour his distressed 
 church, will come,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:13">Ps. cii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He rebuked the disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);

 <I>Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?</I> He does not chide them 
 for disturbing him with their prayers, but for disturbing themselves 
 with their fears. Christ reproved them first, and then delivered them; 
 this is his method, to prepare us for a mercy, and then to give it us. 
 Observe, 

 (1.) His dislike of their fears; "<I>Why are ye fearful?</I> Ye, my 
 disciples? Let the sinners in Zion be afraid, let heathen mariners
 tremble in a storm, but you shall not be so. Enquire into the reasons 
 of your fear, and weigh them." 

 (2.) His discovery of the cause and spring of their fears; <I>O ye of 
 little faith.</I> Many that have true faith are weak in it, and it does 
 but little. Note,

 [1.] Christ's disciples are apt to be disquieted with fears in a stormy 
 day, to torment themselves with jealousies that things are bad with 
 them, and dismal conclusions that they will be worse.

 [2.] The prevalence of our inordinate fears in a stormy day is owing to 
 the weakness of our faith, which would be as an anchor to the soul, and 
 would ply the oar of prayer. By faith we might see through the storm to 
 the quiet shore, and encourage ourselves with hope that we shall 
 weather our point.

 [3.] The fearfulness of Christ's disciples in a storm, and their 
 unbelief, the cause of it, are very displeasing to the Lord Jesus, for 
 they reflect dishonour upon him, and create disturbance to 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He <I>rebukes the wind;</I> the former he did as the God of 
 <I>grace,</I> and the Sovereign of the heart, who can do what he 
 pleases <I>in</I> us; this he did as the God of <I>nature,</I> the 
 Sovereign of the world, who can do what he pleases <I>for</I> us. It is 
 the same <I>power that stills the noise of the sea,</I> and the tumult 
 of fear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:7">Ps. lxv. 7</A>.
 
 See,

 (1.) How <I>easily</I> this was done, with a word's speaking. Moses
 commanded the waters with a rod; Joshua, with the ark of the covenant; 
 Elisha, with the prophet's mantle; but Christ with a word. See his 
 absolute dominion over all the creatures, which bespeaks both his 
 honour, and the happiness of those that have him on their side. 

 (2.) How <I>effectually</I> it was done? <I>There was a great calm,</I> 
 all of a sudden. Ordinarily, after a storm, there is such a fret of the 
 waters, that it is a good while ere they can settle; but if Christ 
 speak the word, not only the storm ceases, but all the effects of it, 
 all the remains of it. Great storms of doubt, and fear in the soul, 
 under the power of the spirit of bondage, sometimes end in a wonderful 
 calm, created and spoken by the Spirit of adoption.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. This excited their astonishment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 <I>The men marvelled.</I> They had been long acquainted with the sea, 
 and never saw a storm so immediately turned into a perfect calm, in all 
 their lives. It has all the marks and signatures of a miracle upon it; 
 <I>it is the Lord's doing, and is marvellous in their eyes.</I> 
 Observe, 

 (1.) Their admiration of Christ; <I>What manner of man is this!</I> 
 Note, Christ is a Nonsuch; every thing in him is admirable: none so 
 wise, so mighty, so amiable, as he. 

 (2.) The reason of it; <I>Even the winds and the sea obey him.</I> Upon 
 this account, Christ is to be admired, that he has a commanding power 
 even over <I>winds and seas.</I> Others pretended to cure diseases, but 
 he only undertook to command <I>the winds.</I> We know not the way of 
 <I>the wind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:8">John iii. 8</A>),

 much less can we control it; but he that <I>bringeth forth the wind out
 of his treasury</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:7">Ps. cxxxv. 7</A>),

 when it is out, gathers it into his fists,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:4">Prov. xxx. 4</A>.

 He that can do this, can do any thing, can do enough to encourage our
 confidence and comfort in him, in the most stormy day, within or 
 without,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:4">Isa. xxvi. 4</A>.

 The Lord <I>sits upon the floods,</I> and is <I>mightier than the noise
 of many waters.</I> Christ, by commanding <I>the seas,</I> showed 
 himself to be the same that <I>made the world, when, at his rebuke, the 
 waters fled</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:7,8">Ps. civ. 7, 8</A>),

 as now, <I>at his rebuke,</I> they fell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  And when he was come to the other side into the country of
 the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming
 out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by
 that way.
 &nbsp; 29  And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with
 thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us
 before the time?
 &nbsp; 30  And there was a good way off from them a herd of many swine
 feeding.
 &nbsp; 31  So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out,
 suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.
 &nbsp; 32  And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they
 went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine
 ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in
 the waters.
 &nbsp; 33  And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the
 city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the
 possessed of the devils.
 &nbsp; 34  And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when
 they saw him, they besought <I>him</I> that he would depart out of
 their coasts.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of Christ's casting the devils out of two men 
 that were possessed. The scope of this chapter is to show the divine 
 power of Christ, by the instances of his dominion over bodily diseases, 
 which to us are irresistible; over winds and waves, which to us are yet 
 more uncontrollable; and lastly, over devils, which to us are most 
 formidable of all. Christ has not only all <I>power in heaven and 
 earth</I> and all deep places, but has the keys of hell too. 
 <I>Principalities and powers were made subject to him,</I> even while 
 he was in his estate of humiliation, as an earnest of what should be at 
 his entrance into his glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:21">Eph. i. 21</A>);
 
 he spoiled them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>.

 It was observed in general

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that Christ <I>cast out the spirits with his word;</I> here we have a
 particular instance of it, which have some circumstances more 
 remarkable than the rest. This miracle was wrought in the country of 
 the Gergesenes; some think, they were the remains of the old 
 Girgashites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:1">Deut. vii. 1</A>.

 Though Christ was sent chiefly <I>to the lost sheep of the house of
 Israel,</I> yet some sallies he made among the borderers, as here, to 
 gain this victory over Satan, which was a specimen of the conquest of 
 his legions in the Gentile world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, besides the general instance which this gives us of Christ's power 
 over Satan, and his design against him to disarm and dispossess him, we 
 have here especially discovered to us the way and manner of evil 
 spirits in their enmity to man. Observe, concerning this legion of 
 devils, What work they made where they <I>were,</I> and where they 
 <I>went.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What work they made where they <I>were;</I> which appears in the 
 miserable condition of these two that were possessed by them; and some 
 think, these two were man and wife, because the other Evangelists speak 
 but of one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They dwelt among <I>the tombs;</I> thence they came when they met
 Christ. The devil having <I>the power of death,</I> not as judge, but
 as executioner, he delighted to converse among the trophies of his 
 victory, the dead bodies of men; but there, where he thought himself in 
 the greatest triumph and elevation, as afterwards in Golgotha, the 
 place of a skull, did Christ conquer and subdue him. Conversing among 
 the graves increased the melancholy and frenzy of the poor possessed 
 creatures, and so strengthened the hold he had of them by their bodily 
 distemper, and also made them more formidable to other people, who 
 generally startle at any thing that stirs among <I>the tombs.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They were <I>exceeding fierce;</I> not only ungovernable themselves, 
 but mischievous to others, frightening many, having hurt some; <I>so 
 that no man durst pass that way.</I> Note, The devil bears malice to 
 mankind, and shows it by making men spiteful and malicious one to 
 another. Mutual enmities, where they should be mutual endearments and 
 assistances, are effects and evidences of Satan's enmity to the whole 
 race; he makes one man a wolf, a bear, a devil, to another--<I>Homo
 homini lupus.</I> Where Satan rules in a man spiritually, by those 
 lusts that war in the members, pride, envy, malice, revenge, they make 
 him as unfit for human society, as unworthy of it, and as much an enemy 
 to the comfort of it, as these poor possessed creatures were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They bid defiance to Jesus Christ, and disclaimed all interest in 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 It is an instance of the power of God over the devils, that, 
 notwithstanding the mischief they studied to do <I>by</I> and <I>to</I> 
 these poor creatures, yet they could not keep them from meeting Jesus 
 Christ, who ordered the matter so as to meet them. It was his 
 overpowering hand that dragged these unclean spirits into his presence, 
 which they dreaded more than any thing else: his chains could hold 
 them, when the chains that men made for them could not. But being 
 brought before him, they protested against his jurisdiction, and broke 
 out into a rage, <I>What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of 
 God?</I> Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>One</I> word that the devil spoke like a <I>saint;</I> he 
 addressed himself to Christ as <I>Jesus the Son of God;</I> a 
 <I>good</I> word, and at this time, when it was a truth but in the 
 proving, it was a <I>great</I> word too, what flesh and blood did not 
 reveal to Peter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:17"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 17</A>.

 Even the devils know, and believe, and confess Christ to be the <I>Son
 of God,</I> and yet they are devils still, which makes their enmity to 
 Christ so much the more wicked, and indeed a perfect torment to 
 themselves; for how can it be otherwise, to oppose one they know to be 
 the <I>Son of God?</I> Note, It is not knowledge, but love, that 
 distinguishes saints from devils. He is the first-born of hell, that 
 knows Christ and yet hates him, and will not be subject to him and his 
 law. We may remember that not long since the devil made a doubt whether 
 Christ were <I>the Son of God</I> or not, and would have persuaded him
 to question it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:3"><I>ch.</I> iv. 3</A>),

 but now he readily owns it. Note, Though God's children may be much
 disquieted in an hour of temptation, by Satan's questioning their 
 relation to God as a Father, yet the Spirit of adoption shall at length 
 clear it up to them so much to their satisfaction, as to set it even 
 above the devil's contradiction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Two</I> words that he said like a <I>devil,</I> like 
 himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] A word of defiance; <I>What have we to do with thee?</I> Now, 
 <I>First,</I> It is true that the devils have nothing to do with Christ 
 as a Saviour, <I>for he took not on him the nature of the angels</I> 
 that fell, nor did he lay hold on them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:16">Heb. ii. 16</A>);

 they are in no relation to him, they neither have, nor hope for, any
 benefit by him. O the depth of this mystery of divine love, that fallen 
 man hath so much <I>to do with Christ,</I> when fallen angels have 
 nothing <I>to do with</I> him! Surely here was torment enough before 
 the time, to be forced to own the excellency <I>that is in Christ,</I> 
 and yet that he has no interest in him. Note, It is possible for me to 
 call Jesus <I>the Son of God,</I> and yet have nothing to do with him.
 <I>Secondly,</I> It is as true, that the devils desire not to have any 
 thing <I>to do with Christ</I> as a Ruler; they hate him, they are 
 filled with enmity against him, they stand in opposition to him, and 
 are in open rebellion against his crown and dignity. See whose language 
 they speak, that will have nothing <I>to do with the</I> gospel of 
 Christ, with his laws and ordinances, that throw off his yoke, that 
 <I>break his bands in sunder,</I> and <I>will not have him to reign 
 over them;</I> that say <I>to the Almighty</I> Jesus, <I>Depart from 
 us: they are of their father the devil, they do his lusts,</I> and 
 speak his language. <I>Thirdly,</I> But it is not true, that the devils 
 have nothing <I>to do with Christ</I> as a Judge, for they have, and 
 they know it. These devils could not say, <I>What hast thou to do with
 us?</I> could not deny that the Son of God is the Judge of devils; to 
 his judgment they are bound over in chains of darkness, which they 
 would fain shake off, and shake off the thought of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] A word of dread and deprecation; "<I>Art thou come hither to 
 torment us</I>--to cast us out from these men, and to restrain us from
 doing the hurt we would do?" Note, To be turned out, and tied up, from 
 doing mischief, is a torment to the devil, all whose comfort and 
 satisfaction are man's misery and destruction. Should not we then count 
 it our heaven to be doing well, and reckon that our torment, whether 
 within or without, that hinders us from well-doing? Now must we be 
 tormented by thee <I>before the time;</I> Note, <I>First,</I> There is 
 a time in which devils will be more tormented than they are, and they 
 know it. The great assize at the last day is the time fixed for their 
 complete torture, in that Tophet which is ordained of old <I>for the 
 king, for the prince of the devils, and his angels</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:33,Mt+25:41">Isa. xxx. 33; Matt. xxv. 41</A>);
 
 <I>for the judgment of that day</I> they are <I>reserved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:4">2 Pet. ii. 4</A>.

 Those malignant spirits that are, by the divine permission, prisoners
 <I>at large,</I> walking to and fro through the earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:7">Job i. 7</A>),

 are even now in a chain; hitherto shall their power reach, and no
 further; they will then be made <I>close</I> prisoners: they have now 
 some ease; they will then be in torment without ease. This they here 
 take for granted, and ask not never to be tormented (despair of relief 
 is the misery of their case), but they beg that they may not be 
 tormented <I>before the time;</I> for though they knew not when the day 
 of judgment should be, they knew it should not be yet.
 <I>Secondly,</I> The devils have <I>a certain fearful looking for of 
 that judgment and fiery indignation,</I> upon every approach of Christ, 
 and every check that is given to their power and rage. The very sight 
 of Christ and his word of command to come out of the man, made them 
 thus apprehensive of their torment. Thus <I>the devils believe, and 
 tremble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:19">Jam. ii. 19</A>.

 It is their own enmity to God and man that puts them upon the rack, and
 <I>torments them before the time.</I> The most desperate sinners, whose 
 damnation is sealed, yet cannot quite harden their hearts against the 
 surprise of fearfulness, <I>when they see the day approaching.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us now see what work they made where they <I>went,</I> when 
 they were turned out of the men possessed, and that was into <I>a herd 
 of swine,</I> which <I>was a good way off,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 These Gergesenes, though living on the other side Jordan, were Jews. 
 What had they to do with <I>swine,</I> which by the law were unclean, 
 and not to be eaten nor touched? Probably, lying in the outskirts of 
 the land, there were many Gentiles among them, to whom this <I>herd of 
 swine</I> belonged: or they kept them to be sold, or bartered, to the 
 Romans, with whom they had now great dealings, and who were admirers of 
 <I>swine's</I> flesh. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How the devils seized the <I>swine.</I> Though they were <I>a good 
 way off,</I> and, one would think, out of danger, yet the devils had an 
 eye upon them, to do them a mischief: for they <I>go up and down, 
 seeking to devour,</I> seeking an opportunity; and they seek not long 
 but they find. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They <I>asked</I> leave to enter <I>into the swine</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>);
 
 <I>they besought him,</I> with all earnestness, <I>If thou cast us out, 
 suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.</I> Hereby, 

 [1.] They discover their own inclination to do mischief, and what a 
 pleasure it is to them; those, therefore, are their children, and 
 resemble them, <I>whose sleep departeth from them, except they cause 
 some to fall,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:16">Prov. iv. 16</A>.

 "Let us go <I>into the herd of swine,</I> any where rather than into
 the place of torment, any where to do mischief." If they might not be 
 suffered to hurt men in their bodies, they would hurt them in their 
 goods, and in that too they intend hurt to their souls, by making 
 Christ a burthen to them: such malicious devices hath that old subtle 
 serpent!

 [2.] They own Christ's power over them; that, without his sufferance 
 and permission, they could not so much as hurt a <I>swine.</I> This is 
 comfortable to all the Lord's people, that, though the devil's power be 
 very great, yet it is limited, and not equal to his malice (what would 
 become of us, if it were?) especially that it is under the control of 
 our Lord Jesus, our most faithful, powerful friend and Saviour; that 
 Satan and his instruments can go no further than he is pleased to 
 permit; <I>here shall their proud waves be stayed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They <I>had</I> leave. Christ said unto them, <I>Go</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),
 
 as God did to Satan, when he desired leave to afflict Job. Note, God 
 does often, for wise and holy ends, permit the efforts of Satan's rage, 
 and suffer him to do the mischief he would, and even by it serve his 
 own purposes. The devils are not only Christ's captives, but his 
 vassals; his dominion over them appears in the harm they do, as well as 
 in the hindrance of them from doing more. Thus even their wrath is made 
 to praise Christ, and the remainder of it he does and will restrain. 
 Christ permitted this, 

 [1.] For the conviction of the Sadducees that were then among the Jews, 
 who denied the existence of spirits, and would not own that there were 
 such beings, because they could not see them. Now Christ would, by 
 this, bring it as near as might be to an ocular demonstration of the 
 being, multitude, power, and malice, of evil spirits, that, if they 
 were not hereby convinced, they might be left inexcusable in their 
 infidelity. We see not the wind, but it would be absurd to deny it, 
 when we see trees and houses blown down by it.

 [2.] For the punishment of the Gadarenes, who perhaps, though Jews,
 took a liberty to eat <I>swine's</I> flesh, contrary to the law: 
 however, their keeping <I>swine</I> bordered upon evil; and Christ 
 would also show what a hellish crew they were delivered from, which, if 
 he had permitted it, would soon have choked them, as they did their 
 <I>swine.</I> The devils, in obedience to Christ's command, came out of 
 the men, and having permission, <I>when they were come out, immediately 
 they went into the herd of swine.</I> See what an industrious enemy 
 Satan is, and how expeditious; he will lose no time in doing mischief.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>Whither they hurried them,</I> when they had seized them. They 
 were not bid to <I>save their lives,</I> and, therefore, they were made 
 to <I>run violently down a steep place into the sea,</I> where they all 
 perished, to the number of about <I>two thousand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:13">Mark v. 13</A>.

 Note, The possession which the devil gets is for destruction. Thus the
 devil hurries people to sin, hurries them to that which they have 
 resolved against, and which they know will be shame and grief to them: 
 with what a force doth the evil spirit <I>work in the children of 
 disobedience,</I> when by so many foolish and hurtful lusts they are 
 brought to act in direct contradiction, not only to religion, but to 
 right reason, and their interest in this world! Thus, likewise, he 
 hurries them to ruin, for he is Apollyon and Abaddon, the great 
 destroyer. By his lusts which men do, they are <I>drowned in 
 destruction and perdition.</I> This is Satan's will, to <I>swallow 
 up</I> and to <I>devour;</I> miserable then is the condition of those 
 that are led <I>captive by him at his will.</I> They are hurried into a 
 worse lake than this, a lake that <I>burns with fire and brimstone.</I> 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>What effect this had upon the owners.</I> The report of it was 
 soon brought them by the swine-herds, who seemed to be more concerned 
 for the loss of the swine than any thing else, for they went not to 
 tell <I>what was befallen to the possessed of the devils,</I> till the 
 swine were lost, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Christ went not <I>into the city,</I> but the news of his being there 
 did, by which he was willing to feel how their pulse beat, and what 
 influence it had upon them, and then act accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 (1.) Their curiosity brought them out to see Jesus. The <I>whole city 
 came out to meet him,</I> that they might be able to say, they had seen 
 a man who did such wonderful works. Thus many go out, in profession, to 
 meet Christ for company, that have no real affection for him, nor 
 desire to know him.</P>

 (2.) Their covetousness made them <I>willing to be rid of him.</I> 
 Instead of inviting him into their city, or bringing their sick to him 
 to be healed, they desired him <I>to depart out of their coasts,</I> as 
 if they had borrowed the words of the devils, <I>What have we to do 
 with thee, Jesus thou Son of God?</I> And now the devils had what they 
 aimed at in drowning the swine; <I>they</I> did it, and then made the 
 people believe that <I>Christ</I> had done it, and so prejudiced them 
 against him. He seduced our first parents, by possessing them with hard 
 thoughts of God, and kept the Gadarenes from Christ, by suggesting that 
 he came into their country to destroy their cattle, and that he would 
 do more hurt than good; for though he had cured two men, yet he had 
 drowned two thousand swine. Thus the devil sows tares in God's field, 
 does mischief in the Christian church, and then lays the blame upon 
 Christianity, and incenses men against that. They besought him that he 
 would depart, lest, like Moses in Egypt, he should proceed to some 
 other plague. Note, There are a great many who prefer their swine 
 before their Saviour, and so come short of Christ, and salvation by 
 him. They desire Christ to depart out of their hearts, and will not 
 suffer his word to have a place in them, because he and his word will 
 be the destruction of their brutish lusts--those swine which they give
 up themselves to feed. And justly will Christ forsake those that thus 
 are weary of him, and say to them hereafter, <I>Depart, ye cursed,</I> 
 who now say to the Almighty, <I>Depart from us.</I></P>
