 Mark's narrative does not take rise so early as those of Matthew and 
 Luke do, from the birth of our Saviour, but from John's baptism, from 
 which he soon passes to Christ's public ministry. Accordingly, in this 
 chapter, we have, 

 I. The office of John Baptist illustrated by the prophecy of him

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;
 &nbsp; 2  As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger
 before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
 &nbsp; 3  The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way
 of the Lord, make his paths straight.
 &nbsp; 4  John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
 repentance for the remission of sins.
 &nbsp; 5  And there went out unto him all the land of Jud&aelig;a, and they
 of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of
 Jordan, confessing their sins.
 &nbsp; 6  And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of
 a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;
 &nbsp; 7  And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after
 me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and
 unloose.
 &nbsp; 8  I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize
 you with the Holy Ghost.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the New Testament is--the <I>divine</I> testament, to which we
 <I>adhere</I> above all that is <I>human;</I> the new testament, which 
 we <I>advance</I> above that which was old. It is <I>the gospel of 
 Jesus Christ the Son of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 1. It is <I>gospel;</I> it is God's word, and is <I>faithful</I> and
 <I>true;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:9,21:5,22:6">
 Rev. xix. 9; xxi. 5; xxii. 6</A>.

 It is a <I>good word,</I> and well <I>worthy of all acceptation;</I> it 
 brings us glad tidings. 

 2. It is the <I>gospel of Jesus Christ,</I> the <I>anointed
 Saviour,</I> the Messiah promised and expected. The foregoing gospel 
 began with the <I>generation of Jesus Christ</I>--that was but 
 preliminary, this comes immediately to the business--<I>the gospel of 
 Christ.</I> It is called <I>his,</I> not only because he is the 
 <I>Author</I> of it, and it comes <I>from him,</I> but because he is 
 the <I>Subject of it,</I> and it treats wholly <I>concerning him.</I> 
 
 3. This Jesus is the <I>Son of God.</I> That truth is the foundation on
 which the gospel is built, and which it is written to demonstrate; for 
 is Jesus be not <I>the Son of God,</I> our <I>faith is vain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the <I>reference</I> of the New Testament is to the Old, and 
 its <I>coherence</I> with it. The gospel of Jesus Christ <I>begins,</I> 
 and so we shall find it <I>goes on,</I> just <I>as it is written in the 
 prophets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 for it <I>saith no other things than those which the prophets and Moses 
 said should come</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:22">Acts xxvi. 22</A>),

 which was most proper and powerful for the conviction of the Jews, who 
 believed the Old-Testament prophets to be sent of God and ought to have 
 <I>evidenced</I> that they did so by welcoming the accomplishment of 
 their prophecies in its season; but it is of use to us all, for the 
 confirmation of our faith both in the Old Testament and in the New, for 
 the exact harmony that there is between both shows that they both have 
 the same divine original.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Quotations are here borrowed from two prophecies--that of Isaiah, which
 was the <I>longest,</I> and that of Malachi, which was the 
 <I>latest</I> (and there were above three hundred years between them), 
 both of whom spoke to the same purport concerning <I>the beginning of 
 the gospel of Jesus Christ,</I> in the ministry of John.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Malachi, in whom we had the Old-Testament <I>farewell,</I> spoke 
 very plainly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1</A>)

 concerning John Baptist, who was to give the New-Testament <I>welcome.
 Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Christ himself had taken notice of this, and applied it to John

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:10">Matt. xi. 10</A>),

 who was God's <I>messenger,</I> sent to <I>prepare Christ's 
 way.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Isaiah, the most evangelical of all the prophets, <I>begins</I> the
 evangelical part of his prophecy with this, which points to the
 <I>beginning of the gospel of Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:3">Isa. xl. 3</A>);

 <I>The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Matthew had taken notice of this, and applied it to John,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:3"><I>ch.</I> iii. 3</A>.

 But from these two put together here, we may observe, 

 (1.) That Christ, in his gospel, <I>comes among us,</I> bringing with 
 him a treasure of grace, and a sceptre of government. 

 (2.) Such is the corruption of the world, that there is something to do 
 to <I>make room</I> for him, and to remove that which gives not only 
 <I>obstruction,</I> but <I>opposition</I> to his progress. 

 (3.) When God sent his Son into the world, he <I>took care,</I> and 
 when he sends him into the heart, he <I>takes care,</I> effectual care, 
 to <I>prepare his way before him;</I> for the designs of his grace 
 shall not be <I>frustrated;</I> nor may any expect the comforts of that 
 grace, but such as, by conviction of sin and humiliation for it, are 
 <I>prepared</I> for those comforts, and disposed to receive them. 

 (4.) When the <I>paths</I> that were <I>crooked,</I> are <I>made 
 straight</I> (the mistakes of the judgment rectified, and the 
 <I>crooked ways</I> of the affections), then way is made for Christ's 
 comforts. 

 (5.) It is in a <I>wilderness,</I> for such this world is, that 
 <I>Christ's way</I> is prepared, and theirs that follow him, like that 
 which Israel passed through to Canaan. 

 (6.) The messengers of conviction and terror, that come to prepare 
 Christ's way, are <I>God's messengers,</I> whom he sends and will own, 
 and must be <I>received</I> as such. 

 (7.) They that are sent to <I>prepare the way of the Lord,</I> in such 
 a vast howling wilderness as this is, have need to <I>cry aloud,</I> 
 and not spare, and to <I>lift up their voice like a trumpet.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What the <I>beginning</I> of the New Testament was. The gospel 
 began in John Baptist; for <I>the law and the prophets were, until 
 John,</I> the only divine revelation, but then the <I>kingdom of God 
 began to be preached,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:16">Luke xvi. 16</A>.

 Peter begins <I>from the baptism of John,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:22">Acts i. 22</A>.

 The gospel did not begin <I>so soon</I> as the <I>birth</I> of Christ,
 for he took time to <I>increase in wisdom and stature,</I> not so late 
 as his entering upon his public ministry, but half a year before, when 
 John began to preach the same doctrine that Christ afterward preached. 
 His baptism was the dawning of the <I>gospel day;</I> for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In John's way of <I>living</I> there was the beginning of a 
 <I>gospel spirit;</I> for it bespoke great self-denial, mortification 
 of the flesh, a holy contempt of the world, and nonconformity to it, 
 which may truly be called the <I>beginning of the gospel of Christ</I> 
 in any soul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He was <I>clothed with camels' hair,</I> not with soft raiment; was 
 girt, not with a golden, but with a <I>leathern girdle;</I> and, in 
 contempt of dainties and delicate things, his meat was <I>locusts and 
 wild honey.</I> Note, The more we sit loose to the body, and live above 
 the world, the better we are prepared for Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In John's <I>preaching</I> and <I>baptizing</I> there was the 
 <I>beginning</I> of the <I>gospel doctrines and ordinances,</I> and the 
 first fruits of them. 

 (1.) He preached the <I>remission of sins,</I> which is the great 
 gospel privilege; showed people their <I>need</I> of it, that they were 
 <I>undone</I> without it, and that it might be obtained. 

 (2.) He preached <I>repentance,</I> in order to it; he told people that 
 there must be a renovation of their hearts and a reformation of their 
 lives, that they must forsake their sins and turn to God, and upon 
 those terms and no other, their sins should be forgiven. <I>Repentance 
 for the remission of sins,</I> was what the apostles were commissioned 
 to <I>preach to all nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:27">Luke xxiv. 27</A>.

 (3.) He preached Christ, and directed his hearers to <I>expect him</I>
 speedily to appear, and to <I>expect great things</I> from him. The 
 preaching of Christ is pure gospel, and that was John Baptist's 
 preaching, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Like a true gospel minister, he preaches, 

 [1.] The great <I>pre-eminence</I> Christ is <I>advanced to;</I> so 
 high, so great, is Christ, that John, though one of the greatest that 
 was born of women, thinks himself unworthy to be employed in the 
 meanest office about him, even to <I>stoop down,</I> and <I>untie his 
 shoes.</I> Thus industrious is he to give honour to him, and to bring 
 others to do so too.

 [2.] The great <I>power</I> Christ is <I>invested with;</I> He <I>comes 
 after me</I> in time, but he is <I>mightier than I,</I> mightier than 
 the mighty ones of the earth, for he is able to <I>baptize with the 
 Holy Ghost;</I> he can <I>give</I> the Spirit of God, and by him 
 <I>govern</I> the spirits of men.

 [3.] The great <I>promise</I> Christ makes in his gospel to those who 
 have <I>repented,</I> and have had their sins forgiven them; They shall 
 be <I>baptized with</I> the Holy Ghost, shall be <I>purified</I> by his 
 graces, and <I>refreshed</I> by his comforts. And, <I>lastly,</I> All 
 those who received his doctrine, and submitted to his institution, he 
 <I>baptized with water,</I> as the manner of the Jews was to admit 
 proselytes, in token of their <I>cleansing themselves</I> by repentance 
 and reformation (which were the duties required), and of God's 
 <I>cleansing them</I> both by remission and by sanctification, which 
 were the blessings promised. Now this was afterward to be advanced into 
 a gospel ordinance, which John's using it was a preface to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. In the success of John's preaching, and the disciples he admitted by 
 baptism, there was the <I>beginning of a gospel church.</I> He baptized 
 <I>in the wilderness,</I> and declined going into the cities; but 
 <I>there went out unto him all the land of Judea, and they of 
 Jerusalem,</I> inhabitants both of city and country, families of them, 
 and <I>were all baptized of him.</I> They entered themselves his 
 disciples, and bound themselves to his discipline; in token of which, 
 they <I>confessed their sins;</I> he admitted them his disciples, in 
 token of which, he <I>baptized</I> them. Here were the stamina of the 
 gospel church, the <I>dew of its youth</I> from <I>the womb of the 
 morning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 Many of these afterward became followers of Christ, and preachers of
 his gospel, and this grain of mustard-seed became a <I>tree.</I></P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from
 Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.
 &nbsp; 10  And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the
 heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:
 &nbsp; 11  And there came a voice from heaven, <I>saying,</I> Thou art my
 beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
 &nbsp; 12  And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 13  And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of
 Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered
 unto him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a brief account of Christ's baptism and temptation, which 
 were largely related 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:1-4:25">Matt. iii. and iv.</A></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His <I>baptism,</I> which was his first public appearance, after he 
 had long lived obscurely <I>in Nazareth.</I> O how much <I>hidden 
 worth</I> is there, which in this world is either lost in the dust of 
 contempt and <I>cannot</I> be known, or wrapped up in the veil of 
 humility and <I>will not</I> be known! But sooner or later it <I>shall 
 be</I> known, as Christ's was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See how <I>humbly</I> he <I>owned</I> God, by coming to be 
 <I>baptized of John;</I> and thus <I>it became him to fulfil all 
 righteousness.</I> Thus he <I>took upon him the likeness of sinful 
 flesh,</I> that, though he was perfectly pure and unspotted, yet he was 
 <I>washed</I> as if he had been <I>polluted;</I> and thus <I>for our 
 sakes he sanctified himself, that we also might be sanctified,</I> and 
 be baptized with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:19">John xvii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See how <I>honourably</I> God owned him, when he submitted to John's 
 <I>baptism.</I> Those who <I>justify God,</I> and <I>they</I> are said 
 to do, who were <I>baptized with the baptism</I> of John, he will 
 <I>glorify,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:29,30">Luke vii. 29, 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He <I>saw the heavens opened;</I> thus he was owned to be the Lord 
 from heaven, and had a glimpse of the glory and joy that were <I>set 
 before him,</I> and <I>secured</I> to him, as the recompence of his 
 undertaking. Matthew saith, <I>The heavens were opened to him.</I> Mark 
 saith, <I>He saw them opened.</I> Many have the heavens opened to 
 receive them, but they do not see it; Christ had not only a clear 
 foresight of his sufferings, but of his glory too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He <I>saw the Spirit like a dove descending upon him.</I> Note,
 <I>Then</I> we may see heaven opened to us, when we perceive the Spirit 
 <I>descending</I> and working upon us. God's good work in us is the 
 surest evidence of his good will towards us, and his preparations for 
 us. Justin Martyr says, that <I>when Christ was baptized, a fire was 
 kindled in Jordan:</I> and it is an ancient tradition, that <I>a great 
 light shone round the place;</I> for the Spirit brings both 
 <I>light</I> and <I>heat.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He heard a voice which was intended for his encouragement to 
 proceed in his undertaking, and therefore it is here expressed as 
 directed <I>to him, Thou art my beloved Son.</I> God lets him know, 
 
 [1.] That he <I>loved him</I> never the <I>less</I> for that <I>low</I> 
 and <I>mean</I> estate to which he had now <I>humbled himself;</I> 
 "Though thus emptied and made of no reputation, yet he is my <I>beloved 
 Son</I> still." 

 [2.] That he <I>loved him</I> much the <I>more</I> for that 
 <I>glorious</I> and <I>kind</I> undertaking in which he had now 
 <I>engaged himself.</I> God is <I>well pleased</I> in him, as referee 
 of all matters in controversy between him and man; and so well pleased 
 in him, as to be well pleased <I>with us</I> in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His <I>temptation.</I> The <I>good Spirit</I> that descended upon 
 him, <I>led him into the wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Paul mentions it as a proof that he had his doctrine from God, and not 
 from man--that, as soon as he was called, he <I>went not to 
 Jerusalem,</I> but <I>went into Arabia,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:17">Gal. i. 17</A>.

 Retirement from the world is an opportunity of more free converse with
 God, and therefore must sometimes be chosen, for a while, even by those 
 that are called to the greatest business. Mark observes this
 circumstance of his being <I>in the wilderness</I>--that he was <I>with 
 the wild beasts.</I> It was an instance of his Father's care of him, 
 that he was preserved from being torn in pieces by the wild beasts, 
 which encouraged him the more that his Father would provide for him 
 when he was hungry. Special protections are earnests of seasonable 
 supplies. It was likewise an intimation to him of the inhumanity of the 
 men of that generation, whom he was to live among--no better than 
 <I>wild beasts</I> in the <I>wilderness,</I> nay abundantly worse. In 
 that wilderness,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The <I>evil spirits</I> were <I>busy with him;</I> he <I>was tempted 
 of Satan;</I> not by any inward injections (the prince of this world 
 had <I>nothing in him</I> to fasten upon), but by outward 
 solicitations. Solicitude often gives advantages to the tempter, 
 therefore <I>two are better than one.</I> Christ himself was tempted, 
 not only to teach us, that <I>it is no sin to be tempted,</I> but to 
 direct us whither to go for succour when we are tempted, even to him 
 that <I>suffered,</I> being <I>tempted;</I> that he might 
 experimentally sympathize with us when we are <I>tempted.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The <I>good spirits</I> were <I>busy about him;</I> the <I>angels 
 ministered to him,</I> supplied him with what he needed, and dutifully 
 attended him. Note, The ministration of the good angels about us, is 
 matter of great comfort in reference to the malicious designs of the 
 evil angels against us; but much more doth it befriend us, to have the 
 indwelling of the spirit in our hearts, which they that have, are so 
 <I>born of God,</I> that, as far as they are so, <I>the evil one 
 toucheth them not,</I> much less shall be <I>triumph</I> over them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into
 Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
 &nbsp; 15  And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is
 at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.
 &nbsp; 16  Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and
 Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were
 fishers.
 &nbsp; 17  And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make
 you to become fishers of men.
 &nbsp; 18  And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.
 &nbsp; 19  And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James
 the <I>son</I> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the
 ship mending their nets.
 &nbsp; 20  And straightway he called them: and they left their father
 Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.
 &nbsp; 21  And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath
 day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.
 &nbsp; 22  And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them
 as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A general account of Christ's preaching in Galilee. John gives an 
 account of his preaching in Judea, before this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:1-3:36"><I>ch.</I> ii. and iii.</A>),

 which the other evangelists had omitted, who chiefly relate what
 occurred in Galilee, because that was least known at Jerusalem. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When Jesus began to preach in Galilee; <I>After that John was put in 
 prison.</I> When he had <I>finished</I> his testimony, then Jesus 
 <I>began</I> his. Note, The silencing of Christ's ministers shall not 
 be the suppressing of Christ's gospel; if some be laid aside, others 
 shall be raised up, perhaps mightier than they, to carry on the same 
 work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What he preached; <I>The gospel of the kingdom of God.</I> Christ 
 came to set up the kingdom of God among men, that they might be brought 
 into <I>subjection to it,</I> and might obtain <I>salvation in it;</I> 
 and he set it up by the preaching of his gospel, and a power going 
 along with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 (1.) The great <I>truths</I> Christ preached; <I>The time is fulfilled, 
 and the kingdom of God is at hand.</I> This refers to the Old 
 Testament, in which the kingdom of the Messiah was promised, and the 
 time fixed for the introducing of it. They were not so well versed in
 those prophecies, nor did they so well observe the signs of the times, 
 as to understand it themselves, and therefore Christ gives them notice 
 of it; "The time prefixed is now <I>at hand;</I> glorious discoveries 
 of divine light, life, and love, are now to be made; a new dispensation 
 far more spiritual and heavenly than that which you have hitherto been 
 under, is now to commence." Note, God keeps time; when <I>the time is 
 fulfilled,</I> the <I>kingdom of God is at hand,</I> for the vision is 
 <I>for an appointed time,</I> which will be punctually observed, though 
 it tarry past our time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The great <I>duties</I> inferred from thence. Christ gave them to 
 <I>understand the times,</I> that they might know <I>what Israel ought 
 to do;</I> they fondly expected the Messiah to appear in external pomp 
 and power, not only to free the Jewish nation from the Roman yoke, but 
 to make it have dominion over all its neighbours, and therefore 
 thought, when that <I>kingdom of God</I> was <I>at hand,</I> they must 
 prepare for war, and for victory and preferment, and great things in 
 the world; but Christ tells them, in the prospect of that kingdom 
 approaching, they must <I>repent, and believe the gospel.</I> They had 
 broken the <I>moral law,</I> and could not be saved by a <I>covenant of 
 innocency,</I> for both Jew and Gentile are concluded <I>under 
 guilt.</I> They must therefore take the benefit of a <I>covenant of 
 grace,</I> must submit to a <I>remedial law,</I> and this is 
 it--<I>repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus
 Christ.</I> They had not made use of the prescribed preservatives, and 
 therefore must have recourse to the prescribed restoratives. By 
 repentance we must lament and forsake our sins, and by faith we must 
 receive the forgiveness of them. By repentance we must give glory to 
 our Creator whom we have offended; by faith we must give glory to our 
 Redeemer who came to <I>save us from our sins.</I> Both these must go 
 together; we must not think either that reforming our lives will save 
 us without trusting in the righteousness and grace of Christ, or that 
 trusting in Christ will save us without the reformation of our hearts 
 and lives. Christ hath joined these two together, and let no man think 
 to put them asunder. They will mutually assist and befriend each other. 
 Repentance will quicken faith, and faith will make repentance 
 evangelical; and the sincerity of both together must be evidenced by a 
 diligent conscientious obedience to all God's commandments. Thus the 
 preaching of the gospel began, and thus it continues; still the call 
 is, Repent, and believe, and live a <I>life of repentance</I> and a 
 <I>life of faith.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ appearing as a teacher, here is next his <I>calling of 
 disciples,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:16-20"><I>v.</I> 16-20</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. Christ will have followers. If he set up a school, he will have 
 scholars; if he set up his standard, he will have soldiers; if he 
 preach, he will have hearers. He has taken an effectual course to 
 secure this; for <I>all that the Father has given him, shall,</I> 
 without fail, <I>come to him.</I> 

 2. The instruments Christ chose to employ in setting up his kingdom,
 were the <I>weak</I> and <I>foolish things of the world;</I> not called 
 from the great sanhedrim, or the schools of the rabbin, but picked up 
 from among the tarpaulins <I>by the sea-side, that the excellency of 
 the power</I> might appear to be wholly <I>of God,</I> and not at all 
 <I>of them.</I> 

 3. Though Christ needs not the help of man, yet he is pleased to make
 use of it in setting up his kingdom, that he might deal with us not in 
 a formidable but in a familiar way, and that in his kingdom the 
 <I>nobles and governors may be of ourselves,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:21">Jer. xxxi. 21</A>.

 4. Christ puts honour upon those who, though mean in the world, are
 <I>diligent in their business,</I> and <I>loving to one another;</I> so 
 those were, whom Christ called. He found them <I>employed,</I> and 
 employed <I>together. Industry</I> and unity are <I>good</I> and
 <I>pleasant,</I> and there the Lord Jesus commands the blessing, even 
 this blessing, <I>Follow me.</I> 

 5. The business of ministers is to <I>fish for souls,</I> and <I>win
 them to Christ.</I> The children of men, in their natural condition, 
 are lost, wander endlessly in the great ocean of this world, and are 
 carried down the stream of its course and way; they are unprofitable. 
 Like leviathan in the waters, they <I>play therein;</I> and often, like 
 the fishes of the sea, they devour one another. Ministers, in
 preaching the gospel, <I>cast the net</I> into the waters, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:47">Matt. xiii. 47</A>.
 
 Some are enclosed and brought to shore, but far the greater number
 escape. <I>Fishermen</I> take great pains, and expose themselves to 
 great perils, so do <I>ministers;</I> and they have need of wisdom. If 
 many a draught brings home nothing, yet they must go on.

 6. Those whom Christ called, must <I>leave all,</I> to follow him; and
 by his grace he inclines them to do so. <I>Not that we must needs go
 out of the world</I> immediately, but we must sit loose to the world, 
 and forsake every thing that is inconsistent with our duty to Christ, 
 and that cannot be kept without prejudice to our souls. Mark takes 
 notice of James and John, that they left not only <I>their father</I> 
 (which we had in Matthew), but <I>the hired servants,</I> whom perhaps 
 they loved as their own brethren, being their <I>fellow-labourers</I> 
 and pleasant comrades; not only relations, but companions, must be left 
 for Christ, and old acquaintance. Perhaps it is an intimation of their 
 care for their father; they did not leave him without assistance, they 
 left the <I>hired servants</I> with him. Grotius thinks it is mentioned 
 as an evidence that their calling was gainful to them, for it was worth 
 while to keep servants in pay, to help them in it, and their 
 <I>hands</I> would be much <I>missed,</I> and yet they <I>left 
 it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is a particular account of his preaching in Capernaum, one of 
 the <I>cities</I> of Galilee; for though John Baptist chose to preach 
 <I>in a wilderness,</I> and did <I>well,</I> and did <I>good,</I> yet 
 it doth not therefore follow, that Jesus must do so too; the 
 inclinations and opportunities of ministers may very much differ, and 
 yet both be in the <I>way of their duty,</I> and both useful. Observe, 
 
 1. When Christ <I>came into Capernaum,</I> he <I>straightway</I>
 applied himself to his work there, and took the <I>first</I> 
 opportunity of preaching the gospel. Those will think themselves 
 concerned not to <I>lose time,</I> who consider what a deal of work 
 they have to do, and what a little time to do it in. 

 2. Christ religiously observed the sabbath day, though not by tying
 himself up to the tradition of the elders, in all the niceties of the 
 <I>sabbath-rest,</I> yet (which was far better) by applying himself to, 
 and abounding in, the <I>sabbath-work,</I> in order to which the 
 sabbath-rest was instituted. 

 3. Sabbaths are to be sanctified in <I>religious assemblies,</I> if we
 have opportunity; it is a <I>holy day,</I> and must be honoured with a 
 <I>holy convocation;</I> this was the <I>good old way,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:27,15:21">Acts xiii. 27; xv. 21</A>.

 On the sabbath-day, <B><I>pois sabbasin</I></B>--<I>on the
 sabbath-days;</I> every sabbath-day, as duly as it returned, he <I>went 
 into the synagogue.</I> 

 4. In <I>religious assemblies</I> on sabbath-days, the gospel is to be
 preached, and those to be <I>taught,</I> who are willing to learn the 
 <I>truth as it is in Jesus.</I> 

 5. Christ was a non-such preacher; he did not preach <I>as the
 scribes,</I> who expounded the law of Moses by rote, as a school-boy 
 says his lesson, but were neither <I>acquainted </I> with it (Paul 
 himself, when a Pharisee, was ignorant of the law), nor <I>affected</I> 
 with it; it came not <I>from the heart,</I> and therefore came not 
 <I>with authority.</I> But Christ taught <I>as one that had 
 authority,</I> as one that knew the mind of God, and was commissioned 
 to declare it. 

 6. There is much in the doctrine of Christ, that is <I>astonishing;</I>
 the more we hear it, the more cause we shall see to <I>admire 
 it.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean
 spirit; and he cried out,
 &nbsp; 24  Saying, Let <I>us</I> alone; what have we to do with thee, thou
 Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who
 thou art, the Holy One of God.
 &nbsp; 25  And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out

 &nbsp; 26  And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a
 loud voice, he came out of him.

 among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine

 spirits, and they do obey him.
 &nbsp; 28  And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the
 region round about Galilee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As soon as Christ began to preach, he began to work miracles for the 
 confirmation of his doctrine; and they were such as intimated the 
 design and tendency of his doctrine, which were to conquer Satan, and 
 cure sick souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's <I>casting the devil</I> out of a man that was possessed, 
 in the synagogue at Capernaum. This passage was not related in Matthew, 
 but is afterward in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:33">Luke iv. 33</A>.

 <I>There was in the synagogue a man with an unclean spirit,</I>
 <B><I>en pneumati akatharto</I></B>--<I>in an unclean spirit;</I> for 
 the spirit had the man in his possession, and led him captive at his 
 will. So the whole world is said to lie <B><I>en to 
 ponero</I></B>--<I>in the wicked one.</I> And some have thought it more 
 proper to say, The <I>body</I> is <I>in the soul,</I> because it is 
 governed by it, than the soul <I>in the body.</I> He was <I>in the 
 unclean</I> spirit, as a man is said to be <I>in a fever,</I> or in a 
 frenzy, quite overcome by it. Observe, The devil is here called <I>an 
 unclean spirit,</I> because he has lost all the purity of his nature, 
 because he acts in direct opposition to the <I>Holy</I> Spirit of God, 
 and because with his suggestions he pollutes the spirits of men. This 
 man <I>was in the synagogue;</I> he did not come either to be taught or 
 to be healed, but, as some think, to confront Christ and oppose him, 
 and hinder people from believing on him. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The rage which the unclean spirit expressed at Christ; <I>He cried 
 out,</I> as one in an agony, at the presence of Christ, and afraid of 
 being dislodged; thus the <I>devils believe and tremble,</I> have a 
 horror of Christ, but no hope in him, nor reverence for him. We are 
 told what he said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>,

 where he doth not go about to <I>capitulate</I> with him, or <I>make 
 terms</I> (so far was he from being in league or compact with him), but 
 speaks as one that knew his doom.

 (1.) He calls him <I>Jesus of Nazareth;</I> for aught that appears, he 
 was the first that called him so, and he did it with design to possess 
 the minds of the people with <I>low thoughts</I> of him, because no 
 good thing was expected out of Nazareth; and with <I>prejudices</I> 
 against him as a Deceiver, because every body knew the Messiah must be 
 of Bethlehem. 

 (2.) Yet a confession is extorted from him--that he is <I>the holy One 
 of God,</I> as was from the damsel that had the spirit of divination 
 concerning the apostles--that they were the <I>servants of the most 
 high God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:16,17">Acts xvi. 16, 17</A>.

 Those who have only a <I>notion</I> of Christ--that he is the <I>holy
 One of God,</I> and have no faith in him, or love to him, go no further 
 than the devil doth.

 (3.) He in effect acknowledgeth that Christ was too hard for him, and 
 that he could not stand before the power of Christ; "<I>Let us 
 alone;</I> for if thou take us to task, we are undone, thou canst 
 <I>destroy us.</I>" This is the misery of those wicked spirits, that 
 they persist in their rebellion, and yet know it will end in their 
 destruction. 

 (4.) He desires to have <I>nothing to do</I> with Jesus Christ; for he 
 <I>despairs</I> of being <I>saved</I> by him, and <I>dreads</I> being 
 <I>destroyed</I> by him. "<I>What have we to do with thee?</I> If thou 
 wilt let us alone, we will let thee alone." See whose language they 
 speak, that <I>say to the Almighty, Depart from us.</I> This, being an 
 <I>unclean spirit,</I> therefore hated and dreaded Christ, because he 
 knew him to be a <I>holy One;</I> for the <I>carnal mind is enmity 
 against God,</I> especially against <I>his holiness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The victory which Jesus Christ obtained over the unclean spirit; 
 <I>for this purpose was the Son of God manifested, that he might 
 destroy the works of the devil,</I> and so he makes it to appear; nor 
 will he be turned back from prosecuting this war, either by his 
 flatteries or by his menaces. It is in vain for Satan to beg and pray, 
 <I>Let us alone;</I> his power must be broken, and the poor man must be 
 relieved; and therefore, 

 (1.) Jesus <I>commands.</I> As he taught, so he healed, <I>with 
 authority.</I> Jesus <I>rebuked him;</I> he chid him and threatened 
 him, imposed silence upon him; <I>Hold thy peace;</I> 
 <B><I>phimotheti</I></B>--<I>be muzzled.</I> Christ has a muzzle for 
 that unclean spirit when he <I>fawns</I> as well as when he 
 <I>barks;</I> such acknowledgments of him as this was, Christ 
 <I>disdains,</I> so far is he from <I>accepting</I> them. Some confess 
 Christ to be the <I>holy One of God,</I> that under the cloak of that 
 profession they may carry on malicious mischievous designs; but their 
 confession is doubly an abomination to the Lord Jesus, as it sues in 
 his name for a license to sin, and shall therefore be put to silence 
 and shame. But this is not all, he must not only <I>hold his peace,</I> 
 but he must <I>come out of the man;</I> this was it he dreaded--his 
 being restrained from doing further mischief. But, 

 (2.) The unclean spirit <I>yields,</I> for there is no remedy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);
 
 He <I>tore him,</I> put him into a <I>strong convulsion;</I> that one 
 could have thought he had been pulled in pieces; when he would not 
 <I>touch</I> Christ, in fury at him he grievously disturbed this poor 
 creature. Thus, when Christ by his grace delivers poor souls out of
 the hands of Satan, it is not without a grievous toss and tumult in the 
 soul; for that spiteful enemy will <I>disquiet</I> those whom he cannot 
 <I>destroy.</I> He <I>cried with a loud voice,</I> to frighten the 
 spectators, and make himself seem terrible, as if he would have it 
 thought that though he was conquered, he was but just conquered, and 
 that he hopes to rally again, and recover his ground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The impression which this miracle made upon the minds of the 
 people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It astonished them that saw it; <I>They were all amazed.</I> It was 
 evident, beyond contradiction, that the man was possessed--witness the
 tearing of him, and the <I>loud voice</I> with which the <I>spirit 
 cried;</I> it was evident that he was <I>forced out</I> by the 
 authority of Christ; this was surprising to them, and put them upon 
 considering with themselves, and enquiring of one another, "<I>What is 
 this new doctrine?</I> For it must certainly be of God, which is thus 
 confirmed. <I>He</I> hath certainly an authority to command us, who 
 hath ability to <I>command even the unclean spirits,</I> and they 
 cannot resist him, but are forced <I>to obey him.</I>" The Jewish 
 exorcists pretended by charm or invocation to drive away evil spirits; 
 but this was quite another thing, <I>with authority he commands 
 them.</I> Surely it is our interest to make <I>him</I> our Friend, who 
 has the control of infernal spirits.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It raised his reputation among all that heard it; <I>Immediately his 
 fame spread abroad into the whole adjacent region of Galilee,</I> which 
 was a third part of the land of Canaan. The story was presently got 
 into every one's mouth, and people wrote it to their friends all the 
 country over, together with the remark made upon it, <I>What new 
 doctrine is this?</I> So that it was universally concluded, that he was 
 a <I>Teacher come from God,</I> and under that character he shone more 
 bright than if he had appeared in all the external pomp and power which 
 the Jews expected their Messiah to <I>appear</I> in; and thus he 
 <I>prepared his own way,</I> now that John, who was his harbinger, was 
 clapped up; and the fame of this miracle spread the further, because as 
 yet the Pharisees, who <I>envied</I> his fame, and laboured to 
 <I>eclipse</I> it, had not advanced their blasphemous suggestion, that 
 he <I>cast out devils</I> by compact with the <I>prince of the 
 devils.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue,
 they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and
 John.
 &nbsp; 30  But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they
 tell him of her.
 &nbsp; 31  And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
 immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.

 that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.
 &nbsp; 33  And all the city was gathered together at the door.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A particular account of one miracle that Christ wrought, in the cure 
 of Peter's wife's mother, who was ill of a fever. This passage we had 
 before, in Matthew. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When Christ had done that which <I>spread his fame</I> throughout 
 all parts, he did not then sit still, as some think that they may 
 <I>lie in bed</I> when their <I>name is up.</I> No, he continued to 
 <I>do good,</I> for that was it he aimed at, and not his own honour. 
 Nay, those who are in reputation, had need be busy and careful to keep 
 it up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When he <I>came out of the synagogue,</I> where he had taught and 
 healed with a divine authority, yet he conversed familiarly with the 
 poor fishermen that attended him, and did not think it below him. Let 
 the same mind, the same lowly mind, be in us, that was in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He went into Peter's house, probably invited thither to such 
 entertainment as a poor fisherman could give him, and he accepted of 
 it. The apostles left all for Christ; so far as that what they had 
 should not hinder them from him, yet not so, but that they might use it 
 for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He cured his mother-in-law, who was sick. Wherever Christ comes, he 
 comes to do good, and will be sure to pay richly for his entertainment. 
 Observe, How complete the cure was; when <I>the fever left her,</I> it 
 did not, as usual, leave her <I>weak,</I> but the same hand that 
 <I>healed</I> her, <I>strengthened</I> her, so that she was able to 
 <I>minister</I> to them; the cure is in order to that, to fit for 
 action, that we may minister to Christ, and to those that are 
 <I>his</I> for his sake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A general account of many cures he wrought--diseases healed, devils
 expelled. It was on the <I>evening of the sabbath,</I> when the <I>sun 
 did set,</I> or <I>was set;</I> perhaps many scrupled bringing their 
 sick to him, till the sabbath was over, but their weakness therein was 
 no prejudice to them in applying to Christ. Though he proved it 
 <I>lawful to heal on the sabbath days,</I> yet, if any stumbled at it, 
 they were welcome at another time. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How <I>numerous</I> the patients were; <I>All the city was gathered 
 at the door,</I> as beggars for a dole. That <I>one cure</I> in the 
 synagogue occasioned this crowding after him. Others speeding well with 
 Christ should quicken us in our enquiries after him. Now the <I>Sun of 
 righteousness rises with healing under his wings;</I> to him shall the 
 <I>gathering of the people be.</I> Observe, How Christ was flocked 
 after in a <I>private house,</I> as well as in the <I>synagogue;</I> 
 wherever he is, there let his servants, his patients, be. And in the 
 <I>evening of the sabbath,</I> when the public worship is over, we must 
 continue our attendance upon Jesus Christ; he healed, as Paul preached, 
 publicly, and from house to house.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How <I>powerful</I> the Physician was; he <I>healed all</I> that 
 were brought to him, though ever so many. Nor was it some one 
 particular disease, that Christ set up for the cure of, but he healed 
 those that were <I>sick of divers</I> diseases, for his word was a 
 <I>panpharmacon--a salve for every sore.</I> And that miracle
 particularly which he wrought in the synagogue, he <I>repeated in the 
 house</I> at night; for he <I>cast out many devils,</I> and <I>suffered 
 not the devils to speak,</I> for he made them <I>know who he was,</I> 
 and that silenced them. Or, He <I>suffered them not to say that they 
 knew him</I> (so it may be read); he would not permit any more of them 
 to say, as they did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 
 <I>I know thee, who thou art.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His <I>retirement</I> to his <I>private devotion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);
 
 <I>He prayed,</I> prayed alone; to set us an example of secret prayer. 
 Though as God he was <I>prayed to,</I> as man he <I>prayed.</I> Though 
 he was glorifying God, and doing good, in his public work, yet he found 
 time to be alone with his Father; and thus <I>it became him to fulfil 
 all righteousness.</I> Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The time <I>when</I> Christ prayed. 

 (1.) It was <I>in the morning,</I> the morning after the <I>sabbath 
 day.</I> Note, When a sabbath day is over and past, we must not think 
 that we may intermit our devotion till the next sabbath: no, though we 
 go not <I>to the synagogue,</I> we must go to the <I>throne of 
 grace,</I> every day in the week; and the morning after the sabbath 
 particularly, that we may preserve the good impressions of the day. 
 This <I>morning</I> was the morning of the <I>first day of the 
 week,</I> which afterward he sanctified, and made remarkable, by 
 another sort of <I>rising early.</I> 

 (2.) It was early, <I>a great while before day.</I> When others were 
 asleep in their beds, he was <I>praying,</I> as a genuine Son of David, 
 who seeks God <I>early,</I> and <I>directs his prayer in the 
 morning;</I> nay, and <I>at midnight will rise to give thanks.</I> It 
 has been said, <I>The morning is a friend to the Muses--Aurora Musis 
 amica;</I> and it is no less so to the <I>Graces.</I> When our spirits 
 are most fresh and lively, then we should take time for <I>devout</I> 
 exercises. He that is the <I>first</I> and <I>best,</I> ought to have 
 the <I>first</I> and <I>best.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The place <I>where</I> he prayed; He <I>departed into a solitary 
 place,</I> either out of town, or some remote garden or out-building. 
 Though he was in no danger of distraction, or of temptation to 
 vain-glory, yet he retired, to set us an example to his own rule, 
 <I>When thou prayest enter into thy closet.</I> Secret prayer must be 
 made secretly. Those that have the most business in public, and of the 
 best kind, must sometimes be <I>alone with God;</I> must retire into 
 <I>solitude,</I> there to converse with God, and keep up communion with 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His <I>return</I> to his <I>public</I> work. The disciples thought 
 they were <I>up early,</I> but found their Master was up <I>before 
 them,</I> and they enquired which way he went, <I>followed him</I> to 
 his <I>solitary place,</I> and there <I>found him</I> at prayer, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>.

 They told him that he was much wanted, that there were a great many 
 patients waiting for him; <I>All men seek for thee.</I> They were proud 
 that their Master was become so popular already, and would have him 
 appear <I>in public,</I> yet more in that place, because it was 
 <I>their own city;</I> and we are apt to be partial to the places we 
 know and are interested in. "No," saith Christ, "Capernaum must not 
 have the monopoly of the Messiah's preaching and miracles. <I>Let us go 
 into the next towns,</I> the <I>villages</I> that lie about here, 
 <I>that I may preach there also,</I> and work miracles there, <I>for 
 therefore came I forth,</I> not to be constantly resident in one place, 
 but to <I>go about doing good.</I>" Even the <I>inhabitants of the 
 villages in Israel</I> shall <I>rehearse the righteous acts of the 
 Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:11">Judg. v. 11</A>.

 Observe, Christ had still an eye to the end <I>wherefore he came 
 forth,</I> and closely pursued that; nor will he be drawn by 
 importunity, or the persuasions of his friends, to decline from that; 
 for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>)

 he <I>preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee,</I> and, to
 illustrate and confirm his doctrine, <I>he cast out devils.</I> Note, 
 Christ's doctrine is Satan's destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>40  And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling
 down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make
 me clean.
 &nbsp; 41  And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth <I>his</I> hand, and
 touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.
 &nbsp; 42  And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy
 departed from him, and he was cleansed.
 &nbsp; 43  And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;
 &nbsp; 44  And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go
 thy way, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing
 those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
 &nbsp; 45  But he went out, and began to publish <I>it</I> much, and to
 blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly
 enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they
 came to him from every quarter.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of Christ's <I>cleansing a leper,</I> which we 
 had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:2-4">Matt. viii. 2-4</A>.
 
 It teaches us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>How to apply ourselves to Christ;</I> come as this leper did, 
 
 (1.) With great <I>humility;</I> this leper came <I>beseeching him, and 
 kneeling down to him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>);

 whether giving divine honour to him as God, or rather a less degree of 
 respect as a <I>great Prophet,</I> it teaches us that those who would 
 receive grace and mercy from Christ, must ascribe honour and glory to 
 Christ, and approach to him with humility and reverence. 

 (2.) With a firm belief of <I>his power; Thou canst make me clean.</I> 
 Though Christ's outward appearance was but <I>mean,</I> yet he had this 
 faith in his power, which implies his belief that he was <I>sent of 
 God.</I> He believes it with application, not only in general, <I>Thou 
 cast do every thing</I> (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:22">John xi. 22</A>),

 but, <I>Thou cast make me clean.</I> Note, What we believe of the power 
 of Christ we must bring home to our particular case; <I>Thou canst do 
 this for me.</I> 

 (3.) With submission to the will of Christ; <I>Lord, if thou wilt.</I> 
 Not as if he had any doubt of Christ's readiness in general to help the 
 distressed, but, with the modesty that became a poor petitioner, he 
 refers his own particular case to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>What to expect from Christ;</I> that according to our faith it 
 shall be to us. His address is not in the form of prayer, yet Christ 
 answered it as a request. Note, Affectionate professions of faith in 
 Christ, and resignations to him, are the most prevailing petitions for 
 mercy from him, and shall speed accordingly. 

 (1.) Christ was <I>moved with compassion.</I> This is added here, in 
 Mark, to show that Christ's power is employed by his pity for the 
 relief of poor souls; that his reasons are fetched from within himself, 
 and we have nothing in us to recommend us to his favour, but our 
 <I>misery</I> makes us the objects of his <I>mercy.</I> And what he 
 does for us he does with all possible tenderness. 

 (2.) He <I>put forth his hand, and touched him.</I> He <I>exerted</I> 
 his power, and directed it to <I>this</I> creature. In healing souls, 
 Christ <I>toucheth them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:26">1 Sam. x. 26</A>.

 When the queen toucheth for the evil, she saith, <I>I touch, God
 heals;</I> but Christ <I>toucheth and healeth too.</I>

 (3.) He said, <I>I will, be thou clean.</I> Christ's power was put 
 forth in and by a <I>word,</I> to signify in what way Christ would 
 ordinarily work spiritual cures; <I>He sends his word and heals,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:20,Joh+15:3,17:17">Ps. cvii. 20; 
 John xv. 3; xvii. 17</A>.

 The poor leper put an <I>if</I> upon the will of Christ; <I>If thou
 wilt;</I> but that <I>doubt</I> is soon put <I>out of doubt; I 
 will.</I> Christ most readily <I>wills</I> favours to those that most 
 readily <I>refer themselves</I> to his will. He was confident of
 Christ's <I>power;</I> Thou <I>canst make me clean;</I> and Christ will 
 show how much his power is drawn out into act by the faith of his 
 people, and therefore speaks the word as one having authority, <I>Be 
 thou clean.</I> And power accompanied this word, and the cure was 
 perfect in an instant; <I>Immediately his leprosy</I> vanished, and 
 there remained no more sign of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>What to do when we have received mercy from Christ.</I> We must 
 with his favours receive his commands. When Christ had cured him, <I>he 
 strictly charged him;</I> the word here is very significant, 
 <B><I>embrimesamenos</B></I>--<I>graviter interminatus--prohibiting with
 threats.</I> I am apt to think that this refers not to the directions 
 he gave him to conceal it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>),

 for those are mentioned by themselves; but that this was such a charge 
 as he gave to the impotent man whom he cured, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:14">John v. 14</A>,

 <I>Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee;</I> for the
 <I>leprosy</I> was ordinarily the punishment of some particular 
 sinners, as in Miriam's, Gehazi's, and Uzziah's, case; now, when Christ 
 healed him, he <I>warned</I> him, he <I>threatened</I> him with the 
 fatal consequence of it if he should <I>return to sin</I> again. He 
 also appointed him,

 (1.) To <I>show himself to the priest,</I> that the priest by his own 
 judgment of this leper might be a witness for Christ, that he was the 
 Messiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:5">Matt. xi. 5</A>.

 (2.) Till he had done that, not to <I>say any thing</I> of it <I>to any
 man:</I> this is an instance of the <I>humility</I> of Christ and his 
 self-denial, that he did not seek his own honour, <I>did not strive or 
 cry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:2">Isa. xlii. 2</A>.

 And it is an example to us, not to <I>seek our own glory,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:27">Prov. xxv. 27</A>.

 He must not <I>proclaim</I> it, because that would much increase the 
 crowd that followed Christ, which he thought was too great already; not 
 as if he were unwilling to <I>do good to all,</I> to as many as came; 
 but he would do it with as little <I>noise</I> as might be, would have 
 no offence given to the government, no disturbance of the public peace, 
 not any thing done that looked like ostentation, or an affecting of 
 popular applause. What to think of the leper's <I>publishing</I> it, 
 and <I>blazing it abroad,</I> I know not; the concealment of the good 
 characters and good works of good men better become <I>them</I> than 
 <I>their friends;</I> nor are we always bound by the modest commands of 
 humble men. The leper ought to have observed his orders; yet, no doubt, 
 it was with a good design that he <I>proclaimed</I> the cure, and it 
 had no other ill effect than that it increased the multitudes which 
 followed Christ, to that degree, that he <I>could no more openly enter 
 into the city;</I> not upon the account of persecution (there was no 
 danger of that yet,) but because the crowd was so great, that the 
 streets would not hold them, which obliged him to go into <I>desert 
 places,</I> to a <I>mountain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:13"><I>ch.</I> iii. 13</A>),
 
 to the <I>sea-side,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:1"><I>ch.</I> iv. 1</A>.

 This shows how <I>expedient</I> it was for us, that Christ should <I>go
 away,</I> and <I>send the Comforter,</I> for his bodily presence could 
 be but in one place at a time; and those that <I>came to him from every 
 quarter,</I> could not get <I>near him;</I> but by his spiritual 
 presence he is with his people wherever they are, and comes to them to 
 <I>every quarter.</I></P>
