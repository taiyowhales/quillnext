 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The parable of the importunate widow, designed to teach us fervency
 in prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. The parable of the Pharisee and publican, designed to teach us
 humility, and humiliation for sin, in prayer,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And he spake a parable unto them <I>to this end,</I> that men
 ought always to pray, and not to faint;
 &nbsp; 2 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God,
 neither regarded man:
 &nbsp; 3 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him,
 saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
 &nbsp; 4 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within
 himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
 &nbsp; 5 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest
 by her continual coming she weary me.
 &nbsp; 6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
 &nbsp; 7 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and
 night unto him, though he bear long with them?
 &nbsp; 8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless
 when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This parable has its key hanging at the door; the drift and design of 
 it are <I>prefixed.</I> Christ spoke it with this intent, to teach us 
 that <I>men ought always to pray and not to faint,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It supposes that all God's people are <I>praying</I> people; all God's
 children keep up both a <I>constant</I> and an <I>occasional</I> 
 correspondence with him, send to him <I>statedly,</I> and upon <I>every 
 emergency.</I> It is our privilege and honour that we <I>may</I> pray.
 It is our duty; we <I>ought to pray,</I> we sin if we neglect it. It is 
 to be our constant work; we ought <I>always</I> to pray, it is that 
 which <I>the duty of every day requires.</I> We must pray, and never 
 grow weary of praying, nor think of leaving it off till it comes to be 
 swallowed up in everlasting praise. But that which seems particularly 
 designed here is to teach us constancy and perseverance in our requests 
 for some spiritual mercies that we are in pursuit of, relating either 
 to ourselves or to the church of God. When we are praying for strength 
 against our spiritual enemies, our lusts and corruptions, which are our 
 worst enemies, we must continue instant in prayer, must pray and <I>not 
 faint,</I> for we shall not <I>seek God's face in vain.</I> So we must 
 likewise in our prayers for the deliverance of the people of God out of 
 the hands of their persecutors and oppressors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ shows, by a parable, the <I>power of importunity</I> among 
 men, who will be swayed by that, when nothing else will influence, to 
 do what is just and right. He gives you an instance of an honest cause 
 that succeeded before an unjust judge, not by the equity or 
 compassionableness of it, but purely by <I>dint of importunity.</I> 
 Observe here, 

 1. The bad character of the judge that was in a certain city. He
 <I>neither feared God nor regarded man;</I> he had no manner of concern 
 either for his conscience or for his reputation; he stood in no awe 
 either of the wrath of God against him or of the censures of men 
 concerning him: or, he took no care to do his duty either to God or 
 man; he was a perfect stranger both to godliness and honour, and had no 
 notion of either. It is not strange if those that have cast off the 
 fear of their Creator be altogether regardless of their 
 fellow-creatures; where no <I>fear of God</I> is no good is to be 
 expected. Such a prevalency of irreligion and inhumanity is bad in any, 
 but very bad in a <I>judge,</I> who has power in his hand, in the use 
 of which he ought to be guided by the principles of religion and 
 justice, and, if he be not, instead of doing good with his power he 
 will be in danger of doing hurt. <I>Wickedness in the place of
 judgment</I> was one of the sorest evils Solomon saw under the sun, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16">Eccl. iii. 16</A>.

 2. The distressed case of a poor widow that was necessitated to make
 her appeal to him, being wronged by some one that thought to bear her 
 down with power and terror. She had manifestly right on her side; but, 
 it should seem, in soliciting to have right done her, she tied not 
 herself to the formalities of the law, but made personal application to 
 the judge from day to day at his own house, still crying, <I>Avenge me 
 of mine adversary;</I> that is, <I>Do me justice against mine 
 adversary;</I> not that she desired to be revenged on him for any thing 
 he had done against her, but that he might be obliged to restore what 
 effects he had of hers in his hands, and might be disabled any more to 
 oppress her. Note, Poor widows have often many adversaries, who 
 barbarously take advantage of their weak and helpless state to invade 
 their rights, and defraud them of what little they have; and 
 magistrates are particularly charged, not only not to do <I>violence to 
 the widow</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+21:3">Jer. xxi. 3</A>),

 but to <I>judge the fatherless,</I> and <I>plead for the widow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:17">Isa. i. 17</A>),

 to be their patrons and protectors; then they are <I>as gods,</I> for 
 God is so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:5">Ps. lxviii. 5</A>.

 3. The difficulty and discouragement she met with in her cause: <I>He 
 would not for awhile.</I> According to his usual practice, he frowned 
 upon her, took no notice of her cause, but connived at all the wrong 
 her adversary did her; for she had no bribe to give him, no great man 
 whom he stood in any awe of to speak for her, so that he did not at all 
 incline to redress her grievances; and he himself was conscience of the 
 reason of his dilatoriness, and could not but own within himself that 
 he <I>neither feared God nor regarded man.</I> It is sad that a man 
 should know so much amiss of himself, and be in no care to amend it. 

 4. The gaining of her point by continually <I>dunning</I> this unjust
 <I>judge</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Because this widow troubleth me,</I> gives me a continual toil, I
 will hear her cause, and do her justice; not so much lest by her 
 clamour against me she bring me into an ill name, as lest by her 
 clamour to me she weary me; for she is resolved that she will give me 
 no rest till it is done, and therefore I will do it, to save myself 
 further trouble; as good at first as at last." Thus she got justice 
 done her by continual craving; she begged it at his door, followed him 
 in the streets, solicited him in open court, and still her cry was, 
 <I>Avenge me of mine adversary,</I> which he was forced to do, to get 
 rid of her; for his conscience, bad as he was, would not suffer him to 
 send her to prison for an affront upon the court.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He applies this for the encouragement of God's praying people to 
 pray with faith and fervency, and to persevere therein.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He assures them that God will at length be gracious to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>Hear what the unjust judge saith,</I> how he owns himself quite 
 overcome by a constant importunity, <I>and shall not God avenge his own 
 elect?</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What it is that they desire and expect: that God would <I>avenge
 his own elect.</I> Note, 

 [1.] There are a people in the world that are God's people, his 
 <I>elect,</I> his <I>own elect,</I> a choice people, a chosen people. 
 And this he has an eye to in all he does for them; it is because they 
 are his <I>chosen,</I> and in pursuance of the choice he has made of 
 them.

 [2.] God's own elect meet with a great deal of trouble and opposition 
 in this world; there are <I>many adversaries</I> that fight against 
 them; Satan is their great adversary.

 [3.] That which is wanted and waited for is God's preserving and 
 protecting them, and the work of his hands in them; his securing the 
 interest of the church in the world and his grace in the heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What it is that is required of God's people in order to the 
 obtaining of this: they must <I>cry day and night to him;</I> not that 
 he needs their remonstrances, or can be moved by their pleadings, but 
 this he has made their duty, and to this he has promised mercy. We 
 ought to be particular in praying against our spiritual enemies, as St. 
 Paul was: <I>For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might 
 depart from me;</I> like this importunate widow. Lord, mortify 
 <I>this</I> corruption. Lord, arm me against <I>this</I> temptation.
 We ought to concern ourselves for the persecuted and oppressed 
 churches, and to pray that God would do them justice, and set them in 
 safety. And herein we must be very urgent; we must <I>cry</I> with 
 earnestness: we must <I>cry day and night,</I> as those that believe 
 prayer will be heard at last; we must <I>wrestle with God,</I> as those 
 that know how to value the blessing, and will have no nay. God's 
 praying people are told to <I>give him no rest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:6,7">Isa. lxii. 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What discouragements they may perhaps meet with in their prayers 
 and expectations. He may <I>bear long with them,</I> and may not 
 presently appear for them, in answer to their prayers. He is 
 <B><I>makrothymon ep autois</I></B>--he <I>exercises patience
 towards</I> the adversaries of his people, and does not take vengeance 
 on them; and he <I>exercises the patience of his people,</I> and does 
 not plead for them. He <I>bore long</I> with the <I>cry of the sin</I> 
 of the Egyptians that oppressed Israel, and with the <I>cry of the 
 sorrows</I> of those that were oppressed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) What assurance they have that mercy will come at last, though it 
 be delayed, and how it is supported by what the unjust judge saith: If 
 this widow prevail by being importunate, much more shall God's elect 
 prevail. For, 

 [1.] This widow was a <I>stranger,</I> nothing related to the judge; 
 but God's praying people are his own elect, whom he knows, and loves, 
 and delights in, and has always concerned himself for.

 [2.] She was but <I>one,</I> but the praying people of God are
 <I>many,</I> all of whom come to him on the same errand, and agree to
 ask what they need, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:19">Matt. xviii. 19</A>.

 As the saints of heaven surround the throne of glory with their united
 praises, so saints on earth besiege the throne of grace with their 
 united prayers.

 [3.] She came to a <I>judge</I> that bade her <I>keep her distance;</I> 
 we come to a <I>Father</I> that bids us <I>come boldly to</I> him, and 
 teaches us to cry, <I>Abba, Father.</I>

 [4.] She came to an <I>unjust judge;</I> we come to a <I>righteous 
 Father</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:25">John xvii. 25</A>),

 one that regards his own glory and the comforts of his poor creatures, 
 especially those in distress, as <I>widows</I> and <I>fatherless.</I> 
 
 [5.] She came to this judge purely upon her own account; but God is 
 himself engaged in the cause which we are soliciting; and we can say, 
 <I>Arise, O Lord, plead thine</I> own cause; and <I>what wilt thou do 
 to thy great name?</I> 

 [6.] She had no friend to speak for her, to add force to her petition, 
 and to use interest for her more than her own; but we have an 
 <I>Advocate with the Father,</I> his own Son, who <I>ever lives to make 
 intercession</I> for us, and has a powerful prevailing interest in 
 heaven.

 [7.] She had no promise off speeding, no, nor any encouragement given 
 her to ask; but we have the golden sceptre held out to us, are told to 
 ask, with a promise that it shall be given to us.

 [8.] She could have access to the judge only at some certain times; but 
 we may cry to God <I>day and night,</I> at all hours, and therefore may 
 the rather hope to prevail by importunity.

 [9.] Her importunity was provoking to the judge, and she might fear 
 lest it should set him more against her; but our importunity is 
 pleasing to God; the prayer of the upright is <I>his delight,</I> and 
 therefore, we may hope, shall avail much, if it be an effectual fervent 
 prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He intimates to them that, notwithstanding this, they will begin to 
 be weary of waiting for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Nevertheless,</I> though such assurances are given that God will 
 avenge his own elect, yet, <I>when the Son of man cometh, shall he find 
 faith on the earth?</I>" The Son of man will come to <I>avenge his own 
 elect,</I> to plead the cause of persecuted Christians against the 
 persecuting Jews; he will come in his providence to plead the cause of 
 his injured people in every age, and at the great day he will come 
 finally to determine the controversies of Zion. Now, when he comes, 
 will he find faith on the earth? The question implies a strong 
 negation: No, he will not; he himself foresees it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This supposes that it is <I>on earth</I> only that there is 
 occasion for <I>faith;</I> for sinners in hell are <I>feeling</I> that 
 which they would not believe, and saints in heaven are <I>enjoying</I> 
 that which they did believe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It supposes that <I>faith</I> is the great thing that Jesus Christ 
 <I>looks for.</I> He <I>looks down</I> upon the children of men, and 
 does not ask, Is there innocency? but, <I>Is there faith?</I> He 
 enquired concerning the faith of those who applied themselves to him 
 for cures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It supposes that if there were faith, though ever so little, he 
 would discover it, and <I>find it out.</I> His eye is upon the weakest 
 and most obscure believer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) It is foretold that, when Christ comes to plead his people's 
 cause, he will find but <I>little faith</I> in comparison with what one 
 might expect. That is, 

 [1.] In general, he will find but <I>few good people,</I> few that are 
 really and truly good. Many that have the form and fashion of 
 godliness, but few that have faith, that are sincere and honest: nay, 
 he will find little <I>fidelity</I> among men; the <I>faithful 
 fail,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:1,2">Ps. xii. 1, 2</A>.

 Even to the end of time there will still be occasion for the same 
 complaint. The world will grow no better, no, not when it is drawing 
 towards its period. Bad it is, and bad it will be, and worst of all 
 just before Christ's coming; the last times will be the most perilous. 
 
 [2.] In particular, he will find few that have <I>faith</I> concerning 
 his coming. When he comes to <I>avenge his own elect</I> he looks if 
 there be any faith <I>to help</I> and <I>to uphold,</I> and wonders 
 that there is none,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:16,63:5">Isa. lix. 16; lxiii. 5</A>.

 It intimates that Christ, both in his particular comings for the relief
 of his people, and in his general coming at the end of time, may, and 
 will, delay his coming so long as that, <I>First,</I> Wicked people 
 will begin to <I>defy it,</I> and to say, <I>Where is the promise of 
 his coming?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:4">2 Pet. iii. 4</A>.

 They will challenge him to come

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:10,Am+5:19">Isa. v. 10; Amos v. 19</A>);

 and his delay will harden them in their wickedness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:48">Matt. xxiv. 48</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Even his own people will begin to <I>despair</I> of
 it, and to conclude he will never come, because he has passed their 
 reckoning. God's time to appear for his people is when things are 
 brought to the last extremity, and when Zion begins to say, <I>The Lord 
 has forsaken me.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:14,Isa+40:27">Isa. xlix. 14; xl. 27</A>.

 But this is our comfort, that, when the time appointed comes, it will
 appear that the unbelief of man has not made the promise of God of no 
 effect.</P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in
 themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
 &nbsp; 10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee,
 and the other a publican.
 &nbsp; 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I
 thank thee, that I am not as other men <I>are,</I> extortioners,
 unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
 &nbsp; 12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I
 possess.
 &nbsp; 13 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so
 much as <I>his</I> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast,
 saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.
 &nbsp; 14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified
 <I>rather</I> than the other: for every one that exalteth himself
 shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of this parable likewise is prefixed to it, and we are told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 who they were whom it was levelled at, and for whom it was calculated. 
 He designed it for the conviction of some who <I>trusted in themselves 
 that they were righteous, and despised others.</I> They were such as 
 had, 

 1. A great conceit of themselves, and of their own goodness; they
 thought themselves as holy as they needed to be, and holier than all 
 their neighbours, and such as might serve for examples to them all. But 
 that was not all; 

 2. They had a confidence in themselves before God, and not only had a
 high opinion of their own righteousness, but depended upon the merit of 
 it, whenever they addressed God, as their plea: They <I>trusted in 
 themselves as being righteous;</I> they thought they had made God their 
 debtor, and might demand any thing from him; and, 

 3. They despised others, and looked upon them with contempt, as not
 worthy to be compared with them. Now Christ by this parable would show 
 such their folly, and that thereby they shut themselves out from 
 acceptance with God. This is called a <I>parable,</I> though there be 
 nothing of similitude in it; but it is rather a description of the 
 different temper and language of those that <I>proudly justify 
 themselves,</I> and those that <I>humbly condemn themselves;</I> and 
 their different standing before God. It is matter of fact every 
 day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here are both these addressing themselves to the duty of prayer at 
 the same place and time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Two men went up into the temple</I> (for the temple stood upon a
 hill) <I>to pray.</I> It was not the hour of public prayer, but they 
 went thither to offer up their personal devotions, as was usual with 
 good people at that time, when the temple was not only the 
 <I>place,</I> but the <I>medium</I> of worship, and God had promised, 
 in answer to Solomon's request, that, whatever prayer was made in a 
 right manner <I>in</I> or <I>towards</I> that house, it should 
 <I>therefore</I> the rather be accepted. Christ is our temple, and to 
 him we must have an eye in all our approaches to God. The 
 <I>Pharisees</I> and the <I>publican</I> both went to <I>the temple to 
 pray.</I> Note, Among the worshippers of God, in the visible church, 
 there is a mixture of good and bad, of some that are accepted of God, 
 and some that are not; and so it has been ever since Cain and Abel 
 brought their offering to the same altar. The Pharisee, proud as he
 was, could not think himself above prayer; nor could the publican, 
 humble as he was, think himself shut out from the benefit of it; but we 
 have reason to think that these went with different views. 

 1. The Pharisee went <I>to the temple</I> to pray because it was a
 <I>public</I> place, more public than the corners of the streets, and 
 therefore he should have many eyes upon him, who would applaud his 
 devotion, which perhaps was more than was expected. The character 
 Christ gave of the Pharisees, that <I>all their works they did to be 
 seen of men,</I> gives us occasion for this suspicion. Note, Hypocrites 
 keep up the external performances of religion only to <I>save</I> or 
 <I>gain</I> credit. There are many whom we see <I>every day</I> at the 
 temple, whom, it is to be feared, we shall not see in the great day at 
 Christ's right hand. 

 2. The publican went to the temple because it was appointed to be a
 <I>house of prayer for all people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:7">Isa. lvi. 7</A>.

 The Pharisee came to the temple upon a <I>compliment,</I> the publican
 upon business; the Pharisee to make his appearance, the publican to 
 make his request. Now God sees with what disposition and design we come 
 to wait upon him in holy ordinances, and will judge of us 
 accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the Pharisee's address to God (for a prayer I cannot call 
 it): He <I>stood</I> and <I>prayed thus with himself</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):
 
 <I>standing by himself, he prayed thus,</I> so some read it; he was 
 wholly intent upon himself, had nothing in his eye but <I>self,</I> his 
 own praise, and not God's glory; or, standing in some conspicuous 
 place, where he distinguished himself; or, <I>setting himself</I> with 
 a great deal of state and formality, he prayed thus. Now that which he 
 is here supposed to say is that which shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he <I>trusted to himself that he was righteous.</I> A great 
 many good things he said of himself, which we will suppose to be true. 
 He was free from gross and scandalous sins; he was not an 
 <I>extortioner,</I> not a usurer, not oppressive to debtors or tenants, 
 but fair and kind to all that had dependence upon him. He was not 
 <I>unjust</I> in any of his dealings; he did no man any wrong; he could 
 say, as Samuel, <I>Whose ox or whose ass have I taken?</I> He was <I>no 
 adulterer,</I> but had possessed his vessel in sanctification and 
 honour. Yet this was not all; he <I>fasted twice in the week,</I> as an 
 act partly of temperature, partly of devotion. The Pharisees and their 
 disciples fasted twice a week, Monday and Thursday. Thus he glorified 
 God with his body: yet that was not all; he <I>gave tithes of all that 
 he possessed,</I> according to the law, and so glorified God with his 
 worldly estate. Now all this was very well and commendable. Miserable 
 is the condition of those who come short of the righteousness of this 
 Pharisee: yet he was not accepted; and why was he not? 

 (1.) His giving God thanks for this, though in itself a good thing, yet 
 seems to be a mere formality. He does not say, <I>By the grace of God I 
 am what I am,</I> as Paul did, but turns it off with a slight, <I>God, 
 I thank thee,</I> which is intended but for a plausible introduction to 
 a proud vainglorious ostentation of himself. 

 (2.) He makes his boast of this, and dwells with delight upon this 
 subject, as if all his business to the temple was to tell God Almighty 
 how very good he was; and he is ready to say, with those hypocrites 
 that we read of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:3">Isa. lviii. 3</A>),

 <I>Wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest not?</I> 

 (3.) He <I>trusted</I> to it as a righteousness, and not only mentioned 
 it, but pleaded it, as if hereby he had merited at the hands of God, 
 and made him his debtor. 

 (4.) Here is not one word of prayer in all he saith. He went <I>up to 
 the temple to pray,</I> but forgot his errand, was so full of himself 
 and his own goodness that he thought he had need of nothing, no, not of 
 the favour and grace of God, which, it would seem, he did not think 
 worth asking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he <I>despised others.</I> 

 (1.) He thought meanly of all mankind but himself: <I>I thank thee that 
 I am not as other men are.</I> He speaks indefinitely, as if he were 
 better than any. We may have reason to thank God that we are not as 
 <I>some men</I> are, that are notoriously wicked and vile; but to speak 
 at random thus, as if <I>we</I> only were good, and all besides us were 
 reprobates, is to judge by wholesale. 

 (2.) He thought meanly in a particular manner of this publican, whom he 
 had left behind, it is probable, in the court of the Gentiles, and 
 whose company he had fallen into as he came to the temple. He knew that 
 he was a publican, and therefore very uncharitably concluded that he 
 was an <I>extortioner, unjust,</I> and all that is naught. Suppose it 
 had been so, and he had known it, what business had he to take notice 
 of it? Could not he <I>say his prayers</I> (and that was all that the 
 Pharisees did) without reproaching his neighbours? Or was this a part 
 of his <I>God, I thank thee?</I> And was he as much pleased with the 
 publican's badness as with his own goodness? There could not be a 
 plainer evidence, not only of the want of humility and charity, but of 
 reigning pride and malice, than this was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the publican's address to God, which was the reverse of 
 the Pharisee's, as full of <I>humility</I> and <I>humiliation</I> as 
 his was of <I>pride</I> and <I>ostentation;</I> as full of 
 <I>repentance</I> for sin, and <I>desire</I> towards God, as his was of 
 <I>confidence</I> in <I>himself</I> and his own righteousness and 
 sufficiency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He expressed his repentance and humility in <I>what he did;</I> and 
 his gesture, when he addressed himself to his devotions, was 
 <I>expressive</I> of great seriousness and humility, and the proper 
 clothing of a broken, penitent, and obedient heart.

 (1.) He <I>stood afar off.</I> The Pharisee <I>stood,</I> but crowded 
 up as high as he could, to the upper end of the court; the publican 
 <I>kept at a distance</I> under a sense of his unworthiness to draw 
 near to God, and perhaps for fear of offending the Pharisee, whom he 
 observed to look scornfully upon him, and of disturbing his devotions. 
 Hereby he owned that God might justly <I>behold him afar off,</I> and 
 send him into a state of eternal distance from him, and that it was a 
 great favour that God was pleased to admit him <I>thus nigh.</I> 

 (2.) He <I>would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven,</I> much
 less his <I>hands,</I> as was usual in prayer. He did <I>lift up his 
 heart</I> to God in the heavens, in <I>holy desires,</I> but, through 
 prevailing shame and humiliation, he did not lift up his eyes in 
 <I>holy confidence</I> and <I>courage.</I> His <I>iniquities</I> are 
 <I>gone over his head, as a heavy burden,</I> so that he is <I>not able 
 to look up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:12">Ps. xl. 12</A>.

 The dejection of his looks is an indication of the dejection of his 
 mind at the thought of sin.

 (3.) He <I>smote upon his breast,</I> in a holy indignation at himself
 for sin: "Thus would I smite this wicked heart of mine, the poisoned 
 fountain out of which flow all the streams of sin, if I could come at 
 it." The sinner's heart first smites him in a penitent rebuke, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:10">2 Sam. xxiv. 10</A>.

 <I>David's heart smote him.</I> Sinner, what hast thou done? And then
 he smites his heart with penitent remorse: <I>O wretched man that I
 am?</I> Ephraim is said to <I>smite upon his thigh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:19">Jer. xxxi. 19</A>.
 
 Great mourners are represented <I>tabouring upon their breasts,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:7">Nah. ii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He expressed it <I>in what he said.</I> His prayer was <I>short.</I> 
 Fear and shame hindered him from saying much; sighs and groans 
 swallowed up his words; but what he said was to the purpose: <I>God, be 
 merciful to me a sinner.</I> And blessed be God that we have this 
 prayer upon record as an answered prayer, and that we are sure that he 
 who prayed it went to his house justified; and so shall we, if we pray 
 it, as he did, through Jesus Christ: "<I>God, be merciful to me a 
 sinner;</I> the God of infinite mercy be merciful to me, for, if he be 
 not, I am for ever undone, for ever miserable. God be merciful to me, 
 for I have been cruel to myself." 

 (1.) He owns himself <I>a sinner</I> by nature, by practice, guilty 
 before God. <I>Behold, I am vile, what shall I answer thee?</I> The 
 Pharisee denies himself to be a <I>sinner;</I> none of his neighbours 
 can charge him, and he sees no reason to charge himself, with any thing 
 amiss; <I>he is clean, he is pure from sin.</I> But the publican gives 
 himself no other character than that of a <I>sinner,</I> a convicted 
 criminal at God's bar. 

 (2.) He has no dependence but upon the <I>mercy of God,</I> that, and 
 that only, he relies upon. The Pharisee had insisted upon the 
 <I>merit</I> of his fastings and tithes; but the poor publican 
 disclaims all thought of merit, and flies to mercy as his city of 
 refuge, and takes hold of the horn of that altar. "Justice condemns me; 
 nothing will save me but mercy, mercy." 

 (3.) He earnestly prays for the benefit of that mercy: "<I>O God, be 
 merciful,</I> be <I>propitious, to me;</I> forgive my sins; be 
 reconciled to me; take me into thy favour; receive me graciously; love 
 me freely." He comes as a beggar for an alms, when he is ready to 
 perish for hunger. Probably he repeated this prayer with renewed 
 affections, and perhaps said more to the same purport, made a 
 particular confession of his sins, and mentioned the particular mercies 
 he wanted, and waited upon God for; but still this was the burden of 
 the song: <I>God, be merciful to me a sinner.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is the publican's <I>acceptance with God.</I> We have seen how 
 differently these two addressed themselves to God; it is now worth 
 while to enquire how they sped. There were those who would cry up the 
 Pharisee, by whom he would go to his house applauded, and who would 
 look with contempt upon this sneaking whining publican. But our Lord 
 Jesus, to whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no 
 secret is hid, who is perfectly acquainted with all proceedings in the 
 court of heaven, assures us that this poor, penitent, broken-hearted 
 publican <I>went to his house justified, rather than the other.</I> The 
 Pharisee thought that if one of them must be justified, and not the 
 other, certainly it must be he rather than the publican. "No," saith 
 Christ, "<I>I tell you,</I> I affirm it with the utmost assurance, and 
 declare it to you with the utmost concern, <I>I tell you,</I> it is the 
 publican rather than the Pharisee." The proud Pharisee goes away, 
 rejected of God; his thanksgivings are so far from being accepted that 
 they are an <I>abomination;</I> he is <I>not justified,</I> his sins 
 are not pardoned, nor is he delivered from condemnation: he is not 
 accepted as righteous in God's sight, because he is so righteous in his 
 own sight; but the publican, upon this humble address to Heaven, 
 obtains the remission of his sins, and he whom the Pharisee would not 
 set <I>with the dogs of his flock</I> God sets with the <I>children of 
 his family.</I> The reason given for this is because God's glory is to 
 <I>resist the proud, and give grace to the humble.</I> 

 1. Proud men, who <I>exalt themselves,</I> are <I>rivals with God,</I>
 and therefore <I>they shall</I> certainly be <I>abased.</I> God, in his 
 discourse with Job, appeals to this proof that he is God, that he 
 <I>looks upon every one that is proud, and brings him low,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:12">Job xl. 12</A>.

 2. Humble men, who <I>abase themselves,</I> are <I>subject to God,</I>
 and they shall be <I>exalted.</I> God has preferment in store for those 
 that will take it as a favour, not for those that demand it as a debt. 
 He shall be <I>exalted</I> into the love of God, and communion with 
 him, shall be exalted into a satisfaction in himself, and exalted at 
 last as high as heaven. See how the punishment answers the sin: <I>He 
 that exalteth himself shall be abased.</I> See how the recompence 
 answers the duty: <I>He that humbles himself shall be exalted.</I> See 
 also the power of God's grace in bringing good out of evil; the 
 publican had been a great sinner, and out of the greatness of his sin 
 was brought the greatness of his repentance; <I>out of the eater came 
 forth meat.</I> See, on the contrary, the power of Satan's malice in 
 bringing evil out of good. It was good that the Pharisee was no 
 extortioner, nor unjust; but the devil made him proud of this, to his 
 ruin.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This passage of story we had both in Matthew and Mark; it very fitly 
 follows here after the story of the publican, as a confirmation of the 
 truth which was to be illustrated by that parable, that those shall be 
 accepted with God, and honoured, who humble themselves, and for them 
 Christ has <I>blessings in store,</I> the choicest and best of 
 blessings. Observe here, 

 1. Those who are themselves blessed in Christ should desire to have
 their children also blessed in him, and should hereby testify the true 
 honour they have for Christ, by their making use of him, and the true 
 love they have for their children, by their concern about their souls. 
 They brought to him <I>infants,</I> very young, not able to go, sucking 
 children, as some think. None are too little, too young, to bring to 
 Christ, who knows how to show kindness to them that are not capable of 
 doing service to him. 

 2. One gracious touch of Christ's will make our children happy. They
 <I>brought infants to him, that he might touch them</I> in token of the 
 application of his grace and Spirit to them, for that always makes way 
 for his <I>blessing,</I> which likewise they expected: see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:3">Isa. xliv. 3</A>.
 
 <I>I will first pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and</I> then <I>my
 blessing upon thine offspring.</I> 

 3. It is no strange thing for those who make their application to Jesus
 Christ, for themselves or for their children, to meet with 
 discouragement, even from those who should countenance and encourage 
 them: <I>When the disciples saw it,</I> they thought, if this were 
 admitted, it would bring endless trouble upon their Master, and 
 therefore they <I>rebuked them,</I> and frowned upon them. The spouse 
 complained of <I>the watchmen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:3,5:7">Cant. iii. 3; v. 7</A>.

 4. Many whom the disciples rebuke the Master invites: <I>Jesus called
 them unto him,</I> when, upon the disciples' check, they were retiring. 
 They did not <I>appeal</I> from the disciples to the Master, but the 
 Master took cognizance of their despised cause. 

 5. It is the mind of Christ that <I>little children</I> should be
 brought to him, and presented as living sacrifices to his honour: 
 "<I>Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not;</I> let 
 nothing be done to hinder them, for they shall be as welcome as any." 
 <I>The promise</I> is <I>to us, and to our seed;</I> and therefore he 
 that has the dispensing of promised blessings will bid them welcome to 
 him with us.

 6. The children of those who belong to the kingdom of God do likewise
 belong to that kingdom, as the children of freemen are freemen. If the 
 parents be members of the visible church, the children are so too; for, 
 if the root be holy, the branches are so.

 7. So welcome are <I>children</I> to Christ that those grown people are
 most welcome to him who have in them most of the disposition of 
 children

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little
 child,</I> that is, receive the benefits of it with humility and
 thankfulness, not pretending to merit them as the Pharisee did, but 
 gladly owning himself indebted to free grace for them, as the publican 
 did; unless a man be brought to this self-denying frame he shall <I>in 
 no wise enter</I> into that kingdom. They must receive the kingdom of
 God as <I>children,</I> receive their estates by descent and 
 inheritance, not by purchase, and call it their Father's gift.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what
 shall I do to inherit eternal life?
 &nbsp; 19 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none <I>is</I>
 good, save one, <I>that is,</I> God.
 &nbsp; 20 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do
 not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy
 father and thy mother.
 &nbsp; 21 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
 &nbsp; 22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet
 lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute
 unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come,
 follow me.
 &nbsp; 23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was
 very rich.
 &nbsp; 24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How
 hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
 &nbsp; 25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye,
 than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
 &nbsp; 26 And they that heard <I>it</I> said, Who then can be saved?
 &nbsp; 27 And he said, The things which are impossible with men are
 possible with God.
 &nbsp; 28 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
 &nbsp; 29 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no
 man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or
 children, for the kingdom of God's sake,
 &nbsp; 30 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time,
 and in the world to come life everlasting.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's discourse with a ruler, that had a good mind to be directed 
 by him in the way to heaven. In which we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is a blessed sight to see persons of distinction in the world 
 distinguish themselves from others of their rank by their concern about 
 their souls and another life. Luke takes notice of it that he was a 
 <I>ruler.</I> Few of the rulers had any esteem for Christ, but here was 
 one that had; whether a church or state ruler does not appear, but he 
 was one <I>in authority.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The great thing we are every one of us concerned to enquire after is 
 what we shall do to get to heaven, <I>what we shall do to inherit 
 eternal life.</I> This implies such a belief of an eternal life after 
 this as atheists and infidels have not, such a concern to make it sure 
 as a careless unthinking world have not, and such a willingness to 
 comply with any terms that it may be made sure as those have not who 
 are resolvedly devoted to the world and the flesh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Those who would inherit eternal life must apply themselves to Jesus 
 Christ as their <I>Master,</I> their <I>teaching</I> Master, so it 
 signifies here (<B><I>didaskale</I></B>), and their <I>ruling</I>
 Master, and so they shall certainly find him. There is no learning the 
 way to heaven but in the school of Christ, by those that enter 
 themselves into it, and continue in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Those who come to Christ as their Master must believe him to have 
 not only a <I>divine mission,</I> but a <I>divine goodness.</I> Christ 
 would have this ruler know that if he understood himself aright in 
 calling him good he did, in effect, call him <I>God</I> and indeed he 
 was so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>Why callest thou me good?</I> Thou knowest <I>there is none good 
 but one, that is, God;</I> and dost thou then take me for God? If so, 
 thou art in the right."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Our Master, Christ himself, has not altered the way to heaven from 
 what it was before his coming, but has only made it more plain, and 
 easy, and comfortable, and provided for our relief, in case we take any 
 false step. <I>Thou knowest the commandments.</I> Christ came not to 
 destroy the law and the prophets, but to establish them. Wouldest thou 
 inherit eternal life? Govern thyself by the commandments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The duties of the second table must be conscientiously observed, in 
 order to our happiness, and we must not think that any acts of 
 devotion, how plausible soever, will atone for the neglect of them. Nor 
 is it enough to keep ourselves free from the gross violations of these 
 commandments, but we must <I>know these commandments,</I> as Christ has 
 <I>explained them</I> in his sermon upon the mount, in their extent and 
 spiritual nature, and so observe them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. Men think themselves <I>innocent</I> because they are 
 <I>ignorant;</I> so this ruler did. He said, <I>All these have I kept 
 from my youth up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 He knows no more evil of himself than the Pharisee did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He boasts that he began <I>early</I> in a course of virtue, that he had
 continued in it to this day, and that he had not in any instance 
 transgressed. Had he been acquainted with the extent and spiritual 
 nature of the divine law, and with the workings of his own heart,--had 
 he been but Christ's disciples awhile, and learned of him, he would 
 have said quite the contrary: "<I>All these have</I> I broken from my 
 youth up, in thought, word, and deed."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. The great things by which we are to try our spiritual state are how 
 we stand affected to Christ and to our brethren, to this world and to 
 the other; by these this man was tried. For, 

 (1.) If we have a true <I>affection to Christ,</I> he will <I>come and 
 follow him,</I> will attend to his doctrine, and submit to his 
 discipline, whatever it cost him. None shall inherit eternal life who 
 are not willing to take their lot with the Lord Jesus, to follow the 
 Lamb whithersoever he goes. 

 (2.) If he have a true <I>affection to his brethren,</I> he will, as 
 there is occasion, <I>distribute to the poor,</I> who are God's 
 receivers of his dues out of our estates. 

 (3.) If he think meanly of <I>this world,</I> as he ought, he will not 
 stick at <I>selling what he has,</I> if there be a necessity for it, 
 for the relief of God's poor.

 (4.) If he think highly of the other world, as he ought, he will desire 
 no more than to have <I>treasure in heaven,</I> and will reckon that a 
 sufficient abundant recompence for all that he has left, or lost, or 
 laid out for God in this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 9. There are many that have a great deal in them that is very 
 commendable, and yet they perish <I>for the lack of some one thing;</I> 
 so this <I>ruler</I> here; he broke with Christ upon this, he liked all 
 his terms very well but this which would part between him and his 
 estate: "In this, I pray thee, have me excused." If this be the 
 bargain, it is no bargain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 10. Many that are loth to leave Christ, yet do leave him. After a long 
 struggle between their convictions and their corruptions, their 
 corruptions carry the day at last; they are very sorry that they cannot 
 serve God and mammon both; but, if one must be quitted, it shall be 
 their God, not their worldly gain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's discourse with his disciples upon this occasion, in which 
 we may observe, 

 1. Riches are a great hindrance to many in the way to heaven. Christ
 took notice of the reluctancy and regret with which the rich man broke 
 off from him. He <I>saw that he was very sorrowful,</I> and was sorry 
 for him; but thence he infers, <I>How hardly shall they that have 
 riches enter into the kingdom of God!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 If this ruler had had but as little of the world as Peter, and James,
 and John had, in all probability he would have left it, to follow 
 Christ, as they did; but, having a great estate, it had a great 
 influence upon him, and he chose rather to take his leave of Christ 
 than to lay himself under an obligation to dispose of his estate in 
 charitable uses. Christ asserts the difficulty of the salvation of rich 
 people very emphatically: <I>It is easier for a camel to go through a 
 needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 It is a proverbial expression, that denotes the thing to be extremely
 difficult.

 2. There is in the hearts of all people such a general affection to
 this world, and the things of it, that, since Christ has required it as 
 necessary to salvation that we should sit loose to this world, it is 
 really very hard for any to get to heaven. If we must <I>sell all,</I> 
 or break with Christ, <I>who then can be saved?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 They do not find fault with what Christ required as hard and
 unreasonable. No, it is very fit that they who expect an eternal 
 happiness in the other world should be willing to forego all that is 
 dear to them in this world, in expectation of it. But they know how 
 closely the hearts of most men cleave to this world, and are ready to 
 despair of their being ever brought to this.

 3. There are such difficulties in the way of our salvation: as could
 never be got over but by pure omnipotence, by that grace of God which 
 is almighty, and to which that is <I>possible</I> which exceeds all 
 created power and wisdom. The <I>things which are impossible with 
 men</I> (and utterly impossible it is that men should work such a 
 change upon their own spirits as to turn them from the world to God, it 
 is like <I>dividing the sea,</I> and <I>driving Jordan back</I>), these 
 things are <I>possible with God.</I> His grace can work upon the soul, 
 so as to alter the bent and bias of it, and give it a contrary ply; and 
 it is he that <I>works in us both to will and to do.</I> 

 4. There is an aptness in us to speak too much of what we have left and
 lost, of what we have done and suffered, for Christ. This appears in 
 Peter: <I>Lo, we have left all, and followed thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 When it came in his way, he could not forbear magnifying his own and
 his brethren's affection to Christ, in <I>quitting</I> all to follow 
 him. But this we should be so far from boasting of, that we should
 rather acknowledge it not worth taking notice of, and be ashamed of 
 ourselves that there should have been any regret and difficulty in the 
 doing of it, and any hankerings towards those things afterwards.

 5. Whatever we have left, or laid out, for Christ, it shall without
 fail be abundantly made up to us in this world and that to come, 
 notwithstanding our weaknesses and infirmities

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>):

 <I>No man has left</I> the comfort of his estate or relations <I>for 
 the kingdom of God's sake,</I> rather than they should hinder either 
 his services to that kingdom or his enjoyments of it, <I>who shall not 
 receive manifold more in this present time,</I> in the graces and 
 comforts of God's Spirit, in the pleasures of communion with God and of 
 a good conscience, advantages which, to those that know how to value 
 and improve them, will abundantly countervail all their loses. Yet
 that is not all; in the world to come they <I>shall receive life 
 everlasting,</I> which is the thing that the ruler seemed to have his 
 eye and heart upon.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  Then he took <I>unto him</I> the twelve, and said unto them,
 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by
 the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.
 &nbsp; 32 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
 mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:
 &nbsp; 33 And they shall scourge <I>him,</I> and put him to death: and the
 third day he shall rise again.
 &nbsp; 34 And they understood none of these things: and this saying
 was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were
 spoken.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 I. The notice Christ gave to his disciples of his sufferings and death 
 approaching, and of the glorious issue of them, which he himself had a 
 perfect sight and foreknowledge of, and thought it necessary to give 
 them warning of, that it might be the less surprise and terror to them. 
 Two things here are which we had not in the other evangelists:--

 1. The <I>sufferings</I> of Christ are here spoken of as the
 <I>fulfilling of the scriptures,</I> with which consideration Christ 
 reconciled himself to them, and would reconcile them: <I>All things 
 that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man,</I> 
 especially the hardships he should undergo, <I>shall be 
 accomplished.</I> Note, The Spirit of Christ, in the Old-Testament 
 prophets, <I>testified beforehand his sufferings,</I> and <I>the glory 
 that should follow,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11">1 Pet. i. 11</A>.
 
 This proves that the scriptures are the <I>word</I> of <I>God,</I> for
 they had their exact and full accomplishment; and that Jesus Christ was 
 <I>sent of God,</I> for they had their accomplishment <I>in him;</I> 
 this was <I>he that should come,</I> for whatever was <I>foretold</I> 
 concerning the Messiah was verified in him; and he would submit to any 
 thing for the fulfilling of scripture, that not one jot or tittle of 
 that should fall to the ground. This makes the <I>offence of the cross 
 to cease,</I> and puts an honour upon it. <I>Thus it was written, and 
 thus it behoved Christ to suffer,</I> thus it became him. 

 2. The ignominy and disgrace done to Christ in his sufferings are here
 most insisted upon. The other evangelists had said that he should be 
 <I>mocked;</I> but here it is added, <I>He shall be spitefully 
 treated,</I> <B><I>hybristhesetai</I></B>--<I>he shall be loaded with 
 contumely and contempt,</I> shall have all possible reproach put upon 
 him. This was that part of his sufferings by which in a spiritual 
 manner he satisfied God's justice for the injury we had done him in his 
 honour by sin. Here is one particular instance of disgrace done him, 
 that <I>he was spit upon,</I> which had been particularly foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:6">Isa. l. 6</A>.

 But here, as always, when Christ spoke of his sufferings and death, he
 foretold his resurrection as that which took off both the terror and 
 reproach of his sufferings: <I>The third day he shall rise 
 again.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The confusion that the disciples were hereby put into. This was so 
 contrary to the notions they had had of the Messiah and his kingdom, 
 such a balk to their expectations from their Master, and such a 
 breaking of all their measures, that <I>they understood none of these 
 things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Their prejudices were so strong that they <I>would not</I> understand
 them literally, and they <I>could not</I> understand them otherwise, so 
 that they did not understand them at all. It was a mystery, it was a 
 riddle to them, it must be so; but they think it impossible to be 
 reconciled with the glory and honour of the Messiah, and the design of 
 setting up his kingdom. This saying was <I>hidden from them,</I> 
 <B><I>kekrymmenon ap auton</I></B>, it was apocrypha to them, they 
 could not receive it: for their parts, they had read the Old Testament 
 many a time, but they could never see any thing in it that would be 
 <I>accomplished</I> in the disgrace and death of this Messiah. They
 were so intent upon those prophecies that spoke of his glory that they 
 overlooked those that spoke of his <I>sufferings,</I> which the scribes 
 and doctors of the law should have directed them to take notice of, and 
 should have brought into their creeds and catechisms, as well as the 
 other; but they did not suit their scheme, and therefore were laid 
 aside. Note, <I>Therefore</I> it is that people run into mistakes, 
 because they <I>read their Bibles by the halves,</I> and are as partial 
 in the prophets as they are <I>in the law.</I> They are only for the 
 <I>smooth things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:10">Isa. xxx. 10</A>.

 Thus now we are too apt, in reading the prophecies that are yet to be
 fulfilled, to have our expectations raised of the glorious state of the 
 church in the latter days. But we overlook its wilderness sackcloth 
 state, and are willing to fancy that is over, and nothing is reserved 
 for us but the halcyon days; and then, when tribulation and persecution 
 arise, we do not <I>understand</I> it, neither <I>know we the things 
 that are done,</I> though we are told as plainly as can be that 
 <I>through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of 
 God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>35  And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho,
 a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:
 &nbsp; 36 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.
 &nbsp; 37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
 &nbsp; 38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, <I>thou</I> Son of David, have mercy
 on me.
 &nbsp; 39 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold
 his peace: but he cried so much the more, <I>Thou</I> Son of David,
 have mercy on me.
 &nbsp; 40 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him:
 and when he was come near, he asked him,
 &nbsp; 41 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he
 said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
 &nbsp; 42 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath
 saved thee.
 &nbsp; 43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
 glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw <I>it,</I> gave
 praise unto God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ came not only to bring <I>light</I> to a <I>dark</I> world, and 
 so to set before us the <I>objects</I> we are to have in view, but also 
 to give <I>sight</I> to blind <I>souls,</I> and by healing the 
 <I>organ</I> to enable them to view those objects. As a token of this, 
 he cured many of their bodily blindness: we have now an account of one 
 to whom he <I>gave sight</I> near Jericho. Mark gives us an account of 
 one, and names him, whom he cured <I>as he went out of Jericho,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:46">Mark x. 46</A>.

 Matthew speaks of two whom he cured <I>as they departed</I> from
 Jericho,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:30">Matt. xx. 30</A>.

 Luke says it was <B><I>en to eggizein auton</I></B>--<I>when he was
 near</I> to Jericho, which might be when he was going out of it as well 
 as when he was coming into it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This poor blind man <I>sat by the wayside, begging,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 It seems, he was not only <I>blind,</I> but <I>poor,</I> had nothing to
 subsist on, nor any relations to maintain him; the fitter emblem of the 
 world of mankind which Christ came to heal and save; they are therefore 
 <I>wretched</I> and <I>miserable,</I> for they are both <I>poor and 
 blind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17">Rev. iii. 17</A>.

 He sat begging, for he was blind, and could not work for his living.
 Note, Those ought to be relieved by charity whom the providence of God 
 has any way disabled to get their own bread. Such objects of charity 
 <I>by the way-side</I> ought not to be overlooked by us. Christ here 
 cast a favourable eye upon a <I>common beggar,</I> and, though there 
 are cheats among such, yet they must not therefore be all thought 
 such.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Hearing the noise of a multitude passing by, he asked <I>what it 
 meant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 This we had not before. It teaches us that it is good to be
 <I>inquisitive,</I> and that those who are so some time or other find 
 the benefit of it. Those who want their <I>sight</I> should make so 
 much the better use of their <I>hearing,</I> and, when they cannot see 
 with their own eyes, should, by <I>asking questions,</I> make use of 
 other people's eyes. So this blind man did, and by that means came to 
 understand that Jesus of Nazareth <I>passed by,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 It is good being in Christ's way; and, when we have an opportunity of
 applying ourselves to him, not to let it slip.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His prayer has in it a great deal both of faith and fervency: 
 <I>Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 He owns Christ to be the <I>Son of David,</I> the Messiah promised; he
 believes him to be Jesus, a Saviour; he believes he is able to help and 
 succour him, and earnestly begs his favour: "<I>Have mercy on me,</I> 
 pardon my sin, pity my misery." Christ is a merciful king; those that 
 apply themselves to him as the <I>Son of David</I> shall find him so, 
 and ask enough for themselves when they pray, <I>Have mercy on us;</I> 
 for Christ's mercy includes all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Those who are in good earnest for Christ's favours and blessings 
 will not be put by from the pursuit of them, though they meet with 
 opposition and rebuke. They who went along chid him as troublesome to 
 the Master, noisy and impertinent, and bade him <I>hold his peace;</I> 
 but he went on with his petition, nay, the check given him was but as a 
 dam to a full stream, which makes it swell so much the more; he 
 <I>cried the louder, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</I> Those who 
 would speed in prayer must be importunate in prayer. This history, in 
 the close of the chapter, intimates the same thing with the parable in 
 the beginning of the chapter, that <I>men ought always to pray, and not 
 to faint.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Christ encourages poor beggars, whom men frown upon, and invites 
 them to come to him, and is ready to entertain them, and bid them 
 welcome: <I>He commanded him to be brought to him.</I> Note, Christ has 
 more tenderness and compassion for distressed supplicants than any of 
 his followers have. Though Christ was upon his journey, yet he stopped 
 and <I>stood,</I> and <I>commanded him to be brought to him.</I> Those 
 who had checked him must now lend him their hands to lead him to 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Though Christ knows all our wants, he will know them from us 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 <I>What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?</I> By spreading our case 
 before God, with a particular representation of our wants and burdens, 
 we teach ourselves to value the mercy we are in pursuit of; and it is 
 necessary that we should, else we are not fit to receive it. This man
 poured out his soul before Christ, when he said, <I>Lord, that I may 
 receive my sight.</I> Thus particular should we be in prayer, upon 
 particular occasions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The prayer of faith, guided by Christ's encouraging promises, and 
 grounded on them, shall not be in vain; nay, it shall not only receive 
 an <I>answer of peace,</I> but of <I>honour</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>);

 Christ said, <I>Receive thy sight, thy faith hath saved thee.</I> True 
 faith will produce fervency in prayer, and both together will fetch in 
 abundance of the fruits of Christ's favour; and they are then doubly 
 comfortable when they come in that way, when we are <I>saved by 
 faith.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. The <I>grace of Christ</I> ought to be thankfully acknowledged, 
 to the <I>glory of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 1. The poor beggar himself, that had his sight restored, <I>followed
 Christ, glorifying God.</I> Christ made it his business to glorify his 
 Father; and those whom he healed <I>pleased him</I> best when they 
 <I>praised God,</I> as those shall <I>please God</I> best who <I>praise 
 Christ</I> and do him honour; for, in <I>confessing that he is 
 Lord,</I> we <I>give glory to God the Father.</I> It is for the 
 <I>glory of God</I> if we <I>follow Christ,</I> as those will do whose 
 <I>eyes</I> are <I>opened.</I> 

 2. The <I>people that saw it</I> could not forbear <I>giving praise to
 God,</I> who had given such power to the <I>Son of Man,</I> and by him 
 had conferred such favours on the <I>sons of men.</I> Note, We must 
 give praise to God for his mercies to others as well as for mercies to 
 ourselves.</P>
