 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The gospels are, in short, a record of what Jesus began both to do and
 to teach. In the foregoing chapter, we had an account of his doings, in
 this, of his teachings; probably, not all at the same time, in a
 continued discourse, but at several times, upon divers occasions, here
 put together, as near akin. We have here,

 I. Instructions concerning humility, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. Concerning offences in general

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:7">ver. 7</A>),

 particularly offences given,
 
 1. By us to ourselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.
 
 2. By us to others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:10-14">ver. 10-14</A>.

 3. By others to us; which are of two sorts,

 (1.) Scandalous sins, which are to be reproved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:15-20">ver. 15-20</A>.

 (2.) Personal wrongs, which are to be forgiven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:21-35">ver. 21-35</A>.

 See how practical Christ's preaching was; he could have revealed 
 mysteries, but he pressed plain duties, especially those that are most 
 displeasing to flesh and blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who
 is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
 &nbsp; 2  And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the
 midst of them,
 &nbsp; 3  And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and
 become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of
 heaven.
 &nbsp; 4  Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little
 child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
 &nbsp; 5  And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
 receiveth me.
 &nbsp; 6  But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe
 in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about
 his neck, and <I>that</I> he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As there never was a greater pattern of humility, so there never was a 
 greater preacher of it, than Christ; he took all occasions to command 
 it, to commend it, to his disciples and followers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The occasion of this discourse concerning humility was an unbecoming 
 contest among the disciples for precedency; they <I>came to him, 
 saying,</I> among themselves (for they were ashamed to ask him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:34">Mark ix. 34</A>),

 <I>Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</I> They mean not,
 <I>who</I> by character (then the question had been good, that they 
 might know what graces and duties to excel in), but <I>who</I> by name. 
 They had heard much, and preached much, of the kingdom of heaven, the 
 kingdom of the Messiah, his church in this world; but ass yet they were 
 so far from having any clear notion of it, that they dreamt of a 
 temporal kingdom, and the external pomp and power of it. Christ had 
 lately foretold his sufferings, and the glory that should follow, that 
 he should rise again, from whence they expected his kingdom would 
 commence; and now they thought it was time to put in for their places 
 in it; it is good, in such cases, to speak early. Upon other discourses 
 of Christ to that purport, debates of this kind arose

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:19,20,Lu+22:22,24"><I>ch.</I> xx. 19, 20; Luke xxii. 22, 24</A>);

 he spoke many words of his sufferings, but only one of his glory; yet
 they fasten upon that, and overlook the other; and, instead of asking 
 how they might have strength and grace to suffer with him, they ask 
 him, "Who shall be highest in reigning with him." Note, Many love to 
 hear and speak of privileges and glory, who are willing to pass by the 
 thoughts of work and trouble. They look so much at the crown, that
 they forget the yoke and the cross. So the disciples here did, when 
 they asked, <I>Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They suppose that all who have a place in that kingdom are great, 
 for it is a kingdom of priests. Note, Those are truly great who are 
 truly good; and they will appear so at last, when Christ shall own them 
 as his, though ever so mean and poor in the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They suppose that there are degrees in this greatness. All the 
 saints are honourable, but not all alike so; <I>one star differs from 
 another star in glory.</I> All David's officers were not worthies, nor 
 all his worthies of the first three.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They suppose it must be some of them, that must be prime ministers 
 of state. To whom should King Jesus delight to do honour, but to them 
 who had left all for him, and were now his companions in patience and 
 tribulation?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They strive who it should be, each having some pretence or other to 
 it. Peter was always the chief speaker, and already had the keys given 
 him; he expects to be lord-chancellor, or lord-chamberlain of the 
 household, and so to be the greatest. Judas had the bag, and therefore 
 he expects to be lord-treasurer, which, though now he come last, he 
 hopes, will then denominate him the greatest. Simon and Jude are nearly 
 related to Christ, and they hope to take place of all the great 
 officers of state, as princes of the blood. John is the beloved 
 disciple, the favourite of the Prince, and therefore hopes to be the 
 greatest. Andrew was first called, and why should not he be first 
 preferred? Note, We are very apt to amuse and humour ourselves with 
 foolish fancies of things that will never be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The discourse itself, which is a just rebuke to the question, 
 <I>Who shall be greatest?</I> We have abundant reason to think, that if 
 Christ ever intended that Peter and his successors at Rome should be 
 heads of the church, and his chief vicars on earth, having so fair an 
 occasion given him, he would now have let his disciples know it; but so 
 far is he from this, that his answer disallows and condemns the thing 
 itself. Christ will not lodge such an authority or supremacy any where 
 in his church; whoever pretend to it are usurpers; instead of settling 
 any of the disciples in this dignity, he warns them all not to put in 
 for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ here teacheth them to be humble,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By a sign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 <I>He called a little child to him, and set him in the midst of 
 them.</I> Christ often taught by signs or sensible representations 
 (comparisons to the eye), as the prophets of old. Note, Humility is a 
 lesson so hardly learned, that we have need by all ways and means to be 
 taught it. When we look upon a little child, we should be put in mind 
 of the use Christ made of this child. Sensible things must be improved 
 to spiritual purposes. <I>He set him in the midst of them;</I> not that 
 they might play with him, but that they might learn by him. Grown men, 
 and great men, should not disdain the company of little children, or 
 think it below them to take notice of them. They may either speak to 
 them, and give instruction to them; or look upon them, and receive 
 instruction from them. Christ himself, when a child, was <I>in the 
 midst of the doctors,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:46">Luke ii. 46</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By as sermon upon this sign; in which he shows them and us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The necessity of humility, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 His preface is solemn, and commands both attention and assent; 
 <I>Verily I say unto you, I, the Amen, the faithful Witness,</I> say 
 it, <I>Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall 
 not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</I> Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What it is that he requires and insists upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> "You must be converted, you must be of another mind, and 
 in another frame and temper, must have other thoughts, both of 
 yourselves and of the kingdom of heaven, before you be fit for a place 
 in it. The pride, ambition, and affectation of honour and dominion, 
 which appear in you, must be repented of, mortified, and reformed, and 
 you must come to yourselves." Note, Besides the first conversion of a 
 soul from a state of nature to a state of grace, there are 
 after-conversions from particular paths of backsliding, which are 
 equally necessary to salvation. Every step out of the way by sin, must 
 be a step into it again by repentance. When Peter repented of his 
 denying his Master, he was converted. <I>Secondly,</I> You must 
 <I>become as little children.</I> Note, Converting grace makes us like 
 little children, not foolish as children 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:20">1 Cor. xiv. 20</A>),
 
 nor fickle
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:14">Eph. iv. 14</A>),
 
 nor playful

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:16"><I>ch.</I> xi. 16</A>);

 but, <I>as children,</I> we must <I>desire the sincere milk of the
 word</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:2">1 Pet. ii. 2</A>);

 as children, we must be careful for nothing, but leave it to our 
 heavenly Father to care for us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:31"><I>ch.</I> vi. 31</A>);

 we must, as children, be harmless and inoffensive, and void of malice
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:20">1 Cor. xiv. 20</A>),

 governable, and under command 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:2">Gal. iv. 2</A>);

 and (which is here chiefly intended) we must be humble as little
 children, who do not take state upon them, nor stand upon the 
 punctilios of honour; the child of a gentleman will play with the child 
 of a beggar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:16">Rom. xii. 16</A>),

 the child in rags, if it have the breast, is well enough pleased, and 
 envies not the gaiety of the child in silk; little children have no 
 great aims at great places, or projects to raise themselves in the 
 world; they <I>exercise not themselves in things too high for them;</I> 
 and we should in like manner <I>behave, and quiet ourselves,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+131:1,2">Ps. cxxxi. 1, 2</A>.

 As children are little in body and low in stature, so we must be little
 and low in spirit, and in our thoughts of ourselves. This is a temper 
 which leads to other good dispositions; the age of childhood is the 
 learning age.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What stress he lays upon this; Without this, <I>you shall not 
 enter into the kingdom of heaven.</I> Note, Disciples of Christ have 
 need to be kept in awe by threatenings, that they may fear <I>lest they 
 seem to come short,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:1">Heb. iv. 1</A>.

 The disciples, when they put that question

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 thought themselves sure of the kingdom of heaven; but Christ awakens 
 them to be jealous of themselves. They were ambitious of being 
 <I>greatest in the kingdom of heaven;</I> Christ tells them, that, 
 except they came to a better temper, they should never come thither. 
 Note, many that set up for great ones in the church, prove not only 
 little, but nothing, and are found to <I>have no part or lot in the 
 matter.</I> Our Lord designs here to show the great danger of pride and 
 ambition; whatever profession men make, if they allow themselves in 
 this sin, they will be rejected both from God's tabernacle and from his 
 holy hill. Pride threw the angels that sinned out of heaven, and will 
 keep us out, if we be not converted from it. They that are lifted up 
 with pride, <I>fall into the condemnation of the devil;</I> to prevent 
 this, we must become as little children, and, in order to do that, 
 <I>must be born again, must put on the new man,</I> must be like <I>the 
 holy child Jesus;</I> so he is called, even after his ascension, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:27">Acts iv. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He shows the honour and advancement that attend humility 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 thus furnishing a direct but surprising answer to their question. He 
 that humbles himself as a little child, though he may fear that hereby 
 he will render himself contemptible, as men of timid minds, who thereby 
 throw themselves out of the way of preferment, yet <I>the same is 
 greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</I> Note, The humblest Christians 
 are the best Christians, and most like to Christ, and highest in his 
 favour; are best disposed for the communications of divine grace, and 
 fittest to serve God in this world, and enjoy him in another. They are 
 great, for God overlooks heaven and earth, to look on such; and 
 certainly those are to be most respected and honoured in the church 
 that are most humble and self-denying; for, though they least seek it, 
 they best deserve it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The special care Christ takes for those that are humble; he 
 espouses their cause, protects them, interests himself in their 
 concerns, and will see that they are not wronged, without being 
 righted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those that thus humble themselves will be afraid,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That nobody will receive them; but 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>Whoso shall receive one such little child in my name, receiveth 
 me.</I> Whatever kindnesses are done to such, Christ takes as done to 
 himself. Whoso entertains a meek and humble Christian, keeps him in 
 countenance, will not let him lose by his modesty, takes him into his 
 love and friendship, and society and care, and studies to do him a 
 kindness; and doth this in Christ's name, for his sake, because he 
 bears the image of Christ, serves Christ, and because Christ has 
 received him; this shall be accepted and recompensed as an acceptable 
 piece of respect to Christ. Observe, Though it be but one such little
 child that is received in Christ's name, it shall be accepted. Note, 
 The tender regard Christ has to his church extends itself to every 
 particular member, even the meanest; not only to the whole family, but 
 to every child of the family; the less they are in themselves, to whom 
 we show kindness, the more there is of good will in it to Christ; the 
 less it is for their sakes, the more it is for his; and he takes it 
 accordingly. If Christ were personally among us, we think we should 
 never do enough to welcome him; <I>the poor, the poor in spirit, we 
 have always with us,</I> and they are his receivers. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:35-40"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 35-40</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] They will be afraid that every body will abuse them; the basest 
 men delight to trample upon the humble; <I>Vexat censura 
 columbas--Censure pounces on doves.</I> This objection he obviates 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 where he warns all people, as they will answer it at their utmost 
 peril, not to offer any injury to one of Christ's little ones. This
 word makes a wall of fire about them; he that touches them, touches the 
 apple of God's eye.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, <I>First,</I> The crime supposed; <I>offending one of these 
 little ones that believe in Christ.</I> Their believing in Christ, 
 though they be little ones, unites them to him, and interests him in 
 their cause, so that, as they partake of the benefit of his sufferings, 
 he also partakes in the wrong of theirs. Even the little ones that 
 believe have the same privileges with the great ones, for they have all 
 obtained like precious faith. There are those that offend these little 
 ones, by drawing them to sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:10,11">1 Cor. viii. 10, 11</A>),

 grieving and vexing their righteous souls, discouraging them, taking 
 occasion from their mildness to make a prey of them in their persons, 
 families, goods, or good name. Thus the best men have often met with 
 the worst treatment in this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The punishment of this crime; intimated in that word, 
 <I>Better for him that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</I> The 
 sin is so heinous, and the ruin proportionably so great, that he had 
 better undergo the sorest punishments inflicted on the worst of 
 malefactors, which can only kill the body. Note, 

 1. Hell is worse than the depth of the sea; for it is a bottomless pit,
 and it is a burning lake. The depth of the sea is only killing, but 
 hell is tormenting. We meet with one that had comfort in the depth of 
 the sea, it was Jonah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:2,4,9"><I>ch.</I> ii. 2, 4, 9</A>);

 but never any had the least grain or glimpse of comfort in hell, nor
 will have to eternity. 

 2. The irresistible irrevocable doom of the great Judge will sink
 sooner and surer, and bind faster, than <I>a mill-stone hanged about 
 the neck.</I> It fixes a great gulf, which can never be broken through, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:26">Luke xvi. 26</A>.

 Offending Christ's little ones, though by omission, is assigned as the
 reason of that dreadful sentence, <I>Go ye cursed,</I> which will at 
 last be the doom of proud persecutors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be
 that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence
 cometh!
 &nbsp; 8  Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off,
 and cast <I>them</I> from thee: it is better for thee to enter into
 life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to
 be cast into everlasting fire.
 &nbsp; 9  And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast <I>it</I>
 from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,
 rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.
 &nbsp; 10  Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for
 I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the
 face of my Father which is in heaven.
 &nbsp; 11  For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
 &nbsp; 12  How think ye? if a man have a hundred sheep, and one of
 them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and
 goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?
 &nbsp; 13  And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he
 rejoiceth more of that <I>sheep,</I> than of the ninety and nine which
 went not astray.
 &nbsp; 14  Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in
 heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Savior here speaks of offences, or scandals,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In general, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Having mentioned the offending of little ones, he takes occasion to 
 speak more generally of offences. That is an offence, 

 1. Which occasions guilt, which by enticement or affrightment tends to
 draw men from that which is good to that which is evil. 

 2. Which occasions grief, which <I>makes the heart of the righteous
 sad.</I> Now, concerning offences, Christ here tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That they were certain things; <I>It must needs be, that offences 
 come.</I> When we are sure there is danger, we should be the better 
 armed. Not that Christ's word necessitates any man to offend, but it is 
 a prediction upon a view of the causes; considering the subtlety and 
 malice of Satan, the weakness and depravity of men's hearts, and the 
 foolishness that is found there, it is morally impossible but that 
 there should be offences; and God has determined to permit them for 
 wise and holy ends, that both <I>they which are perfect, and they which 
 are not, may be made manifest.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:19,Da+11:35">1 Cor. xi. 19; Dan. xi. 35</A>.

 Being told, before, that there will be seducers, tempters, persecutors,
 and many bad examples, let us stand upon our guard,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:24,Ac+20:29,30"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 24; Acts xx. 29, 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That they would be woeful things, and the consequence of them 
 fatal. Here is a double woe annexed to offences:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] A woe to the careless and unguarded, to whom the offence is given; 
 <I>Woe to the world because of offences.</I> The obstructions and 
 oppositions given to faith and holiness in all places are the bane and 
 plague of mankind, and the ruin of thousands. This present world is an 
 evil world, it is so full of offences, of sins, and snares, and 
 sorrows; a dangerous road we travel, full of stumbling-blocks, 
 precipices, and false guides. Woe to the world. As for those whom God 
 hath chosen and called out of the world, and delivered from it, they 
 are preserved by the power of God from the prejudice of these offences, 
 are helped over all these stones of stumbling. <I>They that love God's 
 law have great peace, and nothing shall offend them,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:165">Ps. cxix. 165</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] A woe to the wicked, who wilfully give the offence; <I>But woe to 
 that man by whom the offence comes.</I> Though it must needs be, that 
 the offence will come, that will be no excuse for the offenders. Note, 
 Though God makes the sins of sinners to serve his purposes, that will 
 not secure them from his wrath; and the guilt will be laid at the door 
 of those who give the offence, though they also fall under a woe who 
 take it. Note, They who any way hinder the salvation of others, will 
 find their own condemnation the more intolerable, like <I>Jeroboam, who 
 sinned, and made Israel to sin.</I> This woe is the moral of that 
 judicial law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:33-22:6">Exod. xxi. 33, 34-22:6</A>),

 that he who opened the pit, and kindled the fire, was accountable for 
 all the damage that ensued. The antichristian generation, by whom came 
 the great offence, will fall under this woe, for their delusion of 
 sinners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:11,12">2 Thess. ii. 11, 12</A>),

 and their persecutions of saints 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:1,2,6">Rev. xvii. 1, 2, 6</A>),

 for the righteous God will reckon with those who ruin the eternal 
 interests of precious souls, and the temporal interests of precious 
 saints; for <I>precious in the sight of the Lord is</I> the blood of 
 souls and <I>the blood of saints;</I> and men will be reckoned with, 
 not only for their doings, but for the fruit of their doings, the 
 mischief done by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In particular, Christ here speaks of offences given,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By us to ourselves, which is expressed by our hand or foot offending 
 us; in such a case, it must be <I>cut off,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 This Christ had said before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:29,30"><I>ch.</I> v. 29, 30</A>),

 where it especially refers to seventh-commandment sins; here it is
 taken more generally. Note, Those hard sayings of Christ, which are 
 displeasing to flesh and blood, need to be repeated to us again and 
 again, and all little enough. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What it is that is here enjoined. We must part with an <I>eye,</I> 
 or a <I>hand,</I> or a <I>foot,</I> that is, that, whatever it is, 
 which is dear to us, when it proves unavoidably an occasion of sin to 
 us. Note, 

 [1.] Many prevailing temptations to sin arise from within ourselves; 
 our own eyes and hands offend us; if there were never a devil to tempt 
 us, we should be drawn away of our own lust: nay, those things which in 
 themselves are good, and may be used as instruments of good, even 
 those, through the corruptions of our hearts, prove snares to us, 
 incline us to sin, and hinder us in duty. 

 [2.] In such a case, we must, as far as lawfully we may, part with that 
 which we cannot keep without being entangled in sin by it. 
 <I>First,</I> It is certain, the inward lust must be mortified, though 
 it be dear to us as an eye, or a hand. <I>The flesh, with its
 affections and lusts, must be mortified,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:24">Gal. v. 24</A>.

 <I>The body of sin must be destroyed;</I> corrupt inclinations and
 appetites must be checked and crossed; the beloved lust, that has been 
 rolled under the tongue as a sweet morsel, must be abandoned with 
 abhorrence. <I>Secondly,</I> The outward occasions of sin must be
 avoided, though we thereby put as great a violence upon ourselves as it 
 would be to cut off a hand, or pluck out an eye. When Abraham quitted 
 his native country, for fear of being ensnared in the idolatry of it, 
 and when Moses quitted Pharaoh's court, for fear of being entangled in
 the sinful pleasures of it, there was a right hand cut off. We must 
 think nothing too dear to part with, for the keeping of a good 
 conscience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Upon what inducement this is required; <I>It is better for thee to 
 enter into life maimed, than, having two hands, to be cast into 
 hell.</I> The argument is taken from the future state, from heaven and 
 hell; thence are fetched the most cogent dissuasives from sin. The 
 argument is the same with that of the apostle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:13">Rom. viii. 13</A>.

 [1.] <I>If we live after the flesh, we shall die;</I> having two eyes,
 no breaches made upon the body of sin, inbred corruption like Adonijah 
 never displeased, we shall <I>be cast into hell-fire.</I> 

 [2.] <I>If we through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body, we 
 shall live;</I> that is meant by our <I>entering into life maimed,</I> 
 that is, the body of sin maimed; and it is but maimed at the best, 
 while we are in this world. If the right hand of the old man be cut 
 off, and its right eye be plucked out, its chief policies blasted and 
 powers broken, it is well; but there is still an eye and a hand 
 remaining, with which it will struggle. They that are Christ's have 
 nailed the flesh to the cross, but it is not yet dead; its life is 
 prolonged, but its <I>dominion taken away</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:12">Dan. vii. 12</A>),

 and the deadly wound given it, that shall not be healed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning offences given by us to others, especially Christ's 
 little ones, which we are here charged to take heed of, pursuant to 
 what he had said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The caution itself; <I>Take heed that ye despise not one of these 
 little ones.</I> This is spoken to the disciples. As Christ will be 
 displeased with enemies of his church, if they wrong any of the members 
 of it, even the least, so he will be displeased with the great ones of 
 the church, if they despise the little ones of it. "You that are 
 striving who shall be greatest, take heed lest in this contest you 
 despise the little ones." We may understand it literally of little 
 children; of them Christ was speaking, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:2,4"><I>v.</I> 2, 4</A>.

 The infant seed of the faithful belong to the family of Christ, and are 
 not to be despised. Or, figuratively; true but weak believers are
 these little ones, who in their outward condition, or the frame of 
 their spirits, are like little children, the lambs of Christ's 
 flock.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] We must not despise them, not think meanly of them, as lambs 
 despised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:5">Job xii. 5</A>.

 We must not make a jest of their infirmities, not look upon them with 
 contempt, not conduct ourselves scornfully or disdainfully toward them, 
 as if we cared not what became of them; we must not say, "Though they 
 be offended, and grieved, and stumble, what is that to us?" Nor should 
 we make a slight matter of doing that which will entangle and perplex 
 them. This despising of the little ones is what we are largely 
 cautioned against, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:3,10,15,20,21">Rom. xiv. 3, 10, 15, 20, 21</A>.

 We must not impose upon the consciences of others, nor bring them into
 subjection to our humours, as they do who say to men's souls, <I>Bow 
 down, that we may go over.</I> There is a respect owing to the 
 conscience of every man who appears to be conscientious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] We must take heed that we do not despise them; we must be afraid 
 of the sin, and be very cautious what we say and do, lest we should 
 through inadvertency give offence to Christ's little ones, lest we put 
 contempt upon them, without being aware of it. There were those that 
 hated them, and cast them out, and yet said, <I>Let the Lord be 
 glorified.</I> And we must be afraid of the punishment; "Take heed of 
 despising them, for it is at your peril if you do."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The reasons to enforce the caution. We must not look upon these 
 little ones as contemptible, because really they are considerable. Let 
 not earth despise those whom heaven respects; let not <I>those</I> be 
 looked upon by us with respect, as his favourites. To prove that the 
 little ones which believe in Christ are worthy to be respected, 
 consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The ministration of the good angels about them; <I>In heaven their 
 angels always behold the face of my Father.</I> This Christ saith to 
 us, and we may take it upon <I>his</I> word, who came from heaven to 
 let us know what is done there by the world of angels. Two things he 
 lets us know concerning them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> That they are the little ones' angels. God's angels are 
 theirs; for all his is ours, if we be Christ's. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:22">1 Cor. iii. 22</A>.

 They are theirs; for they have a charge concerning them to minister for
 their good

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:14">Heb. i. 14</A>),

 to pitch their tents about them, and bear them up in their arms. Some 
 have imagined that every particular saint has a guardian angel; but why 
 should we suppose this, when we are sure that every particular saint, 
 when there is occasion, has a guard of angels? This is particularly
 applied here to the little ones, because they are most despised and 
 most exposed. They have but little that they can call their own, but 
 they can look by faith on the heavenly hosts, and call them theirs. 
 While the great ones of the world have honourable men for their retinue 
 and guards, the little ones of the church are attended with glorious 
 angels; which bespeaks not only their dignity, but the danger those run 
 themselves upon, who despise and abuse them. It is bad being enemies to 
 those who are so guarded; and it is good having God for our God, for 
 then we have his angels for our angels.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> That <I>they always behold the face of the Father in 
 heaven.</I> This bespeaks, 

 1. The angels' continual felicity and honour. The happiness of heaven
 consists in the vision of God, seeing him face to face as he is, 
 beholding his beauty; this the angels have without interruption; when 
 they are ministering to us on earth, yet even then by contemplation 
 they behold the face of God, for they are <I>full of eyes within.</I> 
 Gabriel, when speaking to Zecharias, yet stands in the presence of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:8,Lu+1:19">Rev. iv. 8; Luke i. 19</A>.

 The expression intimates, as some think, the special dignity and honour 
 of the little ones' angels; the prime ministers of state are said to 
 <I>see the king's face</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:14">Esth. i. 14</A>),

 as if the strongest angels had the charge of the weakest saints. 

 2. It bespeaks their continual readiness to minister to the saints. 
 They behold the face of God, expecting to receive orders from him what 
 to do for the good of the saints. <I>As the eyes of the servant are to 
 the hand of his master,</I> ready to go or come upon the least beck, so 
 the eyes of the angels are upon the face of God, waiting for the 
 intimations of his will, which those winged messengers fly swiftly to 
 fulfil; they <I>go and return like a flash of lightning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:14">Ezek. i. 14</A>.
 
 If we would behold the face of God in glory hereafter, as the angels do

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:36">Luke xx. 36</A>),

 we must behold the face of God now, in readiness to our duty, as they 
 do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:6">Acts ix. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The gracious design of Christ concerning them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 <I>For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</I> This is 
 a reason, <I>First,</I> Why the little ones' angels have such a charge 
 concerning them, and attend upon them; it is in pursuance of Christ's 
 design to save them. Note, The ministration of angels is founded in the 
 mediation of Christ; through him angels are reconciled to us; and, when 
 they celebrated God's goodwill toward men, to it they annexed their 
 own. <I>Secondly,</I> Why they are not to be despised; because Christ
 came to save them, to save them that are lost, the little ones that are 
 lost in their own eyes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:3">Isa. lxvi. 3</A>),

 that are at a loss within themselves. Or rather, the children of men. 
 Note, 

 1. Our souls by nature are lost souls; as a traveller is lost, that is
 out of his way, as a convicted prisoner is lost. God lost the service 
 of fallen man, lost the honour he should have had from him. 

 2. Christ's errand into the world was to <I>save that which was
 lost,</I> to reduce us to our allegiance, restore us to our work, 
 reinstate us in our privileges, and so to put us into the right way 
 that leads to our great end; to save those that are spiritually lost 
 from being eternally so. 

 3. This is a good reason why the least and weakest believers should not
 be despised or offended. If Christ put such a value upon them, let us
 not undervalue them. If he denied himself so much for their salvation, 
 surely we should deny ourselves for their edification and consolation.
 See this argument urged,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:15,1Co+8:11,12">Rom. xiv. 15; 1 Cor. viii. 11, 12</A>.

 Nay, if Christ came into the world to save souls, and his heart is so
 much upon that work, he will reckon severely with those that obstruct 
 and hinder it, by obstructing the progress of those that are setting 
 their faces heavenward, and so thwart his great design.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The tender regard which our heavenly Father has to these little 
 ones, and his concern for their welfare. This is illustrated by a 
 comparison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.

 Observe the gradation of the argument; the angels of God are their 
 servants, the Son of God is their Saviour, and, to complete their 
 honour, God himself is their Friend. <I>None shall pluck them out of my 
 Father's hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:28">John x. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, <I>First,</I> The comparison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 The owner that had lost one sheep out of a hundred, does not slight it, 
 but diligently enquires after it, is greatly pleased when he has found 
 it, and has in that a sensible and affecting joy, more than in the 
 ninety and nine that wandered not. The fear he was in of losing that 
 one, and the surprise of finding it, add to the joy. Now this is 
 applicable, 

 1. To the state of fallen man in general; he is strayed like a lost
 sheep, the angels that stood were as the ninety-nine that never went 
 astray; wandering man is sought upon the mountains, which Christ, in 
 great fatigue, traversed in pursuit of him, and he is found; which is a 
 matter of joy. Greater joy there is in heaven for returning sinners 
 than for remaining angels. 

 2. To particular believers, who are offended and put out of their way 
 by the stumbling-blocks that are laid in their way, or the wiles of 
 those who seduce them out of the way. Now though but one of a hundred 
 should hereby be driven off, as sheep easily are, yet that one shall be 
 looked after with a great deal of care, the return of it welcomed with 
 a great deal of pleasure; and therefore the wrong done to it, no doubt, 
 will be reckoned for with a great deal of displeasure. If there be joy 
 in heaven for the finding of one of these little ones, there is wrath 
 in heaven for the offending of them. Note, God is graciously concerned, 
 not only for his flock in general, but for every lamb, or sheep, that 
 belongs to it. Though they are many, yet out of those many he can 
 easily miss one, for he is a <I>great</I> Shepherd, but not so easily 
 lose it, for he is a <I>good</I> Shepherd, and takes a more particular 
 cognizance of his flock than ever any did; for he <I>calls his own 
 sheep by name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:3">John x. 3</A>.

 See a full exposition of this parable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:2,10,16,19">Ezek. xxxiv. 2, 10, 16, 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The application of this comparison 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 <I>It is not the will of your Father, that one of these little ones 
 should perish.</I> More is implied than is expressed. It is not his 
 will that any should perish, but, 

 1. It is his will, that these little ones should be saved; it is the
 will of his design and delight: he has designed it, and set his heart 
 upon it, and he will effect it; it is the will of his precept, that all 
 should do what they can to further it, and nothing to hinder it.

 2. This care extends itself to every particular member of the flock,
 even the meanest. We think if but <I>one</I> or <I>two</I> be offended 
 and ensnared, it is no great matter, we need not mind it; but God's 
 thoughts of love and tenderness are above ours.

 3. It is intimated that those who do any thing by which any of these
 little ones are brought into danger of perishing, contradict the will 
 of God, and highly provoke him; and though they cannot prevail in it, 
 yet they will be reckoned with for it by him, who, in his saints, as in 
 other things, is jealous of his honour, and will not bear to have it 
 trampled on. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:15">Isa. iii. 15</A>,

 <I>What mean ye, that ye beat my people?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:8,9">Ps. lxxvi. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, Christ called God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>,

 <I>my Father which is in heaven;</I> he calls him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 <I>your Father which is in heaven;</I> intimating that he is not 
 ashamed to call his poor disciples <I>brethren;</I> for have not he and 
 they one Father? <I>I ascend to my Father and your Father</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17">John xx. 17</A>);

 therefore ours because his. This intimates likewise the ground of the 
 safety of his little ones; that God is their Father, and is therefore 
 inclined to succour them. A father takes care of all his children, but 
 is particularly tender of the little ones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:13">Gen. xxxiii. 13</A>.

 He is their Father in heaven, a place of prospect, and therefore he
 sees all the indignities offered them; and a place of power, therefore 
 he is able to avenge them. This comforts offended little ones, that 
 their Witness is in heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:19">Job xvi. 19</A>),
 
 their Judge is there,

 Christ, having cautioned his disciples not to give offence, comes next 
 to direct them what they must do in case of offences given them; which 
 may be understood either of personal injuries, and then these 
 directions are intended for the preserving of the peace of the church; 
 or of public scandals, and then they are intended for the preserving of 
 the purity and beauty of the church. Let us consider it both ways.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let us apply it to the quarrels that happen, upon any account, among 
 Christians. If thy brother trespass against thee, by grieving thy soul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:12">1 Cor. viii. 12</A>),

 by affronting thee, or putting contempt or abuse upon thee; if he 
 blemish thy good name by false reports or tale-bearing; if he encroach 
 on thy rights, or be any way injurious to thee in thy estate; if he be 
 guilty of any of those trespasses that are specified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+6:2,3">Lev. vi. 2, 3</A>;

 if he transgress the laws of justice, charity, or relative duties; 
 these are trespasses against us, and often happen among Christ's 
 disciples, and sometimes, for want of prudence, are of very mischievous 
 consequence. Now observe what is the rule prescribed in this case,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Go, and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.</I> Let 
 this be compared with, and explained by, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:17">Lev. xix. 17</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart;</I> that is, "If thou
 hast conceived a displeasure at thy brother for any injury he hath done
 thee, do not suffer thy resentments to ripen into a secret malice (like
 a wound, which is most dangerous when it bleed inwardly), but give vent
 to them in a mild and grave admonition, let them so spend themselves,
 and they will expire the sooner; do not go and rail against him behind
 his back, but <I>thou shalt in any ways reprove him.</I> If he has
 indeed done thee a considerable wrong, endeavour to make him sensible
 of it, but let the rebuke be private, between thee and him alone; if
 thou wouldest convince him, do not expose him, for that will but
 exasperate him, and make the reproof look like a revenge." this agrees
 with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:8,9">Prov. xxv. 8, 9</A>,

 "<I>Go not forth hastily to strive,</I> but <I>debate thy cause with 
 thy neighbour himself,</I> argue it calmly and amicably; and <I>if he 
 shall hear thee,</I> well and good, <I>thou hast gained thy 
 brother,</I> there is an end of the controversy, and it is a happy end; 
 let no more be said of it, but let the falling out of friends be the 
 renewing of friendship."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. "<I>If he will not hear thee,</I> if he will not own himself in a 
 fault, nor come to an agreement, yet do not despair, but try what he 
 will say to it, if thou take <I>one or two or more,</I> not only to be 
 witnesses of what passes, but to reason the case further with him; he 
 will be the more likely to hearken to them because they are 
 disinterested; and if reason will rule him, the word of reason in the 
 mouth of two or three witnesses will be better spoken to him" (<I>Plus
 vident oculi quam oculus--Many eyes see more than one</I>), "and more
 regarded by him, and perhaps it will influence him to acknowledge his 
 error, and to say, <I>I repent.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. "If <I>he shall neglect to hear them,</I> and will not refer the 
 matter to their arbitration, then <I>tell it to the church,</I> to the 
 ministers, elders, or other officers, or the most considerable persons 
 in the congregation you belong to, make them the referees to 
 accommodate the matter, and do not presently appeal to the magistrate, 
 or fetch a writ for him." This is fully explained by the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:1-20">1 Cor. vi.</A>),

 where he reproves those that went to law before the unjust, and not
 before the saints 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and would have the saints to judge those small matters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 that pertain to this life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 If you ask, "Who is <I>the church</I> that must be told?" the apostle 
 directs there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>Is there not a wise man among you?</I> Those of the church that are 
 presumed to be most capable of determining such matters; and he speaks 
 ironically, when he says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 "<I>Set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church;</I> those, 
 if there be no better, those, rather than suffer an irreconcileable 
 breach between two church members." This rule was then in a special 
 manner requisite, when the civil government was in the hands of such as 
 were not only aliens, but enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. "If he will not <I>hear the church,</I> will not stand to their 
 award, but persists in the wrong he has done thee, and proceeds to do 
 thee further wrong, <I>let him be to thee as a heathen man, and a 
 publican;</I> take the benefit of the law against him, but let that 
 always be the last remedy; appeal not to the courts of justice till 
 thou hast first tried all other means to compromise the matter in 
 variance. Or thou mayest, if thou wilt, break off thy friendship and 
 familiarity with him; though thou must by no means study revenge, yet 
 thou mayest choose whether thou wilt have any dealings with him, at 
 least, in such a way as may give him an opportunity of doing the like 
 again. Thou wouldest have healed him, wouldest have preserved his 
 friendship, but he would not, and so has forfeited it." If a man cheat 
 and abuse me once, it is his fault; if twice, it is my own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us apply it to scandalous sins, which are an offence to the 
 little ones, of bad example to those that are weak and pliable, and of 
 great grief to those that are weak and timorous. Christ, having taught 
 us to indulge the weakness of our brethren, here cautions us not to 
 indulge their wickedness under pretence of that. Christ, designing to 
 erect a church for himself in the world, here took care for the 
 preservation, 

 1. Of its purity, that it might have an expulsive faculty, a power to
 cleanse and clear itself, like a fountain of living waters, which is 
 necessary as long as the net of the gospel brings up both good fish and 
 bad. 

 2. Of its peace and order, that every member may know his place and 
 duty, and the purity of it may be preserved in a regular way and not 
 tumultuously. Now let us see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What is the case supposed? <I>If thy brother trespass against 
 thee.</I> 

 [1.] "The offender is a brother, one that is in Christian communion, 
 that is baptized, that hears the word, and prays with thee, with whom 
 thou joinest in the worship of God, statedly or occasionally." Note, 
 Church discipline is for church members. <I>Them that are without God 
 judges,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:12,13">1 Cor. v. 12, 13</A>.

 When any trespass is done against us, it is good to remember that the
 trespasser is a brother, which furnishes us with qualifying 
 consideration.

 [2.] "The offense is a trespass against thee; if thy brother sin 
 against thee (so the word is), if he do any thing which is offensive to 
 thee as a Christian." Note, A gross sin against God is a trespass 
 against his people, who have a true concern for his honour. Christ and 
 believers have twisted interests; what is done against them Christ 
 takes as done against himself, and what is done against him they cannot 
 but take as done against themselves. <I>The reproaches of them that
 reproached thee are fallen upon me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:9">Ps. lxix. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What is to be done in this case. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The rules prescribed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.
 
 Proceed in this method:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First, "Go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.</I> Do 
 not stay till he comes to thee, but go to him, as the physician visits 
 the patient, and the shepherd goes after the lost sheep." Note, We 
 should think no pains too much to take for the recovering of a sinner 
 to repentance. "<I>Tell him his fault,</I> remind him of what he has 
 done, and of the evil of it, <I>show him his abominations.</I>" Note, 
 People are loth to see their faults, and have need to be told of them. 
 Though the fact is plain, and the fault too, yet they must be put 
 together with application. Great sins often amuse conscience, and for 
 the present stupify and silence it; and there is need of help to awaken 
 it. David's own heart smote him, when he had cut off Saul's skirt, and 
 when he had numbered the people; but (which is very strange) we do not 
 find that it smote him in the matter of Uriah, till Nathan told him, 
 <I>Thou art the man.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 "Tell him his fault, <B><I>elenxon auton</I></B>--<I>argue the case with
 him</I>" (so the word signifies); "and do it with reason and argument, 
 not with passion." Where the fault is plain and great, the person 
 proper for us to deal with, and we have an opportunity for it, and 
 there is no apparent danger of doing more hurt than good, we must with 
 meekness and faithfulness tell people of what is amiss in them. 
 Christian reproof is an ordinance of Christ for the bringing of sinners 
 to repentance, and must be managed as an ordinance. "Let the reproof be 
 private, between thee and him alone; that it may appear you seek not 
 his reproach, but his repentance." Note, It is a good rule, which 
 should ordinarily be observed among Christians, not to speak of our 
 brethren's faults to others, till we have first spoken of them to 
 themselves, this would make less reproaching and more reproving; that 
 is, less sin committed, and more duty done. It will be likely to work 
 upon an offender, when he sees his reprover concerned not only for his 
 salvation, in telling him his fault, but for his reputation in telling 
 him of it privately.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 "<I>If he shall hear thee</I>" --that is, "heed thee--if he be wrought
 upon by the reproof, it is well, <I>thou hast gained thy brother;</I> 
 thou hast helped to save him from sin and ruin, and it will be thy 
 credit and comfort," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:19,20">James v. 19, 20</A>.

 Note, The converting of a soul is the winning of that soul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:30">Prov. xi. 30</A>);

 and we should covet it, and labour after it, as gain to us; and, if the
 loss of a soul be a great loss, the gain of a soul is sure no small 
 gain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> If that doth not prevail, <I>then take with thee one 
 or two more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Note, We must not be weary of well-doing, though we see not presently 
 the good success of it. "If he will not hear thee, yet do not give him 
 up as in a desperate case; say not, It will be to no purpose to deal 
 with him any further; but go on in the use of other means; even those 
 that harden their necks must be often reproved, and those that oppose 
 themselves instructed in meekness." In work of this kind we must 
 <I>travail in birth again</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:19">Gal. iv. 19</A>);
 
 and it is after many pains and throes that the child is born.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 "<I>Take with thee one or two more;</I> 

 1. To assist thee; they may speak some pertinent convincing word which
 thou didst not think of, and may manage the matter with more prudence 
 than thou didst." note, Christians should see their need of help in 
 doing good, and pray in the aid one of another; as in other things, so 
 in giving reproofs, that the duty may be done, and may be done well. 

 2. "To affect him; he will be the more likely to be humbled for his
 fault, when he sees it witnessed against by <I>two or three.</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:15">Deut. xix. 15</A>.

 Note, Those should think it high time to repent and reform, who see
 their misconduct become a general offence and scandal. Though in such a 
 world as this it is rare to find one good whom <I>all men speak well 
 of,</I> yet it is more rare to find one good whom <I>all men speak ill 
 of.</I>

 3. "To be witnesses of his conduct, in case the matter should afterward
 be brought before the church." None should come under the censure of 
 the church as obstinate and contumacious, till it be very well proved 
 that they are so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly, If he neglect to hear them,</I> and will not be humbled, 
 <I>then tell it to the church,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 There are some stubborn spirits to whom the likeliest means of 
 conviction prove ineffectual; yet such must not be given over as 
 incurable, but let the matter be made more public, and further help 
 called in. Note, 

 1. Private admonitions must always go before public censures; if
 gentler methods will do the work, those that are more rough and severe 
 must not be used,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:10">Tit. iii. 10</A>.

 Those that will be reasoned out of their sins, need not be shamed out
 of them. Let God's work be done effectually, but with as little noise 
 as may be; his kingdom comes with power, but not with observation. But, 
 
 2. Where private admonition does not prevail, there public censure must 
 take place. The church must receive the complaints of the offended, and 
 rebuke the sins of the offenders, and judge between them, after an 
 impartial enquiry made into the merits of the cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Tell it to the church.</I> It is a thousand pities that this 
 appointment of Christ, which was designed to end differences, and 
 remove offences, should itself be so much a matter of debate, and 
 occasion differences and offences, through the corruption of men's 
 hearts. What church must be told--is the great question. The civil
 magistrate, say some; The Jewish sanhedrim then in being, say others; 
 but by what follows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,

 it is plain that he means a Christian church, which, though not yet 
 formed, was now in the embryo. "<I>Tell it to the church,</I> that 
 particular church in the communion of which the offender lives; make 
 the matter known to those of that congregation who are by consent 
 appointed to receive informations of that kind. Tell it to the guides 
 and governors of the church, the minister or ministers, the elders or 
 deacons, or (if such the constitution of the society be) tell it to the 
 representatives or heads of the congregation, or to all the members of 
 it; let them examine the matter and, if they find the complaint 
 frivolous and groundless, let them rebuke the complainant; if they find 
 it just, let them rebuke the offender, and call him to repentance, and 
 this will be likely to put an edge and an efficacy upon the reproof, 
 because given," 

 1. "With greater solemnity," and, 

 2. "With greater authority." It is an awful thing to receive a reproof 
 from a church, from a minister, a reprover by office; and therefore it 
 is the more regarded by such as pay any deference to an institution of 
 Christ and his ambassadors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly, "If he neglect to hear the church,</I> if he slight the 
 admonition, and will neither be ashamed of his faults, nor amend them, 
 <I>let him be unto thee as a heathen man and publican;</I> let him be 
 cast out of the communion of the church, secluded from special 
 ordinances, degraded from the dignity of a church member, let him be 
 put under disgrace, and let the members of the society be warned to 
 withdraw from him, that he may be ashamed of his sin, and they may not 
 be infected by it, or made chargeable with it." Those who put contempt 
 on the orders and rules of a society, and bring reproach upon it, 
 forfeit the honours and privileges of it, and are justly laid aside 
 till they repent and submit, and reconcile themselves to it again. 
 Christ has appointed this method for the vindicating of the church's 
 honour, the preserving of its purity, and the conviction and 
 reformation of those that are scandalous. But observe, he doth not say, 
 "Let him be to thee as a devil or damned spirit, as one whose case is 
 desperate," but "as a heathen and a publican, as one in a capacity of 
 being restored and received in again. Count him not as an enemy, but 
 admonish him as a brother." The directions given to the church of 
 Corinth concerning the incestuous person, agree with the rules here; he 
 must be <I>taken away from among them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:2">1 Cor. v. 2</A>),

 must be <I>delivered to Satan;</I> for if he be cast out of Christ's 
 kingdom, he is looked upon as belonging to Satan's kingdom; they must 
 not keep company with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:11,13"><I>v.</I> 11, 13</A>.

 But when by this he is humbled and reclaimed, he must be welcomed into 
 communion again, and all shall be well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Here is a warrant signed for the ratification of all the church's 
 proceedings according to these rules, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 What was said before to Peter is here said to all the disciples, and in 
 them to all the faithful office-bearers in the church, to the world's 
 end. While ministers preach the word of Christ faithfully, and in their 
 government of the church strictly adhere to his laws (<I>clave non 
 errante--the key not turning the wrong way</I>), they may be assured 
 that he will own them, and stand by them, and will ratify what they say 
 and do, so that it shall be taken as said and done by himself. He will 
 own them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> In their sentence of suspension; <I>Whatsoever ye shall 
 bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.</I> If the censures of the 
 church duly follow the institution of Christ, his judgments will follow 
 the censures of the church, his spiritual judgments, which are the 
 sorest of all other, such as the rejected Jews fell under 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8">Rom. xi. 8</A>),
 
 a <I>spirit of slumber;</I> for Christ will not suffer his own 
 ordinances to be trampled upon, but will say <I>amen</I> to the 
 righteous sentences which the church passes on obstinate offenders. How 
 light soever proud scorners may make of the censures of the church, let 
 them know that they are confirmed in the court of heaven; and it is in 
 vain for them to appeal to that court, for judgment is there already 
 given against them. They that are shut out from the <I>congregation of 
 the righteous</I> now shall not <I>stand in it</I> in the great day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:5">Ps. i. 5</A>.

 Christ will not own those as his, nor receive them to himself, whom the
 church has duly delivered to Satan; but, if through error or envy the 
 censures of the church be unjust, Christ will graciously find those who 
 are so cast out,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:34,35">John ix. 34, 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> In their sentence of absolution; <I>Whatsoever ye 
 shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</I> Note, 

 1. No church censures bind so fast, but that, upon the sinner's
 repentance and reformation, they may and must be loosed again.
 Sufficient is the punishment which has attained its end, and the 
 offender must then be forgiven and comforted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:6">2 Cor. ii. 6</A>.

 There is no unpassable gulf fixed but that between hell and heaven.

 2. Those who, upon their repentance, are received by the church into 
 communion again may take the comfort of their absolution in heaven, if 
 their hearts be upright with God. As suspension is for the terror of 
 the obstinate, so absolution is for the encouragement of the penitent. 
 St. Paul speaks in the person of Christ, when he saith, <I>To whom ye 
 forgive any thing, I forgive also,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:10">2 Cor. ii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now it is a great honour which Christ here puts upon the church, that 
 he will condescend not only to take cognizance of their sentences, but 
 to confirm them; and in the following verses we have two things laid 
 down as ground of this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God's readiness to answer the church's prayers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 <I>If two of you shall agree</I> harmoniously, <I>touching any thing 
 that they shall ask, it shall be done for them.</I> Apply this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] In general, to all the requests of the faithful praying seed of 
 Jacob; they shall not <I>seek God's face in vain.</I> Many promises we 
 have in scripture of a gracious answer to the prayers of faith, but 
 this gives a particular encouragement to the joint-prayer; "the 
 requests which two of you agree in, much more which many agree in." No 
 law of heaven limits the number of petitioners. Note, Christ has been 
 pleased to put an honour upon, and to allow a special efficacy in, the 
 joint-prayers of the faithful, and the common supplications they make 
 to God. If they join in the same prayer, if they meet by appointment to 
 come together to the throne of grace on some special errand, or, though 
 at a distance, agree in some particular matter of prayer, they shall 
 speed well. Besides the general regard God has to the prayers of the 
 saints, he is particularly pleased with their union and communion in 
 those prayers. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:13,Ac+4:31">2 Chron. v. 13; Acts iv. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] In particular, to those requests that are put up to God about 
 binding and loosing; to which this promise seems more especially to 
 refer. Observe, <I>First,</I> That the power of church discipline is 
 not here lodged in the hand of a single person, but two, at least, are 
 supposed to be concerned in it. When the incestuous Corinthian was to 
 be cast out, the church was gathered together 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:4">1 Cor. v. 4</A>),

 and it was a punishment inflicted of many, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:6">2 Cor. ii. 6</A>.

 In an affair of such importance, <I>two are better than one, and in the 
 multitude of counsellors there is safety. Secondly,</I> It is good to 
 see those who have the management of church discipline, agreeing in it. 
 Heats and animosities, among those whose work it is to remove offences, 
 will be the greatest offence of all. <I>Thirdly,</I> Prayer must 
 evermore go along with church discipline. Pass no sentence, which you 
 cannot in faith ask God to confirm. The binding and loosing spoken of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:19"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 19</A>)
 
 was done by preaching, this by praying. Thus the whole power of gospel
 ministers is resolved into the word and prayer, to which they must 
 wholly give themselves. He doth not say, "If you shall agree to 
 sentence and decree a thing, it shall be done" (as if ministers were 
 judges and lords); but, "If you agree to ask it of God, from him you 
 shall obtain it." Prayer must go along with all our endeavours for the 
 conversion of sinners; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:16">Jas. v. 16</A>.

 <I>Fourthly,</I> The unanimous petitions of the church of God, for the
 ratification of their just censures, shall be heard in heaven, and 
 obtain an answer; "<I>It shall be done,</I> it shall be bound and 
 loosed in heaven; God will set his fiat to the appeals and applications 
 you make to him." If Christ (who here speaks as one having authority) 
 say, "It shall be done," we may be assured that it is done, though we 
 see not the effect in the way that we look for it. God doth especially 
 own and accept us, when we are praying for those that have offended him 
 and us. <I>The Lord turned the captivity of Job,</I> not when he prayed 
 for himself, but when he prayed for his friends who had trespassed 
 against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The presence of Christ in the assemblies of Christians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 Every believer has the presence of Christ with him; but the promise 
 here refers to the meetings where two or three are gathered in his 
 name, not only for discipline, but for religious worship, or any act of 
 Christian communion. Assemblies of Christians for holy purposes are 
 hereby appointed, directed, and encouraged.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They are hereby appointed; the church of Christ in the world 
 exists most visibly in religious assemblies; it is the will of Christ 
 that these should be set up, and kept up, for the honour of God, the 
 edification of men, and the preserving of a face of religion upon the 
 world. When God intends special answers to prayer, he calls for a 
 solemn assembly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:15,16">Joel ii. 15, 16</A>.

 If there be no liberty and opportunity for large and numerous
 assemblies, yet then it is the will of God that two or three should 
 gather together, to show their good-will to the great congregation. 
 Note, When we cannot do what we would in religion, we must do as we 
 can, and God will accept us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] They are hereby directed to gather together in Christ's name. In 
 the exercise of church discipline, they must <I>come together in the 
 name of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:4">1 Cor. v. 4</A>.

 That name gives to what they do an authority on earth, and an
 acceptableness in heaven. In meeting or worship, we must have an eye to 
 Christ; must come together by virtue of his warrant and appointment, in 
 token of our relation to him, professing faith in him, and in communion 
 with all that in every place call upon him. When we come together, to 
 worship God in a dependence upon the Spirit and grace of Christ as 
 Mediator for assistance, and upon his merit and righteousness as 
 Mediator for acceptance, having an actual regard to him as our Way to 
 the Father, and our Advocate with the Father, then we are met together 
 in his name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] They are hereby encouraged with an assurance of the presence of 
 Christ; <I>There am I in the midst of them.</I> By his common presence 
 he is in all places, as God; but this is a promise of his special 
 presence. Where his saints are, his sanctuary is, and there he will 
 dwell; it is his rest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:14">Ps. cxxxii. 14</A>),
 
 it is his walk 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:1">Rev. ii. 1</A>);

 he is in the midst of them, to quicken and strengthen them, to refresh 
 and comfort them, as the sun in the midst of the universe. He is in the 
 midst of them, that is, in their hearts; it is a spiritual presence, 
 the presence of Christ's Spirit with their spirits, that is here 
 intended. <I>There am I,</I> not only <I>I will be</I> there, but <I>I 
 am there;</I> as if he came first, is ready before them, they shall 
 find him there; he repeated this promise at parting

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 20</A>),

 <I>Lo, I am with you always.</I> Note, The presence of Christ in the
 assemblies of Christians is promised, and may in faith be prayed for 
 and depended on; <I>There am I.</I> This is equivalent to the 
 Shechinah, or special presence of God in the tabernacle and temple of 
 old, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+40:34,2Ch+5:14">Exod. xl. 34; 2 Chron. v. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though but two or three are met together, Christ is among them; this is 
 an encouragement to the meeting of a few, when it is either, 
 <I>First,</I> of choice. Besides the secret worship performed by 
 particular persons, and the public services of the whole congregation, 
 there may be occasion sometimes for two or three to come together, 
 either for mutual assistance in conference or joint assistance in 
 prayer, not in contempt of public worship, but in concurrence with it; 
 there Christ will be present. Or, <I>Secondly,</I> By constraint; when 
 there are not more than two or three to come together, or, if there be, 
 they dare not, <I>for fear of the Jews,</I> yet Christ will be <I>in 
 the midst of them,</I> for it is not the multitude, but the faith and 
 sincere devotion, of the worshippers, that invites the presence of 
 Christ; and though there be but two or three, the smallest number that 
 can be, yet, it Christ make one among them, who is the principal one, 
 their meeting is as honourable and comfortable as if they were two or 
 three thousand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my
 brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
 &nbsp; 22  Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven
 times: but, Until seventy times seven.
 &nbsp; 23  Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain
 king, which would take account of his servants.
 &nbsp; 24  And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him,
 which owed him ten thousand talents.
 &nbsp; 25  But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him
 to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and
 payment to be made.
 &nbsp; 26  The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,
 Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
 &nbsp; 27  Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
 loosed him, and forgave him the debt.
 &nbsp; 28  But the same servant went out, and found one of his
 fellow-servants, which owed him a hundred pence: and he laid
 hands on him, and took <I>him</I> by the throat, saying, Pay me that
 thou owest.
 &nbsp; 29  And his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and besought
 him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
 &nbsp; 30  And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he
 should pay the debt.
 &nbsp; 31  So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were very
 sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.
 &nbsp; 32  Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him,
 O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou
 desiredst me:
 &nbsp; 33  Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
 fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?
 &nbsp; 34  And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors,
 till he should pay all that was due unto him.
 &nbsp; 35  So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye
 from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their
 trespasses.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This part of the discourse concerning offences is certainly to be 
 understood of personal wrongs, which is in our power to forgive. Now 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Peter's question concerning this matter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 <I>Lord, how oft shall my brother trespass against me, and I forgive 
 him?</I> Will it suffice to do it <I>seven times?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He takes it for granted that he must forgive; Christ had before 
 taught his disciples this lesson 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:14,15"><I>ch.</I> vi. 14, 15</A>),

 and Peter has not forgotten it. He knows that he must not only not bear
 a grudge against his brother, or meditate revenge, but be as good a 
 friend as ever, and forget the injury.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He thinks it is a great matter to forgive till seven times; he means 
 not <I>seven times a day,</I> as Christ said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:4">Luke xvii. 4</A>),

 but seven times in his life; supposing that if a man had any way abused 
 him seven times, though he were ever so desirous to be reconciled, he 
 might then abandon his society, and have no more to do with him. 
 Perhaps Peter had an eye to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:16">Prov. xxiv. 16</A>.

 <I>A just man falleth seven times;</I> or to the mention of <I>three 
 transgressions,</I> and <I>four,</I> which God would no more pass by, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:1">Amos ii. 1</A>.

 Note, There is a proneness in our corrupt nature to stint ourselves in
 that which is good, and to be afraid of doing too much in religion, 
 particularly of forgiving too much, though we have so much forgiven 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's direct answer to Peter's question; <I>I say not unto thee, 
 Until seven times</I> (he never intended to set up any such bounds), 
 but, <I>Until seventy times seven;</I> a certain number for an 
 indefinite one, but a great one. Note, It does not look well for us to 
 keep count of the offences done against us by our brethren. There is 
 something of ill-nature in scoring up the injuries we forgive, as if we 
 would allow ourselves to be revenged when the measure is full. God 
 keeps an account 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:34">Deut. xxxii. 34</A>),

 because he is the Judge, and vengeance is his; but we must not, lest we 
 be found stepping into his throne. It is necessary to the preservation 
 of peace, both within and without, to pass by injuries, without 
 reckoning how often; to forgive, and forget. God multiplies his
 pardons, and so should we, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:38,40">Ps. lxxvii. 38, 40</A>.

 It intimates that we should make it our constant practice to forgive
 injuries, and should accustom ourselves to it till it becomes 
 habitual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A further discourse of our Saviour's, by way of parable, to show 
 the necessity of forgiving the injuries that are done to us. Parables 
 are of use, not only for the pressing of Christian duties; for they 
 make and leave an impression. The parable is a comment upon the fifth 
 petition of the Lord's prayer, <I>Forgive us our trespasses, as we 
 forgive them that trespass against us.</I> Those, and those only, may 
 expect to be forgiven of God, who forgive their brethren. The parable 
 represents the <I>kingdom of heaven,</I> that is, the church, and the 
 administration of the gospel dispensation in it. The church is God's 
 family, it is his court; there he dwells, there he rules. God is our 
 master; his servants we are, at least in profession and obligation. In
 general, the parable intimates how much provocation God has from his 
 family on earth, and how untoward his servants are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There are three things in the parable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The master's wonderful clemency to his servant who was indebted to 
 him; he forgave him ten thousand talents, out of pure compassion to 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:23-27"><I>v.</I> 23-27</A>.
 
 Where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Every sin we commit is a debt to God; not like a debt to an equal, 
 contracted by buying or borrowing, but to a superior; like a debt to a 
 prince when a recognizance is forfeited, or a penalty incurred by a 
 breech of the law or a breach of the peace; like the debt of a servant 
 to his master, by withholding his service, wasting his lord's goods, 
 breaking his indentures, and incurring the penalty. We are all debtors; 
 we owe satisfaction, and are liable to the process of the law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) There is an account kept of these debts, and we must shortly be 
 reckoned with for them. This king <I>would take account of his 
 servants.</I> God now reckons with us by our own consciences; 
 conscience is an auditor for God in the soul, to call us to account, 
 and to account with us. One of the first questions that an awakened 
 Christian asks, is, <I>How much owest thou unto my Lord?</I> And unless 
 it be bribed, it will tell the truth, and not write fifty for a 
 hundred. There is another day of reckoning coming, when these accounts 
 will be called over, and either passed or disallowed, and nothing but 
 the blood of Christ will balance the account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The debt of sin is a very great debt; and some are more in debt, 
 by reason of sin, than others. When he <I>began to reckon,</I> one of 
 the first defaulters appeared to owe <I>ten thousand talents.</I> There 
 is no evading the enquiries of divine justice; your sin will be sure to 
 find you out. The debt was ten thousand talents, a vast sum, amounting 
 by computation to one million eight hundred and seventy-five thousand 
 pounds sterling; a king's ransom or a kingdom's subsidy, more likely 
 than a servant's debt; see what our sins are, 

 [1.] For the heinousness of their nature; they are talents, the 
 greatest denomination that ever was used in the account of money or 
 weight. Every sin is the load of a talent, <I>a talent of lead, this is 
 wickedness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:7,8">Zec. v. 7, 8</A>.

 The trusts committed to us, as stewards of the grace of God, are each
 of them a talent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:15"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 15</A>),

 a talent of gold, and for every one of them buried, much more for every
 one of them wasted, we are a talent in debt, and this raises the 
 account. 

 [2.] For the vastness of their number; they are ten thousand, a myriad, 
 more than <I>the hairs on our head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:12">Ps. xl. 12</A>.

 Who can understand <I>the number of his errors, or tell how oft he
 offends?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:12">Ps. xix. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The debt of sin is so great, that we are not able to pay it; <I>He 
 had not to pay.</I> Sinners are insolvent debtors; the scripture, 
 <I>which concludes all under sin,</I> is a statute of bankruptcy 
 against us all. Silver and gold would not pay our debt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:6,7">Ps. xlix. 6, 7</A>.
 
 Sacrifice and offering would not do it; our good works are but God's
 work in us, and cannot make satisfaction; we are without strength, and 
 cannot help ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) If God should deal with us in strict justice; we should be 
 condemned as insolvent debtors, and God might exact the debt by 
 glorifying himself in our utter ruin. Justice demands satisfaction, 
 <I>Currat, lex--Let the sentence of the law be executed.</I> The servant
 had contracted this debt by his wastefulness and wilfulness, and 
 therefore might justly be left to lie by it. <I>His lord commanded him 
 to be sold,</I> as a bond-slave into the galleys, sold to grind in the 
 prison-house; <I>his wife and children to be sold, and all that he had, 
 and payment to be made.</I> See here what every sin deserves; this is 
 <I>the wages of sin.</I> 

 [1.] To be sold. Those that <I>sell themselves to work wickedness,</I> 
 must be sold, to make satisfaction. Captives to sin are captives to 
 wrath. He that is sold for a bond-slave is deprived of all his 
 comforts, and has nothing left him but his life, that he may be 
 sensible of his miseries; which is the case of damned sinners. 

 [2.] Thus he would have <I>payment to be made,</I> that is, something 
 done towards it; though it is impossible that the sale of one so 
 worthless should amount to the payment of so great a debt. By the 
 damnation of sinners divine justice will be to eternity in the 
 satisfying, but never satisfied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Convinced sinners cannot but humble themselves before God, and 
 pray for mercy. <I>The servant,</I> under this charge, and this doom, 
 <I>fell down</I> at the feet of his royal master, <I>and worshipped 
 him;</I> or, as some copies read it, <I>he besought him;</I> his 
 address was very submissive and very importunate; <I>Have patience with 
 me, and I will pay thee all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 The servant knew before that he was so much in debt, and yet was under 
 no concern about it, till he was called to an account. Sinners are 
 commonly careless about the pardon of their sins, till they come under 
 the arrests of some awakening word, some startling providence, or 
 approaching death, and then, <I>Wherewith shall I come before the 
 Lord?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:6">Mic. vi. 6</A>.

 How easily, how quickly, can God bring the proudest sinner to his feet;
 Ahab to his sackcloth, Manasseh to his prayers, Pharaoh to his 
 confessions, Judas to his restitution, Simon Magus to his supplication, 
 Belshazzar and Felix to their tremblings. The stoutest heart will fail, 
 when God sets the sins in order before it. This servant doth not deny
 the debt, nor seek evasions, nor go about to abscond.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But, 

 [1.] He begs time; <I>Have patience with me.</I> Patience and 
 forbearance are a great favour, but it is folly to think that these 
 alone will save us; reprieves are not pardons. Many are borne with, who 
 are not thereby <I>brought to repentance</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:4">Rom. ii. 4</A>),

 and then their being borne with does them no kindness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He promises payment; <I>Have patience</I> awhile, <I>and I will 
 pay thee all.</I> Note, It is the folly of many who are under 
 convictions of sin, to imagine that they can make God satisfaction for 
 the wrong they have done him; as those who, like a compounding 
 bankrupt, would discharge the debt, by giving their <I>first-born for 
 their transgressions</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:7">Mic. vi. 7</A>),

 who <I>go about to establish their own righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:3">Rom. x. 3</A>.

 He that <I>had nothing to pay</I> with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)

 fancied he could pay <I>all.</I> See how close pride sticks, even to 
 awakened sinners; they are convinced, but not humbled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) The God of infinite mercy is very ready, out of pure compassion, 
 to forgive the sins of those that humble themselves before him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);
 
 <I>The lord of that servant,</I> when he might justly have ruined him, 
 mercifully released him; and, since he could not be satisfied by the 
 payment of the debt, he would be glorified by the pardon of it. The 
 servant's prayer was, <I>Have patience with me;</I> the master's grant 
 is a discharge in full. Note, 

 [1.] The pardon of sin is owing to the mercy of God, to his tender 
 mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:77,78">Luke i. 77, 78</A>);

 <I>He was moved with compassion.</I> God's reasons of mercy are fetched 
 from within himself; he has mercy <I>because he will have mercy.</I> 
 God looked with pity on mankind in general, because miserable, and sent 
 his Son to be a Surety for them; he looks with pity on particular 
 penitents, because sensible of their misery (their hearts broken and 
 contrite), and accepts them in the Beloved.

 [2.] There is forgiveness with God for the greatest sins, if they be 
 repented of. Though the debt was vastly great, he <I>forgave it
 all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Though our sins be very numerous and very heinous, yet, upon gospel 
 terms, they may be pardoned.

 [3.] The forgiving of the debt is the loosing of the debtor; <I>He 
 loosed him.</I> The obligation is cancelled, the judgment vacated; we 
 never walk at liberty till our sins are forgiven. But observe, Though 
 he discharged him from the penalty as a debtor, he did not discharge 
 him from his duty as a servant. The pardon of sin doth not slacken, but 
 strengthen, our obligations to obedience; and we must reckon it a 
 favour that God is pleased to continue such wasteful servants as we 
 have been in such a gainful service as his is, and should therefore 
 <I>deliver us, that we might serve him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74">Luke i. 74</A>.

 <I>I am thy servant, for thou hast loosed my bonds.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The servant's unreasonable severity toward his fellow-servant, 
 notwithstanding his lord's clemency toward him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:28-30"><I>v.</I> 28-30</A>.

 This represents the sin of those who, though they are not unjust in 
 demanding that which is not their own, yet are rigorous and unmerciful 
 in demanding that which is their own, to the utmost of right, which 
 sometimes proves a real wrong. <I>Summum jus summa injuria--Push a 
 claim to an extremity, and it becomes a wrong.</I> To exact 
 satisfaction for debts of injury, which tends neither to reparation nor 
 to the public good, but purely for revenge, though the law may allow 
 it, <I>in terrorem--in order to strike terror,</I> and for the hardness 
 of men's hearts, yet savours not of a Christian spirit. To sue for 
 money-debts, when the debt or cannot possibly pay them, and so let him 
 perish in prison, argues a greater love of money, and a less love of 
 our neighbour, than we ought to have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:7">Neh. v. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 (1.) How small the debt was, how very small, compared with the <I>ten 
 thousand talents</I> which his lord forgave him; <I>He owed him a 
 hundred pence,</I> about three pounds and half a crown of our money. 
 Note, Offences done to men are nothing to those which are committed 
 against God. Dishonours done to a man like ourselves are but as 
 <I>peace, motes, gnats;</I> but dishonours done to God are as 
 <I>talents, beams, camels.</I> Not that <I>therefore</I> we may make 
 light of wronging our neighbour, for that is also a sin against God; 
 but <I>therefore</I> we should make light of our neighbour's wronging 
 us, and not aggravate it, or study revenge. David was unconcerned as 
 the indignities done to him; <I>I, as a deaf man, heard not;</I> but 
 laid much to heart the sins committed against God; for them, <I>rivers 
 of tears ran down his eyes.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How severe the demand was; <I>He laid hands on him, and took him 
 by the throat.</I> Proud and angry men think, if the matter of their 
 demand be just, that will bear them out, though the manner of it be 
 ever so cruel and unmerciful; but it will not hold. What needed all 
 this violence? The debt might have been demanded without taking the 
 debtor by the throat; without sending for a writ, or setting the 
 bailiff upon him. How lordly is this man's carriage, and yet how base 
 and servile is his spirit! If he had been himself going to prison for
 his debt to his lord, his occasions would have been so pressing, that 
 he might have had some pretence for going to this extremity in 
 requiring his own; but frequently pride and malice prevail more to make 
 men severe than the most urgent necessity would do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) How submissive the debtor was; <I>His fellow servant,</I> though 
 his equal, yet knowing how much he lay at his mercy, <I>fell down at 
 his feet,</I> and humbled himself to him for this trifling debt, as 
 much as he did to his lord for that great debt; for <I>the borrower is 
 servant to the lender,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:7">Prov. xxii. 7</A>.

 Note, Those who cannot pay their debts ought to be very respectful to 
 their creditors, and not only give them good words, but do them all the 
 good offices they possibly can: they must not be angry at those who 
 claim their own, nor speak ill of them for it, no, not though they do 
 it in a rigorous manner, but in that case leave it to God to plead 
 their cause. The poor man's request is, <I>Have patience with me;</I> 
 he honestly confesses the debt, and puts not his creditor to the charge 
 of proving it, only begs time. Note, Forbearance, though it be no
 acquittance, is sometimes a piece of needful and laudable charity. As 
 we must not be hard, so we must not be hasty, in our demands, but think 
 how long God bears with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) How implacable and furious the creditor was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>);

 <I>He would not have patience with him,</I> would not hearken to his 
 fair promise, but without mercy <I>cast him into prison.</I> How 
 insolently did he trample upon one as good as himself, that submitted 
 to him! How cruelly did he use one that had done him no harm, and 
 though it would be no advantage to himself! In this, as in a glass, 
 unmerciful creditors may see their own faces, who take pleasure in 
 nothing more than to swallow up and destroy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:19">2 Sam. xx. 19</A>),

 and glory in having their poor debtors' bones.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) How much concerned the rest of the servants were; <I>They were 
 very sorry</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 sorry for the creditor's cruelty, and for the debtor's calamity. Note, 
 The sins and sufferings of our fellow-servants should be a matter of 
 grief and trouble to us. It is sad that any of our brethren should 
 either make themselves beast of prey, by cruelty and barbarity; or be 
 made beasts of slavery, by the inhuman usage of those who have power 
 over them. To see a fellow-servant, either raging like a bear or 
 trampled on like a worm, cannot but occasion great regret to all that 
 have any jealousy for the honour either of their nature of their 
 religion. See with what eye Solomon looked both upon <I>the tears of 
 the oppressed,</I> and <I>the power of the oppressors,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:1">Eccl. iv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) How notice of it was brought to the master; <I>They came, and told 
 their lord.</I> They durst not reprove their fellow-servant for it, he 
 was so unreasonable and outrageous (<I>let a bear robbed of her whelps 
 meet a man, rather than such a fool in his folly</I>); but they went to 
 their lord, and besought him to appear for the oppressed against the 
 oppressor. Note, That which gives us occasion for sorrow, should give 
 us occasion for prayer. Let our complaints both of the wickedness of 
 the wicked and of the afflictions of the afflicted, be brought to God, 
 and left with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The master's just resentment of the cruelty his servant was guilty 
 of. If the servants took it so ill, much more would the master, whose 
 compassions are infinitely above ours. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How he reproved his servant's cruelty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>);

 <I>O thou wicked servant.</I> Note, Unmercifulness is wickedness, it is 
 great wickedness.

 [1.] He upbraids him with the mercy he had found with his master; <I>I 
 forgive thee all that debt.</I> Those that will use God's favours, 
 shall never be upbraided with them, but those that abuse them, may 
 expect it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:20"><I>ch.</I> xi. 20</A>.

 Consider, It was <I>all that debt,</I> that great debt. Note, The
 greatness of sin magnifies the riches of pardoning mercy: we should 
 think <I>how much has been forgiven us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:47">Luke vii. 47</A>.

 [2.] He thence shows him the obligation he was under to be merciful to 
 his fellow-servant; <I>Shouldst not thou also have had compassion on 
 thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?</I> Note, It is justly 
 expected, that such as have received mercy, should show mercy. <I>Dat 
 ille veniam facile, cui venia est opus--He who needs forgiveness, 
 easily bestows it.</I> Senec. Agamemn. He shows him, <I>First,</I> That 
 he should have been more compassionate to the distress of his fellow 
 servant, because he had himself experienced the same distress. What we 
 have had the feeling of ourselves, we can the better have the fellow 
 feeling of with our brethren. <I>The Israelites knew the heart of a 
 stranger, for they were strangers;</I> and this servant should have 
 better known the heart of an arrested debtor, than to have been thus 
 hard upon such a one. <I>Secondly,</I> That he should have been more 
 conformable to the example of his master's tenderness, having himself 
 experienced it, so much to his advantage. Note, The comfortable sense 
 of pardoning mercy tends much to the disposing of our hearts to forgive 
 our brethren. It was in the close of the day o atonement that the 
 jubilee trumpet sounded <I>a release of debts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:9">Lev. xxv. 9</A>);

 for we must have compassion on our brethren, as God has on us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How he revoked his pardon and cancelled the acquittance, so that 
 the judgment against him revived 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 <I>He delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was 
 due unto him.</I> Though the wickedness was very great, his lord laid 
 upon him no other punishment than the payment of his own debt. Note, 
 Those that will not come up to the terms of the gospel need be no more 
 miserable than to be left open to the law, and to let that have its 
 course against them. See how the punishment answers the sin; he that 
 would not forgive shall not be forgiven; <I>He delivered him to the 
 tormentors;</I> the utmost he could do to his fellow servant was but to 
 cast him into prison, but he was himself delivered to the tormentors. 
 Note, The power of God's wrath to ruin us, goes far beyond the utmost 
 extent of any creature's strength and wrath. The reproaches and terrors 
 of his own conscience would be his tormentors, for that is a worm that 
 dies not; devils, the executioners of God's wrath, that are sinners' 
 tempters now, will be their tormentors for ever. He was sent to 
 Bridewell till he should pay all. Note, Our debts to God are never 
 compounded; either all is forgiven or all is exacted; glorified saints 
 in heaven are pardoned all, through Christ's complete satisfaction; 
 damned sinners in hell are paying all, that is, are punished for all. 
 The offence done to God by sin is in point of honour, which cannot be 
 compounded for without such a diminution as the case will by no means 
 admit, and therefore, some way or other, by the sinner or by his 
 surety, it must be satisfied.</P>

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is the application of the whole parable, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);
 
 <I>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you.</I> The title
 Christ here gives to God was made use of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>,

 in a comfortable promise; <I>It shall be done for them of my Father 
 which is in heaven;</I> here it is made use of in a terrible 
 threatening. If God's governing be fatherly, it follows thence, that it 
 is righteous, but it does not therefore follow that it is not rigorous, 
 or that under his government we must not be kept in awe by the fear of 
 the divine wrath. When we pray to God as <I>our Father in heaven,</I>
 we are taught to ask for <I>the forgiveness of sins, as we forgive our 
 debtors.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The duty of forgiving; we must <I>from our hearts</I> forgive. Note, 
 We do not forgive our offending brother aright, nor acceptably, if we 
 do not forgive from the heart; for that is it that God looks at. No 
 malice must be harboured there, nor ill will to any person, one or 
 another; no projects of revenge must be hatched there, nor desires of 
 it, as there are in many who outwardly appear peaceable and reconciled. 
 Yet this is not enough; we must from the heart desire and seek the 
 welfare even of those that have offended us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The danger of not forgiving; <I>So shall your heavenly Father 
 do.</I> 

 (1.) This is not intended to teach us that God reverses his pardons to 
 any, but that he denies them to those that are unqualified for them, 
 according to the tenour of the gospel; though having seemed to be 
 humbled, like Ahab, they thought themselves, and others thought them, 
 in a pardoned state, and they made bold with the comfort of it.
 Intimations enough we have in scripture of the forfeiture of pardons, 
 for caution to the presumptuous; and yet we have security enough of the 
 continuance of them, for comfort to those that are sincere, but 
 timorous; that the one may fear, and the other may hope. Those that do 
 not <I>forgive their brother's trespasses,</I> did never truly repent 
 of their own, nor ever truly believe the gospel; and therefore that 
 which is <I>taken away</I> is only what <I>they seemed to have,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:18">Luke viii. 18</A>.

 (2.) This is intended to teach us, that <I>they shall have judgment
 without mercy, that have showed no mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:13">Jam. ii. 13</A>.

 It is indispensably necessary to pardon and peace, that we not only
 <I>do justly,</I> but <I>love mercy.</I> It is an essential part of 
 that religion which is <I>pure and undefiled before God and the 
 Father,</I> of that <I>wisdom from above,</I> which <I>is gentle, and 
 easy to be entreated.</I> Look how <I>they</I> will answer it another 
 day, who, though they bear the Christian name, persist in the most 
 rigorous and unmerciful treatment of their brethren, as if the 
 strictest laws of Christ might be dispensed with for the gratifying of 
 their unbridled passions; and so they curse themselves every time they 
 say the Lord's prayer.</P>
