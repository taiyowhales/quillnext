 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn;
 and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of
 corn, and to eat.
 &nbsp; 2  But when the Pharisees saw <I>it,</I> they said unto him, Behold,
 thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath
 day.
 &nbsp; 3  But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when
 he was an hungred, and they that were with him;
 &nbsp; 4  How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the
 showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them
 which were with him, but only for the priests?
 &nbsp; 5  Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days
 the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
 &nbsp; 6  But I say unto you, That in this place is <I>one</I> greater than
 the temple.
 &nbsp; 7  But if ye had known what <I>this</I> meaneth, I will have mercy,
 and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
 &nbsp; 8  For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
 &nbsp; 9  And when he was departed thence, he went into their
 synagogue:
 &nbsp; 10  And, behold, there was a man which had <I>his</I> hand withered.
 And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath
 days? that they might accuse him.
 &nbsp; 11  And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you,
 that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the
 sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift <I>it</I> out?
 &nbsp; 12  How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is
 lawful to do well on the sabbath days.
 &nbsp; 13  Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
 stretched <I>it</I> forth; and it was restored whole, like as the
 other.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Jewish teachers had corrupted many of the commandments, by 
 interpreting them more loosely than they were intended; a mistake which 
 Christ discovered and rectified 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:1-48"><I>ch.</I> v.</A>)

 in his sermon on the mount: but concerning the fourth commandment, they
 had erred in the other extreme, and interpreted it too strictly. Note, 
 it is common for men of corrupt minds, by their zeal in rituals, and 
 the external services of religion, to think to atone for the looseness 
 of their morals. But they are cursed who <I>add to,</I> as well as they 
 who <I>take from, the words of this book,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:16,19,Pr+30:6">Rev. xxii. 16, 19; Prov. xxx. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now that which our Lord Jesus here lays down is, that the works of 
 necessity and mercy are lawful on the sabbath day, which the Jews in 
 many instances were taught to make a scruple of. Christ's industrious 
 explanation of the fourth commandment, intimates its perpetual 
 obligation to the religious observation of <I>one day in seven,</I> as 
 a <I>holy sabbath.</I> He would not expound a law that was immediately 
 to expire, but doubtless intended hereby to settle a point which would 
 be of use to his church in all ages; and so it is to teach us, that our 
 Christian sabbath, though under the direction of the fourth 
 commandment, is not under the injunctions of the Jewish elders.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is usual to settle the meaning of a law by judgments given upon 
 cases that happen in fact, and in like manner is the meaning of this 
 law settled. Here are two passages of story put together for this 
 purpose, happening at some distance of time from each other, and of a 
 different nature, but both answering this intention.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ, by justifying his disciples in plucking the ears of corn on 
 the sabbath-day, shows that <I>works of necessity</I> are <I>lawful</I> 
 on that day. Now here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What it was that the disciples did. They were following their Master 
 one sabbath day through a corn-field; it is likely they were going to 
 the synagogue 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 for it becomes not Christ's disciples to take <I>idle walks</I> on that 
 day, and <I>they were hungry;</I> let it be no disparagement to our 
 Master's house-keeping. But we will suppose they were so intent upon 
 the sabbath work, that they forgot to eat bread; had spent so much time 
 in their morning worship, that they had no time for their morning meal, 
 but came out fasting, because they would not come late to the 
 synagogue. Providence ordered it that they <I>went through the 
 corn,</I> and there they were supplied. Note, God has many ways of 
 bringing suitable provision to his people when they need it, and will 
 take particular care of them when they are going to the synagogue, as 
 of old for them that went up to Jerusalem to worship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:6,7">Ps. lxxxiv. 6, 7</A>),

 for whose use the rain filled the pools: while we are in the way of
 duty, <I>Jehovah-jireh,</I> let God alone to provide for us. Being in
 the corn-fields, they began to <I>pluck the ears of corn;</I> the law 
 of God allowed this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:25">Deut. xxiii. 25</A>),

 to teach people to be neighbourly, and not to insist upon property in a
 small matter, whereby another may be benefited. This was but slender 
 provision for Christ and his disciples, but it was the best they had, 
 and they were content with it. The famous Mr. Ball, of Whitmore, used 
 to say he had two dishes of meat to his sabbath dinner, a dish of hot 
 milk, and a dish of cold, and he had enough and enough.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What was the offence that the Pharisees took at this. It was but a 
 dry breakfast, yet the Pharisees would not let them eat that in 
 quietness. They did not quarrel with them for taking another man's corn 
 (they were no great zealots for justice), but for doing it <I>on the 
 sabbath day;</I> for plucking and rubbing the ears of corn of that day 
 was expressly forbidden by the tradition of the elders, for this 
 reason, because it was <I>a kind of reaping.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, It is no new thing for the most harmless and innocent actions of 
 Christ's disciples to be evil spoken of, and reflected upon as 
 unlawful, especially by those who are zealous for their own inventions 
 and impositions. The Pharisees complained of them to their Master for 
 doing that which it was not <I>lawful to do.</I> Note, Those are no 
 friends to Christ and his disciples, who make that to be unlawful which 
 God has not made to be so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What was Christ's answer to this cavil of the Pharisees. The 
 disciples could say little for themselves, especially because those who 
 quarrelled with them seemed to have the strictness of the sabbath
 sanctification on their side; and it is safest to err on that hand: but 
 Christ came to free his followers, not only from the corruptions of the 
 Pharisees, but from their unscriptural impositions, and therefore has 
 something to say for them, and justifies what they did, though it was a 
 transgression of the canon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He justifies them by precedents, which were allowed to be good by 
 the Pharisees themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He urges an ancient instance of David, who in a case of necessity 
 did that which otherwise he ought not to have done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>);

 "<I>Have ye not read</I> the story 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:6">1 Sam. xxi. 6</A>)

 of David's eating the show-bread, which by the law was appropriated to 
 the priest?" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:5-9">Lev. xxiv. 5-9</A>).

 <I>It is most holy to Aaron and his sons;</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+29:33">Exod. xxix. 33</A>)

 <I>a stranger shall not eat of it;</I> yet the priest gave it to David 
 and his men; for though the exception of a case of necessity was not 
 expressed, yet it was implied in that and all other ritual 
 institutions. That which bore out David in eating the show-bread was 
 not his dignity (Uzziah, that invaded the priest's office in the pride 
 of his heart, though a king, was struck with a leprosy for it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+26:16">2 Chron. xxvi. 16</A>,

 &c.), but his hunger. The greatest shall not have their lusts
 indulged, but the meanest shall have their wants considered. Hunger is 
 a natural desire which cannot be mortified, but must be gratified, and 
 cannot be put off with any thing but meat; therefore we say, It will 
 <I>break through stone walls.</I> Now the <I>Lord is for the body,</I> 
 and allowed his own appointment to be dispensed with in a case of 
 distress; much more might the tradition of the elders be dispensed 
 with. Note, That may be done in a case of necessity which may not be 
 done at another time; there are laws which necessity has not, but it is 
 a law to itself. <I>Men do not despise,</I> but pity, <I>a thief that 
 steals to satisfy his soul when he is hungry,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:30">Prov. vi. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He urges a daily instance of the priests, which they likewise 
 <I>read in the law,</I> and according to which was the constant usage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 <I>The priests in the temple</I> did a great deal of servile work on 
 the sabbath day; killing, flaying, burning the sacrificed beasts, which 
 in a common case would <I>have been profaning the sabbath;</I> and yet 
 it was never reckoned any transgression of the fourth commandment, 
 because the temple-service required and justified it. This intimates, 
 that those labours are lawful on the sabbath day which are necessary, 
 not only to the <I>support of life,</I> but to the <I>service of the 
 day;</I> as tolling a bell to call the congregation together, 
 travelling to church, and the like. Sabbath rest is to promote, not to 
 hinder, sabbath worship.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He justifies them by arguments, three cogent ones.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>In this place is one greater than the temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 If the temple-service would justify what the priests did in their 
 ministration, the service of Christ would much more justify the 
 disciples in what they did in their attendance upon him. The Jews had
 an extreme veneration for the temple: it <I>sanctified the gold;</I> 
 Stephen was accused for <I>blaspheming that holy place</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:13">Acts vi. 13</A>);
 
 but Christ, in a corn-field, was <I>greater than the temple,</I> for in
 him dwelt not the <I>presence of God</I> symbolically, but <I>all the 
 fulness of the Godhead bodily.</I> Note, If whatever we do, we do it 
 <I>in the name of Christ,</I> and <I>as unto him,</I> it shall be 
 graciously accepted of God, however it may be censured and cavilled at 
 by men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>God will have mercy and not sacrifice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Ceremonial duties must give way to moral, and the natural, royal law of 
 love and self-preservation must take place of ritual observances. This 
 is quoted from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:6">Hos. vi. 6</A>.
 
 It was used before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:13"><I>ch.</I> ix. 13</A>,

 in vindication of mercy to the souls of men; here, of mercy to their
 bodies. The rest of the sabbath was ordained for man's good, in favour
 of the body,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:14">Deut. v. 14</A>.

 Now no law must be construed so as to contradict its own end. <I>If you
 had known what this means,</I> had known what it is to be of a merciful 
 disposition, you would have been sorry that they were forced to do this 
 to satisfy their hunger, and would <I>not have condemned the 
 guiltless.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> Ignorance is the cause of our rash 
 and uncharitable censures of our brethren. <I>Secondly,</I> It is not 
 enough for us to know the scriptures, but we must labour to <I>know the 
 meaning</I> of them. <I>Let him that readeth understand. Thirdly,</I>
 Ignorance of the meaning of the scripture is especially shameful in 
 those who take upon them to teach others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] <I>The Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 That law, as all the rest, is put into the hand of Christ, to be 
 altered, enforced, or dispensed with, as he sees good. It was by <I>the 
 Son</I> that God <I>made the world,</I> and by him he instituted the 
 sabbath in innocency; by him he gave the ten commandments at mount 
 Sinai, and as Mediator he is entrusted with the institution of 
 ordinances, and to make what changes he thought fit; and particularly, 
 as being <I>Lord of the sabbath,</I> he was authorized to make such an 
 alteration of that day, as that it should become the Lord's day, the 
 Lord Christ's day. And if Christ be the <I>Lord of the sabbath,</I> it
 is fit the day and all the work of it should be dedicated to him. By 
 virtue of this power Christ here enacts, that works of necessity, if 
 they be really such, and not a pretended and self-created necessity, 
 are lawful on the sabbath day; and this explication of the law plainly 
 shows that it was to be perpetual. <I>Exceptio firmat regulam--The 
 exception confirms the rule.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ having thus silenced the Pharisees, and got clear of them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>departed,</I> and <I>went into their synagogue,</I> the synagogue of 
 these Pharisees, in which they presided, and toward which he was going, 
 when they picked this quarrel with him. Note, <I>First,</I> We must 
 take heed lest any thing that occurs in our way to holy ordinances 
 unfit us for, or divert us from, our due attendance on them. Let us 
 proceed in the way of our duty, notwithstanding the artifices of Satan, 
 who endeavours, by the <I>perverse disputings of men of corrupt 
 minds,</I> and many other ways, to ruffle and discompose us. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> We must not, for the sake of private feuds and 
 personal piques, draw back from public worship. Though the Pharisees 
 had thus maliciously cavilled at Christ, yet he <I>went into their 
 synagogue.</I> Satan gains this point, if, by sowing discord among 
 brethren, he prevail to drive them, or any of them, from the synagogue, 
 and the communion of the faithful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ, by <I>healing the man that had the withered hand on the 
 sabbath day,</I> shows that works of mercy are lawful and proper to be 
 done on that day. The work of necessity was done by the disciples, and 
 justified by him; the work of mercy was done by himself; the works of 
 mercy were his works of necessity; it was his <I>meat and drink to do 
 good. I must preach,</I> says he, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:43">Luke iv. 43</A>.

 This cure is recorded for the sake of the time when it was wrought, on
 the sabbath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The affliction that this poor man was in; his hand was withered so 
 that he was utterly disabled to get his living by <I>working with his 
 hands.</I> St. Jerome says, that the gospel of Matthew in Hebrew, used 
 by the Nazarenes and Ebionites, adds this circumstance to this story of 
 the man with the withered hand, that he was <I>C&aelig;mentarius--a 
 bricklayer,</I> and applied himself to Christ thus; "Lord, I am a 
 bricklayer, and <I>have got my living by my labour (manibus victum 
 qu&aelig;ritans</I>); I beseech thee, O Jesus, restore me the use of my 
 hand, <I>that I may not be obliged to beg my bread" (ne turpiter 
 mendicem cibos</I>). Hieron. <I>in loc.</I> This poor man was in the 
 synagogue. Note, Those who can do but little, or have but little to do 
 for the world, must do so much the more for their souls; as the rich, 
 the aged, and the infirm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A spiteful question which the Pharisees put to Christ upon the sight 
 of this man. <I>They asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal?</I> We 
 read not here of any address this poor man made to Christ for a cure, 
 but they observed Christ began to take notice of him, and knew it was 
 usual for him to be <I>found of those that sought him not,</I> and 
 therefore with their badness they anticipated his goodness, and started 
 this case as a stumbling-block in the way of doing good; <I>Is it 
 lawful to heal on the sabbath-day?</I> Whether it was lawful for 
 <I>physicians to heal</I> on that day or not, which was the thing 
 disputed in their books, one would think it past dispute, that it is 
 lawful for <I>prophets to heal,</I> for him to heal who discovered a 
 divine power and goodness in all he did of this kind, and manifested 
 himself to be <I>sent of God.</I> Did ever any ask, whether it is 
 lawful for God to heal, to send his word and heal? It is true, Christ 
 was now <I>made under the law,</I> by a voluntary submission to it, but 
 he was never made under the precepts of the elders. <I>Is it lawful to 
 heal?</I> To enquire into the lawfulness and unlawfulness of actions is 
 very good, and we cannot apply ourselves to any with such enquiries 
 more fitly than to Christ; but they asked here, not that they might be 
 instructed by him, but <I>that they might accuse him.</I> If he should 
 say that it was lawful to heal on the sabbath day, they would accuse 
 him of a contradiction to the fourth commandment; to so great a degree 
 of superstition had the Pharisees brought the sabbath rest, that, 
 unless in peril of life, they allowed not any medicinal operations on 
 the sabbath day. If he should say that it was not lawful, they would 
 accuse him of partiality, having lately justified his disciples in 
 plucking the ears of corn on that day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ's answer to this question, by way of appeal to themselves, 
 and their own opinion and practice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 In case a <I>sheep</I> (though but one, of which the loss would not be 
 very great) should fall into a pit on the sabbath day, <I>would they 
 not lift it out?</I> No doubt they might do it, the fourth commandment 
 allows it; they must do it, for a <I>merciful man regardeth the life of 
 his beast,</I> and for their parts they would do it, rather than lose a 
 sheep; does Christ take care for sheep? Yes, he does; he preserves and 
 provides for both man and beast. But here he says it for our sakes 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:9,10">1 Cor. ix. 9, 10</A>),

 and hence argues, <I>How much then is a man better than a sheep?</I>
 Sheep are not only harmless but useful creatures, and are prized and 
 tended accordingly; yet a man is here preferred far before them. Note, 
 Man, in respect of his being, is a great deal better, and more 
 valuable, than the best of the brute creatures: man is a reasonable 
 creature, capable of knowing, loving, and glorifying God, and therefore 
 is better than a sheep. The sacrifice of a sheep could therefore not 
 atone for the sin of a soul. They do not consider this, who are more 
 solicitous for the education, preservation, and supply of their horses 
 and dogs than of God's poor, or perhaps their own household.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hence Christ infers a truth, which, even at first sight, appears very 
 reasonable and good-natured; that <I>it is lawful to do well on the 
 sabbath days;</I> they had asked, <I>Is it lawful to hear?</I> Christ 
 proves it is lawful to <I>do well,</I> and let any one judge whether 
 healing, as Christ healed, was not <I>doing well.</I> Note, There are 
 more ways of <I>doing well</I> upon sabbath days, than by the duties of 
 God's immediate worship; attending the sick, relieving the poor, 
 helping those who are fallen into sudden distress, and call for speedy 
 relief; this is <I>doing good:</I> and this must be done from a 
 principle of love and charity, with humility and self-denial, and a 
 heavenly frame of spirit, and this is <I>doing well,</I> and it 
 <I>shall be accepted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:7">Gen. iv. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Christ's curing of the man, notwithstanding the offence which he 
 foresaw the Pharisees would take at it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Though they could not answer Christ's arguments, they were resolved to 
 persist in their prejudice and enmity; but Christ went on with his work 
 notwithstanding. Note, Duty is not to be left undone, nor
 opportunities of doing good neglected, for fear of giving offence. Now 
 the manner of the cure is observable; he said to the man, "<I>Stretch 
 forth thy hand,</I> exert thyself as well as thou canst;" and he did 
 so, <I>and it was restored whole.</I> This, as other cures Christ 
 wrought, had a spiritual significancy. 

 (1.) By nature our hands are withered, we are utterly unable of 
 ourselves to doing any thing that is good. 

 (2.) It is Christ only, by the power of his grace, that cures us; he 
 heals the withered hand by putting life into the dead soul, works in us 
 both to will and to do.

 (3.) In order to our cure, he commands us to <I>stretch forth our 
 hands,</I> to improve our natural powers, and do as well as we can; to 
 stretch them out in prayer to God, to stretch them out to lay hold on 
 Christ by faith, to stretch them out in holy endeavours. Now this man 
 could not stretch forth his withered hand of himself, any more than the 
 impotent man could arise and carry his bed, or Lazarus come forth out 
 of his grave; yet Christ bid him do it. God's commands to us to do the 
 duty which of ourselves we are not able to do are no more absurd or 
 unjust, than this command to the man with the withered hand, <I>to 
 stretch it forth;</I> for with the command, there is a promise of grace 
 which is given by the word. <I>Turn ye at my reproof, and I will pour 
 out my Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:23">Prov. i. 23</A>.

 Those who perish are as inexcusable as this man would have been, if he 
 had not attempted to stretch forth his hand, and so had not been 
 healed. But those who are saved have no more to boast of than this man 
 had of contributing to his own cure, by stretching forth his hand, but 
 are as much indebted to the power and grace of Christ as he was.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him,
 how they might destroy him.
 &nbsp; 15  But when Jesus knew <I>it,</I> he withdrew himself from thence:
 and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;
 &nbsp; 16  And charged them that they should not make him known:
 &nbsp; 17  That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
 prophet, saying,
 &nbsp; 18  Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom
 my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he
 shall show judgment to the Gentiles.
 &nbsp; 19  He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his
 voice in the streets.
 &nbsp; 20  A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he
 not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.
 &nbsp; 21  And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As in the midst of Christ's greatest humiliations, there were proofs of 
 his dignity, so in the midst of his greatest honours, he gave proofs of 
 his humility; and when the mighty works he did gave him an opportunity 
 of making a figure, yet he made it appear that <I>he emptied 
 himself,</I> and <I>made himself of no reputation.</I> Here we 
 have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The cursed malice of the Pharisees against Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 being enraged at the convincing evidence of his miracles, they <I>went 
 out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.</I> 
 That which vexed them was, not only that by his miracles his honour 
 eclipsed theirs, but that the doctrine he preached was directly 
 opposite to their pride, and hypocrisy, and worldly interest; but they 
 pretended to be displeased at his breaking the sabbath day, which was 
 by the law a capital crime, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+35:2">Exod. xxxv. 2</A>.

 Note, it is no new thing to see the vilest practices cloaked with the
 most specious pretences. Observe their policy; they took counsel about 
 it, considered with themselves which way to do it effectually; they 
 took counsel together in a close cabal about it, that they might both 
 animate and assist one another. Observe their cruelty; they took
 counsel, not to imprison or banish him, but to destroy him, to be the 
 death of him who came <I>that we might have life.</I> What an indignity 
 was hereby put upon our Lord Jesus, to run him down as an outlaw 
 (<I>qui caput gerit lupinum--carries a wolf's head</I>), and the plague 
 of his country, who was the greatest blessing of it, the Glory of his 
 people Israel!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's absconding upon this occasion, and the privacy he chose, 
 to decline, not his work, but his danger; because <I>his hour was not 
 yet come</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 <I>he withdrew himself from thence.</I> He could have secured himself 
 by miracle, but chose to do it in the ordinary way of flight and 
 retirement; because in this, as in other things, he would submit to the 
 sinless infirmities of our nature. Herein he humbled himself, that he 
 was driven to the common shift of those who are most helpless; thus 
 also he would give an example to his own rule, <I>When they persecute 
 you in one city, flee to another.</I> Christ had said and done enough 
 to convince those Pharisees, if reason or miracles would have done it; 
 but instead of yielding to the conviction, they were hardened and 
 enraged, and therefore he left them as incurable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:9">Jer. li. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ did not retire for his own ease, nor seek an excuse to leave off 
 his work; no, his retirements were filled up with business, and he was 
 even then doing good, when he was forced to flee for the same. Thus he 
 gave an example to his ministers, to do what they can, when they cannot 
 do what they would, and to continue teaching, even when they are 
 removed into corners. When the Pharisees, the great dons and doctors of 
 the nation, drove Christ from then, and forced him to withdraw himself, 
 yet the common people crowded after him; <I>great multitudes followed 
 him</I> and found him out. This some would turn to his reproach, and 
 call him the ring-leader of the mob; but it was really his honour, that 
 all who were unbiased and unprejudiced, and not blinded by the pomp of 
 the world, were so hearty, so zealous for him, that they would follow 
 him whithersoever he went, and whatever hazards they ran with him; as 
 it was also the honour of his grace, that the poor were evangelized; 
 that when they received him, he received them and healed them all. 
 Christ came into the world to be a Physician-general, as the sun to the 
 lower world, <I>with healing under his wings.</I> Though the Pharisees 
 persecuted Christ for doing good, yet he went on in it, and did not let 
 the people fare the worse for the wickedness of their rulers. Note, 
 Though some are unkind to us, we must not on that account be unkind to 
 others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ studied to reconcile usefulness and privacy; he <I>healed them 
 all,</I> and yet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>charged them that they should not make him known;</I> which may be 
 looked upon, 

 1. As an act of prudence; it was not so much the miracles themselves,
 as the public discourse concerning them, that enraged the Pharisees

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>);

 therefore Christ, though he would not omit doing good, yet would do it
 with as little noise as possible, to avoid offence to them and peril to 
 himself. Note, Wise and good men, though they covet to do good, yet are 
 far from coveting to have it talked of when it is done; because it is 
 God's acceptance, not men's applause, that they aim at. And in 
 suffering times, though we must boldly go on in the way of duty, yet we 
 must contrive the circumstances of it so as not to exasperate, more 
 than is necessary, those who seek occasion against us; <I>Be ye wise as 
 serpents,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:16"><I>ch.</I> x. 16</A>.

 2. It may be looked upon as an act of righteous judgment upon the
 Pharisees, who were unworthy to hear of any more of his miracles, 
 having made so light of those they had seen. By shutting their eyes 
 against the light, they had forfeited the benefit of it. 

 3. As an act of humility and self-denial. Though Christ's intention in 
 his miracles was to prove himself the Messiah, and so to bring men to 
 believe on him, in order to which it was requisite that they should be 
 known, yet sometimes he charged the people to conceal them, to set us 
 an example of humility, and to teach us not to proclaim our own 
 goodness or usefulness, or to desire to have it proclaimed. Christ 
 would have his disciples to be the reverse of those who did all their 
 works <I>to be seen of men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The fulfilling of the scriptures in all this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Christ retired into privacy and obscurity, that though he was eclipsed, 
 the word of God might be fulfilled, and so illustrated and glorified, 
 which was the thing his heart was upon. The scripture here said to be 
 fulfilled is 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1-4">Isa. xlii. 1-4</A>,
 
 which is quoted at large,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:18-21"><I>v.</I> 18-21</A>.

 The scope of it is to show how mild and quiet, and yet how successful, 
 our Lord Jesus should be in his undertaking; instances of both which we 
 have in the foregoing passages. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The pleasure of the Father in Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 <I>Behold, my Servant whom I have chosen, my Beloved in whom my soul is 
 well pleased.</I> Hence we may learn,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That our Saviour was God's Servant in the great work of our 
 redemption. He therein submitted himself to the Father's will 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:7">Heb. x. 7</A>),

 and set himself to serve the design of his grace and the interests of
 his glory, in repairing the breaches that had been made by man's
 apostasy. As a <I>Servant,</I> he had a great work appointed him, and a
 great trust reposed in him. This was a part of his humiliation, that
 though he <I>thought it not robbery to be equal with God,</I> yet that
 in the work of our salvation he took upon him the form of a servant,
 received a law, and came into bonds. <I>Though he were a son, yet
 learned he this obedience,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:8">Heb. v. 8</A>.

 The motto of this Prince is, <I>Ich dien--I serve.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That Jesus Christ was chosen of God, as the only fit and proper 
 person for the management of the great work of our redemption. He is 
 <I>my Servant whom I have chosen,</I> as <I>par negotio--equal to the
 undertaking.</I> None but he was able to do the Redeemer's work, or fit 
 to wear the Redeemer's crown. He was <I>one chosen out of the 
 people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:19">Ps. lxxxix. 19</A>),

 chosen by Infinite Wisdom to that post of service and honour, for which
 neither man nor angel was qualified; none but Christ, that he might in
 all things have the pre-eminence. Christ did not thrust himself upon
 this work, but was duly chosen into it; Christ was so God's Chosen as
 to be the head of election, and of all other the Elect, for we are
 <I>chosen in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:4">Eph. i. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That Jesus Christ is God's Beloved, his beloved Son; as God, he
 lay from eternity in his bosom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18">John i. 18</A>);

 he was <I>daily his delight,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov. viii. 30</A>).

 Between the Father and the Son there was before all time an eternal and 
 inconceivable intercourse and interchanging of love, and thus <I>the 
 Lord possessed him in the beginning of his way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:22">Prov. viii. 22</A>.

 As Mediator, the Father loved him; then when it pleased the Lord to 
 bruise him, and he submitted to it, <I>therefore did the Father love 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:17">John x. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That Jesus Christ is one in whom the Father is well pleased, in 
 whom his soul is pleased; which denotes the highest complacency 
 imaginable. God declared, by a voice from heaven, that he was his 
 beloved Son in whom he is well pleased; well pleased <I>in him,</I> 
 because he was the ready and cheerful Undertaker of that work of wonder 
 which God's heart was so much upon, and he is well pleased with us in 
 him; for he had <I>made us accepted in the Beloved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:6">Eph. i. 6</A>.

 All the interest which fallen man has or can have in God is grounded
 upon and owing to God's <I>well-pleasedness</I> in Jesus Christ; for 
 there is <I>no coming to the Father but by him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:6">John xiv. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The promise of the Father to him in two things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he should be every way well qualified for his undertaking;
 <I>I will put my Spirit upon him,</I> as a Spirit of <I>wisdom and
 counsel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:2,3">Isa. xi. 2, 3</A>.

 Those whom God calls to any service, he will be sure to fit and qualify
 for it; and by that it will appear that he called them to it, as Moses,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:12">Exod. iv. 12</A>.

 Christ, as God, was equal in power and glory with the Father; as
 Mediator, he received from the Father power and glory, and received
 that he might give: and all that the Father gave him, to qualify him
 for his undertaking, was summed up in this, he <I>put his Spirit upon
 him:</I> this was that <I>oil of gladness</I> with which he was
 <I>anointed above his fellows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:9">Heb. i. 9</A>.

 He received the Spirit, not by measure, but <I>without measure,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:34">John iii. 34</A>.

 Note, Whoever they be that God has chosen, and in whim he is well 
 pleased, he will be sure to <I>put his Spirit upon them.</I> Wherever 
 he confers his love, he confers somewhat of his likeness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That he should be abundantly successful in his understanding. 
 Those whom God sends he will certainly own. It was long since secured 
 by promise to our Lord Jesus, that the <I>good pleasure of the Lord 
 should prosper in his hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10">Isa. liii. 10</A>.

 And here we have an account of that prospering good pleasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He shall <I>show judgment to the Gentiles.</I> Christ in his own 
 person preached to those who bordered upon the heathen nations (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:6-8">Mark iii. 6-8</A>),

 and by his apostle showed his gospel, called here his <I>judgment,</I>
 to the Gentile world. The way and method of salvation, the 
 <I>judgment</I> which is <I>committed to the Son,</I> is not only 
 wrought out by him as our great High Priest, but showed and published 
 by him as our great Prophet. The gospel, as it is a rule of practice 
 and conversation, which has a direct tendency to the reforming and 
 bettering of men's hearts and lives, shall be showed to the Gentiles.
 God's judgments had been the Jews' peculiar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:19">Ps. cxlvii. 19</A>),

 but it was often foretold, by the Old-Testament prophets, that they
 should be <I>showed to the Gentiles,</I> which therefore ought not to 
 have been such a surprise as it was to the unbelieving Jews, much less 
 a vexation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>In his name shall the Gentiles trust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 He shall so show judgment to them, that they shall heed and observe 
 what he shows them, and be influenced by it to depend upon him, to 
 devote themselves to him, and conform to that judgment. Note, The
 great design of the gospel, is to bring people to trust in the name of 
 Jesus Christ; his name Jesus, a Saviour, that precious name whereby he 
 is called, and which is as ointment poured forth; <I>The Lord our 
 Righteousness.</I> The evangelist here follows the Septuagint (or 
 perhaps the latter editions of the Septuagint follow the evangelist); 
 the Hebrew 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:4">Isa. xlii. 4</A>)

 is, <I>The isles shall wait for his law.</I> The isles of the Gentiles
 are spoken of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:5">Gen. x. 5</A>),

 as peopled by the sons of Japhet, of whom it was said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:27">Gen. ix. 27</A>),

 <I>God shall persuade Japhet to dwell in the tents of Shem;</I> which
 was now to be fulfilled, when <I>the isles</I> (says the prophet),
 <I>the Gentiles</I> (says the evangelist), <I>shall wait for his
 law,</I> and <I>trust in his name:</I> compare these together, and
 observe, that they, and they only, can with confidence <I>trust in
 Christ's name,</I> that <I>wait for his law</I> with a resolution to be
 ruled by it. Observe also, that the law we wait for is the law of
 faith, the law of trusting in his name. This is now his great
 commandment, that we <I>believe in Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:23">1 John iii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The prediction concerning him, and his mild and quiet management of 
 his undertaking, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 It is chiefly for the sake of this that it is here quoted, upon 
 occasion of Christ's affected privacy and concealment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he should carry on his undertaking without noise or 
 ostentation. <I>He shall not strive, or make an outcry.</I> Christ and 
 his kingdom <I>come not with observation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:20,21">Luke xvii. 20, 21</A>.

 When the First-begotten was brought into the world, it was not with
 state and ceremony; he made no public entry, had no harbingers to 
 proclaim him King. He <I>was in the world and the world knew him 
 not.</I> Those were mistaken who fed themselves with hopes of a pompous 
 Saviour. <I>His voice was not heard in the streets;</I> "Lo, here is 
 Christ;" or, "Lo, he is there:" he spake in a still small voice, which 
 was alluring to all, but terrifying to none; he did not affect to make 
 a noise, but came down silently like the dew. What he spake and did was 
 with the greatest possible humility and self-denial. His kingdom was 
 spiritual, and therefore not to be advanced by force or violence, or by 
 high pretensions. No, <I>the kingdom of God is not in word, but in 
 power.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That he should carry on his undertaking without severity and 
 rigour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>).

 <I>A bruised reed shall he not break.</I> Some understand this of his 
 patience in bearing with the wicked; he could as easily have broken 
 these Pharisees as a bruised reed, and have quenched them as soon as 
 smoking flax; but he will not do it till the judgment-day, when all his 
 enemies shall be made his footstool. Others rather understand it of his 
 power and grace in bearing up the weak. In general, the design of his 
 gospel is to establish such a method of salvation as encourages 
 sincerity, though there be much infirmity; it does not insist upon a 
 sinless obedience, but accepts an upright, willing mind. As to 
 particular persons, that follow Christ in meekness, and in fear, and in 
 much trembling, observe, 

 [1.] How their case is here described--they are like <I>a bruised 
 reed,</I> and <I>smoking flax.</I> Young beginners in religion are weak 
 as a bruised reed, and their weakness offensive like smoking flax; some 
 little life they have, but it is like that of a bruised reed; some 
 little heat, but like that of smoking flax. Christ's disciples were as 
 yet but weak, and many are so that have a place in his family. The 
 grace and goodness in them are as a bruised reed, the corruption and 
 badness in them are as smoking flax, as the wick of a candle when it is 
 put out and is yet smoking.

 [2.] What is the compassion of our Lord Jesus toward them? He will not 
 discourage them, much less reject them or cast them off; the reed that 
 is bruised shall not be broken and trodden down, but shall be 
 supported, and made as strong as a cedar or flourishing palm-tree. The 
 candle newly lighted, though it only smokes and does not flame, shall 
 not be blown out, but blown up. The <I>day of small things</I> is the 
 day of <I>precious</I> things, and therefore he will not despise it, 
 but make it <I>the day of great things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:10">Zech. iv. 10</A>.

 Note, Our Lord Jesus deals very tenderly with those who have true
 grace, though they be weak in it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11,Heb+5:2">Isa. xl. 11; Heb. v. 2</A>.

 He remembers not only that we are dust, but that we are flesh.

 [3.] The good issue and success of this, intimated in that, <I>till he
 send forth judgment unto victory.</I> That judgment which he showed to 
 the Gentiles shall be victorious, he will go on conquering and to 
 conquer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2">Rev. vi. 2</A>.

 Both the preaching of the gospel in the world, and the power of the 
 gospel in the heart, shall prevail. Grace shall get the upper hand of 
 corruption, and shall at length be perfected in glory. Christ's 
 judgment will be brought forth to victory, for when he judges he will 
 overcome. He shall <I>bring forth judgment unto truth;</I> so it is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:3">Isa. xlii. 3</A>.

 Truth and victory are much the same, for <I>great is the truth, and
 will prevail.</I></P>

 both spake and saw.
 &nbsp; 23  And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the

 &nbsp; 24  But when the Pharisees heard <I>it,</I> they said, This <I>fellow</I>
 doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the

 &nbsp; 25  And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every

 every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:

 how shall then his kingdom stand?
 &nbsp; 27  And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your

 things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
 &nbsp; 35  A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth
 forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure
 bringeth forth evil things.
 &nbsp; 36  But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall
 speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
 &nbsp; 37  For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
 thou shalt be condemned.

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's glorious conquest of Satan, in the gracious cure of one 
 who, by the divine permission, was under his power, and in his 
 possession, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The man's case was very sad; he was <I>possessed with a devil.</I> 
 More cases of this kind occurred in Christ's time than usual, that 
 Christ's power might be the more magnified, and his purpose the more 
 manifested, in opposing and dispossessing Satan; and that it might the 
 more evidently appear, that he <I>came to destroy the works of the 
 devil.</I> This poor man that was possessed was blind and dumb; a 
 miserable case! he could neither see to help himself, nor speak to 
 others to help him. A soul under Satan's power, and led captive by him, 
 is blind in the things of God, and dumb at the throne of grace; sees 
 nothing, and says nothing to the purpose. Satan blinds the eye of 
 faith, and seals up the lips of prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His cure was very strange, and the more so, because sudden; <I>he 
 healed him.</I> Note, The conquering and dispossessing of Satan is the 
 healing of souls. And the cause being removed, immediately the effect 
 ceased; the <I>blind and dumb both spake and saw.</I> Note, Christ's 
 mercy is directly opposite to Satan's malice; his favours, to the 
 devil's mischiefs. When Satan's power is broken in the soul, the eyes 
 are opened to see God's glory, and the lips opened to speak his 
 praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The conviction which this gave to the people to <I>all the 
 people:</I> they <I>were amazed.</I> Christ had wrought divers miracles 
 of this kind before; but his works are not the less wonderful, nor the 
 less to be wondered at, for their being often repeated. They inferred 
 from it, "<I>Is not this the Son of David?</I> The Messiah promised, 
 that was to spring from the loins of David? Is not this he that should 
 come?" We may take this, 

 1. As an <I>enquiring</I> question; they asked, <I>Is not this the Son 
 of David?</I> But they did not stay for an answer: the impressions were 
 cogent, but they were transient. It was a good question that they 
 started; but, it should seem, it was soon lost, and was not prosecuted. 
 Such convictions as these should be brought to a head, and then they 
 are likely to be brought to the heart. Or,

 2. as an <I>affirming</I> question; <I>Is not this the Son of
 David?</I> "Yes, certainly it is, it can be no other; such miracles as 
 these plainly evince that the kingdom of the Messiah is now setting 
 up." And they were the people, the vulgar sort of the spectators, that 
 drew this inference from Christ's miracles. Atheists will say, "That 
 was because they were less prying than the Pharisees;" no, the matter 
 of fact was obvious, and required not much search: but it was because 
 they were less prejudiced and biassed by worldly interest. So plain and 
 easy was the way made to this great truth of Christ being the Messiah 
 and Saviour of the world, that the common people could not miss it; the 
 <I>wayfaring men, though fools, could not err therein.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8">Isa. xxxv. 8</A>.

 It was found of them that sought it. It is an instance of the
 condescensions of divine grace, that the things that were <I>hid from 
 the wise and prudent</I> were <I>revealed unto babes.</I> The world by 
 wisdom knew not God, and by the foolish things the wise were 
 confounded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The blasphemous cavil of the Pharisees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 The Pharisees were a sort of men that pretended to more knowledge in, 
 and zeal for, the divine law, than other people; yet they were the most 
 inveterate enemies to Christ and his doctrine. They were proud of the 
 reputation they had among the people; <I>that</I> fed their pride, 
 supported their power, and filled their purses; and when they heard the 
 people say, <I>Is not this the Son of David?</I> they were extremely 
 irritated, more at that than at the miracle itself; this made them 
 jealous of our Lord Jesus, and apprehensive, that as <I>his</I> 
 interest in the people's esteem increased, <I>theirs</I> must of course 
 be eclipsed and diminished; therefore they envied him, as Saul did his 
 father David, because of what the women sang of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:7,8">1 Sam. xviii. 7, 8</A>.
 
 Note, Those who bind up their happiness in the praise and applause of
 men, expose themselves to a perpetual uneasiness upon every favourable 
 word that they hear said of any other. The shadow of honour followed 
 Christ, who fled from it, and fled from the Pharisees, who were eager 
 in the pursuit of it. They said, "<I>This fellow does not cast out 
 devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils,</I> and therefore is 
 not the Son of David." Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How scornfully they speak of Christ, <I>this fellow;</I> as if that 
 precious name of his, which is <I>as ointment poured forth,</I> were 
 not worthy to be taken into their lips. It is an instance of their 
 pride and superciliousness, and their diabolical envy, that the more 
 people magnified Christ, the more industrious they were to vilify him. 
 It is a bad thing to speak of good men with disdain because they are 
 poor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How blasphemously they speak of his miracles; they could not deny 
 the matter of fact; it was as plain as the sun, that devils were cast 
 out by the word of Christ; nor could they deny that it was an 
 extraordinary thing, and supernatural. Being thus forced to grant the 
 premises, they had no other way to avoid the conclusion, that <I>this 
 is the Son of David,</I> than by suggesting that <I>Christ cast out 
 devils by Beelzebub;</I> that there was a compact between Christ and 
 the devil; pursuant to that, the devil was not cast out, but did 
 voluntarily retire, and give back by consent and with design: or as if, 
 by an agreement with the ruling devil, he had power to cast out the 
 inferior devils. No surmise could be more palpably false and vile than 
 this; that he, who is Truth itself, should be in combination with the 
 father of lies, to cheat the world. This was the last refuge, or 
 subterfuge rather, or an obstinate infidelity, that was resolved to 
 stand it out against the clearest conviction. Observe, Among the devils 
 there is a prince, the ringleader of the apostasy from God and 
 rebellion against him; but this prince is Beelzebub--the god of a fly,
 or a dunghill god. How art thou fallen, O Lucifer! from an anger of 
 light, to be a lord of flies! Yet this is the prince of the devils too, 
 the chief of the gang of infernal spirits.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ's reply to this base insinuation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:25-30"><I>v.</I> 25-30</A>.

 <I>Jesus knew their thoughts.</I> Note, Jesus Christ knows what we are 
 thinking at any time, knows what is in man; he <I>understands our 
 thoughts afar off.</I> It should seem that the Pharisees could not for 
 shame speak it out, but kept it in their minds; they could not expect 
 to satisfy the people with it; they therefore reserved it for the 
 silencing of the convictions of their own consciences. Note, Many are 
 kept off from their duty by that which they are ashamed to own, but 
 which they cannot hide from Jesus Christ: yet it is probable that the 
 Pharisees had whispered what they thought among themselves, to help to 
 harden one another; but Christ's reply is said to be to their thoughts, 
 because he knew with what mind, and from what principle, they said it; 
 that they did not say it in their haste, but that it was the product of 
 a rooted malignity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ's reply to this imputation is copious and cogent, that <I>every 
 mouth may be stopped</I> with sense and reason, before it be stopped 
 with fire and brimstone. Here are three arguments by which he 
 demonstrates the unreasonableness of this suggestion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It would be very strange, and highly improbable, that Satan should
 be cast out by such a compact, because then Satan's <I>kingdom would be 
 divided against itself;</I> which, considering his subtlety, is not a 
 thing to be imagined, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is a known rule laid down, that in all societies a common 
 ruin is the consequence of mutual quarrels: <I>Every kingdom divided 
 against itself is brought to desolation;</I> and every family too: 
 <I>Qu&aelig; enim domus tam stabilis est, qu&aelig; tam firma civitas, 
 qu&aelig; non odiis atque dissidiis funditus everti possit?--For what 
 family is so strong, what community so firm, as not to be overturned by 
 enmity and dissension?</I> Cic. <I>L&aelig;l.</I> 7. Divisions commonly
 end in desolations; if we clash, we break; if we divide one from 
 another, we become an easy prey to a common enemy; much more <I>if we 
 bite and devour one another,</I> shall <I>we be consumed one of 
 another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:15">Gal. v. 15</A>.

 Churches and nations have known this by sad experience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The application of it to the case in hand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 <I>If Satan cast out Satan;</I> if the prince of the devils should be 
 at variance with the inferior devils, the whole kingdom and interest 
 would soon be broken; nay, if Satan should come into a compact with 
 Christ, it must be to his own ruin; for the manifest design and 
 tendency of Christ's preaching and miracles was to overthrow the 
 kingdom of Satan, as a kingdom of darkness, wickedness, and enmity to 
 God; and to set up, upon the ruins of it, a kingdom of light, holiness, 
 and love. <I>The works of the devil,</I> as a rebel against God, and a 
 tyrant over the souls of men, were destroyed by Christ; and therefore 
 it was the most absurd thing imaginable, to think that Beelzebub should 
 at all countenance such a design, or come into it: if he should fall in 
 with Christ, <I>how should then his kingdom stand?</I> He would himself 
 contribute to the overthrow of it. Note, The devil has a kingdom, a 
 common interest, in opposition to God and Christ, which, to the utmost 
 of his power, he will make to stand, and he will never come into 
 Christ's interests; he must be conquered and broken by Christ, and 
 therefore cannot submit and bend to him. <I>What concord or communion 
 can there be between light and darkness, Christ and Belial, Christ and 
 Beelzebub?</I> Christ will destroy the devil's kingdom, but he needs 
 not do it by any such little arts and projects as that of a secret 
 compact with Beelzebub; no, this victory must be obtained by nobler 
 methods. Let the prince of the devils muster up all his forces, let him 
 make use of all his powers and politics, and keep his interests in the 
 closest confederacy, yet Christ will be too hard for his united force, 
 and his kingdom shall not stand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was not at all strange, or improbable, that devils should be cast 
 out by the Spirit of God; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>How</I> otherwise <I>do your children cast them out?</I> There 
 were those among the Jews who, by invocation of the name of the most 
 high God, or the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, did sometimes cast 
 out devils. Josephus speaks of some in his time that did it; we read of 
 <I>Jewish exorcists</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:13">Acts xix. 13</A>),

 and of some that <I>in Christ's name cast out devils,</I> though they
 did not follow him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:38">Mark ix. 38</A>),

 or were not faithful to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:22"><I>ch.</I> vii. 22</A>.

 These the Pharisees condemned not, but imputed what they did to the
 Spirit of God, and valued themselves and their nation upon it. It was 
 therefore merely from spite and envy to Christ, that they would own 
 that others cast out devils by the Spirit of God, but suggest that he 
 did it by compact with Beelzebub. Note, It is the way of malicious
 people, especially the malicious persecutors of Christ and 
 Christianity, to condemn the same thing in those they hate, which they 
 approve of and applaud in those they have a kindness for: the judgments 
 of envy are made, not by things, but persons; not by reason, but 
 prejudice. But those were very unfit to sit in Moses's seat, who knew 
 faces, and knew nothing else in judgment: <I>Therefore they shall be 
 your judges;</I> "This contradicting of yourselves will rise up in 
 judgment against you at the last great day, and will condemn you." 
 Note, In the last judgment, not only every sin, but every aggravation 
 of it, will be brought into the account, and some of our notions that 
 were right and good will be brought in evidence against us, to convict 
 us of partiality.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) This casting out of devils was a certain token and indication of 
 the approach and appearance of the kingdom of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);

 "But if it be indeed that <I>I cast out devils by the Spirit of 
 God,</I> as certainly I do, then you must conclude, that though you are 
 unwilling to receive it, yet the kingdom of the Messiah is now about to 
 be set up among you." Other miracles that Christ wrought proved him 
 <I>sent of God,</I> but this proved him sent of God to destroy the 
 devil's kingdom and his works. Now that great promise was evidently
 fulfilled, that <I>the seed of the woman should break the serpent's 
 head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>.

 "Therefore that glorious dispensation of the kingdom of God, which has 
 been long expected, is now commenced; slight it at your peril." Note,

 [1.] The destruction of the devil's power is wrought by the Spirit of
 God; that Spirit who works to the obedience of faith, overthrows the 
 interest of that spirit who <I>works in the children of</I> unbelief 
 and <I>disobedience.</I> 

 [2.] The casting out of devils is a certain introduction to the kingdom 
 of God. If the devil's interest in a soul be not only checked by custom 
 or external restraints, but sunk and broken by the Spirit of God, as a 
 Sanctifier, no doubt but <I>the kingdom of God is come</I> to that 
 soul, the kingdom of grace, a blessed earnest of the kingdom of the 
 glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The comparing of Christ's miracles, particularly this of casting out 
 devils, with his doctrine, and the design and tendency of his holy 
 religion, evidenced that he was so far from being in league with Satan, 
 that he was at open enmity and hostility against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>);

 <I>How can one enter into a strong man's house, and plunder his 
 goods,</I> and carry them away, <I>except he first bind the strong man? 
 And then he</I> may do what he pleases with his goods. The world, that 
 sat in darkness, and lay in wickedness, was in Satan's possession, and 
 under his power, as a house in the possession and under the power of a 
 strong man; so is every unregenerate soul; there Satan resides, there 
 he rules. Now, 

 (1.) The design of Christ's gospel was to spoil the devil's house,
 which, as a strong man, he kept in the world; <I>to turn the people
 from darkness to light,</I> from sin to holiness, from this world to a
 better, <I>from the power of Satan unto God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:18">Acts xxvi. 18</A>);

 to alter the property of souls. 

 (2.) Pursuant to this design, he bound the strong man, when he cast out 
 unclean spirits by his word: thus he wrested the <I>sword</I> out of 
 the devil's hand, that he might wrest the <I>sceptre</I> out of it. The 
 doctrine of Christ teaches us how to construe his miracles, and when he 
 showed how easily and effectually he could cast the devil out of 
 people's bodies, he encouraged all believers to hope that, whatever 
 power Satan might usurp and exercise in the souls of men, Christ by his 
 grace would break it: he will spoil him, for it appears that he can 
 bind him. When nations were turned <I>from the service of idols to 
 serve the living God,</I> when some of the worst of sinners were 
 sanctified and justified, and became the best of saints, then Christ 
 spoiled the devil's house, and will spoil it more and more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. It is here intimated, that this holy war, which Christ was carrying 
 on with vigour against the devil and his kingdom, was such as would not 
 admit of a neutrality 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 <I>He that is not with me is against me.</I> In the little differences 
 that may arise between the disciples of Christ among themselves, we are 
 taught to lessen the matters in variance, and to seek peace, by 
 accounting those who <I>are not against us, to be with us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:50">Luke ix. 50</A>);

 but in the great quarrel between Christ and the devil, no peace is to
 be sought, nor any such favourable construction to be made of any 
 indifference in the matter; he that is not hearty <I>for</I> Christ, 
 will be reckoned with as really <I>against</I> him: he that is cold in 
 the cause, is looked upon as an enemy. When the dispute is between God 
 and Baal, there is no halting between two

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:21">1 Kings xviii. 21</A>),

 there is no trimming between Christ and Belial; for the kingdom of
 Christ, as it is eternally opposite to, so it will be eternally 
 victorious over, the devil's kingdom; and therefore in this cause there 
 is no sitting still with <I>Gilead beyond Jordan, or Asher on the 
 sea-shore,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:16,17">Judg. iv. 16, 17</A>),

 we must be entirely, faithfully, and immovably, on Christ's side; it is
 the <I>right</I> side, and will at last be the <I>rising</I> side. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:26">Exod. xxxii. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The latter clause is to the same purport: <I>He that gathereth not with 
 me scattereth.</I> Note, 

 (1.) Christ's errand into the world was to gather, to gather in his
 harvest, to gather in those whom the Father had given him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52,Eph+1:10">John xi. 52; Eph. i. 10</A>.

 (2.) Christ expects and requires from those who are with him, that they
 gather with him; that they not only gather to him themselves, but do 
 all they can in their places to gather others to him, and so to 
 strengthen his interest. 

 (3.) Those who will not appear, and act, as furtherers of Christ's 
 kingdom, will be looked upon, and dealt with, as hinderers of it; if we 
 <I>gather not with Christ, we scatter;</I> it is not enough, not to do 
 hurt, but we must do good. Thus is the breach widened between Christ
 and Satan, to show that there was no such compact between them as the 
 Pharisees whispered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is a discourse of Christ's upon this occasion, concerning 
 tongue-sins; <I>Wherefore I say unto you.</I> He seems to turn from the 
 Pharisees to the people, from disputing to instructing; and from the 
 sin of the Pharisees he warns the people concerning three sorts of 
 tongue-sins; for others' harms are admonitions to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Blasphemous words against the Holy Ghost are the worst kind of 
 tongue-sins, and unpardonable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is a gracious assurance of the pardon of all sin upon gospel 
 terms: this Christ says to us, and it is a comfortable saying, that the 
 greatness of sin shall be no bar to our acceptance with God, if we 
 truly repent and believe the gospel: <I>All manner of sin and blasphemy 
 shall be forgiven unto men.</I> Though the sin has been <I>as scarlet 
 and crimson</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:18">Isa. i. 18</A>),

 though ever so heinous in its nature, ever so much aggravated by its
 circumstances, and ever so often repeated, though it <I>reach up to the
 heavens,</I> yet <I>with the Lord there is mercy, that reacheth beyond
 the heavens;</I> mercy will be extended even to blasphemy, a sin
 immediately touching God's name and honour. Paul obtained mercy, who
 had <I>been a blasphemer,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:13">1 Tim. i. 13</A>.

 Well may we say, <I>Who is a God like unto thee, pardoning
 iniquity?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:18">Micah vii. 18</A>.

 Even <I>words spoken against the Son of man shall be forgiven;</I> as
 theirs were who reviled him at his death, many of whom repented and 
 found mercy. Christ here in has set an example to all the sons of men, 
 to be ready to forgive words spoken against them: <I>I, as a deaf man, 
 heard not.</I> Observe, <I>They shall be forgiven unto men,</I> not to 
 devils; this is love to the whole world of mankind, above the world of 
 fallen angels, that all sin is pardonable to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here is an exception of <I>the blasphemy against the Holy 
 Ghost,</I> which is here declared to be the only unpardonable sin. See 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What this sin; it is <I>speaking against the Holy Ghost.</I> See 
 what malignity there is in tongue-sins, when the only unpardonable sin 
 is so. <I>But Jesus knew their thoughts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 It is not all speaking against the person or essence of the Holy Ghost, 
 or some of his more private operations, or merely the resisting of his 
 internal working in the sinner himself, that is here meant; for <I>who 
 then should be saved?</I> It is adjudged in our law, that an act of 
 indemnity shall always be construed in favour of that grace and 
 clemency which is the intention of the act; and therefore the 
 exceptions in the act are not to be extended further than needs must.
 The gospel is an act of indemnity; none are excepted by name, nor any 
 by description, but those only <I>that blaspheme the Holy Ghost;</I> 
 which therefore must be construed in the narrowest sense: all presuming 
 sinners are effectually cut off by the conditions of the indemnity, 
 faith and repentance; and therefore the other exceptions must not be 
 stretched far: and this blasphemy is excepted, not for any defect of 
 mercy in God or merit in Christ, but because it inevitably leaves the 
 sinner in infidelity and impenitency. We have reason to think that none 
 are guilty of this sin, who believe that Christ is <I>the Son of 
 God,</I> and sincerely desire to have part in his merit and mercy: and 
 those who fear they have committed this sin, give a good sign that they 
 have not. The learned Dr. Whitby very well observes, that Christ speaks 
 not of what should be 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:28,Lu+12:10">Mark iii. 28; Luke xii. 10</A>);

 <I>Whosoever shall blaspheme.</I> As for those who blasphemed Christ
 when he was here upon earth, and called him a Winebibber, a Deceiver, a 
 Blasphemer, and the like, they had some colour of excuse, because of 
 the meanness of his appearance, and the prejudices of the nation 
 against him; and the proof of his divine mission was not perfected till 
 after his ascension; and therefore, upon their repentance, they shall 
 be pardoned: and it is hoped that they may be convinced by the pouring 
 out of the Spirit, as many of them were, who had been his betrayers and 
 murderers. But if, when the Holy Ghost is given, in his inward gifts of 
 revelation, speaking with tongues, and the like, such as were the 
 distributions of the Spirit among the apostles, if they continue to 
 blaspheme the Spirit likewise, as an evil spirit, there is no hope of 
 them that they will ever be brought to believe in Christ; for 
 <I>First,</I> Those gifts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles were the 
 last proof that God designed to make use of for the confirming of the 
 gospel, and were still kept in reserve, when other methods preceded. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> This was the most powerful evidence, and more apt to 
 convince than miracles themselves. <I>Thirdly,</I> Those therefore who 
 blaspheme this dispensation of the Spirit, cannot possibly be brought 
 to believe in Christ; those who shall impute them to a collusion with 
 Satan, as the Pharisees did the miracles, what can convince them? This 
 is such a strong hold of infidelity as a man can never be beaten out 
 of, and is therefore unpardonable, because hereby repentance is hid 
 from the sinner's eyes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What the sentence is that is passed upon it; <I>It shall not be 
 forgiven, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.</I> As in 
 the then present state of the Jewish church, there was no sacrifice of 
 expiation for <I>the soul that sinned presumptuously;</I> so neither 
 under the dispensation of gospel grace, which is often in scripture 
 called <I>the world to come,</I> shall there be any pardon to <I>such 
 as tread underfoot the blood of the covenant, and do despite to the 
 Spirit of grace:</I> there is no cure for a sin so directly against the 
 remedy. It was a rule in our old law, No sanctuary for sacrilege. Or, 
 <I>It shall be forgiven neither now,</I> in the sinner's own 
 conscience, <I>nor in the great day,</I> when the pardon shall be 
 published. Or, this is a sin that exposes the sinner both to temporal 
 and eternal punishment, both to present wrath and <I>the wrath to 
 come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ speaks here concerning other wicked words, the products of 
 corruption reigning in the heart, and breaking out thence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:33-35"><I>v.</I> 33-35</A>.

 It was said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)

 that <I>Jesus knew their thoughts,</I> and here he spoke with an eye to 
 them, showing that it was not strange that they should speak so ill, 
 when their hearts were so full of enmity and malice; which yet they 
 often endeavoured to cloak and cover, by feigning themselves just men. 
 Our Lord Jesus therefore points to the springs and heals them; let the 
 heart be sanctified and it will appear in our words.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The heart is the <I>root,</I> the language is the <I>fruit</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 if the nature of the tree be good, it will bring forth fruit 
 accordingly. Where grace is the reigning principle in the heart, the 
 language will be the language of Canaan; and, on the contrary, whatever 
 lust reigns in the heart it will break out; diseased lungs make an 
 offensive breath: men's language discovers what country they are of, so 
 likewise <I>what manner of spirit they are of: "Either make the tree 
 good, and then the fruit will be good;</I> get pure hearts and then you 
 will have pure lips and pure lives; or else <I>the tree will be 
 corrupt, and the fruit</I> accordingly. You may make a crab-stock to
 become a good tree, by grafting into it a shoot from a good tree, and 
 then the fruit will be good; but if the tree be still the same, plant 
 it where you will, and water it how you will, the fruit will be still 
 corrupt." Note, Unless the heart be <I>trans</I>formed, the life will 
 never be thoroughly <I>re</I>formed. These Pharisees were shy of 
 speaking out their wicked thoughts of Jesus Christ; but Christ here 
 intimates, how vain it was for them to seek to hide that root of 
 bitterness in them, that bore this gall and wormwood, when they never 
 sought to mortify it. Note, It should be more our care to be good 
 really, than to seem good outwardly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The heart is the <I>fountain,</I> the words are the streams 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 <I>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks,</I> as the 
 streams are the overflowings of the spring. A wicked heart is said to 
 <I>send forth wickedness, as a fountain casts forth her waters,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:7">Jer. vi. 7</A>.
 
 <I>A troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring,</I> such as
 Solomon speaks of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:26">Prov. xxv. 26</A>),

 must needs <I>send forth muddy and unpleasant streams.</I> Evil words 
 are the natural, genuine product of an evil heart. Nothing but the
 salt of grace, cast into the spring, will heal the waters, <I>season 
 the speech,</I> and purify the <I>corrupt communications.</I> This they 
 wanted, they were evil; <I>and how can ye, being evil, speak good 
 things?</I> They were <I>a generation of vipers;</I> John Baptist had 
 called them so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:7"><I>ch.</I> iii. 7</A>),

 and they were still the same; for <I>can the Ethiopian change his
 skin?</I> The people looked upon the Pharisees as a generation of
 saints, but Christ calls them <I>a generation of vipers, the seed of
 the serpent,</I> that had an enmity to Christ and his gospel. Now what
 could be expected from <I>a generation of vipers,</I> but that which is
 poisonous and malignant? Can the viper be otherwise than venomous?
 Note, Bad things may be expected from bad people, as said the proverb
 of the ancients, <I>Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:13">1 Sam. xxiv. 13</A>.
 
 <I>The vile person will speak villany,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:6">Isa. xxxii. 6</A>.

 Those who are themselves evil, have neither skill nor will to speak
 good things, as they should be spoken. Christ would have his disciples 
 know what sort of men they were to live among, that they might know 
 what to look for. They are as Ezekiel <I>among scorpions</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:6">Ezek. ii. 6</A>),
 
 and must not think it strange if they be stung and bitten.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The heart is the <I>treasury,</I> the words are the things brought 
 out of that treasury 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 and from hence men's characters may be drawn, and may be judged of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] It is the character of a <I>good man,</I> that he has a <I>good 
 treasure in his heart,</I> and from thence <I>brings forth good 
 things,</I> as there is occasion. Graces, comforts, experiences, good 
 knowledge, good affections, good resolutions, these are a <I>good 
 treasure in the heart;</I> the word of God hidden there, the law of God 
 written there, divine truths dwelling and ruling thee, are a treasure 
 there, valuable and suitable, kept safe and kept secret, as the stores 
 of the good householder, but ready for use upon all occasions. <I>A 
 good man,</I> thus furnished, will <I>bring forth,</I> as Joseph out of 
 his stores; will be speaking and doing that which is good, for God's 
 glory, and the edification of others. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:11,13,14,20,21,31,32">Prov. x. 11, 13, 14, 20, 21, 31, 32</A>.

 This is <I>bringing forth good things.</I> Some pretend to good 
 expenses that have not a <I>good treasure</I>--such will soon be 
 bankrupts: some pretend to have a good treasure within, but give no 
 proof of it: they hope they have it in them, and thank God, whatever 
 their words and actions are, they have good hearts; but <I>faith 
 without works is dead:</I> and some have a <I>good treasure</I> of 
 wisdom and knowledge, but they are not communicative, they do not 
 <I>bring forth</I> out of it: they have a talent, but know not how to 
 trade with it. The complete Christian in <I>this</I> bears the image of 
 God, that he both <I>is good, and does good.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It is the character of <I>an evil man,</I> that he has an <I>evil 
 treasure in his heart,</I> and out of it <I>bringeth forth evil 
 things.</I> Lusts and corruptions dwelling and reigning in the heart 
 are an evil treasure, out of which the sinner brings forth bad words 
 and actions, to the dishonour of God, and the hurt of others. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:5,12,Mt+15:18-20,Jam+1:15">Gen. vi. 5, 12;
 Matt. xv. 18-20; Jam. i. 15</A>.
 
 But <I>treasures of wickedness</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:2">Prov. x. 2</A>)
 
 will be <I>treasures of wrath.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ speaks here concerning <I>idle words,</I> and shows what evil
 there is in them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>);

 much more is there in such wicked words as the Pharisees spoke. It 
 concerns us to think much of the day of judgment, that <I>that</I> may 
 be a check upon our tongues; and let us consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How particular the account will be of tongue-sins in that day: 
 even <I>for every idle word,</I> or discourse, <I>that men speak, they
 shall give account.</I> This intimates, 

 [1.] That God takes notice of every word we say, even that which we 
 ourselves do not notice. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:4">Psalm cxxxix. 4</A>.

 <I>Not a word in my tongue but thou knowest it:</I> though spoken 
 without regard or design, God takes cognizance of it. 

 [2.] That vain, idle, impertinent talk is displeasing to God, which 
 tends not to any good purpose, is not good to any use of edifying; it 
 is the product of a vain and trifling heart. These <I>idle words</I>
 are the same with that <I>foolish talking and jesting</I> which is 
 forbidden, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:4">Eph. v. 4</A>.

 This is that sin which is seldom wanting in <I>the multitude of words,
 unprofitable talk,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:3">Job xv. 3</A>.

 [3.] We must shortly account for these idle words; they will be
 produced in evidence against us, to prove us unprofitable servants, 
 that have not improved the faculties of reason and speech, which are 
 part of the talents we are entrusted with. If we repent not of our idle 
 words, and our account for them be not balanced by the blood of Christ, 
 we are undone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How strict the judgment will be upon that account 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>);

 <I>By thy words thou shall be justified or condemned;</I> a common rule 
 in men's judgments, and here applied to God's. Note, The constant 
 tenour of our discourse, according as it is gracious or not gracious, 
 will be an evidence for us, or against us, at the great day. Those who 
 seemed to be religious, but bridled not their tongue, will then be 
 found to have put a cheat upon themselves with a vain religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:26">Jam. i. 26</A>.
 
 Some think that Christ here refers to that of Eliphaz 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:6">Job xv. 6</A>),
 
 <I>Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I;</I> or, rather, to that
 of Solomon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:21">Prov. xviii. 21</A>),

 <I>Death and life are in the power of the tongue.</I></P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>38  Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
 saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.
 &nbsp; 39  But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
 generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given
 to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:
 &nbsp; 40  For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's
 belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in
 the heart of the earth.
 &nbsp; 41  The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this
 generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the
 preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas <I>is</I> here.
 &nbsp; 42  The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with
 this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the
 uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and,
 behold, a greater than Solomon <I>is</I> here.
 &nbsp; 43  When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
 through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.
 &nbsp; 44  Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I
 came out; and when he is come, he findeth <I>it</I> empty, swept, and
 garnished.
 &nbsp; 45  Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits
 more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and
 the last <I>state</I> of that man is worse than the first. Even so
 shall it be also unto this wicked generation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is probable that these Pharisees with whom Christ is here in 
 discourse were not the same that cavilled at him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 and would not credit the signs he gave; but another set of them, who 
 saw that there was no reason to discredit them, but would not content 
 themselves with the signs he gave, nor admit the evidence of them, 
 unless he would give them such further proof as they should demand. 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their address to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 They compliment him with the title of <I>Master,</I> pretending respect 
 for him, when they intended to abuse him; all are not indeed Christ's 
 servants, who call him <I>Master.</I> Their request is, <I>We would see 
 a sign from thee.</I> It was highly reasonable that they should see a 
 sign, that he should by miracles prove his divine mission: see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:8,9">Exod. iv. 8, 9</A>.

 He came to take down a model of religion that was set up by miracles, 
 and therefore it was requisite he should produce the same credentials; 
 but it was highly unreasonable to demand a sign now, when he had given 
 so many signs already, that did abundantly prove him <I>sent of 
 God.</I> Note, It is natural to proud men to <I>pre</I>scribe to God, 
 and then to make that an excuse for not <I>sub</I>scribing to him; but 
 a man's <I>of</I>fence will never be his <I>de</I>fence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His answer to this address, this insolent demand,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He condemns the demand, as the language of <I>an evil and adulterous 
 generation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 He fastens the charge, not only on <I>the scribes and Pharisees,</I> 
 but the whole nation of the Jews; they were all like their leaders, a 
 seed and succession of evil-doers: they were an evil generation indeed, 
 that not only hardened themselves against the conviction of Christ's 
 miracles, but set themselves to abuse him, and put contempt on his 
 miracles. They were <I>an adulterous generation,</I> 

 (1.) As an adulterous brood; so miserably degenerated from the faith
 and obedience of their ancestors, that Abraham and Israel acknowledged
 them not. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:3">Isa. lvii. 3</A>.
 
 Or, 

 (2.) As an adulterous wife; they departed from that God, to whom by
 covenant they had been espoused: they were not guilty of the whoredom 
 of idolatry, as they had been before the captivity, but they were 
 guilty of infidelity, and all iniquity, and that is whoredom too: they 
 did not look after gods of their own making, but they looked for signs 
 of their own devising; and that was adultery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He refuses to give them any other sign than he has already given 
 them, but <I>that of the prophet Jonas.</I> Note, Though Christ is 
 always ready to hear and answer holy desires and prayers, yet he will 
 not gratify corrupt lusts and humours. Those who <I>ask amiss, ask, and 
 have not.</I> Signs were granted to those who desired them for the 
 confirmation of their faith, as to Abraham and Gideon; but were denied 
 to those who demanded them for the excuse of their unbelief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Justly might Christ have said, They shall never see another miracle: 
 but see his wonderful goodness; 

 (1.) They shall have the same signs still repeated, for their further 
 benefit, and more abundant conviction. 

 (2.) They shall have one sign of a different kind from all these, and 
 that is, <I>the resurrection of Christ from the dead by his own 
 power,</I> called here <I>the sign of the prophet Jonas</I> this was 
 yet reserved for their conviction, and was intended to be the great 
 proof of Christ's being the Messiah; for by that he was <I>declared to 
 be the Son of God with power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:4">Rom. i. 4</A>.

 That was such a sign as surpassed all the rest, completed and crowned
 them. "<I>If they will not believe</I> the former signs, they will 
 believe this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:9">Exod. iv. 9</A>),

 and if this will not convince them, nothing will." And yet the unbelief
 of the Jews found out an evasion to shift off that too, by saying, 
 <I>His disciples came and stole him away;</I> for none are so incurably 
 blind as those who are resolved they will not see.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this sign of the prophet Jonas he further explains here; 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>)
 
 <I>As Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly,</I> 
 and then came out again safe and well, thus Christ shall be so long in 
 the grave, and then shall rise again.

 [1.] The grave was to Christ as the belly of the fish was to Jonah; 
 thither he was thrown, as a Ransom for lives ready to be lost in a 
 storm; there he lay, as <I>in the belly of hell</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:2">Jonah ii. 2</A>),

 and seemed to be cast out of God's sight.

 [2.] He continued in the grave just as long as Jonah continued in the
 fish's belly, <I>three days and three nights;</I> not three whole days 
 and nights: it is probable, Jonah did not lie so long in the whale's 
 belly, but part of three natural days (<B><I>nychthemerai</I></B>, the 
 Greeks called them); he was buried in the afternoon of the sixth day of 
 the week, and rose again in the morning of the first day; it is a 
 manner of speech very usual; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:29,Es+4:16,5:1,Lu+2:21">1 Kings xx. 29;
 Esth. iv. 16; v. 1; Luke ii. 21</A>.

 So long Jonah was a prisoner for his own sins, so long Christ was a 
 Prisoner for ours.

 [3.] As Jonah in the whale's belly comforted himself with an assurance
 that yet he should look again <I>toward God's holy temple</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:4">Jonah ii. 4</A>),

 so Christ when he lay in the grave, is expressly said to <I>rest in
 hope,</I> as one assured he should <I>not see corruption,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:26,27">Acts ii. 26, 27</A>.

 [4.] As Jonah on the third day was discharged from his prison, and came
 to the land of the living again, from <I>the congregation of the 
 dead</I> (for dead things are said to be <I>formed from under the 
 waters,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:5">Job xxvi. 5</A>),

 so Christ on the third day should return to life, and rise out of his
 grave to send abroad the gospel to the Gentiles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ takes this occasion to represent the sad character and 
 condition of that generation in which he lived, a generation that would 
 not be reformed, and therefore could not but be ruined; and he gives 
 them their character, as it would stand in the day of judgment, under 
 the full discoveries and final sentences of that day. Persons and 
 things now appear under false colours; characters and conditions are 
 here changeable: if therefore we would make a right estimate, we must 
 take our measures from the last judgment; things are really, what they 
 are eternally.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now Christ represents the people of the Jews,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) As a generation that would be condemned by the <I>men of 
 Nineveh,</I> whose <I>repenting at the preaching of Jonas</I> would 
 <I>rise up in judgment</I> against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 Christ's resurrection will be the sign of the prophet Jonas to them: 
 but it will not have so happy an effect upon them, as that of Jonas had 
 upon the Ninevites, for they were by it brought to such a repentance as 
 prevented their ruin; but the Jews will be hardened in an unbelief that 
 shall hasten their ruin; and in the day of judgment, the repentance of 
 the Ninevites will be mentioned as an aggravation of the sin, and 
 consequently the condemnation of those to whom Christ preached then, 
 and of those to whom Christ is preached now; for this reason, because 
 Christ is greater than Jonah. 

 [1.] Jonah was but a man, subject to like passions, to like sinful 
 passions, as we are; but Christ is the Son of God. 

 [2.] Jonah was a stranger in Nineveh, he came among the strangers that 
 were prejudiced against his country; but Christ came to his own, when 
 he preached to the Jews, and much more when he is preached among 
 professing Christians, that are called by his name. 

 [3.] Jonah preached but one short sermon, and that with no great 
 solemnity, but as he passed along the streets; Christ renews his calls, 
 sat and taught, taught in the synagogues. 

 [4.] Jonah preached nothing but wrath and ruin within forty days, gave 
 no instructions, directions, or encouragements, to repent: but Christ, 
 besides the warning given us of our danger, has shown wherein we must 
 repent, and assured us of acceptance upon our repentance, because 
 <I>the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</I> 

 [5.] Jonah wrought no miracle to confirm his doctrine, showed no good 
 will to the Ninevites; but Christ wrought abundance of miracles, and 
 all miracles of mercy: yet the Ninevites <I>repented at the preaching 
 of Jonas,</I> but the Jews were not wrought upon by Christ's preaching. 
 Note, The goodness of some, who have less helps and advantages for 
 their souls, will aggravate the badness of those who have much greater. 
 Those who by the twilight discover <I>the things that belong to their 
 peace,</I> will shame those who grope at noon-day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) As a generation that would be condemned by the queen of the south, 
 the queen of Sheba, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 The Ninevites would shame them for not repenting, the queen of Sheba 
 for not believing in Christ. She came from a far country to hear the 
 wisdom of Solomon; yet people will not be persuaded to come and hear 
 the wisdom of Christ, though he is in every thing greater than Solomon. 
 
 [1.] The queen of Sheba had no invitation to come to Solomon, nor any 
 promise of being welcome; but we are invited to Christ, to sit at his 
 feet and hear his word. 

 [2.] Solomon was but a wise man, but Christ is wisdom itself, <I>in 
 whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom.</I> 

 [3.] The queen of Sheba had many difficulties to break through; she was 
 a woman, unfit for travel, the journey long and perilous; she was a 
 queen, and what would become of her own country in her absence? We have 
 no such cares to hinder us.

 [4.] She could not be sure that it would be worth her while to go so 
 far on this errand; fame uses to flatter men, and perhaps she might 
 have in her own country or court wise men sufficient to instruct her; 
 yet, having heard of Solomon's fame, she would see him; but we come not 
 to Christ upon such uncertainties. 

 [5.] <I>She came from the uttermost parts of the earth,</I> but we have 
 Christ among us, and his word nigh us: <I>Behold he stands at the door, 
 and knocks.</I> 

 [6.] It should seem the wisdom the queen of Sheba came for was only 
 philosophy and politics; but the wisdom that is to be had with Christ 
 is wisdom to salvation. 

 [7.] She could only <I>hear</I> Solomon's wisdom; he could not 
 <I>give</I> her wisdom: but Christ will give wisdom to those who come 
 to him; nay, he will himself be <I>made of God to them Wisdom;</I> so 
 that, upon all these accounts, if we do not hear the wisdom of Christ, 
 the forwardness of the queen of Sheba to come and hear the wisdom of 
 Solomon will rise up in judgment against us and condemn us; for Jesus 
 Christ is greater than Solomon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) As a generation that were resolved to continue in the possession, 
 and under the power, of Satan, notwithstanding all the methods that 
 were used to dispossess him and rescue them. They are compared to one 
 out of whom the devil is gone, but returns with double force, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:43-45"><I>v.</I> 43-45</A>.
 
 The devil is here called <I>the unclean spirit,</I> for he has lost all 
 his purity, and delights in and promotes all manner of impurity among 
 men. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The parable represents his possessing men's bodies: Christ having 
 lately cast out a devil, and they having said <I>he had a devil,</I> 
 gave occasion to show how much they were under the power of Satan. This 
 is a further proof that Christ did not cast out devils by compact with 
 the devil, for then he would soon have returned again; but Christ's 
 ejectment of him was final, and such as barred a re-entry: we find him 
 charging the evil spirit to <I>go out, and enter no more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:25">Mark ix. 25</A>.
 
 Probably the devil was wont sometimes thus to sport with those he had
 possession of; he would go out, and then return again with more fury; 
 hence the lucid intervals of those in that condition were commonly 
 followed with the more violent fits. When the devil is gone out, he is 
 uneasy, for <I>he sleeps not except he have done mischief</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:16">Prov. iv. 16</A>);

 <I>he walks in dry places,</I> like one that is very melancholy; he 
 <I>seeks rest but finds none,</I> till he returns again. When Christ 
 cast the legion out of the man, they begged leave to enter into the 
 swine, where they went not long in dry places, but into the lake 
 presently.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The application of the parable makes it to represent the case of
 the body of the Jewish church and nation: <I>So shall it be with this 
 wicked generation,</I> that now resist, and will finally reject, the 
 gospel of Christ. The devil, who by the labours of Christ and his 
 disciples had been cast out of many of the Jews, sought for rest among 
 the heathen, from whose persons and temples the Christians would every 
 where expel him: so Dr. Whitby: or finding no where else in the heathen
 world such pleasant, desirable habitations, to his satisfaction, as 
 here in the heart of the Jews: so Dr. Hammond: he shall therefore enter
 again into them, for Christ had not found admission among them, and 
 they, by their prodigious wickedness and obstinate unbelief, were still 
 more ready than ever to receive him; and then he shall take a durable 
 possession here, and the state of this people is likely to be more 
 desperately damnable (so Dr. Hammond) than it was before Christ came 
 among them, or would have been if Satan had never been cast out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The body of that nation is here represented, <I>First,</I> As an 
 apostate people. After the captivity in Babylon, they began to reform, 
 left their idols, and appeared with some face of religion; but they 
 soon corrupted themselves again: though they never relapsed into 
 idolatry, they fell into all manner of impiety and profaneness, grew 
 worse and worse, and added to all the rest of their wickedness a wilful 
 contempt of, and opposition to, Christ and his gospel. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 As a people marked for ruin. A new commission was passing the seals 
 against that hypocritical nation, the people of God's wrath (like that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6">Isa. x. 6</A>),

 and their destruction by the Romans was likely to be greater than any
 other, as their sins had been more flagrant: then it was <I>that wrath
 came upon them to the uttermost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15,16">1 Thess. ii. 15, 16</A>.

 Let this be a warning to all nations and churches, to take heed of
 leaving their first love, of letting fall a good work of reformation 
 begun among them, and returning to that wickedness which they seemed to 
 have forsaken; <I>for the last state of such will be worse than the 
 first.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>46  While he yet talked to the people, behold, <I>his</I> mother and
 his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.
 &nbsp; 47  Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
 stand without, desiring to speak with thee.

 mother? and who are my brethren?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Many excellent, useful sayings came from the mouth of our Lord Jesus 
 upon particular occasions; even his digressions were instructive, as 
 well as his set discourses: as here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 I. How Christ was interrupted in his preaching by <I>his mother and his 
 brethren,</I> that <I>stood without, desiring to speak with him</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:40,47"><I>v.</I> 40, 47</A>);

 which desire of theirs was conveyed to him through the crowd. It is
 needless to enquire which of his brethren they were that came along 
 with his mother (perhaps they were those <I>who did not believe in 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:5">John vii. 5</A>);

 or what their business was; perhaps it was only designed to oblige him
 to break off, for fear he should fatigue himself, or to caution him to 
 take heed of giving offence by his discourse to the Pharisees, and or 
 involving himself in a difficulty; as if they could teach <I>him</I> 
 wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was as yet talking to the people. Note, Christ's preaching was 
 talking; it was plain, easy, and familiar, and suited to their capacity 
 and case. What Christ had delivered had been cavilled at, and yet he 
 went on. Note, The opposition we meet within our work, must not drive 
 us from it. He left off talking with the Pharisees, for he saw he could 
 do no good with them; but continued to talk to the common people, who, 
 not having such a conceit of their knowledge as the Pharisees had, were 
 willing to learn.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His mother and brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him, 
 when they should have been standing within, desiring to hear him. They 
 had the advantage of his daily converse in private, and therefore were 
 less mindful to attend upon his public preaching. Note, Frequently 
 those who are nearest to the means of knowledge and grace, are most 
 negligent. Familiarity and easiness of access breed some degree of 
 contempt. We are apt to neglect <I>that</I> this day, which we think we 
 may have any day, for getting that it is only the present time we can 
 be sure of; tomorrow is none of ours. There is too much truth in that 
 common proverb, "The nearer the church, the further from God;" it is 
 pity it should be so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They not only would not hear him themselves, but they interrupted 
 others that <I>heard him gladly.</I> The devil was a sworn enemy to our 
 Saviour's preaching. He had sought to baffle his discourse by the 
 unreasonable cavils of the scribes and Pharisees, and when he could not 
 gain his point that way, he endeavoured to break it off by the 
 unseasonable visits of relations. Note, We often meet with hindrances 
 and obstructions in our work, by our friends that are about us, and are 
 taken off by civil respects from our spiritual concerns. Those who 
 really wish well to us and to our work, may sometimes, by their 
 indiscretion, prove our back-friends, and impediments to us in our 
 duty; as <I>Peter</I> was offensive to Christ, with his, "<I>Master, 
 spare thyself,</I>" when he thought himself very officious. The mother 
 of our Lord desired to speak with him; it seemed she had not then 
 learned to command her Son, as the iniquity and idolatry of the church 
 of Rome has since pretended to teach her: nor was she so free from 
 fault and folly as they would make her. It was Christ's prerogative, 
 and not his mother's, to do every thing wisely, and well, and in its 
 season. Christ once said to his mother, <I>How is it that ye sought me? 
 Wist ye not, that I must be about my Father's business?</I> And it was
 then said, she <I>laid up that saying in her heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:49">Luke ii. 49</A>);

 but if she had remembered it now, she would not have given him this
 interruption when he was about his Father's business. Note, There is 
 many a good truth that we thought was well laid up when we heard it, 
 which yet is out of the way when we have occasion to use it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he resented this interruption, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:48-50"><I>v.</I> 48-50</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He would not hearken to it; he was so intent upon his work, that no 
 natural or civil respects should take him off from it. <I>Who is my 
 mother and who are my brethren?</I> Not that natural affection is to be 
 put off, or that, under pretence of religion, we may be disrespectful 
 to parents, or unkind to other relations; but <I>every thing is 
 beautiful in its season,</I> and the less duty must stand by, while the 
 greater is done. When our regard to our relations comes in competition 
 with the service of God, and the improving of an opportunity to <I>do 
 good,</I> in such a case, we must <I>say to our Father, I have not seen 
 him,</I> as Levi did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">Deut. xxxiii. 9</A>.

 The nearest relations must be comparatively hated, that is, we must
 love them less than Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:26">Luke xiv. 26</A>),

 and our duty to God must have the preference. This Christ has here
 given us an example of; <I>the zeal of God's house</I> did so far 
 <I>eat him up,</I> that it made him not only forget himself, but forget 
 his dearest relations. And we must not take it ill of our friends, nor 
 put it upon the score of their wickedness, if they prefer the pleasing 
 of God before the pleasing of us; but we must readily forgive those 
 neglects which may be easily imputed to a pious zeal for God's glory 
 and others' good. Nay, we must deny ourselves and our own
 satisfaction, rather than do that which may any way divert our friends 
 from, or distract them in, their duty to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He took that occasion to prefer his disciples, who were his 
 spiritual kindred, before his natural relations as such: which was a 
 good reason why he would not leave preaching to speak with his 
 brethren. He would rather be profiting his disciples, than pleasing his 
 relations. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The description of Christ's disciples. They are such as <I>do the 
 will of his Father;</I> not only hear it, and know it, and talk of it, 
 but <I>do it;</I> for doing the will of God is the best preparative for 
 discipleship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>),
 
 and the best proof of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:21"><I>ch.</I> vii. 21</A>);

 <I>that</I> denominates us his disciples indeed. Christ does not say,
 "Whosoever shall do my will," for he came not to seek or do his own
 will distinct from his Father's: his will and his Father's are the
 same; but he refers us to his Father's will, because now in his present
 state and work he referred himself to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:38">John vi. 38</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The dignity of Christ's disciples: <I>The same is my brother, and 
 sister, and mother.</I> His disciples, that had left all to follow him, 
 and embraced his doctrine, were dearer to him than any that were akin 
 to him according to the flesh. They had preferred Christ before their 
 relations; they <I>left their father</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:22,10:37"><I>ch.</I> iv. 22; x. 37</A>);

 and now to make them amends, and to show that there was no love lost,
 he preferred them before his relations. Did not they hereby receive, in 
 point of honour, <I>a hundred fold?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:29"><I>ch.</I> xix. 29</A>.

 It was very endearing and very encouraging for Christ to say, <I>Behold
 my mother and my brethren;</I> yet it was not <I>their</I> privilege 
 alone, <I>this honour have all the saints.</I> Note, All obedient 
 believers are near akin to Jesus Christ. They wear his name, bear his 
 image, have his nature, are of his family. He loves them, converses 
 freely with them as his relations. He bids them welcome to his table, 
 takes care of them, provides for them, sees that they want nothing that 
 is fit for them: when he died he left them rich legacies, now he is in 
 heaven he keeps up a correspondence with them, and will have them all 
 with him at last, and will in nothing fail to <I>do the kinsman's 
 part</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:13">Ruth iii. 13</A>),

 nor will ever be ashamed of his poor relations, but will confess them
 before men, before the angels, and before his Father.</P>
