 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 W<FONT SIZE=-1>E</FONT> have heard the evidence given in by the first 
 witness to the doctrine and miracles of our Lord Jesus; and now here is 
 another witness produced, who calls for our attention. The second 
 <I>living creature</I> saith, <I>Come, and see,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:3">Rev. vi. 3</A>.

 Now let us enquire a little,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning <I>this witness.</I> His name is <I>Mark. Marcus</I> was 
 a Roman name, and a very common one, and yet we have no reason to 
 think, but that he was by birth a Jew; but as Saul, when he went among 
 the nations, took the Roman name of <I>Paul,</I> so he of <I>Mark,</I> 
 his Jewish name perhaps being <I>Mardocai;</I> so Grotius. We read of 
 John whose surname was <I>Mark,</I> sister's son to Barnabas, whom Paul 
 was displeased with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:37,38">Acts xv. 37, 38</A>),

 but afterward had a great kindness for, and not only ordered the 
 churches to receive him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:10">Col. iv. 10</A>),

 but sent for him to be his assistant, with this encomium, <I>He is 
 profitable to me for the ministry</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:11">2 Tim. iv. 11</A>);

 and he reckons him among his fellow-labourers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Philem+1:24">Philemon 24</A>.

 We read of Marcus whom Peter calls his <I>son,</I> he having been an
 instrument of his conversion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:13">1 Pet. v. 13</A>);

 whether that was the same with the other, and, if not, which of them 
 was the penman of this gospel, is altogether uncertain. It is a 
 tradition very current among the ancients, that St. Mark wrote this
 gospel under the direction of St. Peter, and that it was confirmed by 
 his authority; so Hieron. Catal. Script. Eccles. <I>Marcus discipulus
 et interpres Petri, juxta quod Petrum referentem audierat, legatus Roma 
 &agrave; fratribus, breve scripsit evangelium--Mark, the disciple and 
 interpreter of Peter, being sent from Rome by the brethren, wrote a 
 concise gospel;</I> and Tertullian saith (Adv. Marcion. lib. 4, cap. 
 5), <I>Marcus quod edidit, Petri affirmetur, cujus interpres 
 Marcus--Mark, the interpreter of Peter, delivered in writing the things 
 which had been preached by Peter.</I> But as Dr. Whitby very well 
 suggests, Why should we have recourse to the authority of Peter for the 
 support of this gospel, or say with St. Jerome that Peter approved of
 it and recommended it by his authority to the church to be read, when, 
 though it is true Mark was no apostle, yet we have all the reason in 
 the world to think that both he and Luke were of the number of the 
 seventy disciples, who <I>companied with the apostles all along</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:21">Acts i. 21</A>),
 
 who had a commission like that of the apostles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:19,Mk+16:18">Luke x. 19, 
 compared with Mark xvi. 18</A>),

 and who, it is highly probable, received the Holy Ghost when they did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:15,2:1-4">Acts i. 15; ii. 1-4</A>),

 so that it is no diminution at all to the validity or value of this 
 gospel, that Mark was not one of the twelve, as Matthew and John were? 
 St. Jerome saith that, after the writing of this gospel, he went into 
 Egypt, and was the first that preached the gospel at Alexandria, where 
 he founded a church, to which he was a great example of holy living.
 <I>Constituit ecclesiam tant&acirc; doctrin&acirc; et vit&aelig; 
 continenti&acirc; ut omnes sectatores Christi ad exemplum sui 
 cogeret--He so adorned, by his doctrine and his life, the church which 
 he founded, that his example influenced all the followers of 
 Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning <I>this testimony.</I> Mark's gospel, 

 1. Is but short, much shorter than Matthew's, not giving so full an
 account of Christ's sermons as that did, but insisting chiefly on his 
 miracles. 

 2. It is very much a repetition of what we had in Matthew; many
 remarkable circumstances being added to the stories there related, but 
 not many new matters. When many witnesses are called to prove the same 
 fact, upon which a judgment is to be given, it is not thought 
 <I>tedious,</I> but highly <I>necessary,</I> that they should each of 
 them relate it in their own words, again and again, that by the 
 agreement of the testimony the thing may be established; and therefore 
 we must not think this book of scripture needless, for it is written 
 not only to confirm our belief that <I>Jesus is the Christ the Son of 
 God,</I> but to put us in mind of things which we have read in the 
 foregoing gospel, that we may <I>give the more earnest heed to 
 them,</I> lest at any time we let them slip; and even <I>pure minds</I> 
 have need to be <I>thus stirred up by way of remembrance.</I> It was 
 fit that such great things as these should be spoken and written, once, 
 yea twice, because man is so <I>unapt</I> to <I>perceive</I> them, and 
 so <I>apt</I> to <I>forget</I> them. There is no ground for the 
 tradition, that this gospel was written first in Latin, though it was 
 written at Rome; it was written in Greek, as was St. Paul's epistle to 
 the Romans, the Greek being the more universal language.</P>
