 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter, we have an account of the birth and infancy of our 
 Lord Jesus: having had notice of his conception, and of the birth and
 infancy of his forerunner, in the former chapter. The First-begotten is 
 here brought into the world; let us go meet him with our hosannas, 
 blessed is he that cometh. Here is, 

 I. The place and other circumstances of his birth, which proved him to
 be the true Messiah, and such a one as we needed, but not such a one as 
 the Jews expected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. The notifying of his birth to the shepherds in that neighbourhood
 by an angel, the song of praise which the angels sung upon that 
 occasion, and the spreading of the report of it by the shepherds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:8-20">ver. 8-20</A>.
 
 III. The circumcision of Christ, and the naming of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:21">ver. 21</A>.
 
 IV. The presenting of him in the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:22-24">ver. 22-24</A>.

 V. The testimonies of Simeon, and Anna the prophetess, concerning him,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:25-39">ver. 25-39</A>.

 VI. Christ's growth and capacity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:40-52">ver. 40-52</A>.

 VIII. His observing the passover at twelve years old, and his disputing 
 with the doctors in the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:41-51">ver. 41-51</A>.
 
 And this, with what we have met with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:1-2:23">Matt. i. and ii.</A>),

 is all we have concerning our Lord Jesus, till he entered upon his
 public work in the thirtieth year of his age.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a
 decree from C&aelig;sar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.
 &nbsp; 2 (<I>And</I> this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor
 of Syria.)
 &nbsp; 3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
 &nbsp; 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of
 Nazareth, into Jud&aelig;a, unto the city of David, which is called
 Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)
 &nbsp; 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with
 child.
 &nbsp; 6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were
 accomplished that she should be delivered.
 &nbsp; 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in
 swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no
 room for them in the inn.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <I>fulness of time</I> was now come, when God would send forth his 
 Son, <I>made of a woman,</I> and <I>made under the law;</I> and it was 
 foretold that he should be born at Bethlehem. Now here we have an 
 account of the time, place, and manner of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when our Lord Jesus was born. Several things may be 
 gathered out of these verses which intimate to us that it was the 
 <I>proper time.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was born at the time when the <I>fourth monarchy</I> was in its 
 height, just when it was become, more than any of the three before it, 
 a <I>universal monarchy.</I> He was born <I>in the days</I> of Augustus 
 C&aelig;sar, when the Roman empire extended itself further than ever 
 before or since, including Parthia one way, and Britain another way; so 
 that it was then called <I>Terraram orbis imperium--The empire of the 
 whole earth;</I> and here that empire is called <I>all the world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 for there was scarcely any part of the civilized world, but what was 
 dependent on it. Now this was the time when the Messiah was to be born, 
 according to Daniel's prophecy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:44">Dan. ii. 44</A>):

 <I>In the days of these kings,</I> the kings of the fourth monarchy, 
 <I>shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be 
 destroyed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was born when Judea was become a province of the empire, and 
 tributary to it; as appears evidently by this, that when all the Roman 
 empire was taxed, the Jews were taxed among the rest. Jerusalem was 
 taken by Pompey the Roman general, about sixty years before this, who 
 granted the government of the church to Hyrcanus, but not the 
 government of the state; by degrees it was more and more reduced, till 
 now at length it was quite subdued; for Judea was ruled by Cyrenius the 
 Roman governor of Syria 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 the Roman writers call him <I>Sulpitius Quirinus.</I> Now just at this 
 juncture, the Messiah was to be born, for so was dying Jacob's 
 prophecy, that Shiloh should come when the <I>sceptre was departed from 
 Judah,</I> and the <I>lawgiver from between his feet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>.
 
 This was the <I>first taxing</I> that was made in Judea, the first
 badge of their servitude; therefore now Shiloh must come, to set up his 
 kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. There is another circumstance, as to the time, implied in this 
 general enrolment of all the subjects of the empire, which is, that 
 there was now universal peace in the empire. The temple of Janus was 
 now shut, which it never used to be if any wars were on foot; and now 
 it was fit for the Prince of peace to be born, in whose days <I>swords 
 should be beaten into plough-shares.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The place where our Lord Jesus was born is very observable. He was 
 born at <I>Bethlehem;</I> so it was foretold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:2">Mic. v. 2</A>),

 the scribes so understood it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:5,6">Matt. ii. 5, 6</A>),
 
 so did the common people,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:42">John vii. 42</A>.

 The name of the place was significant. Bethlehem signifies <I>the
 house of bread;</I> a proper place for him to be born in who is the 
 Bread of life, the Bread that <I>came down from heaven.</I> But that 
 was not all; Bethlehem was the city of David, where he was born, and 
 therefore there <I>he</I> must be born who was the <I>Son of David.</I> 
 Zion was also called <I>the city of David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:7">2 Sam. v. 7</A>),

 yet Christ was not born there; for Bethlehem was that city of David 
 where he was born in meanness, to be a <I>shepherd;</I> and this our 
 Saviour, when he humbled himself, chose for the place of his birth; not 
 Zion, where he ruled in power and prosperity, that was to be a type of 
 the church of Christ, <I>that mount Zion.</I> Now when the virgin Mary 
 was with child, and near her time, Providence so ordered it that, by 
 order from the emperor, all the subjects of the <I>Roman empire</I> 
 were to be <I>taxed;</I> that is, they were to <I>give in their 
 names</I> to the proper officers, and they were to be <I>registered</I> 
 and <I>enrolled,</I> according to their families, which is the proper 
 signification of the word here used; their being <I>taxed</I> was but 
 secondary. It is supposed that they made profession of subjection to 
 the Roman empire, either by some set form of words, or at least by 
 payment of some small tribute, a penny suppose, in token of their 
 allegiance, like a man's <I>atturning</I> tenant. Thus are they vassals 
 upon record, and may thank themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 According to this <I>decree,</I> the Jews (who were now nice in 
 distinguishing their tribes and families) provided that in their 
 enrolments particular care should be had to preserve the memory of 
 them. Thus foolishly are they solicitous to save the <I>shadow,</I> 
 when they had lost the <I>substance.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 That which Augustus designed was either to gratify his <I>pride</I> in 
 knowing the numbers of his people, and proclaiming it to the world, or 
 he did it in <I>policy,</I> to strengthen his interest, and make his 
 government appear the more formidable; but Providence had another reach 
 in it. All the world shall be at the trouble of being <I>enrolled,</I> 
 only that Joseph and Mary may. This brought them up from Nazareth in 
 Galilee to Bethlehem in Judea, because they were <I>of the stock and 
 lineage of David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>);

 and perhaps, being poor and low, they thought the royalty of their 
 extraction rather than a burden and expense to them than a matter of 
 pride. Because it is difficult to suppose that every Jew (women as well 
 as men) was obliged to repair to the city of which their ancestors 
 were, and there be enrolled, now, at a time when they kept not to the 
 bounds of their tribes, as formerly, it may be offered as a conjecture 
 that this great exactness was used only with the <I>family of 
 David,</I> concerning which, it is probable, the emperor gave 
 particular orders, it having been the royal family, and still talked of 
 as designed to be so, that he might know its number and strength. 
 Divers ends of Providence were served by this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Hereby the virgin Mary was brought, <I>great with child,</I> to 
 Bethlehem, to be <I>delivered</I> there, according to the prediction; 
 whereas she had designed to lie in at Nazareth. See how <I>man purposes 
 and God disposes;</I> and how Providence orders all things for the 
 fulfilling of the scripture, and makes use of the projects men have for 
 serving their own purposes, quite beyond their intention, to serve 
 his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Hereby it appeared that Jesus Christ was of the <I>seed</I> of 
 David; for what brings his mother to Bethlehem now, but because she 
 <I>was of the stock and lineage of David?</I> This was a material thing 
 to be proved, and required such an authentic proof as this. Justin 
 Martyr and Tertullian, two of the earliest advocates for the Christian 
 religion, appeal to these <I>rolls</I> or <I>records</I> of the 
 <I>Roman empire,</I> for the proof of Christ's being born of the house 
 of David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Hereby it appeared that he was <I>made under the law;</I> for he 
 became a subject of the Roman empire as soon as he was born, a 
 <I>servant of rulers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:7">Isa. xlix. 7</A>.

 Many suppose that, being born during the time of the taxing, he was
 enrolled as well as his father and mother, that it might appear how 
 <I>he made himself of no reputation,</I> and <I>took upon him the form 
 of a servant.</I> Instead of having kings tributaries to him, when he 
 came into the world he was himself a tributary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The circumstances of his birth, which were very mean, and under 
 all possible marks of contempt. He was indeed a <I>first-born son;</I> 
 but it was a poor honour to be the first-born of such a poor woman as 
 Mary was, who had no inheritance to which he might be entitled as 
 first-born, but what was <I>in nativity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was under some abasements in common with other children; he was 
 <I>wrapped in swaddling clothes,</I> as other children are when they 
 are new-born, as if he could be bound, or needed to be kept straight. 
 He that makes darkness a <I>swaddling band for the sea</I> was himself 
 wrapped in <I>swaddling bands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:9">Job xxxviii. 9</A>.

 The everlasting Father became a child of time, and men said to him
 whose out-goings were of old from everlasting, <I>We know this man, 
 whence he is,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:27">John vii. 27</A>.
 
 The Ancient of days became an infant of a span long.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was under some abasements peculiar to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He was born <I>at an inn.</I> That son of David that was the glory 
 of his father's house had no inheritance that he could command, no not 
 in the city of David, no nor a friend that would accommodate his mother 
 in distress with lodgings to be brought to bed in. Christ was born 
 <I>in an inn,</I> to intimate that he came into the world but to 
 sojourn here for awhile, as in an inn, and to teach us to do likewise. 
 An inn receives all comers, and so does Christ. He hangs out the banner 
 of love for his sign, and whoever comes to him, he will in no wise cast 
 out; only, unlike other inns, he welcomes those that come <I>without 
 money and without price.</I> All is on free cost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He was born <I>in a stable;</I> so some think the word signifies 
 which we translate <I>a manger,</I> a place for cattle to stand to be 
 fed in. Because there was <I>no room in the inn,</I> and for want of 
 conveniences, nay for want of necessaries, he was laid <I>in a 
 manger,</I> instead of a cradle. The word which we render <I>swaddling 
 clothes</I> some derive from a word that signifies to <I>rend,</I> or 
 <I>tear,</I> and these infer that he was so far from having a good suit 
 of child-bed linen, that his very swaddles were ragged and torn. His 
 being born in a stable and laid in a manger was an instance, 

 [1.] Of the poverty of his parents. Had they been rich, room would have 
 been made for them; but, being poor, they must <I>shift</I> as they 
 <I>could.</I> 

 [2.] Of the corruption and degeneracy of manners in that age; that a 
 woman in reputation for virtue and honour should be used so 
 barbarously. If there had been any common humanity among them, they 
 would not have turned a woman in travail into a stable. 

 [3.] It was an instance of the humiliation of our Lord Jesus. We were 
 become by sin like an out-cast infant, helpless and forlorn; and such a 
 one Christ was. Thus he would answer the type of Moses, the great 
 prophet and lawgiver of the Old Testament, who was in his infancy cast 
 out in an ark of bulrushes, as Christ <I>in a manger.</I> Christ would 
 hereby put a contempt upon all worldly glory, and teach us to slight 
 it. Since <I>his own received him not,</I> let us not think it strange 
 if they <I>receive us not.</I></P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
 field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
 &nbsp; 9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory
 of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
 &nbsp; 10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring
 you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
 &nbsp; 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a
 Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.
 &nbsp; 12 And this <I>shall be</I> a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
 wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
 &nbsp; 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
 heavenly host praising God, and saying,
 &nbsp; 14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will
 toward men.
 &nbsp; 15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them
 into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go
 even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,
 which the Lord hath made known unto us.
 &nbsp; 16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and
 the babe lying in a manger.
 &nbsp; 17 And when they had seen <I>it,</I> they made known abroad the
 saying which was told them concerning this child.
 &nbsp; 18 And all they that heard <I>it</I> wondered at those things which
 were told them by the shepherds.
 &nbsp; 19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered <I>them</I> in her
 heart.
 &nbsp; 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for
 all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto
 them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The meanest circumstances of Christ's humiliation were all along 
 attended with some discoveries of his glory, to balance them, and take 
 off the offence of them; for even when he humbled himself God did in 
 some measure exalt him and give him earnests of his future exaltation. 
 When we saw him <I>wrapped in swaddling clothes</I> and <I>laid in a 
 manger,</I> we were tempted to say, "Surely this cannot be the <I>Son 
 of God.</I>" But see his birth attended, as it is here, with a choir of 
 angels, and we shall say, "Surely this cannot be the <I>Son of 
 God.</I>" But see his birth attended, as it is here, with a choir of 
 angels, and we shall say, "Surely it can be no other than the <I>Son of 
 God,</I> concerning whom it was said, when he was <I>brought into the 
 world, Let all the angels of God worship him,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:6">Heb. i. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We had in Matthew an account of the notice given of the arrival of this 
 ambassador, this prince from heaven, to the wise men, who were 
 Gentiles, by a star; here we are told of the notice given of it to the 
 shepherds, who were Jews, by an angel: to each God chose to speak in 
 the language they were most conversant with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See here how the shepherds were employed; they were <I>abiding in 
 the fields</I> adjoining to Bethlehem, and <I>keeping watch over their 
 flocks by night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The angel was not sent to the chief priests or the elders (they were
 not prepared to receive these tidings), but to a company of poor 
 shepherds, who were like Jacob, <I>plain men dwelling in tents,</I> not 
 like Esau, <I>cunning hunters.</I> The patriarchs were shepherds. Moses 
 and David particularly were called from keeping sheep to rule God's 
 people; and by this instance God would show that he had still a favour 
 for those of that innocent employment. Tidings were brought to Moses of 
 the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, when he was keeping sheep, and 
 to these shepherds, who, it is probable, were devout pious men, the 
 tidings were brought of a <I>greater salvation.</I> Observe, 

 1. They were not <I>sleeping</I> in their beds, when this news was
 brought them (though many had very acceptable intelligence from heaven 
 in <I>slumbering upon the bed</I>), but <I>abiding in the fields,</I> 
 and <I>watching.</I> Those that would hear from God must <I>stir up 
 themselves.</I> They were broad awake, and therefore could not be 
 deceived in what they saw and heard, so as those may be who are half 
 asleep. 

 2. They were employed now, not in acts of devotion, but in the business
 of their calling; they were <I>keeping watch over their flock,</I> to 
 secure them from thieves and beasts of prey, it being probably in the 
 summer time, when they kept their cattle out all night, as we do now, 
 and did not house them. Note, We are not out of the way of divine 
 visits when we are sensibly employed in an honest calling, and abide 
 with God in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they were surprised with the appearance of the angel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 <I>Behold, an angel of the Lord came upon them,</I> of a sudden, 
 <B><I>epeste</I></B>--<I>stood over them;</I> most probably, in the air 
 over their heads, as coming immediately from heaven. We read it, <I>the 
 angel,</I> as if it were the same that appeared once and again in the 
 chapter before, <I>the angel Gabriel,</I> that was caused to fly 
 swiftly; but that is not certain. The angel's <I>coming upon them</I> 
 intimates that they little thought of such a thing, or expected it; for 
 it is in a <I>preventing</I> way that gracious visits are made us from 
 heaven, <I>or ever we are aware.</I> That they might be sure it was an 
 angel from heaven, they saw and heard the <I>glory of the Lord round 
 about them;</I> such as made the night as bright as day, such a glory 
 as used to attend God's appearance, a <I>heavenly</I> glory, or an 
 <I>exceedingly great glory,</I> such as they could not bear the 
 dazzling lustre of. This made them <I>sore afraid,</I> put them into
 great consternation, as fearing some evil tidings. While we are 
 conscious to ourselves of so much guilt, we have reason to fear lest 
 every express from heaven should be a messenger of wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What the message was which the angel had to deliver to the 
 shepherds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>.

 1. He gives a <I>supersedeas</I> to their <I>fears:</I> "<I>Fear 
 not,</I> for we have nothing to say to you that needs be a terror to 
 you; you <I>need not</I> fear your enemies, and <I>should not</I> fear 
 your friends." 

 2. He furnishes them with abundant matter for joy: "Behold, I
 <I>evangelize to you great joy;</I> I solemnly declare it, and you have 
 reason to bid it welcome, for it shall bring <I>joy to all people,</I> 
 and not to the people of the Jews only; that <I>unto you is born this 
 day,</I> at this time, <I>a Saviour,</I> the Saviour that has been so 
 long expected, <I>which is Christ the Lord, in the city of David,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah, the Anointed; he is <I>the Lord,</I> 
 Lord of all; he is a sovereign prince; nay, he is God, for <I>the 
 Lord,</I> in the Old Testament, answers to <I>Jehovah.</I> He is a 
 Saviour, and he will be a Saviour to those only that accept him for 
 their Lord. "The Saviour <I>is born,</I> he is born <I>this day;</I>
 and, since it is matter of <I>great joy to all people,</I> it is not to 
 be kept secret, you may proclaim it, may tell it to whom you please. He 
 is born in the place where it was foretold he should be born, in the 
 <I>city of David;</I> and he is born <I>to you;</I> to you Jews he is 
 sent in the first place, to <I>bless you,</I> to you <I>shepherds,</I> 
 though poor and mean in the world." This refers to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6">Isa. ix. 6</A>,

 <I>Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given.</I> To <I>you</I>
 men, not to <I>us</I> angels; he took not on him the nature of angels. 
 This is matter of <I>joy</I> indeed to all people, great joy. 
 Long-looked for is come at last. Let heaven and earth rejoice before 
 this Lord, <I>for he cometh.</I>

 3. He gives them a sign for the confirming of their faith in this
 matter. "How shall we find out this child in Bethlehem, which is now 
 full of the descendants from David?" "You will find him by this token: 
 he is lying in a <I>manger,</I> where surely never any new-born infant 
 was laid before." They expected to be told, "You shall find him, though 
 a babe, dressed up in robes, and lying in the best house in the town, 
 lying in state, with a numerous train of attendants in rich liveries." 
 "No, you will find him wrapped in <I>swaddling clothes,</I> and <I>laid 
 in a manger.</I>" When Christ was here upon earth, he 
 <I>distinguished</I> himself, and made himself remarkable, by nothing 
 so much as the instances of his <I>humiliation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The angels' <I>doxology</I> to God, and <I>congratulations</I> of 
 men, upon this solemn occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 The message was no sooner delivered by one angel (that was sufficient 
 to go express) than suddenly there was with that angel <I>a multitude 
 of the heavenly hosts;</I> sufficient, we may be sure, to make a 
 <I>chorus,</I> that were heard by the shepherds, <I>praising God;</I> 
 and certainly their song was not like that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:3">Rev. xiv. 3</A>)

 which <I>no man could learn,</I> for it was designed that we should all 
 learn it. 

 1. Let God have the honour of this work: <I>Glory to God in the
 highest.</I> God's good-will to men, manifested in sending the Messiah, 
 redounds very much to his praise; and angels in the highest heavens, 
 though not immediately interested in it themselves, will celebrate it 
 to his honour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:11,12">Rev. v. 11, 12</A>.

 <I>Glory to God,</I> whose kindness and love designed this favour, and 
 whose wisdom contrived it in such a way as that one divine attribute 
 should not be glorified at the expense of another, but the honour of 
 all effectually secured and advanced. Other works of God are for his 
 glory, but the redemption of the world is for his <I>glory in the 
 highest.</I> 

 2. Let men have the joy of it: <I>On earth peace, good-will toward
 men.</I> God's <I>good-will</I> in sending the Messiah introduced peace 
 in this lower world, slew the enmity that sin had raised between God 
 and man, and resettled a peaceable correspondence. If God be at peace
 with us, all peace results from it: peace of conscience, peace with 
 angels, peace between Jew and Gentile. Peace is here put for <I>all 
 good,</I> all that good which flows to us from the incarnation of 
 Christ. All the <I>good</I> we have, or hope, is owing to God's 
 <I>good-will;</I> and, if we have the comfort of it, he must have the 
 glory of it. Nor must any <I>peace,</I> and <I>good,</I> be expected in 
 a way inconsistent with the glory of God; therefore not in any way of 
 sin, nor in any way but by <I>a Mediator.</I> Here was the <I>peace 
 proclaimed</I> with great solemnity; whoever will, let them come and 
 take the benefit of it. It is on earth peace, to <I>men of 
 good-will</I> (so some copies read it), <B><I>en anthropois 
 eudokias</I></B>; to men who have a <I>good-will to God,</I> and are 
 willing to be reconciled; or to men whom God has a <I>good-will to,</I> 
 though vessels of his mercy. See how well affected the angels are to 
 man, and to his welfare and happiness; how well pleased they were in 
 the incarnation of the Son of God, though he passed by their nature; 
 and ought not we much more to be affected with it? This is a 
 <I>faithful saying,</I> attested by an innumerable company of angels, 
 and well <I>worthy of all acceptation, That the good-will of God toward 
 men is glory to God in the highest, and peace on the earth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The visit which the shepherds made to the new-born Saviour. 

 1. They consulted about it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 While the angels were singing their hymn, they could attend to that 
 only; but, <I>when they were gone away from them into heaven</I> (for 
 angels, when they appeared, never made any long stay, but returned as 
 soon as they had despatched their business), <I>the shepherds said one 
 to another, Let us go to Bethlehem.</I> Note, When extraordinary 
 messages from the upper world are no more to be expected, we must set 
 ourselves to improve the advantages we have for the confirming of our 
 faith, and the keeping up of our communion with God in this lower 
 world. And it is no reflection upon the testimony of angels, no nor 
 upon a divine testimony itself, to get it corroborated by observation 
 and experience. But observe, These shepherds do not speak doubtfully, 
 "Let us go see whether it be so or no;" but with assurance, <I>Let us 
 go see this thing which is come to pass;</I> for what room was left to 
 doubt of it, when <I>the Lord had</I> thus <I>made it known to 
 them?</I> The <I>word spoken by angels was stedfast</I> and 
 unquestionably true. 
 
 2. They immediately made the visit,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 They lost no time, but <I>came with haste</I> to the place, which,
 probably, the angel directed them to more particularly than is recorded 
 ("Go to the stable of such an inn"); and there <I>they found Mary and
 Joseph,</I> and <I>the babe lying in the manger.</I> The poverty and 
 meanness in which they found <I>Christ the Lord</I> were no shock to 
 their faith, who themselves knew what it was to live a life of 
 comfortable communion with God in very poor and mean circumstances. We 
 have reason to think that the shepherds told Joseph and Mary of the 
 vision of the angels they had seen, and the song of the angels they had 
 heard, which was a great encouragement to them, more than if a visit 
 had been made them by the best ladies in the town. And it is probable 
 that Joseph and Mary told the shepherds what visions they had had 
 concerning the child; and so, by communicating their experiences to 
 each other, they greatly strengthened one another's faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The care which the shepherds took to spread the report of this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>When they had seen it,</I> though they saw nothing in the child that 
 should induce them to believe that he was <I>Christ the Lord,</I> yet 
 the circumstances, how mean soever they were, agreeing with the sign 
 that the angel had given them, they were abundantly satisfied; and as 
 the lepers argued 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:9">2 Kings xii. 9</A>,

 This being <I>a day of good tidings,</I> we dare not <I>hold our 
 peace</I>), so they made <I>known abroad</I> the whole story of what 
 was <I>told them,</I> both by the <I>angels,</I> and by Joseph and 
 Mary, <I>concerning this child,</I> that he was the Saviour, even 
 <I>Christ the Lord,</I> that in him there is <I>peace on earth,</I> and 
 that he was <I>conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost,</I> and 
 <I>born of a virgin.</I> This they told every body, and agreed in their 
 testimony concerning it. And now if, when he <I>is in the world,</I> 
 the world knows him not, it is <I>their own fault,</I> for they have 
 sufficient notice given them. What impression did it make upon people? 
 Why truly, <I>All they that heard it wondered at those things which 
 were told them by the shepherds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The shepherds were plain, downright, <I>honest men,</I> and they could 
 not suspect them guilty of any design to impose upon them; what they 
 had said therefore was likely to be true, and, if true, they could not 
 but wonder at it, that the Messiah should be born <I>in a stable</I> 
 and not in a palace, that angels should bring news of it to <I>poor 
 shepherds</I> and not to the chief priests. They wondered, but never 
 <I>enquired any further</I> about the Saviour, their duty to him, or 
 advantages by him, but let the thing drop as a <I>nine days' 
 wonder.</I> O the amazing stupidity of the men of that generation!
 Justly were the things which belonged to their peace <I>hid from their 
 eyes,</I> when they thus wilfully <I>shut their eyes</I> against 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The use which those made of these things, who did believe them. 

 1. The virgin Mary made them the matter of her <I>private
 meditation.</I> She said little, but <I>kept all these things,</I> and 
 <I>pondered them in her heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 She laid the evidences together, and kept them in reserve, to be 
 compared with the discoveries that should afterwards be made her. As 
 she had silently left it to God to clear up her virtue, when that was 
 suspected, so she silently leaves it to him to publish her honour, now 
 when it was veiled; and it is satisfaction enough to find that, if no 
 one else takes notice of the birth of her child, angels do. Note, The 
 truths of Christ are worth keeping; and the way to keep them safe is to 
 <I>ponder them.</I> Meditation is the best help to memory.

 2. The shepherds made them the matter of their more <I>public
 praises.</I> If others were not affected with those things, yet they 
 themselves were

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 They <I>returned, glorifying and praising God,</I> in concurrence with
 the holy angels. If others would not regard the report they made to 
 them, God would accept the thanksgivings they offered to him. They 
 praised God for what <I>they had heard</I> from the angel, and for what 
 <I>they had seen,</I> the babe <I>in the manger,</I> and just then 
 <I>in the swaddling,</I> when they came in, as it had been spoken to 
 them. They thanked God that they had seen Christ, though in the depth 
 of his humiliation. As afterwards the cross of Christ, so now his 
 <I>manger,</I> was to some <I>foolishness</I> and a 
 <I>stumbling-block,</I> but others saw in it, and admired, and praised, 
 the wisdom <I>of God</I> and the <I>power of God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising
 of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of
 the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
 &nbsp; 22 And when the days of her purification according to the law
 of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to
 present <I>him</I> to the Lord;
 &nbsp; 23 (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that
 openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)
 &nbsp; 24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in
 the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus, being <I>made of a woman,</I> was <I>made under the 
 law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:4">Gal. iv. 4</A>.

 He was not only, as the son of a daughter of Adam, made under the law
 of <I>nature,</I> but as the son of a daughter of Abraham was made 
 under the law of <I>Moses;</I> he put his neck under that yoke, though 
 it was a heavy yoke, and a <I>shadow of good things to come.</I> Though 
 its institutions were <I>beggarly elements,</I> and <I>rudiments of 
 this world,</I> as the apostle calls them, Christ submitted to it, that 
 he might with the better grace cancel it, and set it aside for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now here we have two instances of his being <I>made under</I> that 
 <I>law,</I> and submitting to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He was <I>circumcised</I> on the very day that the law appointed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>When eight days were accomplished,</I> that day seven-night that he 
 was born, they <I>circumcised</I> him. 

 1. Though it was a <I>painful</I> operation (<I>Surely a bloody husband
 thou has been,</I> said Zipporah to Moses, <I>because of the 
 circumcision,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:25">Exod. iv. 25</A>),
 
 yet Christ would undergo it for us; nay, <I>therefore</I> he submitted
 to it, to give an instance of his early obedience, his obedience unto 
 blood. Then he shed his blood by drops, which afterwards he poured out 
 in purple streams. 

 2. Though it supposed him a <I>stranger,</I> that was by that ceremony
 to be admitted into covenant with God, whereas he had always been his 
 <I>beloved Son;</I> nay, though it supposed him a <I>sinner,</I> that 
 needed to have his filthiness taken away, whereas he had no impurity or 
 superfluity of naughtiness to be cut off, <I>yet</I> he submitted to 
 it; nay, <I>therefore</I> he submitted to it, because he would be made 
 in the likeness, not only of <I>flesh,</I> but of <I>sinful flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Rom. viii. 3</A>.

 3. Though thereby he made himself a <I>debtor to the whole law</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:3">Gal. v. 3</A>),

 yet he submitted to it; nay, <I>therefore</I> he submitted to it,
 because he would take upon him the form of a servant, though he was 
 free-born. Christ was circumcised, 

 (1.) That he might own himself of the seed of Abraham, and of that 
 nation <I>of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came,</I> and who 
 was to <I>take on him the seed of Abraham,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:16">Heb. ii. 16</A>.

 (2.) That he might own himself a surety for our sins, and an undertaker
 for our safety. Circumcision (saith Dr. Goodwin) was our <I>bond,</I>
 whereby we acknowledged ourselves <I>debtors to the law;</I> and 
 Christ, by being circumcised, did as it were set his hand to it, being 
 <I>made sin for us.</I> The ceremonial law consisted much in 
 sacrifices; Christ hereby obliged himself to offer, not the blood of 
 bulls or goats, but his own blood, which none that ever were 
 circumcised before could oblige themselves to. 

 (3.) That he might justify, and put an honour upon, the dedication of 
 the infant seed of the church to God, by that ordinance which is the 
 instituted seal of the covenant, and of the righteousness which is by 
 faith, as circumcision was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:11">Rom. iv. 11</A>),

 and baptism is. And certainly his being circumcised at eight days old 
 doth make much more for the dedicating of the seed of the faithful by 
 baptism in their infancy than his being baptized at thirty years old 
 doth for the deferring of it till they are grown up. The change of the 
 ceremony alters not the substance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 At his circumcision, according to the custom, he had his name given 
 him; he was called <I>Jesus</I> or <I>Joshua,</I> for he was <I>so 
 named of the angel</I> to his mother Mary <I>before he was conceived in 
 the womb</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:31">Luke i. 31</A>),
 
 and to his supposed father Joseph after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:21">Matt. i. 21</A>.

 [1.] It was a <I>common name</I> among the Jews, as John was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:11">Col. iv. 11</A>),
 
 and in this he would be made <I>like unto his brethren.</I>

 [2.] It was the name of two eminent types of him in the Old Testament,
 Joshua, the success or of Moses, who was commander of Israel, and
 conqueror of Canaan; and Joshua, the high priest, who was therefore
 purposely crowned, that he might prefigure Christ as a <I>priest upon
 his throne,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:11,13">Zech. vi. 11, 13</A>.

 [3.] It was very significant of his undertaking. Jesus signifies a
 <I>Saviour.</I> He would be denominated, not from the glories of his 
 divine nature, but from his gracious designs as Mediator; he <I>brings 
 salvation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He was <I>presented</I> in the temple. This was done with an eye to 
 the law, and at the time appointed by the law, when he was forty days 
 old, <I>when the days of her purification were accomplished,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Many copies, and authentic ones, read <B><I>auton</I></B> for 
 <B><I>autes</I></B>, <I>the days of their purification,</I> the 
 purification both of the mother and of the child, for so it was 
 intended to be by the law; and our Lord Jesus, though he had no 
 impurity to be cleansed from, yet submitted to it, as he did to 
 circumcision, because he was made <I>sin for us;</I> and that, as by 
 the <I>circumcision of Christ</I> we might be <I>circumcised,</I> in 
 the virtue of our union and communion with him, with a spiritual 
 circumcision <I>made without hands</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:11">Col. ii. 11</A>),

 so in the <I>purification</I> of Christ we might be <I>spiritually 
 purified</I> from the filthiness and corruption which we brought into 
 the world with us. Now, according to the law,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The child Jesus, being a first-born son, was <I>presented to the 
 Lord,</I> in one of the courts of the temple. The law is here recited 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord,</I> 
 because by a special writ of protection the first-born of the Egyptians 
 were slain by the destroying angel; so that Christ, as first-born, was 
 a priest by a title surer than that of Aaron's house. Christ was the
 <I>first-born</I> among many brethren, and was <I>called holy to the 
 Lord,</I> so as never any other was; yet he was <I>presented to the 
 Lord</I> as other first-born were, and no otherwise. Though he was 
 newly come out of the bosom of the Father, yet he was <I>presented</I> 
 to him by the hands of a priest, as if he had been a stranger, that 
 needed one to introduce him. His being <I>presented to the Lord</I> now 
 signified his <I>presenting himself</I> to the Lord as Mediator, when 
 he was caused to <I>draw near</I> and <I>approach unto him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:21">Jer. xxx. 21</A>.
 
 But, according to the law, he was <I>redeemed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:15">Num. xviii. 15</A>.

 <I>The first-born of many shalt thou redeem,</I> and <I>five 
 shekels</I> was the value,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+27:6,Nu+18:16">Lev. xxvii. 6; Num. xviii. 16</A>.

 But probably in case of poverty the priest was allowed to take less, or
 perhaps nothing; for no mention is made of it here. Christ was 
 <I>presented to the Lord,</I> not to be <I>brought back,</I> for his 
 <I>ear was bored</I> to God's <I>door-post</I> to serve him for ever; 
 and though he is not left in the temple as Samuel was, to minister 
 there, yet like him he is given to the Lord <I>as long as he lives,</I> 
 and ministers to him in the true temple <I>not made with hands.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The mother brought her offering, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 When she had presented that son of hers unto the Lord who was to be the 
 great sacrifice, she might have been excused from offering any other; 
 but so <I>it is said in the law of the Lord,</I> that law which was yet 
 in force, and therefore so it must be done, she must offer <I>a pair of 
 turtle-doves, or two young pigeons;</I> had she been of ability, she 
 must have brought a <I>lamb for a burnt-offering,</I> and a <I>dove for 
 a sin-offering;</I> but, being poor, and not able to reach the price of 
 a lamb, she brings <I>two doves,</I> one for <I>a burnt-offering and 
 the other for a sin-offering</I> (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+12:6,8">Lev. xii. 6, 8</A>),

 to teach us in every address to God, and particularly in those upon 
 special occasions, both to give thanks to God for his mercies to us and 
 to acknowledge with sorrow and shame our sins against him; in both we 
 must give glory to him, nor do we ever want matter for both. Christ was 
 not <I>conceived</I> and <I>born</I> in sin, as others are, so that 
 there was not that occasion in his case which there is in others; yet, 
 because he was made under the law, he complied with it. <I>Thus it 
 became him to fulfil all righteousness.</I> Much more doth it become 
 the best of men to join in confessions of sin; for <I>who can say, I 
 have made my heart clean?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name <I>was</I>
 Simeon; and the same man <I>was</I> just and devout, waiting for the
 consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.
 &nbsp; 26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he
 should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
 &nbsp; 27 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the
 parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the
 custom of the law,
 &nbsp; 28 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,
 &nbsp; 29 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,
 according to thy word:
 &nbsp; 30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
 &nbsp; 31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
 &nbsp; 32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which
 were spoken of him.
 &nbsp; 34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother,
 Behold, this <I>child</I> is set for the fall and rising again of many
 in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;
 &nbsp; 35 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that
 the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
 &nbsp; 36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of
 Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had
 lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;
 &nbsp; 37 And she <I>was</I> a widow of about fourscore and four years,
 which departed not from the temple, but served <I>God</I> with
 fastings and prayers night and day.
 &nbsp; 38 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the
 Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 39 And when they had performed all things according to the law
 of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city
 Nazareth.
 &nbsp; 40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
 wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Even when he humbles himself, still Christ has honour done him to 
 balance the offence of it. That we might not be stumbled at the 
 <I>meanness of his birth, angels</I> then did him honour; and now, that 
 we may not be offended at his being presented in the temple, like other 
 children born in sin, and without any manner of solemnity peculiar to 
 him, but silently, and in the crowd of other children, Simeon and Anna 
 now do him honour, by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A very honourable testimony is borne to him by Simeon, which was 
 both a reputation to the child and an encouragement to the parents, and 
 might have been a happy introduction of the priests into an 
 acquaintance with the Saviour, if those <I>watchmen</I> had not been 
 <I>blind.</I> Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The account that is given us concerning this Simeon, or Simon. He 
 dwelt now in Jerusalem, and was eminent for his piety and communion 
 with God. Some learned men, who have been conversant with the Jewish 
 writers, find that there was at this time one Simeon, a man of great 
 note in Jerusalem, the son of Hillel, and the first to whom they gave 
 the title of <I>Rabban,</I> the highest title that they gave to their 
 doctors, and which was never given but to seven of them. He succeeded 
 his father Hillel, as president of the college which his father 
 founded, and of the great Sanhedrim. The Jews say that he was endued 
 with a <I>prophetical</I> spirit, and that he was turned out of his 
 place because he witnessed against the common opinion of the Jews 
 concerning the temporal kingdom of the Messiah; and they likewise 
 observe that there is no mention of him in their Mishna, or book of 
 traditions, which intimates that he was no patron of those fooleries. 
 One thing objected against this conjecture is that at this time his 
 father Hillel was living, and that he himself lived many years after 
 this, as appears by the Jewish histories; but, as to that, he is not 
 here said to be old; and his saying,<I> Now let thy servant depart</I> 
 intimates that he was willing to die <I>now,</I> but does not conclude 
 that therefore he did die quickly. St. Paul lived many years after he 
 had spoken of his death as <I>near,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:25">Acts xx. 25</A>.

 Another thing objected is that the son of Simeon was Gamaliel, a
 Pharisee, and an enemy to Christianity; but, as to that, it is no new 
 thing for a faithful lover of Christ to have a son a bigoted 
 Pharisee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The account given of him here is, 

 (1.) That he was <I>just</I> and <I>devout, just</I> towards men and 
 <I>devout</I> towards God; these two must always go together, and each 
 will befriend the other, but neither will atone for the defect of the 
 other.

 (2.) That he <I>waited for the consolation of Israel,</I> that is, for 
 the coming of the Messiah, in whom alone the nation of Israel, that was 
 now miserably harassed and oppressed, would find <I>consolation.</I> 
 Christ is not only the author of his people's comfort, but the matter 
 and ground of it, the <I>consolation of Israel.</I> He was long a 
 coming, and they who believed he would come continued <I>waiting, 
 desiring</I> his coming, and <I>hoping</I> for it with <I>patience;</I> 
 I had almost said, with some degree of <I>impatience</I> waiting till 
 it came. He <I>understood by books,</I> as Daniel, that the time was at 
 hand, and therefore was now more than ever big with expectation of it. 
 The unbelieving Jews, who still expect that which is already come, use 
 it as an oath, or solemn protestation, <I>As ever I hope to see the 
 consolation of Israel,</I> so and so it is. Note, The consolation of 
 Israel is to be waited for, and it is worth waiting for, and it will be 
 very welcome to those who have <I>waited</I> for it, and continue 
 waiting. 

 (3.) The <I>Holy Ghost</I> was upon him, not only as a Spirit of 
 holiness, but as a Spirit of prophecy; he was <I>filled with the Holy 
 Ghost,</I> and enabled to speak things above himself. 

 (4.) He had a gracious promise made him, that before he died he should 
 have a sight of the Messiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 He was searching <I>what manner of time</I> the Spirit of Christ in the 
 Old-Testament prophets did signify, and whether it were not now at 
 hand; and he received <I>this oracle</I> (for so the word signifies), 
 <I>that he should not see death before he had seen</I> the Messiah, 
 <I>the Lord's Anointed.</I> Note, Those, and those only, can with 
 courage <I>see death,</I> and look it in the face without terror, that 
 have had by faith a sight of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The seasonable coming of Simeon into the temple, at the time when 
 Christ was presented there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Just then, when Joseph and Mary brought in the child, to be registered 
 as it were in the church-book, among the first-born, Simeon came, by 
 direction of <I>the Spirit,</I> into the temple. The same Spirit that 
 had provided for the support of his hope now provided for the transport 
 of his joy. It was whispered in his ear, "Go to the temple now, and you 
 shall see what you have longed to see." Note, Those that would see 
 Christ must go to his temple; for there <I>The Lord, whom ye seek,</I> 
 shall suddenly come to <I>meet you,</I> and there you must be ready to 
 <I>meet him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The abundant satisfaction wherewith he welcomed this sight: <I>He 
 took him up in his arms</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 he <I>embraced</I> him with the greatest affection imaginable, laid him 
 in his bosom, as near his heart as he could, which was as full of joy 
 as it could hold. He <I>took him up in his arms,</I> to present him to 
 the Lord (so some think), to do either the parent's part or the 
 priest's part; for divers of the ancients say that he was himself a 
 priest. When we receive the record which the gospel gives us of Christ 
 with a lively faith, and the offer it makes us of Christ with love and 
 resignation, then we <I>take Christ in our arms.</I> It was promised 
 him that he should have a sight of Christ; but more is <I>performed</I> 
 than was <I>promised:</I> he has him in his arms.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The solemn declaration he made hereupon: <I>He blessed God,</I> and
 said, <I>Lord, now let thou thy servant depart in peace,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:29-32"><I>v.</I> 29-32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He has a pleasant prospect <I>concerning himself,</I> and (which
 is a great attainment) is got quite above the love of life and fear of 
 death; nay, he is arrived at a holy contempt of life, and desire of 
 death: "<I>Lord, now let thou thy servant depart,</I> for mine eyes 
 have seen the salvation I was promised a sight of before I died." Here 
 is, 

 [1.] An acknowledgment that God had been <I>as good as his word;</I> 
 there has not failed one tittle of his good promises, as Solomon owns, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:56">1 Kings viii. 56</A>.

 Note, Never any that hoped in God's word were made ashamed of their 
 hope.

 [2.] A thanksgiving for it. He <I>blessed God</I> that he saw that
 salvation in his arms which many prophets and kings desired to see, and 
 might not. 

 [3.] A confession of his faith, that the child in his arms was the 
 <I>saviour,</I> the <I>Salvation</I> itself; <I>thy salvation,</I> the 
 salvation of thine appointing, the salvation <I>which thou has 
 prepared</I> with a great deal of contrivance. And, while it has been 
 thus long <I>in the coming,</I> it hath still been <I>in the 
 preparing.</I> 

 [4.] It is a farewell to this world: "<I>Now let thy servant 
 depart;</I> now mine eyes have been blessed with this sight, let them 
 be closed, and see no more in this world." The eye is not satisfied 
 with seeing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:8">Eccl. i. 8</A>),

 till it hath <I>seen Christ,</I> and then it is. What a poor thing doth 
 this world look to one that hath Christ in his arms and salvation in 
 his eye! Now adieu to all my friends and relations, all my enjoyments 
 and employments here, even the temple itself.

 [5.] It is a welcome to death: <I>Now let thy servant depart.</I> Note, 
 Death is a departure, the soul's departure out of the body, from the 
 world of sense to the world of spirits. We must not depart till God 
 give us our discharge, for we are his <I>servants</I> and must not quit 
 his service till we have accomplished our time. Moses was promised that 
 he should see Canaan, and then <I>die;</I> but he prayed that this word 
 might be altered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:24,25">Deut. iii. 24, 25</A>.

 Simeon is promised that he should not <I>see death</I> till he had
 <I>seen Christ;</I> and he is willing to construe that beyond what was 
 expressed, as an intimation that, when he had seen Christ, he should 
 die: <I>Lord, be it so,</I> saith he, <I>now let me depart.</I> See 
 here, <I>First,</I> How <I>comfortable</I> the death of a good man is; 
 he departs <I>as God's servant</I> from the place of his toil to that 
 of his rest. He departs <I>in peace,</I> peace with God, peace with his 
 own conscience; in <I>peace</I> with death, well-reconciled to it, 
 well-acquainted with it. He departs <I>according to God's word,</I> as 
 Moses at the <I>word of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+34:5">Deut. xxxiv. 5</A>):

 the word of precept, <I>Go up and die;</I> the word of promise, <I>I 
 will come again and receive you to myself. Secondly,</I> What is the 
 ground of this comfort? <I>For mine eyes have seen thy salvation.</I> 
 This bespeaks more than a great complacency in the sight, like that of 
 Jacob 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:30">Gen. xlvi. 30</A>),

 <I>Now let me die, since I have seen thy face.</I> It bespeaks a 
 believing expectation of a happy state on the other side death, through 
 this salvation he now had a sight of, which not only takes off the 
 terror of death, but makes it <I>gain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:21">Phil. i. 21</A>.

 Note, Those that have welcomed Christ may welcome death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He has a pleasant prospect concerning the world, and concerning 
 the church. This salvation shall be,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] A blessing to the world. It is <I>prepared before the face of all 
 people,</I> not to be hid in a corner, but to be made known; to be a 
 <I>light to lighten the Gentiles</I> that now sit in darkness: they 
 shall have the knowledge of him, and of God, and another world through 
 him. This has reference to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:6">Isa. xlix. 6</A>,

 <I>I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles;</I> for Christ came to
 be the light of the world, not a candle in the Jewish candlestick, but 
 the <I>Sun of righteousness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] A blessing to the church: <I>the glory of thy people Israel.</I> 
 It was an honour to the Jewish nation that the Messiah sprang out of 
 one of their tribes, and was born, and lived, and died, among them. And 
 of those who were Israelites indeed of the spiritual Israel, he was 
 indeed <I>the glory,</I> and will be so to eternity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:19">Isa. lx. 19</A>.

 They shall <I>glory</I> in him. <I>In the Lord shall all the seed of
 Israel be justified and shall glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:25">Isa. xlv. 25</A>.

 When Christ ordered his apostles to preach the gospel to all nations,
 therein he made himself a <I>light to lighten the Gentiles;</I> and 
 when he added, <I>beginning at Jerusalem,</I> he made himself <I>the 
 glory of his</I> people Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The prediction concerning this child, which he delivered, with his 
 blessing, to Joseph and Mary. They <I>marvelled at those things</I> 
 which were still more and more fully and plainly spoken concerning this 
 child, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 And because they were affected with, and had their faith strengthened 
 by, that which was said to them, here is more said to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Simeon shows them what reason they had to <I>rejoice;</I> for he 
 <I>blessed them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 he pronounced them blessed who had the honour to be related to this 
 child, and were entrusted with the bringing him up. He <I>prayed</I> 
 for them, that God would <I>bless</I> them, and would have others do so 
 too. They had reason to rejoice, for this child should be, not only a 
 comfort and honour to them, but a public blessing. He is set <I>for the 
 rising again of many in Israel,</I> that is, for the conversion of many 
 to God that are dead and buried in sin, and for the consolation of many 
 in God that are sunk and lost in sorrow and despair. Those whom he is 
 set <I>for the fall of</I> may be the same with those whom he is set 
 for the <I>rising again of.</I> He is set <B><I>eis ptosin kai 
 anastasin</I></B>--<I>for their fall, in order to their rising 
 again;</I> to humble and abase them, and bring them off from all 
 confidence in themselves, that they may be exalted by relying on 
 Christ; he wounds and then heals, Paul <I>falls,</I> and rises 
 again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He shows them likewise what reason they had to <I>rejoice with 
 trembling,</I> according to the advice given of old, with reference to 
 the Messiah's kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:11">Ps. ii. 11</A>.

 Lest Joseph, and Mary especially, should be <I>lifted up</I> with the
 abundance of the revelations, here is a <I>thorn in the flesh</I> for 
 them, an allay to their joy; and it is what we sometimes need.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] It is true, Christ shall be a blessing to Israel; but there are 
 those in Israel whom he is <I>set for the fall of,</I> whose 
 corruptions will be provoked, who will be prejudiced and enraged 
 against him, and offended, and whose sin and ruin will be aggravated by 
 the revelation of Jesus Christ; many who will extract poison to 
 themselves out of the balm of Gilead, and split their souls on the Rock 
 of salvation, to whom this precious Foundation-stone will be a <I>stone 
 of stumbling.</I> This refers to that prophecy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:14,15">Isa. viii. 14, 15</A>),

 He shall be <I>for a sanctuary</I> to some, and yet for a <I>snare</I> 
 to others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:7,8">1 Pet. ii. 7, 8</A>.

 Note, As it is pleasant to think how many there are to whom Christ and
 his gospel are a savour of life unto life, so it is sad to think how 
 many there are to whom it is a savour of death unto death. He is set 
 for <I>a sign,</I> to be admired by some, but by others, by many, 
 spoken against. He had many <I>eyes upon him,</I> during the time of 
 his public ministry, he was a <I>sign,</I> but he had many <I>tongues 
 against</I> him, the contradiction and reproach of sinners, he was 
 continually cavilled at and abused; and the effects of this will be 
 that the <I>thoughts of many hearts will be revealed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 that is, upon this occasion, men will <I>show themselves,</I> will 
 discover, and so distinguish, themselves. The secret good affections 
 and dispositions in the minds of some will be revealed by their 
 embracing Christ, and closing with him; the secret corruptions and 
 vicious dispositions of others, that otherwise would never have 
 appeared so bad, will be revealed by their enmity to Christ and their 
 rage against him. Men will be judged of by the thoughts of their 
 hearts, their thoughts concerning Christ; are they for <I>him,</I> or 
 are they for his <I>adversaries?</I> The <I>word of God</I> is a 
 discerner of the <I>thoughts</I> and <I>intents of the heart,</I> and 
 by it we are discovered to ourselves, and shall be judged 
 hereafter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It is true, Christ shall be a comfort to his mother; but be not 
 thou too proud of it, for <I>a sword shall pass through thine own soul 
 also.</I> He shall be a suffering Jesus; and, <I>First,</I> "Thou 
 <I>shalt suffer with him,</I> by sympathy, more than any other of his 
 friends, because of the nearness of thy relation, and strength of 
 affection, to him." When he was abused, it was <I>a sword in her 
 bones.</I> When she stood by his cross, and saw him dying, we may well 
 think her inward grief was such that it might truly be said, <I>A sword 
 pierced through her soul,</I> it cut her to the heart. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 Thou shalt <I>suffer for him.</I> Many understand it as a prediction of 
 her martyrdom; and some of the ancients say that it had its 
 accomplishment in that. Note, In the midst of our greatest delights and 
 advancements in this world, it is good for us to know that bonds and 
 afflictions abide us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is taken notice of by one <I>Anna,</I> or <I>Ann, a 
 prophetess,</I> that one of each sex might bear witness to him in whom 
 both <I>men</I> and <I>women</I> are invited to believe, that they may 
 be saved. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The account here given of this Anna, who she was. She was, 

 (1.) <I>A prophetess;</I> the Spirit of prophecy now began to revive, 
 which had ceased in Israel above three hundred years. Perhaps no more 
 is meant than that she was one who had understanding in the scriptures 
 above other women, and made it her business to instruct the <I>younger 
 women</I> in the things of God. Though it was a very degenerate age of 
 the church, yet God <I>left not himself without witness.</I> 

 (2.) She was <I>the daughter of Phanuel;</I> her father's name (says
 Grotius) is mentioned, to put us in mind of Jacob's <I>Phanuel,</I> or 
 <I>Penuel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:30">Gen. xxxii. 30</A>),

 that now the mystery of that should be unfolded, when in Christ we 
 should as it were see God face to face, and our lives be preserved; and 
 her name signifies <I>gracious.</I> 

 (3.) She was of <I>the tribe of Asher,</I> which was in Galilee; this, 
 some think, is taken notice of to refute those who said, <I>Out of 
 Galilee ariseth no prophet,</I> when no sooner did prophecy revive but 
 it appeared from Galilee. 

 (4.) She was of <I>a great age,</I> a widow of about eighty-four years; 
 some think she had now been eighty-four years a widow, and then she 
 must be considerably above a hundred years old; others, rather than 
 suppose that a woman so very old should be capable of fasting and 
 praying as she did, suppose that she was only eighty-four years of age, 
 and had been long a widow. Though she was a young widow, and had lived 
 with her husband but seven years, yet she never married again, but 
 continued a widow to her dying day, which is mentioned to her praise. 
 
 (5.) She was a constant resident <I>in</I> or at least attendant 
 <I>on</I> the temple. Some think she had lodgings in the courts of the 
 temple, either in an alms-house, being maintained by the temple 
 charities; or, as a prophetess, she was lodged there, as in a proper 
 place to be consulted and advised with by those that desired to know 
 the mind of God; others think her not <I>departing from the temple</I> 
 means no more, than that she was constantly there at the time of divine 
 service: when any good work was to be done, she was ready to join in 
 it. It is most probable she had an apartment of her own among the 
 out-buildings of the temple; and, besides her constant attendance on 
 the public worship, abounded in private devotions, for she <I>served 
 God with fastings and prayers night and day:</I> having no secular 
 business to employ herself in, or being past it, she gave up herself 
 wholly to her devotions, and not only <I>fasted twice in the week,</I> 
 but always lived a mortified life, and spent that time in religious 
 exercises which others spent in eating and drinking and sleeping; she 
 not only observed the <I>hours of prayer,</I> but prayed <I>night and 
 day;</I> was always in a praying frame, lived a life of prayer, gave 
 herself to prayer, was frequent in ejaculations, large in solemn 
 prayers, and very particular in her intercessions. And in these she 
 <I>served</I> God; that was it that put a value upon them and an 
 excellency in to them. The Pharisees <I>fasted often,</I> and made 
 <I>long prayers,</I> but they served themselves, and their own pride 
 and covetousness, in their fastings and prayers; but this good woman 
 not only did that which was good, but did it from a good principle, and 
 with a good end; she <I>served God,</I> and aimed at his honour, in 
 <I>fasting and praying.</I> Note,

 [1.] Devotion is a thing we ought to be constant in; other duties are 
 in season now and then, but we must <I>pray always.</I> 

 [2.] It is a pleasant sight to see aged Christians abounding in acts of 
 devotion, as those that are not <I>weary of well-doing,</I> that do not 
 think themselves <I>above</I> these exercises, or <I>past</I> them, but 
 that take more and more pleasure in them, and see more and more need of 
 them, till they come to heaven.

 [3.] Those that are diligent and faithful in improving the light and 
 means they have shall have further discoveries made them. Anna is now 
 at length abundantly recompensed for her attendance so many years in 
 the temple.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The testimony she bore to our Lord Jesus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>She came in at that instant</I> when the child was presented, and 
 Simeon discoursed concerning him; she, who was so <I>constant</I> to 
 the temple, could not miss the opportunity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 (1.) She <I>gave thanks likewise to the Lord,</I> just as Simeon, 
 perhaps like him, wishing now to depart in peace. Note, Those to whom 
 Christ is <I>made known</I> have reason enough to <I>give thanks to the 
 Lord</I> for so great a favour; and we should be excited to that duty 
 by the praises and thanksgivings of others; why should not we <I>give 
 thanks likewise,</I> as well as they? Anna concurred with Simeon, and 
 helped to make up the harmony. <I>She confessed unto the Lord</I> (so 
 it may be read); she made an open profession of her faith concerning 
 this child.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) She, as a prophetess, instructed others concerning him: She 
 <I>spoke of him to all them</I> that believed the Messiah would come, 
 and with him <I>looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</I> Redemption was 
 the thing wanted, waited for, and wished for; redemption <I>in 
 Jerusalem,</I> for thence the <I>word of the Lord was to go forth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3">Isa. ii. 3</A>.

 Some there were in Jerusalem that <I>looked for redemption;</I> yet but
 a few, for Anna, it should seem, had acquaintance with all them that 
 were joint-expectants with her of the Messiah; she knew where to find 
 them, or they where to find her, and she told them all the good news, 
 that she had seen the Lord; and it was great news, this of his birth 
 now, as afterwards that of his resurrection. Note, Those that have an 
 acquaintance with Christ <I>themselves</I> should do all they can to 
 bring <I>others</I> acquainted with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is a short account of the infancy and childhood of 
 our Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Where</I> he spent it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 When the ceremony of presenting the child, and purifying the mother, 
 was all over, they <I>returned into Galilee.</I> Luke relates no more 
 concerning them, till they were returned into Galilee; but it appears 
 by St. Matthew's gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:1-23"><I>ch.</I> ii.</A>)

 that from Jerusalem they returned to Bethlehem, where the wise men of
 the east found them, and there they continued till they were directed 
 to flee into Egypt, to escape the malice and rage of Herod; and, 
 returning thence when Herod was dead, they were directed to go to their 
 old quarters in Nazareth, whence they had been perhaps some years 
 absent. It is here called <I>their own city,</I> because there they had 
 lived a great while, and their relations were there. He was ordered 
 further from Jerusalem, because his kingdom and priesthood were to have 
 no affinity with the present government of the Jewish church or state. 
 He is sent into a place of obscurity and reproach; for in this, as in 
 other things, he must humble himself and <I>make himself of no 
 reputation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>How</I> he spent it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 In all things <I>it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren,</I> 
 and therefore he passed through infancy and childhood as other children 
 did, yet without sin; nay, with manifest indications of a divine nature 
 in him. As other children, he <I>grew</I> in stature of body, and the 
 improvement of understanding in his human soul, that his <I>natural</I> 
 body might be a figure of his <I>mystical</I> body, which, though 
 animated by a perfect spirit, yet <I>maketh increase of itself</I> till 
 it comes to the <I>perfect man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:13,16">Eph. iv. 13, 16</A>.
 
 But,

 (1.) Whereas other children are weak in understanding and resolution,
 he was <I>strong in spirit.</I> By the Spirit of God his human soul was 
 endued with extraordinary vigour, and all his faculties performed their 
 offices in an extraordinary manner. He reasoned strongly, and his
 judgment was penetrating. 

 (2.) Whereas other children have <I>foolishness bound in their 
 hearts,</I> which appears in what they say or do, he was <I>filled with 
 wisdom,</I> not by any advantages of instruction and education, but by 
 the operation of the Holy Ghost; every thing he said and did was wisely 
 said, and wisely done, above his years. 

 (3.) Whereas other children show that the corruption of nature is in 
 them, and <I>the tares of sin</I> grow up with the <I>wheat of 
 reason,</I> he made it appear that nothing but <I>the grace of God was 
 upon him</I> (the wheat sprang up without tares), and that, whereas 
 other children are by nature children of wrath, he was <I>greatly 
 beloved,</I> and high in the favour of God; that God loved him, and 
 cherished him, and took a particular care of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>41  Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of
 the passover.
 &nbsp; 42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem
 after the custom of the feast.
 &nbsp; 43 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the
 child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his
 mother knew not <I>of it.</I>
 &nbsp; 44 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a
 day's journey; and they sought him among <I>their</I> kinsfolk and
 acquaintance.
 &nbsp; 45 And when they found him not, they turned back again to
 Jerusalem, seeking him.
 &nbsp; 46 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in
 the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing
 them, and asking them questions.
 &nbsp; 47 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding
 and answers.
 &nbsp; 48 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said
 unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy
 father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
 &nbsp; 49 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye
 not that I must be about my Father's business?
 &nbsp; 50 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.
 &nbsp; 51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was
 subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her
 heart.
 &nbsp; 52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour
 with God and man.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the only passage of story recorded concerning our blessed 
 Saviour, from his infancy to the day of his showing to Israel at 
 twenty-nine years old, and therefore we are concerned to make much of 
 this, for it is in vain to wish we had more. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's <I>going up with his parents</I> to Jerusalem, at the feast 
 of the passover, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:41,42"><I>v.</I> 41, 42</A>.

 1. It was their constant practice to attend there, according to the 
 law, though it was a long journey, and they were poor, and perhaps not 
 well able, without straitening themselves, to bear the expenses of it. 
 Note, Public ordinances must be frequented, and we must <I>not forsake 
 the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is.</I> 
 Worldly business must give way to spiritual concerns. Joseph and Mary
 had a son in the house with them, that was able to teach them better 
 than all the rabbin at Jerusalem; yet they <I>went up</I> thither, 
 <I>after the custom of the feast. The Lord loves the gates of Zion more 
 than all the dwellings of Jacob,</I> and so should we. We have reason 
 to suppose that Joseph went up likewise at the feasts of 
 <I>pentecost</I> and <I>tabernacles;</I> for all the males were to 
 appear there <I>thrice a year,</I> but Mary only at the 
 <I>passover,</I> which was the greatest of the three feasts, and had 
 most gospel in it. 

 2. The child Jesus, at <I>twelve years old,</I> went up with them. The
 Jewish doctors say that at twelve years old children must begin to fast 
 from time to time, that they may learn to fast on the day of atonement; 
 and that at thirteen years old a child begins to be <I>a son of the 
 commandment,</I> that is, obliged to the duties of adult 
 church-membership, having been from his infancy, by virtue of his 
 circumcision, <I>a son of the covenant.</I> It is not said that this 
 was the <I>first time</I> that Jesus went up to Jerusalem to worship at 
 the feast: probably he had done it for some years before, having spirit 
 and wisdom above his years; and all should attend on public worship 
 that can <I>hear with understanding,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:2">Neh. viii. 2</A>.

 Those children that are forward in other things should be put forward
 in religion. It is for the honour of Christ that children should attend 
 on public worship, and he is pleased with their hosannas; and those 
 children that were in their infancy dedicated to God should be called 
 upon, when they are grown up, to come to the <I>gospel passover,</I> to 
 the Lord's supper, that they make it their own act and deed to join 
 themselves to the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's <I>tarrying behind his parents at Jerusalem,</I> unknown 
 to them, in which he designed to give an early specimen of what he was 
 reserved for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His parents did not return till they had <I>fulfilled the days;</I> 
 they had staid there all the seven days at the feast, though it was not 
 absolutely necessary that they should stay longer than the two first 
 days, after which many went home. Note, It is good to stay to the 
 conclusion of an ordinance, as becomes those who say, <I>It is good to 
 be here,</I> and not to hasten away, as if we were like Doeg, 
 <I>detained before the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The child <I>tarried behind in Jerusalem,</I> not because he was 
 loth to go home, or shy of his parents' company, but because he had 
 business to do there, and would let his parents know that he had a 
 <I>Father in heaven,</I> whom he was to be <I>observant</I> of more 
 than of <I>them;</I> and respect to <I>him</I> must not be construed 
 disrespect <I>to them.</I> Some conjecture that he tarried behind in 
 the temple, for it was the custom of the pious Jews, on the morning 
 that they were to go home, to go first to the temple, to worship God; 
 there he <I>staid behind,</I> and found entertainment there till they 
 found him again. Or, perhaps, he staid at the house where they lodged, 
 or some other friend's house (and such a child as he was could not but 
 be the darling of all that knew him, and every one would court his 
 company), and went up to the temple only at church-time; but so it was 
 that he staid behind. It is good to see young people willing to 
 <I>dwell in the house of the Lord;</I> they are then like Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His parents went the <I>first day's journey</I> without any 
 suspicion that he was left behind, for they <I>supposed him to have 
 been in the company,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 On these occasions, the crowd was very great, especially the first 
 day's journey, and the roads full of people; and they concluded that he 
 came along with some of their neighbours, and they <I>sought him among 
 their kindred and acquaintance,</I> that were upon the road, going 
 down. Pray did <I>you</I> see our Son? or, Did <I>you</I> see him?
 Like the spouses's inquiry, <I>Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?</I> This 
 was a jewel worth seeking after. They knew that every one would be 
 desirous of his company, and that he would be willing to do good among 
 <I>his kinsfolk and acquaintance,</I> but among them they <I>found him 
 not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 There are many, too many, who are our kinsfolk and acquaintance, that 
 we cannot avoid conversing with, among whom we find little or nothing 
 of Christ. When they could not hear of him in this and the other 
 company upon the road, yet they hoped they should meet with him at the 
 place where they lodged that night; but <I>there</I> they could learn 
 no tidings of him. Compare this with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8,9">Job xxiii. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. When they found him not at their quarters at night, they <I>turned 
 back again,</I> next morning, <I>to Jerusalem, seeking him.</I> Note, 
 Those that would find Christ must <I>seek till they find;</I> for he 
 will at length be found of those that seek him, and will be found their 
 bountiful rewarder. Those that have lost their comforts in Christ, and 
 the evidences of their interest in him, must bethink themselves where, 
 and when, and how, they lost them, and must <I>turn back again</I> to 
 the place where they last had them; must <I>remember whence they are 
 fallen, and repent, and do their first works,</I> and <I>return to 
 their first love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:4,5">Rev. ii. 4, 5</A>.

 Those that would recover their lost acquaintance with Christ must go to 
 Jerusalem, the <I>city of our solemnities,</I> the place which he has 
 <I>chosen to put his name there;</I> must attend upon him in his 
 ordinances, in the gospel-passover, there they may hope to meet 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The <I>third day</I> they found him <I>in the temple,</I> in some of 
 the apartments belonging to the temple, where the doctors of the law 
 kept, not their courts, but their conferences rather, or their schools 
 for disputation; and there they found him <I>sitting in the midst of 
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>),

 not standing as a <I>catechumen</I> to be examined or instructed by 
 them, for he had discovered such measures of knowledge and wisdom that 
 they admitted him to sit among them as a fellow or member of their 
 society. This is an instance, not only that he was <I>filled with 
 wisdom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 but that he had both a desire to increase it and a readiness to 
 communicate it; and herein he is an example to children and young 
 people, who should learn of Christ to delight in the company of those 
 they may get good by, and choose to <I>sit in the midst of</I> the 
 doctors rather than in the midst of the players. Let them begin at 
 <I>twelve years old,</I> and sooner, to enquire after knowledge, and to 
 associate with those that are able to instruct them; it is a hopeful 
 and promising presage in youth to be desirous of instruction. Many a 
 youth at Christ's age now would have been playing with the <I>children 
 in the temple,</I> but he was sitting with the <I>doctors in the 
 temple.</I> 

 (1.) He <I>heard</I> them. Those that would <I>learn</I> must be 
 <I>swift to hear.</I> 

 (2.) He <I>asked them questions;</I> whether, as a teacher (he had
 authority so to ask) or as a learner (he had humility so to ask) I know
 not, or whether as an associate, or joint-searcher after truth, which 
 must be found out by mutual amicable disquisitions.

 (3.) He returned <I>answers</I> to them, which were very surprising and 
 satisfactory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 And his wisdom and <I>understanding</I> appeared as much in the 
 questions he asked as in the answers he gave, so that all who heard him 
 <I>were astonished:</I> they never heard one so young, no indeed any of 
 their greatest doctors, talk sense at the rate that he did; like David, 
 he had <I>more understanding than all his teachers,</I> yea, <I>than 
 the ancients,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:99,100">Ps. cxix. 99, 100</A>.

 Now Christ showed forth some rays of his glory, which were presently
 drawn in again. He <I>gave them a taste</I> (says Calvin) of his divine 
 wisdom and knowledge. Methinks this public appearance of Christ in the 
 temple, as a teacher, was like Moses's early attempt to deliver Israel, 
 which Stephen put this construction upon, that <I>he supposed his 
 brethren would have understood,</I> by that, <I>how God by his hand 
 would deliver them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:24,25">Acts vii. 24, 25</A>.

 They might have taken the hint, and been delivered then, but <I>they
 understood not;</I> so they here might have had Christ (for aught I 
 know) to enter upon his work now, but they were only <I>astonished,</I> 
 and <I>understood not</I> the indication; and therefore, like Moses, he 
 retires into obscurity again, and they hear no more of him for many 
 years after.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. His mother talked with him privately about it. When the company 
 broke up, she took him aside, and examined him about it with a deal of 
 tenderness and affection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.

 Joseph and Mary were both <I>amazed</I> to find him there, and to find 
 that he had so much respect showed him as to be admitted to <I>sit 
 among the doctors,</I> and to be taken notice of. His father knew he 
 had only the name of a father, and therefore said nothing. But,

 (1.) His mother told him how ill they took it: "<I>Son, why hast thou 
 thus dealt with us?</I> Why didst thou put us into such a fright?" They 
 were ready to say, as Jacob of Joseph, "<I>A wild beast has devoured 
 him;</I> or, He is fallen into the hands of some more cruel enemy, who 
 has at length found out that he was the young child whose life Herod 
 had sought some years ago." A thousand imaginations, we may suppose, 
 they had concerning him, each more frightful than another. "Now, why 
 hast thou given us occasion for these fears? <I>Thy father and I have 
 sought thee, sorrowing;</I> not only troubled that we lost thee, but 
 vexed at ourselves that we did not take more care of thee, to bring 
 thee along with us." Note, Those may have leave to complain of their 
 losses that think they have lost Christ. But their <I>weeping</I> did 
 not hinder <I>sowing;</I> they did not sorrow and sit down in despair, 
 but sorrowed and <I>sought.</I> Note, If we would find Christ, we must 
 seek him <I>sorrowing,</I> sorrowing that we have lost him, that we 
 have provoked him to withdraw, and that we have sought him no sooner. 
 They that thus seek him in sorrow shall find him, at length, with so 
 much the greater joy. 

 (2.) He gently reproved their inordinate solicitude about him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):
 
 "<I>How is it that you sought me?</I> You might have depended upon it, 
 I would have followed you home when I had done the business I had to do 
 here. I could not be lost in Jerusalem. Wist ye not that I <I>ought to
 be,</I> <B><I>en tois tou patros mou</I></B>;--<I>in my Father's 
 house?"</I> so some read it; "where else should the Son be, who 
 <I>abideth in the house for ever?</I> I ought to be,"

 [1.] "<I>Under my Father's care</I> and protection; and therefore you 
 should have cast the care of me upon him, and not have burdened 
 yourselves with it." Christ is a shaft hid in his Father's quiver, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:2">Isa. xlix. 2</A>.

 He takes care of his church likewise, and therefore let us never 
 despair of its safety.

 [2.] "<I>At my Father's work</I>" (so we take it): "I must be <I>about
 my Father's business,</I> and therefore could not go home as soon as 
 you might. <I>Wist ye not?</I> Have you not already perceived that
 concerning me, that I have devoted myself to the service of religion, 
 and therefore must employ myself in the affairs of it?" Herein he hath 
 left us an example; for it becomes the children of God, in conformity 
 to Christ, to attend their heavenly Father's business, and to make all 
 other business give way to it. This word of Christ we now think we 
 understand very well, for he hath explained it in what he hath done and 
 said. It was his errand into the world, and his meat and drink in the 
 world, to do his Father's will, and finish his work: and yet at that 
 time his parents <I>understood not this saying,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>.

 They did not understand what business he had to do then in the temple 
 for his Father. They believed him to be the Messiah, that should have 
 the throne of his father David; but they thought that should rather 
 bring him to the royal palace than to the temple. They <I>understood 
 not</I> his prophetical office; and he was to do much of his work in 
 that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is their return to Nazareth. This glimpse of his 
 glory was to be short. It was now over, and he did not urge his parents 
 either to come and settle at Jerusalem or to settle him there (though 
 that was the place of improvement and preferment, and where he might 
 have the best opportunities of showing his wisdom), but very willingly 
 retired into his obscurity at Nazareth, where for many years he was, as 
 it were, buried alive. Doubtless, he came up to Jerusalem, to worship 
 at the feast, three times a year, but whether he ever went again into 
 the temple, to dispute with the doctors there, we are not told; it is 
 not improbable but he might. But here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he was <I>subject to his parents.</I> Though once, to show that 
 he was <I>more than a man,</I> he withdrew himself from his parents, to 
 attend his heavenly Father's business, yet he did not, as yet, make 
 that his constant practice, nor for many years after, but was 
 <I>subject to them,</I> observed their order, and went and came as they 
 directed, and, as it should seem, worked with his father at the trade 
 of a carpenter. Herein he hath given an example to children to be 
 dutiful and obedient to their parents in the Lord. Being <I>made of a 
 woman,</I> he was made under the law of the fifth commandment, to teach 
 the <I>seed</I> of the faithful thus to approve themselves to him a 
 faithful seed. Though his parents were poor and mean, though his father 
 was only his <I>supposed</I> father, yet he was <I>subject to them;</I> 
 though he was <I>strong in spirit,</I> and <I>filled with wisdom</I> 
 nay though he was the Son of God, yet he was subject to his parents; 
 how then will <I>they</I> answer it who, though foolish and weak, yet 
 are disobedient to their parents?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That his mother, though she did not perfectly understand her son's 
 sayings, yet <I>kept them in her heart,</I> expecting that hereafter 
 they would be explained to her, and she should fully understand them, 
 and know how to make use of them. However we may neglect men's sayings 
 because they are obscure (<I>Si non vis intelligi debes negligi--If it 
 be not intelligible, it is not valuable</I>), yet we must not think so 
 of God's sayings. That which at first is dark, so that we know not what 
 to make of it, may afterwards become plain and easy; we should 
 therefore <I>lay it up</I> for hereafter. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:22">John ii. 22</A>.

 We may find use for that another time which now we see not how to make
 useful to us. A <I>scholar</I> keeps those grammar rules in memory 
 which at present he understands not the use of, because he is told that 
 they will hereafter be of use to him; so we must do by Christ's 
 sayings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he improved, and came on, to admiration 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>):

 <I>He increased in wisdom and stature.</I> In the perfections of his 
 divine nature there could be no increase; but this is meant of his 
 human nature, his body increased in <I>stature</I> and bulk, he grew in 
 the growing age; and his soul increased <I>in wisdom,</I> and in all 
 the endowments of a human soul. Though the Eternal Word was united to 
 the human soul from his conception, yet the divinity that dwelt in him 
 manifested itself to his humanity by degrees, <I>ad modum 
 recipientis--in proportion to his capacity;</I> as the faculties of his 
 human soul grew more and more capable, the gifts it received from the 
 divine nature were more and more communicated. And he increased in 
 <I>favour with God and man,</I> that is, in all those graces that 
 rendered him acceptable to God and man. Herein Christ accommodated 
 himself to his estate of humiliation, that, as he condescended to be an 
 infant, a child, a youth, so the image of God shone brighter in him, 
 when he grew up to be a youth, than it did, or could, while he was an 
 <I>infant</I> and a <I>child.</I> Note, Young people, as they grow in 
 stature, should grow in wisdom, and then, as they grow in wisdom, they 
 will grow in favour <I>with God and man.</I></P>
