 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have divers excellent discourses of our Saviour's 
 upon various occasions, many of which are to the same purport with what 
 we had in Matthew upon other the like occasions; for we may suppose 
 that our Lord Jesus preached the same doctrines, and pressed the same 
 duties, at several times, in several companies, and that one of the 
 evangelists took them as he delivered them at one time and another at 
 another time; and we need thus to have precept upon precept, line upon 
 line. Here, 

 I. Christ warns his disciples to take heed of hypocrisy, and of
 cowardice in professing Christianity and preaching the gospel, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:1-12">ver. 1-12</A>.

 II. He gives a caution against covetousness, upon occasion of a
 covetous motion made to him, and illustrates that caution by a parable 
 of a rich man suddenly cut off by death in the midst of his worldly 
 projects and hopes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:13-21">ver. 13-21</A>.

 III. He encourages his disciples to cast all their care upon God, and 
 to live easy in a dependence upon his providence, and exhorts them to 
 make religion their main business, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:22-34">ver. 22-34</A>.

 IV. He stirs them up to watchfulness for their Master's coming, from 
 the consideration of the reward of those who are then found faithful, 
 and the punishment of those who are found unfaithful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:35-48">ver. 35-48</A>.

 V. He bids them expect trouble and persecution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:49-53">ver. 49-53</A>.

 VI. He warns the people to observe and improve the day of their
 opportunities and to make their peace with God in time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:54-59">ver. 54-59</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the mean time, when there were gathered together an
 innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one
 upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all,
 Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
 &nbsp; 2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed;
 neither hid, that shall not be known.
 &nbsp; 3 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be
 heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in
 closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
 &nbsp; 4 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that
 kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
 &nbsp; 5 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which
 after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say
 unto you, Fear him.
 &nbsp; 6 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of
 them is forgotten before God?
 &nbsp; 7 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear
 not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.
 &nbsp; 8 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men,
 him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:
 &nbsp; 9 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the
 angels of God.
 &nbsp; 10 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it
 shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the
 Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.
 &nbsp; 11 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and <I>unto</I>
 magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye
 shall answer, or what ye shall say:
 &nbsp; 12 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye
 ought to say.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We find here, 

 I. A vast auditory that was got together to hear Christ preach. The 
 <I>scribes</I> and <I>Pharisees</I> sought <I>to accuse him,</I> and do 
 him mischief; but the people, who were not under the bias of their 
 prejudices and jealousies, still <I>admired</I> him, attended on him, 
 and did him honour. <I>In the mean time</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 while he was in the Pharisee's house, contending with them that sought 
 to ensnare him, the people got together for an afternoon sermon, a 
 sermon after <I>dinner,</I> after dinner with a Pharisee; and he would 
 not disappoint them. Though in the morning sermon, when they were 
 <I>gathered thickly together</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:29"><I>ch.</I> xi. 29</A>),

 he had severely reproved them, as an <I>evil generation that seek a
 sign,</I> yet they renewed their attendance on him; so much better 
 could the people bear <I>their</I> reproofs than the Pharisees 
 <I>theirs.</I> The more the Pharisees strove to drive the people from 
 Christ, the more flocking there was to him. Here was an <I>innumerable 
 multitude of people gathered together, so that they trade one upon 
 another,</I> in labouring to get foremost, and to come within hearing. 
 It is a good sight to see people thus forward to hear the word, and 
 venture upon inconvenience and danger rather than miss an opportunity 
 for their souls. Who are these that thus <I>fly as the doves to their 
 windows?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:8">Isa. lx. 8</A>.

 When the net is cast where there is such a multitude of fish, it may be
 hoped that some will be enclosed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The instructions which he gave his followers, in the hearing of 
 this auditory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He began with a caution against <I>hypocrisy.</I> This he said <I>to 
 his disciples first of all;</I> either to the twelve, or to the 
 seventy. These were his more peculiar charge, his family, his school, 
 and therefore he particularly <I>warned them</I> as his <I>beloved 
 sons;</I> they made more profession of religion than others and 
 hypocrisy in <I>that</I> was the sin they were most in danger of. They 
 were to preach to others; and, if they should <I>prevaricate,</I> 
 corrupt the word, and deal deceitfully, hypocrisy would be worse in 
 them than in others. Besides, there was a Judas among them, who was a 
 hypocrite, and Christ knew it, and would hereby startle him, or leave 
 him inexcusable. Christ's disciples were, for aught we know, the 
 <I>best men</I> then in the world, yet they needed to be cautioned 
 against hypocrisy. Christ said this to the disciples, <I>in the 
 hearing</I> of this great multitude, rather than <I>privately</I> when 
 he had them by themselves, to add the greater weight to the caution, 
 and to let the world know that he would not countenance hypocrisy, no, 
 not in <I>his own disciples.</I> Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The description of that sin which he warns them against: <I>It is 
 the leaven of the Pharisees.</I> 

 [1.] It is <I>leaven;</I> it is <I>spreading</I> as leaven, 
 <I>insinuates</I> itself into the whole man, and all that he does; it 
 is <I>swelling</I> and <I>souring</I> as leaven, for it puffs men up 
 with pride, embitters them with malice, and makes their service 
 unacceptable to God. 

 [2.] It is the leaven of the Pharisees: "It is the sin they are most of 
 them found in. Take heed of imitating them; be not you of their spirit; 
 do not dissemble in Christianity as they do in Judaism; make not 
 <I>your</I> religion a <I>cloak of maliciousness,</I> as they do 
 theirs."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) A good reason against it: "<I>For there is nothing covered that 
 shall not be revealed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 It is to no purpose to dissemble, for, sooner or later, truth will come
 out; and a <I>lying tongue is but for a moment.</I> If you <I>speak in 
 darkness</I> that which is unbecoming you, and is inconsistent with 
 your public professions, <I>it shall be heard in the light;</I> some 
 way or other it shall be discovered, <I>a bird of the air shall carry 
 the voice</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:20">Eccl. x. 20</A>),

 and your folly and falsehood will be <I>made manifest.</I>" The 
 iniquity that is concealed with a show of piety will be discovered, 
 perhaps in this world, as Judas's was, and Simon Magus's, at furthest 
 in the great day, when the <I>secrets of all hearts</I> shall be made 
 <I>manifest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:14,Ro+2:16">Eccl. xii. 14; Rom. ii. 16</A>.

 If men's religion prevail not to conquer and cure the wickedness of
 their hearts, it shall not always serve for a cloak. The day is coming 
 when hypocrites will be stripped of their fig-leaves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To this he added a charge to them to be faithful to the trust 
 reposed in them, and not to betray it, through cowardice or base fear. 
 Some make 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>,

 to be a caution to them not to <I>conceal</I> those things which they
 had been <I>instructed</I> in, and were <I>employed</I> to publish to 
 the world. "Whether men will <I>hear,</I> or whether they will 
 <I>forbear,</I> tell them the <I>truth,</I> the <I>whole</I> truth, and 
 <I>nothing but</I> the truth; what has been spoken to you, and you have 
 talked of among yourselves, <I>privately,</I> and in corners, that do 
 you preach <I>publicly,</I> whoever is offended; for, if you <I>please 
 men,</I> you are not <I>Christ's servants,</I> nor can you please him," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:10">Gal. i. 10</A>.

 But this was not the worst of it: it was likely to be a
 <I>suffering</I> cause, though never a <I>sinking</I> one: let them 
 therefore arm themselves with courage; and divers arguments are 
 furnished here to steel them with a holy resolution in their work.
 Consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) "The power of your enemies is a limited power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>I say unto you, my friends</I>" (Christ's disciples are his friends,
 he calls them <I>friends,</I> and gives them this <I>friendly</I> 
 advice), "<I>be not afraid,</I> do not disquiet yourselves with 
 tormenting fears of the power and rage of men." Note, Those whom Christ 
 owns for <I>his friends</I> need not be afraid of any enemies. "<I>Be 
 not afraid,</I> no, not of them that <I>kill the body,</I> let it not 
 be in the power of <I>scoffers,</I> not even of <I>murderers,</I> to 
 drive you off from your work, for you that have learned to triumph over 
 death may say, even of them, Let them do their worst, <I>after that 
 there is no more that they can do;</I> the immortal soul lives, and is 
 happy, and enjoys itself and its God, and sets them all at defiance." 
 Note, Those can do Christ's disciples no real harm, and therefore ought 
 not to be dreaded, who can but <I>kill the body;</I> for they only send 
 that to its rest, and the soul to its joy, the sooner.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) God is to be feared more than the most powerful men: "<I>I will 
 forewarn you whom you shall fear</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 that you may fear man less, fear God more. Moses conquers his fear of 
 the <I>wrath of the king,</I> by having an eye to him <I>that is 
 invisible.</I> By <I>owning Christ</I> you may incur the wrath of men, 
 which can reach no further than to <I>put you to death</I> (and without 
 God's permission they cannot do that); but by <I>denying</I> Christ, 
 and disowning him, you will incur the wrath of God, which has power to 
 send <I>you to hell,</I> and there is no resisting it. Now of two evils 
 the less is to be chosen, and the greater is to be dreaded, and 
 therefore <I>I say unto you, Fear him.</I>" "It is true," said that 
 blessed martyr, Bishop Hooper, "life is sweet, and death bitter; but 
 eternal life is more sweet, and eternal death more bitter."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The lives of good Christians and good ministers are the particular 
 care of divine Providence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 To encourage us in times of difficulty and danger, we must have
 recourse to our first principles, and build upon them. Now a firm 
 belief of the doctrine of God's universal providence, and the extent of 
 it, will be satisfying to us when at any time we are in peril, and will 
 encourage us to trust God in the way of duty. 

 [1.] Providence takes cognizance of the <I>meanest creatures,</I> even 
 of <I>the sparrows.</I> "Though they are of such small account that 
 <I>five</I> of them are sold for <I>two farthings,</I> yet not one of 
 them is <I>forgotten of God,</I> but is provided for, and notice is 
 taken of its death. Now, <I>you are of more value than many 
 sparrows,</I> and therefore you may be sure you <I>are not 
 forgotten,</I> though imprisoned, though banished, though forgotten by 
 your friends; much more <I>precious in the sight of the Lord is the 
 death of saints</I> than the death of sparrows." 

 [2.] Providence takes cognizance of the <I>meanest interest</I> of the 
 disciples of Christ: "<I>Even the very hairs of your head are all 
 numbered</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 much more are your sighs and tears numbered, and the drops of your 
 blood, which you shed for Christ's name's sake. An account is kept of 
 all your losses, that they <I>may be,</I> and without doubt they shall 
 be, recompensed unspeakably to your advantage."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) "You will be owned or disowned by Christ, in the great day, 
 according as you now own or disown him," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 [1.] To engage us to <I>confess Christ before men,</I> whatever we may
 lose or suffer for our constancy to him, and how dear soever it may 
 cost us, we are assured that they who <I>confess Christ</I> now shall 
 be owned by him in the great day <I>before the angels of God,</I> to 
 their everlasting comfort and honour. Jesus Christ will <I>confess,</I> 
 not only that he suffered for them, and that they are to have the 
 benefit of <I>his</I> sufferings, but that they suffered <I>for 
 him,</I> and that his kingdom and interest on earth were advanced by 
 <I>their</I> sufferings; and what greater honour can be done them? 

 [2.] To deter us from <I>denying</I> Christ, and a cowardly 
 <I>deserting</I> of his truths and ways, we are here assured that those 
 who <I>deny Christ,</I> and treacherously depart from him, whatever 
 they may save by it, though it were life itself, and whatever they may 
 gain by it, though it were a kingdom, will be vast losers at last, for 
 they shall be <I>denied before the angels of God;</I> Christ will not 
 know them, will not own them, will not show them any favour, which will 
 turn to their everlasting terror and contempt. By the stress here laid 
 upon their being <I>confessed or denied before the angels of God,</I> 
 it should seem to be a considerable part of the happiness of glorified 
 saints that they will not only stand <I>right,</I> but stand 
 <I>high,</I> in the esteem of the <I>holy angels;</I> they will love 
 them, and honour them, and own them, if they be Christ's servants; they 
 are their fellow-servants, and they will take them for their 
 companions. On the contrary, a considerable part of the misery of 
 damned sinners will be that the holy angels will abandon them, and will 
 be the pleased witnesses, not only of their disgrace, as here, but of 
 their misery, for they shall be <I>tormented in the presence of the 
 holy angels</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:10">Rev. xiv. 10</A>),
 
 who will give them no relief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The errand they were shortly to be sent out upon was of the 
 highest and last importance to the children of men, to whom they were 
 sent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Let them be bold in preaching the gospel, for a sorer and heavier doom
 would attend those that rejected them (after the Spirit was poured upon 
 them, which was to be the <I>last</I> method of conviction) than those 
 that now rejected Christ himself, and opposed him: "<I>Greater works 
 than those shall he do,</I> and, consequently, greater will be the 
 punishment of those that blaspheme the gifts and operations of the Holy 
 Ghost in you. <I>Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of 
 man,</I> shall stumble at the meanness of his appearance, and speak 
 <I>slightly</I> and <I>spitefully</I> of him, it is capable of some 
 excuse: <I>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</I> 
 But unto him that <I>blasphemes the Holy Ghost,</I> that blasphemes the 
 Christian doctrine, and maliciously opposes it, after the pouring out 
 of the Spirit and his attestation of Christ's <I>being glorified</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:33,5:32">Acts ii. 33; v. 32</A>),

 the privilege of the <I>forgiveness of sins</I> shall be denied; he 
 shall have no benefit by Christ and his gospel. You may shake off the 
 dust of your feet against those that do so, and give them over as 
 incurable; they have forfeited that <I>repentance</I> and that 
 <I>remission</I> which Christ was <I>exalted to give,</I> and which you 
 are <I>commissioned to preach.</I>" The sin, no doubt, was the more 
 daring, and consequently the case the more desperate, during the 
 continuance of the <I>extraordinary</I> gifts and operations of the 
 Spirit in the church, which were intended for a <I>sign to them who 
 believed not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:22">1 Cor. xiv. 22</A>.

 There were hopes of those who, though not convinced by them at first,
 yet admired them, but those who <I>blasphemed</I> them were given 
 over.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Whatever trials they should be called out to, they should be 
 sufficiently furnished for them, and honourably brought through them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 The faithful martyr for Christ has not only <I>sufferings</I> to
 <I>undergo,</I> but a <I>testimony</I> to <I>bear,</I> a <I>good 
 confession</I> to <I>witness,</I> and is concerned to do that 
 <I>well,</I> so that the cause of Christ may not suffer, though he 
 suffer for it; and, if this be his care, let him cast it upon God: 
 "When they <I>bring you into the synagogues,</I> before church-rulers, 
 before the Jewish courts, or before <I>magistrates and powers,</I> 
 Gentile rulers, rulers in the state, to be examined about your 
 doctrine, what it is, and what the proof of it, <I>take no thought what 
 ye shall answer,</I>" 

 [1.] "That you may <I>save yourselves.</I> Do not study by what art or 
 rhetoric to mollify your judges, or by what tricks in law to bring 
 yourselves off; if it be the will of God that you should come off, and 
 your time is not yet come, he will bring it about effectually." 

 [2.] "That you may <I>serve your Master;</I> aim at this, but do not 
 perplex yourselves about it, for <I>the Holy Ghost,</I> as a Spirit of 
 wisdom, <I>shall teach you what you ought to say,</I> and how to say 
 it, so that it may be for the honour of God and his cause."</P>

 goods.

 We have in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The application that was made to Christ, very unseasonably, by one 
 of his hearers, desiring him to interpose <I>between him and his 
 brother</I> in a matter that concerned the estate of the family 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Master, speak to my brother;</I> speak as a prophet, speak as a 
 king, speak with authority; he is one that will have regard to what 
 thou sayest; speak to him, <I>that he divide the inheritance with 
 me.</I>" Now, 

 1. Some think that his brother <I>did him wrong,</I> and that he
 appealed to Christ to <I>right him,</I> because he knew the law was 
 costly. His brother was such a one as the Jews called 
 <I>Ben-hamesen</I>--<I>a son of violence,</I> that took not only his 
 own part of the estate, but his brother's too, and forcibly detained it 
 from him. Such brethren there are in the world, who have no sense at
 all either of <I>natural equity</I> or <I>natural affection,</I> who 
 make a prey of those whom they ought to patronize and protect. They who 
 are so wronged have God to go to, who will <I>execute</I> judgment and 
 justice for <I>those that are oppressed.</I> 

 2. Others think that he had a mind to <I>do his brother wrong,</I> and
 would have Christ to <I>assist him;</I> that, whereas the law gave the 
 elder brother a double portion of the estate, and the father himself 
 could not dispose of what he had but by that rule

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:16,17">Deut. xxi. 16, 17</A>),

 he would have Christ to <I>alter that law,</I> and oblige his brother, 
 who perhaps was a follower of Christ at large, to <I>divide the 
 inheritance</I> equally <I>with him,</I> in gavel-kind, share and share 
 alike, and to allot him as much as his elder brother. I suspect that 
 this was the case, because Christ takes occasion from it to warn 
 against <I>covetousness,</I> <B><I>pleonexia</I></B>--<I>a desire of 
 having more,</I> more than God in his providence has allotted us. It 
 was not a lawful desire of getting his own, but a <I>sinful</I> desire 
 of getting more than his own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's refusal to interpose in this matter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Man, who made me a judge or divider over you?</I> In matters of this 
 nature, Christ will not assume either a <I>legislative</I> power to 
 alter the settled rule of inheritances, or a <I>judicial</I> power to 
 determine controversies concerning them. He could have done the judge's 
 part, and the lawyer's, as well as he did the physician's, and have 
 ended suits at law as happily as he did diseases; but he would not, for 
 it was not in his commission: <I>Who made me a judge?</I> Probably he 
 refers to the indignity done to Moses by his brethren in Egypt, with 
 which Stephen upbraided the Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:27,35">Acts vii. 27, 35</A>.

 "If I should offer to do this, you would taunt me as you did Moses,
 <I>Who made thee a judge or a divider?</I>" He corrects the man's 
 mistake, will not admit his appeal (it was <I>coram non judice--not 
 before the proper judge</I>), and so <I>dismisses</I> his bill. If he 
 had come to him to desire him to assist his pursuit of the heavenly 
 inheritance, Christ would have given him his best help; but as to this 
 matter he has nothing to do: <I>Who made me a judge?</I> Note, Jesus 
 Christ was no usurper; he took no honour, no power, to himself, but 
 what was given him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:5">Heb. v. 5</A>.
 
 Whatever he did, he could tell by what authority he did it, and who
 gave him that authority. Now this shows us what is the nature and 
 constitution of Christ's kingdom. It is a spiritual kingdom, and not of 
 this world. 

 1. It does not interfere with civil powers, nor take the authority of
 princes out of their hands. Christianity leaves the matter as it found 
 it, as to civil power. 

 2. It does not intermeddle with civil rights; it obliges all to do
 justly, according to the settled rules of equity, but dominion is not 
 founded in grace.

 3. It does not <I>encourage</I> our <I>expectations</I> of worldly
 advantages by our religion. If this man will be a disciple of Christ, 
 and expects that in consideration of this Christ should give him his 
 brother's estate, he is mistaken; the rewards of Christ's disciples are 
 of another nature.

 4. It does not <I>encourage</I> our <I>contests</I> with our brethren,
 and our being rigorous and high in our demands, but rather, for peace' 
 sake, to recede from our right. 

 5. It does not allow ministers to <I>entangle</I> themselves in the
 affairs of this <I>life</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:4">2 Tim. ii. 4</A>),

 to <I>leave the word of God to serve tables.</I> There are those whose 
 business it is, let it be left to them, <I>Tractent fabrilia 
 fabri</I>--<I>Each workman to his proper craft.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The necessary caution which Christ took occasion from this to give 
 to his hearers. Though he came not to be a <I>divider</I> of men's 
 estates, he came to be a director of their consciences about them, and 
 would have all take heed of harbouring that corrupt principle which 
 they saw to be in others the <I>root</I> of <I>so much evil.</I> Here 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The caution itself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Take heed and beware of covetousness;</I> 
 <B><I>horate</I></B>--"<I>Observe yourselves,</I> keep a <I>jealous 
 eye</I> upon your own hearts, lest covetous principles steal into them; 
 and <B><I>phylassesthe</I></B>--<I>preserve yourselves,</I> keep a 
 <I>strict band</I> upon your own hearts, lest covetous principles rule 
 and give law in them." Covetousness is a sin which we have need 
 constantly to <I>watch against,</I> and therefore frequently to be 
 <I>warned against.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reason of it, or an argument to enforce this caution: <I>For a 
 man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he 
 possesseth;</I> that is, "our happiness and comfort do not depend upon 
 our having a great deal of the wealth of this world." 

 (1.) The life of the <I>soul,</I> undoubtedly, does not depend upon it, 
 and the soul is the man. The things of the world will not suit the 
 nature of a soul, nor supply its needs, nor satisfy its desires, nor 
 last so long as it will last. Nay, 

 (2.) Even the life of the body and the happiness of that do not consist 
 in an <I>abundance</I> of these things; for many live very contentedly 
 and easily, and get through the world very comfortably, who have but a 
 little of the wealth of it (a dinner of herbs with holy love is better 
 than a <I>feast of fat things</I>); and, on the other hand, many live 
 very miserably who have a great deal of the things of this world; they 
 possess abundance, and yet have no comfort of it; they <I>bereave their 
 souls of good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:8">Eccl. iv. 8</A>.

 Many who have abundance are discontented and fretful, as Ahab and
 Haman; and then what good does their abundance do them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The illustration of this by a parable, the sum of which is to show 
 the folly of carnal worldlings while they live, and their misery when 
 they die, which is intended not only for a check to that man who came 
 to Christ with an address about his estate, while he was in no care 
 about his soul and another world, but for the enforcing of that 
 necessary caution to us all, to <I>take heed of covetousness.</I> The 
 parable gives us the life and death of a <I>rich man,</I> and leaves us 
 to judge whether he was a <I>happy</I> man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is an account of his worldly wealth and abundance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 
 <I>The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully,</I> 
 <B><I>chora</I></B>--<I>regio</I>--<I>the country.</I> He had a whole
 country to himself, a lordship of his own; he was a little prince. 
 Observe, His wealth lay much in the fruits of the earth, for <I>the 
 king himself is served by the field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:9">Eccl. v. 9</A>.

 He had a great deal of ground, and his ground was <I>fruitful;</I> much
 would have <I>more,</I> and he <I>had more.</I> Note, The fruitfulness 
 of the earth is a great blessing, but it is a blessing which God often 
 gives plentifully to wicked men, to whom it is a snare, that we may not 
 think to judge of his love or hatred by what is before us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Here are the workings of his heart, in the midst of this 
 abundance. We are here told what <I>he thought within himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Note, The God of heaven knows and observes whatever we think within
 ourselves, and we are accountable to him for it. He is both a
 discerner and judge of the thoughts and intents of the heart. We 
 mistake if we imagine that thoughts are <I>hid</I> and thoughts are 
 <I>free.</I> Let us here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What his <I>cares</I> and <I>concerns</I> were. When he saw an 
 extraordinary crop upon his ground, instead of <I>thanking God</I> for 
 it, or rejoicing in the opportunity it would give him of doing the more 
 good, he afflicts himself with this thought, <I>What shall I do, 
 because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?</I> He speaks as one 
 <I>at a loss,</I> and full of perplexity. <I>What shall I do now?</I> 
 The poorest beggar in the country, that did not know where to get a 
 meal's meat, could not have said a more anxious word. Disquieting care 
 is the common fruit of an abundance of this world, and the common fault 
 of those that have abundance. The more men have, the more perplexity 
 they have with it, and the more solicitous they are to keep what they 
 have and to add to it, how to spare and how to spend; so that even the 
 <I>abundance</I> of the rich will not suffer them to <I>sleep,</I> for 
 thinking what they shall do with what they have and how they shall 
 dispose of it. The rich man seems to speak it with a sigh, <I>What 
 shall I do?</I> And if you ask, Why, what is the matter? Truly he had 
 <I>abundance</I> of wealth, and wants a place to <I>put it in,</I> that 
 is all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What his <I>projects</I> and <I>purposes</I> were, which were the 
 result of his cares, and were indeed absurd and foolish like them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>This will I do,</I> and it is the wisest course I can take, <I>I 
 will pull down my barns,</I> for they are too little, and I will 
 <I>build greater, and there will I bestow all my fruits and my 
 goods,</I> and then I shall be at ease." Now here, <I>First,</I> It was 
 folly for him to call the fruits of the ground <I>his</I> fruits and 
 <I>his</I> goods. He seems to lay a pleasing emphasis upon that, 
 <I>my</I> fruits and <I>my</I> goods; whereas what we have is but 
 <I>lent</I> us for our use, the property is still in God; we are but 
 stewards of our <I>Lord's goods,</I> tenants at will of our Lord's 
 land. It is <I>my corn</I> (saith God) and <I>my wine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:8,9">Hos. ii. 8, 9</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> It was folly for him to <I>hoard up</I> what he had,
 and then to think it <I>well bestowed.</I> There will I bestow it 
 <I>all;</I> as if none must be bestowed upon the poor, none upon his 
 family, none upon the Levite and <I>the stranger,</I> the <I>fatherless 
 and the widow,</I> but all in the great barn. <I>Thirdly,</I> It was 
 folly for him to let his <I>mind</I> rise with his <I>condition;</I> 
 when his ground brought forth more plentifully than usual, then to talk 
 of bigger barns, as if the next year must needs be as fruitful as this, 
 and much more abundant, whereas the barn might be as much too big the 
 next year as it was too little this. Years of famine commonly follow 
 years of plenty, as they did in Egypt; and therefore it were better to 
 <I>stack</I> some of his corn for this once. <I>Fourthly,</I> It was 
 folly for him to think to ease his care by building new barns, for the 
 building of them would but increase his care; those know this who know 
 any thing of the spirit of building. The way that God prescribes for 
 the cure of inordinate care is certainly successful, but the way of the 
 world does but increase it. Besides, when he had done this, there were 
 other cares that would still attend him; the greater the barns, still 
 the greater the cares, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:10">Eccl. v. 10</A>.

 <I>Fifthly,</I> It was folly for him to contrive and resolve all this
 <I>absolutely</I> and <I>without reserve.</I> This <I>I will</I> do: 
 <I>I will</I> pull down my barns and will build greater, yea, that <I>I 
 will;</I> without so much as that necessary proviso, <I>If the Lord 
 will, I shall live,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:13-15">Jam. iv. 13-15</A>.

 Peremptory projects are foolish projects; for our times are in God's
 hand, and not in our own, and we do not so much as <I>know what shall 
 be on the morrow.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] What his <I>pleasing hopes</I> and <I>expectations</I> were, when 
 he should have made good these projects. "Then <I>I will say to my 
 soul,</I> upon the credit of this security, whether God say it or no, 
 <I>Soul,</I> mark what I say, <I>thou hast much goods laid up for many 
 years</I> in these barns; now <I>take thine ease,</I> enjoy thyself, 
 <I>eat, drink, and be merry,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Here also appears his folly, as much in the enjoyment of his wealth as
 in the pursuit of it. <I>First,</I> It was folly for him to put off
 his comfort in his abundance till he had compassed his projects 
 concerning it. When he has built bigger barns, and filled them (which 
 will be a work of time), then he will <I>take his ease;</I> and might 
 he not as well have <I>done that now?</I> Grotius here quotes the story 
 of Pyrrhus, who was projecting to make himself master of Sicily, 
 Africa, and other places, in the prosecution of his victories. Well, 
 says his friend Cyneas, and what must we do then? <I>Postea 
 vivemus,</I> says he, <I>Then we will live; At hoc jam licet,</I> says 
 Cyneas, <I>We may live now if we please. Secondly,</I> It was folly for 
 him to be confident that his goods were <I>laid up for many years,</I> 
 as if his bigger barns would be <I>safer</I> than those he had; whereas 
 in an hour's time they might be burnt to the ground and all that was 
 laid up in them, perhaps by lightning, against which there is no 
 defence. A few years may make a great change; <I>moth and rust may 
 corrupt, or thieves break through and steal. Thirdly,</I> It was folly 
 for him to count upon certain <I>ease,</I> when he had laid up 
 abundance of the wealth of this world, whereas there are many things 
 that may make people uneasy in the midst of their greatest abundance. 
 One dead fly may spoil a whole pot of precious ointment; and one thorn 
 a whole bed of down. Pain and sickness of body, disagreeableness of 
 relations, and especially a guilty conscience, may rob a man of his 
 ease, who has ever so much of the wealth of this world.
 <I>Fourthly,</I> It was folly for him to think of making no other use 
 of his plenty than to <I>eat</I> and <I>drink,</I> and to <I>be 
 merry;</I> to indulge the flesh, and gratify the sensual appetite, 
 without any thought of doing good to others, and being put thereby into 
 a better capacity of serving God and his generation: as if we 
 <I>lived</I> to <I>eat,</I> and did not <I>eat</I> to <I>live,</I> and 
 the happiness of man consisted in nothing else but in having all the 
 gratifications of sense wound up to the height of pleasurableness. 
 <I>Fifthly,</I> It was the greatest folly of all to say all this to his 
 <I>soul.</I> if he had said, <I>Body, take thine ease,</I> for <I>thou 
 hast goods laid up for many years,</I> there had been sense in it; but 
 the soul, considered as an immortal spirit, separable from the body, 
 was no way interested in a barn full of corn or a bag full of gold. If 
 he had had the <I>soul of a swine,</I> he might have <I>blessed it</I> 
 with the satisfaction of <I>eating</I> and <I>drinking;</I> but what is 
 this to the <I>soul of a man,</I> that has exigencies and desires which 
 these things will be no ways suited to? It is the great absurdity which 
 the children of this world are guilty of that they portion their souls 
 in the wealth of the world and the pleasures of sense.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Here is God's sentence upon all this; and we are sure that his 
 judgment is according to truth. He said to himself, said to his soul, 
 <I>Take thine ease.</I> If God had said so too, the man had been happy, 
 as his Spirit witnesses with the spirit of believers to make them easy. 
 <I>But God said</I> quite otherwise; and by his judgment of us we must 
 stand or fall, not by ours of ourselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:3,4">1 Cor. iv. 3, 4</A>.

 His neighbours blessed him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:3">Ps. x. 3</A>),
 
 praised him as <I>doing well for himself</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:18">Ps. xlix. 18</A>);

 but God said he did ill for himself: <I>Thou fool, this night thy soul 
 shall be required of thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 <I>God said to him,</I> that is, decreed this concerning him, and let
 him know it, either by his conscience or by some awakening providence, 
 or rather by both together. This was said when he was <I>in the
 fulness of his sufficiency</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:22">Job xx. 22</A>),

 when his eyes were held waking upon his bed with his cares and 
 contrivances about enlarging his barns, not by adding a bay or two more 
 of building to them, which might serve to answer the end, but by 
 pulling them down and building greater, which was requisite to please 
 his fancy. When he was forecasting this, and had brought it to an 
 issue, and then lulled himself asleep again with a pleasing dream of 
 many years' enjoyment of his present improvements, <I>then</I> God said 
 this to him. Thus Belshazzar was struck with terror by the hand-writing 
 on the wall, in the midst of his jollity. Now observe what God
 said,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The character he gave him: <I>Thou fool,</I> thou <I>Nabal,</I> 
 alluding to the story of Nabal, that <I>fool</I> (Nabal is his name, 
 and folly is with him) whose heart was struck dead <I>as a stone</I> 
 while he was regaling himself in the abundance of his provision for his 
 sheep-shearers. Note, Carnal worldlings are fools, and the day is 
 coming when God will call them by their own name, <I>Thou fool,</I> and 
 they will call themselves so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The sentence he passed upon him, a sentence of death: <I>This 
 night thy soul shall be required of thee; they shall require thy 
 soul</I> (so the words are), and then <I>whose shall those things be 
 which thou hast provided?</I> He thought he had goods that should be 
 his for many years, but he must part from them <I>this night;</I> he 
 thought he should enjoy them himself, but he must leave them to he 
 knows not who. Note, The death of carnal worldlings is miserable in 
 itself and terrible to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> It is a <I>force,</I> an <I>arrest;</I> it is the 
 <I>requiring of the soul,</I> that soul that thou art making such a 
 fool of; what hast thou to do with a soul, who canst use it no better? 
 Thy soul shall be <I>required;</I> this intimates that he is loth to 
 part with it. A good man, who has taken his heart off from this world, 
 cheerfully resigns his soul at death, and gives it up; but a worldly 
 man has it <I>torn</I> from him with violence; it is a terror to him to 
 think of leaving this world. <I>They shall require thy soul.</I> God 
 shall require it; he shall require an account of it. "Man, woman, what 
 hast thou done with thy soul. Give an account of that stewardship." 
 <I>They shall;</I> that is, evil angels as the messengers of God's 
 justice. As good angels receive gracious souls to carry them to their 
 joy, so evil angels receive wicked souls to carry them to the place of 
 torment; they shall <I>require it</I> as a guilty soul to be punished. 
 The devil requires thy soul as his own, for it did, in effect, give 
 itself to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> It is a <I>surprize,</I> an <I>unexpected</I> force. 
 It is in <I>the night,</I> and terrors in the night are most terrible. 
 The time of death is day-time to a good man; it is his morning. But it 
 is night to a worldling, a dark night; he <I>lies down in sorrow.</I> 
 It is <I>this night,</I> this <I>present</I> night, without delay; 
 there is no giving bail, or begging a day. This <I>pleasant</I> night, 
 when thou art promising thyself many years to come, now thou must die, 
 and go to judgment. Thou art entertaining thyself with the fancy of 
 many a merry day, and merry night, and merry feast; but, in the midst 
 of all, here is an end of all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:4">Isa. xxi. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> It is the leaving of all <I>those things</I> behind 
 <I>which they have provided,</I> which they have laboured for, and 
 prepared for hereafter, with abundance of toil and care. All that which 
 they have placed their happiness in, and built their hope upon, and 
 raised their expectations from, they must leave behind. <I>Their pomp 
 shall not descend after them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:17">Ps. xlix. 17</A>),

 but they shall go as naked out of the world as they came into it, and 
 they shall have no benefit at all by what they have hoarded up either 
 in death, in judgment, or in their everlasting state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> It is leaving them to they <I>know not who:</I> "Then 
 <I>whose shall those things be?</I> Not <I>thine</I> to be sure, and 
 thou knowest not what <I>they</I> will prove for whom thou didst design 
 them, thy children and relations, whether they will be <I>wise</I> or 
 <I>fools</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:18,19">Eccl. ii. 18, 19</A>),

 whether such as will bless thy memory or curse it, be a credit to thy 
 family or a blemish, do good or hurt with what thou leavest them, keep 
 it or spend it; nay, thou knowest not but those for whom thou dost 
 design it may be prevented from the enjoyment of it, and it may be 
 turned to somebody else thou little thinkest of; nay, though thou 
 knowest to whom thou leavest it, thou knowest not to whom they will 
 leave it, or into whose hand it will come at last." If many a man could 
 have foreseen to whom his house would have come after his death, he 
 would rather have burned it than beautified it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fifthly,</I> It is a demonstration of his folly. Carnal worldlings 
 are <I>fools</I> while they live: <I>this their way is their folly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:13">Ps. xlix. 13</A>);

 but their folly is made most evident when they die: <I>at his end he 
 shall be a fool</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:11">Jer. xvii. 11</A>);

 for then it will appear that he took pains to lay up treasure in a 
 world he was hastening from, but took no care to lay it up in the world 
 he was hastening to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is the application of this parable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>So is he,</I> such a fool, a fool in God's judgment, a fool upon 
 record, that <I>layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich towards 
 God.</I> This is the way and this is the end of such a man. Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The description of a worldly man: He <I>lays up treasure for 
 himself,</I> for the body, for the world, for <I>himself</I> in 
 opposition to God, for that <I>self</I> that is to be <I>denied.</I> 
 
 (1.) It is his error that he counts his <I>flesh himself,</I> as if the 
 <I>body</I> were the <I>man.</I> If <I>self</I> be rightly stated and 
 understood, it is only the true Christian that lays up treasure for 
 himself, and is <I>wise for himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:12">Prov. ix. 12</A>.

 (2.) It is his error that he makes it his business to <I>lay up for the 
 flesh,</I> which he calls laying up <I>for himself.</I> All his labour 
 is <I>for his mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+6:7">Eccl. vi. 7</A>),

 <I>making provision for the flesh.</I> 

 (3.) It is his error that he counts those things his <I>treasure</I> 
 which are thus <I>laid up</I> for the world, and the body, and the life 
 that now is; they are the wealth he trusts to, and spends upon, and 
 lets out his affections toward. 

 (4.) The greatest error of all is that he is in no care to be <I>rich 
 towards God,</I> rich in the <I>account of God,</I> whose accounting us 
 rich makes us so

 rich in the <I>things of God,</I> rich <I>in faith</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:5">Jam. ii. 5</A>),

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:18">1 Tim. vi. 18</A>),

 rich in graces, and comforts, and spiritual gifts. Many who have 
 abundance of this world are wholly destitute of that which will enrich 
 their souls, which will make them rich towards God, rich for 
 eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The folly and misery of a worldly man: <I>So is he.</I> Our Lord 
 Jesus Christ, who knows what the end of things will be, has here told 
 us what his end will be. Note, It is the unspeakable folly of the most 
 of men to mind and pursue the wealth of this world more than the wealth 
 of the other world, that which is merely for the body and for time, 
 more than that which is for the soul and eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you,
 Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the
 body, what ye shall put on.
 &nbsp; 23 The life is more than meat, and the body <I>is more</I> than
 raiment.
 &nbsp; 24 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
 neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much
 more are ye better than the fowls?
 &nbsp; 25 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature
 one cubit?
 &nbsp; 26 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why
 take ye thought for the rest?
 &nbsp; 27 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin
 not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was
 not arrayed like one of these.
 &nbsp; 28 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the
 field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more <I>will
 he clothe</I> you, O ye of little faith?
 &nbsp; 29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,
 neither be ye of doubtful mind.
 &nbsp; 30 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after:
 and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
 &nbsp; 31 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things
 shall be added unto you.
 &nbsp; 32 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good
 pleasure to give you the kingdom.
 &nbsp; 33 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags
 which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not,
 where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.
 &nbsp; 34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
 &nbsp; 35 Let your loins be girded about, and <I>your</I> lights burning;
 &nbsp; 36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord,
 when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and
 knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.
 &nbsp; 37 Blessed <I>are</I> those servants, whom the lord when he cometh
 shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird
 himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth
 and serve them.
 &nbsp; 38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the
 third watch, and find <I>them</I> so, blessed are those servants.
 &nbsp; 39 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known
 what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not
 have suffered his house to be broken through.
 &nbsp; 40 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an
 hour when ye think not.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus is here inculcating some needful useful lessons upon his 
 disciples, which he had before taught them, and had occasion afterwards 
 to press upon them; for they need to have <I>precept upon precept, and 
 line upon line: "Therefore,</I> because there are so many that are 
 ruined by covetousness, and an inordinate affection to the wealth of 
 this world, <I>I say unto you,</I> my disciples, take heed of it." 
 <I>Thou, O man of God, flee these things,</I> as well as thou, O man of 
 the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:11">1 Tim. vi. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He charges them not to afflict themselves with disquieting 
 perplexing cares about the necessary supports of life: <I>Take no 
 thought for your life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 In the foregoing parable he had given us warning against that branch of
 covetousness of which rich people are most in danger; and that is, a 
 <I>sensual complacency</I> in the abundance of this world's goods. Now 
 his disciples might think they were in no danger of this, for they had 
 no plenty or variety to glory in; and therefore he here warns them 
 against another branch of covetousness, which they are most in 
 temptation to that have but a little of this world, which was the case 
 of the disciples at best and much more now that they had left all to 
 follow Christ, and that was, an <I>anxious solicitude</I> about the 
 necessary supports of life: "<I>Take no thought for your life,</I> 
 either for the preservation of it, if it be in danger, or for the 
 provision that is to be made for it, either of food or clothing, 
 <I>what ye shall eat</I> or <I>what ye shall put on.</I>" This is the 
 caution he had largely insisted upon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25">Matt. vi. 25</A>,

 &c.; and the arguments here used are much the same, designed for our
 encouragement to cast all our care upon God, which is the <I>right 
 way</I> to <I>ease</I> ourselves of it. Consider then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God, who has done the greater for us, may be depended upon to do the 
 less. He has, without any care or forecast of our own, given us 
 <I>life</I> and a <I>body,</I> and therefore we may cheerfully leave it 
 to him to provide <I>meat</I> for the support of that life, and 
 <I>raiment</I> for the defence of that body.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God, who provides for the inferior creatures, may be depended upon 
 to provide for good Christians. "Trust God for <I>meat,</I> for he 
 <I>feeds the ravens</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 they <I>neither sow nor reap,</I> they take neither care nor pains 
 beforehand to provide for themselves, and yet they are <I>fed,</I> and 
 never perish for want. Now consider <I>how much better ye are than the 
 fowls,</I> than the ravens. Trust God for clothing, for he clothes the 
 lilies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>);

 they make no preparation for their own clothing, they <I>toil not,</I> 
 they <I>spin not,</I> the root in the ground is a naked thing, and 
 without ornament, and yet, as the flower grows up, it appears 
 wonderfully <I>beautified.</I> Now, if God has so clothed the flowers, 
 which are fading perishing things, <I>shall he not much more clothe</I> 
 you with such clothing as is fit for you, and with clothing suited to 
 your nature, as theirs is?" When God fed Israel with <I>manna</I> in 
 the wilderness, he also took care for their clothing; for though he did 
 not furnish them with new clothes, yet (which came all to one) he 
 provided that those they had should not <I>wax old upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:4">Deut. viii. 4</A>.

 Thus will he clothe his spiritual Israel; but then let them not be
 <I>of little faith.</I> Note, Our inordinate cares are owing to the 
 weakness of our faith; for a powerful practical belief of the 
 all-sufficiency of God, his covenant-relation to us as a Father, and 
 especially his precious promises, relating both to this life and that 
 to come, would be mighty, through God, to the pulling down of the 
 strong holds of these disquieting perplexing imaginations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Our cares are fruitless, vain, and insignificant, and therefore it 
 is folly to indulge them. They will not gain us our wishes, and 
 therefore ought not to hinder our repose 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>Which of you by taking thought can add to his stature one 
 cubit,</I> or one inch, can add to <I>his age</I> one year or one hour? 
 Now if ye be <I>not able to do that which is least,</I> if it be not in 
 your power to alter your statures, why should you perplex yourselves 
 about other things, which are as much out of your power, and about 
 which it is necessary that we refer ourselves to the providence of 
 God?" Note, As in our <I>stature,</I> so in our <I>state,</I> it is our 
 wisdom to take <I>it as it is,</I> and make the best of it; for 
 fretting and vexing, carping and caring, will not mend it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. An inordinate anxious pursuit of the things of this world, even 
 necessary things, very ill becomes the disciples of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>):
 
 "Whatever others do, <I>seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall 
 drink;</I> do not you afflict yourselves with perplexing cares, nor 
 weary yourselves with constant toils; do not hurry hither and thither 
 with enquiries <I>what you shall eat or drink,</I> as David's enemies, 
 that <I>wandered up and down for meat</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:15">Ps. lix. 15</A>),

 or as the eagle that <I>seeks the prey afar off,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:29">Job xxxix. 29</A>.

 Let not the disciples of Christ thus <I>seek</I> their food, but ask it
 of God day by day; let them not be <I>of doubtful mind;</I> <B><I>me 
 meteorizesthe</I></B>--<I>Be not as meteors in the air,</I> that are 
 blown hither and thither with every wind; do not, like them, 
 <I>rise</I> and <I>fall,</I> but maintain a consistency with 
 yourselves; be even and steady, and have your hearts fixed; <I>live not 
 in careful suspense;</I> let not your minds be continually perplexed 
 between hope and fear, ever upon the rack." Let not the children of God 
 make themselves uneasy; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This is to make themselves like the children of this world: 
 "<I>All these things do the nations of the world seek after,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 
 They that take care for the body only, and not for the soul, for this
 world only, and not for the other, look no further than what they shall 
 <I>eat</I> and <I>drink;</I> and, having no all-sufficient God to seek 
 to and confide in, they burden themselves with anxious cares about 
 those things. But it ill becomes you to do so. You, who are called out 
 of the world, ought not to be thus conformed to the world, and to 
 <I>walk in the way of this people,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:11,12">Isa. viii. 11, 12</A>.

 When inordinate cares prevail over us, we should think, "What am I, a
 Christian or a heathen? Baptized or not baptized? If a Christian, if 
 baptized, shall I rank myself with Gentiles, and join with them in 
 their pursuits?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is needless for them to disquiet themselves with care about the
 necessary supports of life; for they have a Father in heaven who does 
 and will take care for them: "<I>Your Father knows that you have need 
 of these things,</I> and considers it, and will supply your needs 
 <I>according to his riches in glory;</I> for he is <I>your Father,</I> 
 who <I>made</I> you subject to these necessities, and therefore will 
 suit his compassions to them: <I>your Father,</I> who <I>maintains</I> 
 you, educates you, and designs an inheritance for you, and therefore 
 will take care that you <I>want no good thing.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They have better things to mind and pursue
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "<I>But rather seek ye the kingdom of God,</I> and mind this, you, my 
 disciples, who are to <I>preach the kingdom of God;</I> let your hearts 
 be upon your work, and your great care how to do that well, and this 
 will effectually divert your thoughts from inordinate care about things 
 of the world. And let all that have souls to save <I>seek the kingdom 
 of God,</I> in which only they can be <I>safe.</I> Seek admission into 
 it, seek advancement in it; seek the <I>kingdom of grace,</I> to be 
 subjects in that; the <I>kingdom of glory,</I> to be princes in that; 
 and then <I>all these things shall be added to you.</I> Mind the 
 affairs of your souls with diligence and care, and then trust God with 
 all your other affairs."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) They have better things to expect and hope for: <I>Fear not, 
 little flock,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 For the banishing of inordinate cares, it is necessary that fears
 should be suppressed. When we frighten ourselves with an apprehension 
 of evil to come, we put ourselves upon the stretch of care how to avoid 
 it, when after all perhaps it is but the creature of our own 
 imagination. Therefore <I>fear not, little flock,</I> but <I>hope to 
 the end;</I> for <I>it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the 
 kingdom.</I> This comfortable word we had not in Matthew. Note,

 [1.] Christ's flock in this world is a <I>little flock;</I> his sheep 
 are but few and feeble. The church is a vineyard, a garden, a small 
 spot, compared with the wilderness of this world; as Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:27">1 Kings xx. 27</A>),

 who were like two little flocks of kids, when <I>the Syrians filled the 
 country.</I> 

 [2.] Though it be a little flock, quite <I>over-numbered,</I> and 
 therefore in danger of being <I>overpowered,</I> by its enemies, yet it 
 is the will of Christ that they should not <I>be afraid: "Fear not, 
 little flock,</I> but see yourselves safe under the protection and 
 conduct of the great and good Shepherd, and lie easy." 

 [3.] God has <I>a kingdom</I> in store for all that belong to Christ's 
 <I>little flock,</I> a crown of glory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:4">1 Pet. v. 4</A>),
 
 a throne of power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:21">Rev. iii. 21</A>),

 unsearchable riches, far exceeding the peculiar treasures of <I>kings 
 and provinces.</I> The <I>sheep on the right hand</I> are called to 
 <I>come</I> and <I>inherit the kingdom;</I> it is theirs for ever; a 
 kingdom for each. 

 [4.] The kingdom is given according to the <I>good pleasure</I> of the 
 Father; <I>It is your Father's good pleasure;</I> it is given not of 
 debt, but of grace, free grace, sovereign grace; <I>even so, Father, 
 because it seemed good unto thee.</I> The kingdom is his; and may he 
 not do what he will with his own? 

 [5.] The believing hopes and prospects of <I>the kingdom</I> should 
 silence and suppress the fears of Christ's little flock in this world. 
 "Fear no trouble; for, though it should come, it shall not come between 
 you and the kingdom, that is sure, it is near." (That is not an evil 
 worth trembling at the thought of which cannot separate us from the 
 love of God). "<I>Fear not the want of any</I> thing that is good for 
 you; for, if it be <I>your Father's good pleasure to give you the 
 kingdom,</I> you need not question but he will <I>bear your charges</I> 
 thither."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He charged them to make sure work for their souls, by laying up 
 their treasure in heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>.

 Those who have done this may be very easy as to all the events of
 time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. "<I>Sit loose to this world,</I> and to all your possessions in it: 
 <I>Sell that ye have,</I> and <I>give alms,</I>" that is, "rather than 
 want wherewith to relieve those that are truly <I>necessitous,</I> sell 
 what you have that is <I>superfluous,</I> all that you can spare from 
 the support of yourselves and families, and give it <I>to the poor. 
 Sell what you have,</I> if you find it a hindrance from, or incumbrance 
 in, the service of Christ. Do not think yourselves undone, if by being 
 fined, imprisoned, or banished, for the testimony of Jesus, you be 
 forced to sell your estates, thought they be <I>the inheritance of your 
 fathers.</I> Do not sell to <I>hoard up</I> the money, or because you 
 can make more of it by usury, but <I>sell and give alms;</I> what is 
 given in alms, in a right manner, is put out to the <I>best</I> 
 interest, upon the <I>best</I> security."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. "<I>Set your hearts upon the other world,</I> and your expectations 
 from that world. <I>Provide yourselves bags that wax not old,</I> that 
 wax not empty, not of gold, but of grace in the heart and good works in 
 the life; these are the bags that will last." Grace will <I>go with 
 us</I> into another world, for it is <I>woven in</I> the soul; and our 
 good works will <I>follow us,</I> for <I>God is not unrighteous to 
 forget</I> them. These will be <I>treasures in heaven,</I> that will 
 enrich us to eternity. 

 (1.) It is treasure that will not be <I>exhausted;</I> we may spend 
 upon it to eternity, and it will not be at all the less; there is no 
 danger of seeing the bottom of it. 

 (2.) It is treasure that we are in no danger of being robbed of, for 
 <I>no thief approaches</I> near it; what is laid up in heaven is out of 
 reach of enemies. 

 (3.) It is treasure that will not <I>spoil</I> with <I>keeping,</I> any 
 more than it will <I>waste</I> with <I>spending;</I> the <I>moth</I> 
 does not <I>corrupt</I> it, as it does our garments which we now wear. 
 Now by <I>this</I> it appears that we have laid up our treasure in 
 heaven if our <I>hearts</I> be <I>there</I> while we are <I>here</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 if we think much of heaven and keep our eye upon it, if we quicken 
 ourselves with the hopes of it and keep ourselves in awe with the fear 
 of falling short of it. But, if your hearts be set upon the earth and
 the things of it, it is to be feared that you have your treasure and 
 portion in it, and are undone when you leave it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He charges them to get ready, and to keep in a readiness for 
 Christ's coming, when all those who have laid up their treasure in 
 heaven shall enter upon the enjoyment of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ is our <I>Master,</I> and we are his <I>servants,</I> not 
 only <I>working</I> servants, but <I>waiting</I> servants, servants 
 that are to do him honour, in <I>waiting</I> on him, and attending his 
 motions: <I>If any man serve me, let him follow me. Follow the Lamb 
 whithersoever he goes.</I> But that is not all: they must do him honour 
 in <I>waiting for him,</I> and expecting his return. We must be as men 
 that <I>wait for their Lord,</I> that sit up late while he stays out 
 late, to be ready to receive him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ our Master, though now <I>gone from us,</I> will <I>return 
 again,</I> return <I>from the wedding,</I> from <I>solemnizing</I> the 
 nuptials abroad, to <I>complete</I> them at home. Christ's servants are 
 now in a state of expectation, <I>looking for their Master's glorious 
 appearing,</I> and doing every thing with an eye to <I>that,</I> and in 
 order to <I>that.</I> He <I>will come</I> to take cognizance of his 
 servants, and, that being a <I>critical day,</I> they shall either stay 
 with him or be turned out of doors, according as they are found in that 
 day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The time of our Master's return is uncertain; it will be <I>in the 
 night,</I> it will be <I>far</I> in the night, when he has long 
 <I>deferred</I> his coming, and when many have done looking for him; in 
 the <I>second watch,</I> just before midnight, or in the <I>third 
 watch,</I> next after midnight, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 His coming to us, at our death, is uncertain, and to many it will be a
 great surprise; for <I>the Son of Man cometh at an hour that ye think 
 not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 without giving notice beforehand. This bespeaks not only the
 uncertainty of the time of his coming, but the prevailing security of 
 the greatest part of men, who are <I>unthinking,</I> and altogether 
 regardless of the notices given them, so that, whenever he comes, it is 
 <I>in an hour that they think not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That which he expects and requires from his servants is that they be 
 <I>ready to open to him immediately,</I> whenever he comes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),
 
 that is, that they be in a frame fit to receive him, or rather to be 
 received by him; that they be found <I>as</I> his servants, in the 
 posture that becomes them, with their <I>loins girded about,</I> 
 alluding to the servants that are ready to go whither their master 
 sends them, and do what their master bids them, having their long 
 garments tucked up (which otherwise would hang about them, and hinder 
 them), and <I>their lights burning,</I> with which to light their 
 master into the house, and up to his chamber.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Those servants will be happy who shall be found ready, and in a good 
 frame, when their Lord shall come 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>Blessed are those servants</I> who, after having waited long, 
 continue in a waiting frame, until the hour that their Lord comes, and 
 are then found awake and aware of his first approach, of his first 
 knock; and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>Blessed are those servants,</I> for then will be the time of their 
 preferment. Here is such an instance of honour done them as is scarcely 
 to be found among men: He <I>will make them sit down to meat, and will 
 serve them.</I> For the bridegroom to wait upon his bride at table is 
 not uncommon, but to wait upon his servants is not <I>the manner of 
 men;</I> yet Jesus Christ was among his disciples as <I>one that 
 served,</I> and did once, to show his condescension, <I>gird 
 himself,</I> and <I>serve them,</I> when he <I>washed their feet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:4,5">John xiii. 4, 5</A>);

 it signified the joy with which they shall be received into the other 
 world by the Lord Jesus, who is gone before, to prepare for them, and 
 has told them that his <I>Father</I> will <I>honour</I> them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:26">John xii. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. We are <I>therefore</I> kept at uncertainty concerning the precise 
 time of his coming that we may be always ready; for it is no thanks to 
 a man to be ready for an attack, if he know beforehand just the time 
 when it will be made: <I>The good man of the house, if he had known 
 what hour the thief would have come,</I> though he were ever so 
 careless a man, <I>would</I> yet <I>have watched,</I> and have 
 frightened away the thieves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 But we do not know at what hour the alarm will be given us, and
 therefore are concerned to watch at all tines, and never to be off our 
 guard. Or this may intimate the miserable case of those who are 
 careless and unbelieving in this great matter. If the <I>good man of 
 the house</I> had had notice of his danger of being robbed such a 
 night, he would have sat up, and saved his house; but we have notice of 
 the day of the Lord's coming, <I>as a thief in the night,</I> to the 
 confusion and ruin of all secure sinners, and yet do not thus 
 <I>watch.</I> If men will take such care of their houses, O let us be 
 thus wise for our souls: <I>Be ye therefore ready also,</I> as ready as 
 the good man of the house would be <I>if he knew what hour the thief 
 would come.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>41  Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable
 unto us, or even to all?
 &nbsp; 42 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise
 steward, whom <I>his</I> lord shall make ruler over his household, to
 give <I>them their</I> portion of meat in due season?
 &nbsp; 43 Blessed <I>is</I> that servant, whom his lord when he cometh
 shall find so doing.
 &nbsp; 44 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over
 all that he hath.
 &nbsp; 45 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth
 his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens,
 and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;
 &nbsp; 46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh
 not for <I>him,</I> and at a hour when he is not aware, and will cut
 him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the
 unbelievers.
 &nbsp; 47 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared
 not <I>himself,</I> neither did according to his will, shall be beaten
 with many <I>stripes.</I>
 &nbsp; 48 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of
 stripes, shall be beaten with few <I>stripes.</I> For unto whomsoever
 much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men
 have committed much, of him they will ask the more.
 &nbsp; 49 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it
 be already kindled?
 &nbsp; 50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I
 straitened till it be accomplished!
 &nbsp; 51 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell
 you, Nay; but rather division:
 &nbsp; 52 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house
 divided, three against two, and two against three.
 &nbsp; 53 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son
 against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the
 daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her
 daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in
 law.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Peter's question, which he put to Christ upon occasion of the 
 foregoing parable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 "<I>Lord, speakest thou this parable to us</I> that are thy constant 
 followers, to us that are ministers, <I>or also to all</I> that come to 
 be taught by thee, to all the hearers, and in them to all Christians?" 
 Peter was now, as often, spokesman for the disciples. We have reason to 
 bless God that there are some such forward men, that have a gift of 
 utterance; let those that are such take heed of being proud. Now Peter 
 desires Christ to explain himself, and to direct the arrow of the 
 foregoing parable to the mark he intended. He calls it a 
 <I>parable,</I> because it was not only figurative, but weighty, solid, 
 and instructive. Lord, said Peter, was it intended for <I>us,</I> or 
 for <I>all?</I> To this Christ gives a direct answer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:37">Mark xiii. 37</A>):
 
 <I>What I say unto you, I say unto all.</I> Yet here he seems to show 
 that the apostles were primarily concerned in it. Note, We are all 
 concerned to take to ourselves what Christ in his word designs for us, 
 and to enquire accordingly concerning it: <I>Speakest thou this to 
 us?</I> To me? Speak, Lord, for thy servant hears. Doth this word 
 belong to me? Speak it to <I>my heart.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's reply to this question, directed to Peter and the rest of 
 the disciples. If what Christ had said before did not so peculiarly 
 concern them, but in common with other Christians, who must all watch 
 and pray for Christ's coming, <I>as his servants,</I> yet this that 
 follows is peculiarly adapted to ministers, who are the <I>stewards</I> 
 in Christ's house. Now our Lord Jesus here tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was their <I>duty as stewards,</I> and what the <I>trust</I> 
 committed to them. 

 (1.) They are made <I>rulers of God's household,</I> under Christ, 
 whose own the house is; ministers derive an authority from Christ to 
 preach the gospel, and to administer the ordinances of Christ, and 
 apply the seals of the covenant of grace. 

 (2.) Their business is to give God's children and servants <I>their 
 portion of meat,</I> that which is proper for them and allotted to 
 them; convictions and comfort to those to whom they respectively 
 belong. <I>Suum cuique</I>--<I>to every one his own.</I> This is
 <I>rightly to divide the word of truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:15">2 Tim. ii. 15</A>.

 (3.) To give it to them <I>in due season,</I> at that time and in that
 way which are most suitable to the temper and condition of those that 
 are to be fed; a word <I>in season</I> to him <I>that is weary.</I> 
 
 (4.) Herein they must approve themselves <I>faithful</I> and <I>wise; 
 faithful</I> to their Master, by whom this great trust is reposed in 
 them, and faithful to their fellow-servants, for whose benefit they are 
 put in trust; and <I>wise</I> to improve an opportunity of doing honour 
 to their Master, and service in the family. Ministers must be both
 <I>skilful</I> and <I>faithful.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What would be their happiness if they approved themselves faithful 
 and wise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>Blessed is that servant,</I> 

 (1.) That is <I>doing,</I> and is not idle, nor indulgent of his ease; 
 even the rulers of the household must be <I>doing,</I> and make 
 themselves <I>servants of all.</I> 

 (2.) That is <I>so</I> doing, doing as he should be, giving them their 
 <I>portion of meat,</I> by public preaching and personal application. 
 
 (3.) That is <I>found</I> so doing when his Lord comes; that perseveres 
 to the end, notwithstanding the difficulties he may meet with in the 
 way. Now his happiness is illustrated by the preferment of a steward 
 that has approved himself within a lower and narrower degree of 
 service; he shall be preferred to a larger and higher 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):

 <I>He will make him ruler over all that he has,</I> which was Joseph's 
 preferment in Pharaoh's court. Note, Ministers that obtain mercy of the 
 Lord to be faithful shall obtain further mercy to be abundantly 
 rewarded for their faithfulness in the day of the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What a dreadful reckoning there would be if they were treacherous 
 and unfaithful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:45,46"><I>v.</I> 45, 46</A>.

 If that servant begin to be quarrelsome and profane, he shall be called
 to an account, and severely punished. We had all this before in 
 Matthew, and therefore shall here only observe,

 (1.) Our looking upon Christ's second coming as a thing at a distance 
 is the cause of all those irregularities which render the thought of it 
 terrible to us: <I>He saith in his heart, My Lord delays his 
 coming.</I> Christ's patience is very often misinterpreted his 
 <I>delay,</I> to the <I>dis</I>couragement of his people, and the 
 <I>en</I>couragement of his enemies. 

 (2.) The persecutors of God's people are commonly abandoned to security 
 and sensuality; <I>they beat their fellow-servants,</I> and then <I>eat 
 and drink with the drunken,</I> altogether unconcerned either at their 
 own sin or their brethren's sufferings, as the king and Haman, who 
 <I>sat down to drink when the city Shushan was perplexed.</I> Thus they 
 drink, to drown the clamours of their own consciences, and baffle them, 
 which would otherwise fly in their faces. 

 (3.) Death and judgment will be very terrible to all wicked people, but 
 especially to wicked ministers. It will be a surprise to them: <I>At an 
 hour when they are not aware.</I> It will be the determining of them to 
 endless misery; they shall be cut in sunder, and have their portion 
 assigned them with <I>the unbelievers.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. What an aggravation it would be of their sin and punishment that 
 they knew their duty, and did not do it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:47,48"><I>v.</I> 47, 48</A>):

 <I>That servant that knew his lord's will, and did it not, shall be 
 beaten with many stripes,</I> shall fall under a sorer punishment; and 
 <I>he that knew not shall be beaten with few stripes,</I> his 
 punishment shall, in consideration of this, be mitigated. Here seems to 
 be an allusion to the law, which made a distinction between sins 
 committed through ignorance, and presumptuous sins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+5:15,Nu+15:29,30">Lev. v. 15, &c.; 
 Num. xv. 29, 30</A>),

 as also to another law concerning the number of stripes given to a
 malefactor, to be according to the nature of the crime, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:2,3">Deut. xxv. 2, 3</A>.
 
 Now,

 (1.) Ignorance of our duty is an extenuation of sin. He <I>that knew 
 not his lord's will,</I> through carelessness and neglect, and his not 
 having such opportunities as some others had of coming to the knowledge 
 of it, and <I>did things worthy of stripes,</I> he shall <I>be 
 beaten,</I> because he might have known his duty better, but <I>with 
 few stripes;</I> his ignorance excuses in part, but not wholly. Thus
 <I>through ignorance</I> the Jews put Christ to death 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:17,1Co+2:8">Acts iii. 17; 1 Cor. ii. 8</A>),

 and Christ pleaded that ignorance in their excuse: <I>They know not 
 what they do.</I> 

 (2.) The knowledge of our duty is an aggravation of our sin: <I>That 
 servant that knew his lord's will,</I> and yet did his own will, shall 
 be <I>beaten with many stripes.</I> God will justly inflict more upon 
 him for abusing the means of knowledge he afforded him, which others 
 would have made a better use of, because it argues a great degree of 
 wilfulness and contempt to sin against knowledge; of how much sorer 
 punishment then shall they be thought worthy, besides the many stripes 
 that their own consciences will give them! Son, remember. Here is a 
 good reason for this added: <I>To whomsoever much is given, of him 
 shall be much required,</I> especially when it is <I>committed</I> as a 
 trust he is to account for. Those have greater capacities of mind than 
 others, more knowledge and learning, more acquaintance and converse 
 with the scriptures, to them <I>much is given,</I> and their account 
 will be accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A further discourse concerning his own sufferings, which he 
 expected, and concerning the sufferings of his followers, which he 
 would have them also to live in expectation of. In general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):
 
 <I>I am come to send fire on the earth.</I> By this some understand the 
 preaching of the gospel, and the pouring out of the Spirit, holy fire; 
 this Christ came to send with a commission to refine the world, to 
 purge away its dross, to burn up its chaff, and it was <I>already 
 kindled.</I> The gospel was begun to be preached; some prefaces there 
 were to the pouring out of the Spirit. Christ baptized with the Holy 
 Ghost and with fire; this Spirit descended in fiery tongues. But, by 
 what follows, it seems rather to be understood of the fire of 
 <I>persecution.</I> Christ is not the Author of it, as it is the sin of 
 the incendiaries, the <I>persecutors;</I> but he <I>permits</I> it, 
 nay, he <I>commissions</I> it, as a <I>refining</I> fire for the 
 <I>trial</I> of the <I>persecuted.</I> This fire was <I>already 
 kindled</I> in the enmity of the carnal Jews to Christ and his 
 followers. "<I>What will I that it may presently be kindled? What thou 
 doest, do quickly. If it be already kindled, what will I?</I> Shall I 
 wait the <I>quenching</I> of it? No, for it must fasten upon myself, 
 and upon all, and glory will redound to God from it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He must himself suffer many things; he must pass through this fire 
 that was already kindled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>):

 <I>I have a baptism to be baptized with.</I> Afflictions are compared 
 both to <I>fire</I> and <I>water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:12,69:1,2">Ps. lxvi. 12; lxix. 1, 2</A>.

 Christ's sufferings were both. He calls them a <I>baptism</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:22">Matt. xx. 22</A>);

 for he was watered or sprinkled with them, as Israel was baptized <I>in 
 the cloud,</I> and dipped into them, as Israel was baptized <I>in the 
 sea,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:2">1 Cor. x. 2</A>.

 He must be sprinkled with his own blood, and with the blood of his 
 enemies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:3">Isa. lxiii. 3</A>.

 See here,

 (1.) Christ's <I>foresight</I> of his sufferings; he knew what he was
 to undergo, and the necessity of undergoing it: <I>I am to be baptized 
 with a baptism.</I> He calls his sufferings by a name that 
 <I>mitigates</I> them; it is a baptism, not a deluge; I must be 
 <I>dipped</I> in them, not <I>drowned</I> in them; and by a name that 
 <I>sanctifies</I> them, for baptism is a name that <I>sanctifies</I> 
 them, for baptism is a sacred rite. Christ in his sufferings 
 <I>devoted</I> himself to his Father's honour, and <I>consecrated</I> 
 himself a priest for evermore, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:27,28">Heb. vii. 27, 28</A>.

 (2.) Christ's <I>forwardness</I> to his sufferings: <I>How am I 
 straitened till it be accomplished!</I> He longed for the time when he 
 should suffer and die, having an eye to the glorious issue of his 
 sufferings. It is an allusion to a woman in travail, that is <I>pained
 to be delivered,</I> and welcomes her pains, because they hasten the 
 birth of the child, and wishes them sharp and strong, that the 
 <I>work</I> may be <I>cut short.</I> Christ's sufferings were the 
 <I>travail of his soul,</I> which he cheerfully underwent, in hope that 
 he should by them <I>see his seed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10,11">Isa. liii. 10, 11</A>.

 So much was his heart set upon the redemption and salvation of man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He tells those about him that they also must bear with hardships and 
 difficulties 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>):

 "<I>Suppose ye that I came to give peace on earth,</I> to give you a 
 peaceable possession of the earth, and outward prosperity on the 
 earth?" It is intimated that they were ready to entertain such a 
 thought as this, nay, that they went upon this supposition, that the 
 gospel would meet with a <I>universal</I> welcome, that people 
 <I>unanimously</I> embrace it, and would therefore study to make the 
 preachers of it <I>easy</I> and <I>great,</I> that Christ, if he did 
 not give them <I>pomp</I> and <I>power,</I> would at least give them 
 <I>peace;</I> and herein they were encouraged by divers passages of the 
 Old Testament, which speak of the peace of the Messiah's kingdom, which 
 they were willing to understand of external peace. "But," saith Christ, 
 "you will be mistaken, the event will declare the contrary, and 
 therefore do not flatter yourselves into a fool's paradise. You will 
 find,"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) "That the effect of the preaching of the gospel will be 
 <I>division.</I>" Not but that the design of the gospel and its proper 
 tendency are to unite the children of men to one another, to knit them 
 together in holy love, and, if all would receive it, this would be the 
 effect of it; but there being multitudes that not only will not receive 
 it, but oppose it, and have their corruptions exasperated by it, and 
 are enraged at those that do receive it, it proves, though not the 
 <I>cause</I> yet the <I>occasion</I> of <I>division.</I> While <I>the 
 strong man armed kept his palace,</I> in the Gentile world, <I>his 
 goods were at peace;</I> all was quiet, for all went one way, the sects 
 of philosophers agreed well enough, so did the worshippers of different 
 deities; but when the gospel was preached, and many were enlightened by 
 it, and turned from the power of Satan to God, then there was a 
 disturbance, <I>a noise and a shaking,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:7">Ezek. xxxvii. 7</A>.

 Some <I>distinguished</I> themselves by embracing the gospel, and
 others were angry that they did so. Yea, and among them that received 
 the gospel there would be different sentiments in minor things, which 
 would occasion <I>division;</I> and Christ permits it for holy ends

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:18">1 Cor. xi. 18</A>),
 
 that Christians may learn and practise mutual forbearance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:1,2">Rom. xiv. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) "That this <I>division</I> will reach into private families, and 
 the preaching of the gospel will give occasion for discord among the 
 nearest relations" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>):

 <I>The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the 
 father,</I> when the one turns Christian and the other does not; for 
 the one that does turn Christian will be zealous by arguments and 
 endearments to turn the other too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:16">1 Cor. vii. 16</A>.

 As soon as ever Paul was converted, he <I>disputed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:29">Acts ix. 29</A>.

 The one that continues in unbelief will be provoked, and will hate and
 persecute the one that by his faith and obedience witnesses against, 
 and condemns, his unbelief and disobedience. A spirit of bigotry and 
 persecution will break through the strongest bonds of relation and 
 natural affection; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:35,24:7">Matt. x. 35; xxiv. 7</A>.

 Even <I>mothers</I> and <I>daughters</I> fall out about religion; and
 those that believe not are so violent and outrageous that they are 
 ready to deliver up into the hands of the bloody persecutors those that 
 believe, though otherwise very near and dear to them. We find in the 
 <I>Acts</I> that, wherever the gospel came, <I>persecution</I> was 
 <I>stirred up;</I> it was <I>every where spoken against,</I> and there 
 was <I>no small stir about that way.</I> Therefore let not the 
 disciples of Christ promise themselves <I>peace upon earth,</I> for 
 they are sent forth <I>as sheep in the midst of wolves.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>54  And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having given his disciples <I>their</I> lesson in the foregoing verses, 
 here Christ turns to <I>the people,</I> and gives them <I>theirs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>.

 He <I>said also to the people:</I> he preached <I>ad populum--to the
 people,</I> as well as <I>ad clerum--to the clergy.</I> In general, he 
 would have them be as wise in the affairs of their souls as they are in 
 their outward affairs. Two things he specifies:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let them learn to <I>discern the way of God towards them,</I> that 
 they may <I>prepare</I> accordingly. They were <I>weather-wise,</I> and 
 by observing the winds and clouds could foresee when there would be 
 <I>rain</I> and when there would be <I>hot weather</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:54,55"><I>v.</I> 54, 55</A>);
 
 and, according as they foresaw the weather would be, they either housed 
 their hay and corn, or threw it abroad, and equipped themselves for a 
 journey? Even in regard to changes of the weather God gives warning to 
 us what is coming, and art has improved the notices of nature in 
 weather-glasses. The prognostications here referred to had their origin 
 in repeated observations upon the chain of causes: from what <I>has 
 been</I> we conjecture what <I>will be.</I> See the benefit of 
 experience; by <I>taking notice</I> we may come to <I>give notice.</I> 
 Whose is wise will <I>observe</I> and <I>learn.</I> See now.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The particulars of the presages: "<I>When you see a cloud arising 
 out of the west</I>" (the Hebrew would say, <I>out of the sea</I>), 
 "perhaps it is at first <I>no bigger than a man's hand</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:44">1 Kings xviii. 44</A>),

 but you say, There is a shower in the womb of it, and it proves so. 
 When you <I>observe</I> the <I>south wind blow,</I> you say, <I>There 
 will be heat</I>" (for the hot countries of Africa lay not far south 
 from Judea), "and it usually <I>comes to pass;</I>" yet nature has not 
 ties itself to such a track but that <I>sometimes</I> we are mistaken 
 in our prognostics.</P>

 2. The inferences from them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>):

 "<I>Ye hypocrites,</I> who pretend to be wise, but really are not so, 
 who pretend to expect the Messiah and his kingdom" (for so the 
 generality of the Jews did) "and yet are no way disposed to receive and 
 entertain it, <I>how is it that you do not discern this time,</I> that 
 you do not discern that now is the time, according to the indications 
 given in the Old-Testament prophecies, for the Messiah to appear, and 
 that, according to the marks given of him, I am he? Why are you not
 aware that you have now an opportunity which you <I>will not have 
 long,</I> and which you <I>may never have again,</I> of securing to 
 yourselves an interest in the kingdom of God and the privileges of that 
 kingdom?" <I>Now is the accepted time,</I> now or never. It is the 
 folly and misery of man that he <I>knows not his time,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:12">Eccl. ix. 12</A>.
 
 This was the ruin of the men of that generation, that they <I>knew not
 the day of their visitation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:44"><I>ch.</I> xix. 44</A>.

 But a <I>wise man's heart discerns time and judgment;</I> such was the
 wisdom of the men of Issachar, who <I>had understanding of the 
 times,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:32">1 Chron. xii. 32</A>.

 He adds, "<I>Yea, and why even of yourselves,</I> though ye had not
 these loud alarms given you, <I>judge ye not what is right?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>.

 You are not only stupid and regardless in matters that are purely of
 divine revelation, and take not the hints which that gives you, but you 
 are so even in the dictates of the very light and law of nature." 
 Christianity has reason and natural conscience on its side; and, if men 
 would allow themselves the liberty of <I>judging what is right,</I> 
 they would soon find that all Christ's precepts concerning all things 
 are right, and that there is nothing more equitable in itself, nor 
 better becoming us, than to submit to them and be ruled by them.</P>

 II. Let them hasten to <I>make their peace with God</I> in time, before 
 it be too late, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:58,59"><I>v.</I> 58, 59</A>.

 This we had upon another occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:25,26">Matt. v. 25, 26</A>.

 1. We reckon it our wisdom in our temporal affairs to <I>compound</I>
 with those with whom we cannot <I>contend,</I> to <I>agree with our 
 adversary</I> upon the best terms we can, before the equity be 
 <I>foreclosed,</I> and we be left to the rigour of the law: "<I>When 
 thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate,</I> to whom the 
 appeal is made, and knowest that he has an advantage against thee, and 
 thou art in danger of being cast, thou knowest it is the most prudent 
 course to make the matter up between yourselves; <I>as thou art in the 
 way, give diligence to be delivered from him,</I> to get a discharge, 
 lest judgment be given, and execution awarded according to law." Wise 
 men will not let their quarrels go to an extremity, but accommodate 
 them in time. 

 2. Let us do thus in the affairs of our souls. We have by sin made God
 our <I>adversary,</I> have provoked his displeasure against us, and he 
 has both <I>right</I> and <I>might</I> on his side; so that it is to no 
 purpose to think of carrying on the controversy with him either at 
 <I>bar</I> or in <I>battle.</I> Christ, to whom all judgment is 
 committed, is the magistrate before whom we are hastening to appear: if 
 we stand a trial before him, and insist upon our own justification, the 
 cause will certainly go against us, the <I>Judge</I> will 
 <I>deliver</I> us to the <I>officer,</I> the ministers of his justice, 
 and we shall be <I>cast into</I> the <I>prison</I> of hell, and the 
 debt will be exacted to the utmost; though we cannot make a full 
 satisfaction for it, it will be continually demanded, <I>till the last 
 mite be paid,</I> which will not be to all eternity. Christ's 
 sufferings were short, yet the <I>value</I> of them made them fully 
 satisfactory. In the sufferings of damned sinners what is wanting in 
 value must be made up in an endless duration. Now, in consideration of 
 this, let us give diligence to be delivered <I>out of</I> the hands of 
 God as an adversary, into his hands as a Father, and this <I>as we are 
 in the way,</I> which has the chief stress laid upon it here. While we 
 are alive, we are <I>in the way;</I> and <I>now</I> is our <I>time,</I> 
 by repentance and faith through Christ (who is the Mediator as well as 
 the magistrate), to get the quarrel made up, while it may be done, 
 before it be too late. Thus was God in Christ <I>reconciling the world 
 to himself, beseeching us to be reconciled.</I> Let us take hold on the 
 arm of the Lord stretched out in this gracious offer, that we may make 
 peace, and we <I>shall make peace</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4,5">Isa. xxvii. 4, 5</A>),

 for we cannot <I>walk together</I> till we be <I>agreed.</I></P>
