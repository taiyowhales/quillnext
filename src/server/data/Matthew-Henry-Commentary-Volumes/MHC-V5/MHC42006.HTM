 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have Christ's exposition of the moral law, which he 
 came not to destroy, but to fulfil, and to fill up, by his gospel. 

 I. Here is a proof of the lawfulness of works of necessity and mercy
 on the sabbath day, the former in vindication of his disciples' 
 plucking the ears of corn, the latter in vindication of himself healing 
 the withered hand on that day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. His retirement for secret prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:12">ver. 12</A>.

 III. His calling his twelve apostles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.

 IV. His curing the multitudes of those under various diseases who made
 their application to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:17-19">ver. 17-19</A>.

 V. The sermon that he preached to his disciples and the multitude,
 instructing them in their duty both to God and man,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first,
 that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked
 the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing <I>them</I> in <I>their</I> hands.
 &nbsp; 2 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that
 which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?
 &nbsp; 3 And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as
 this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which
 were with him;
 &nbsp; 4 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the
 showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is
 not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?
 &nbsp; 5 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of
 the sabbath.
 &nbsp; 6 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered
 into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right
 hand was withered.
 &nbsp; 7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would
 heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation
 against him.
 &nbsp; 8 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the
 withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he
 arose and stood forth.
 &nbsp; 9 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it
 lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save
 life, or to destroy <I>it?</I>
 &nbsp; 10 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man,
 Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored
 whole as the other.
 &nbsp; 11 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with
 another what they might do to Jesus.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These two passages of story we had both in Matthew and Mark, and they 
 were there laid together 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:1,Mk+2:23,3:1">Matt. xii. 1; Mark ii. 23; iii. 1</A>),

 because, though happening at some distance of time from each other, 
 both were designed to rectify the mistakes of the scribes and Pharisees 
 concerning the sabbath day, on the <I>bodily rest</I> of which they 
 laid greater stress and required greater strictness than the Law-giver 
 intended. Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ justifies his disciples in a <I>work of necessity</I> for 
 themselves on that day, and that was <I>plucking the ears of corn,</I> 
 when they were hungry on that day. This story here has a date, which we 
 had not in the other evangelists; it was <I>on the second sabbath after 
 the first</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 that is, as Dr. Whitby thinks is pretty clear, the <I>first sabbath 
 after the second day of unleavened bread,</I> from which day they 
 reckoned the <I>seven weeks</I> to the feast of pentecost; the first of 
 which they called <B><I>Sabbaton deuteroproton</I></B>, the second 
 <B><I>deuterodeuteron</I></B>, and so on. Blessed be God we need not be 
 critical in this matter. Whether this circumstance be mentioned to 
 intimate that this sabbath was thought to have some peculiar honour 
 upon it, which aggravated the offence of the disciples, or only to 
 intimate that, being the first sabbath after the offering of the first 
 fruits, it was the time of the year when the corn was nearly ripe, is 
 not material. We may observe, 

 1. Christ's disciples ought not to be nice and curious in their diet,
 at any time, especially on sabbath days, but take up with what is 
 easiest got, and be thankful. These disciples <I>plucked the ears of
 corn, and did eat</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 a little served them, and that which had no delicacy in it. 

 2. Many that are themselves guilty of the greatest crimes are forward 
 to censure others for the most innocent and inoffensive actions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 The Pharisees quarrelled with them as doing that which it <I>was not 
 lawful to do on the sabbath days,</I> when it was their own practice to 
 feed deliciously on sabbath days, more than on all other days. 

 3. Jesus Christ will justify his disciples when they are unjustly
 censured, and will own and accept of them in many a thing which men
 tell them <I>it is not lawful for them to do.</I> How well is it for us
 that men are not to be our judges, and that Christ will be our
 Advocate! 

 4. Ceremonial appointments may be dispensed with, in cases of
 necessity; as the appropriating of the showbread to the priests was 
 dispensed with, when David was by Providence brought into such a strait 
 that he must have either that or none,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 And, if God's own appointments might be thus set aside for a greater 
 good, much more may the traditions of men. 

 5. Works of necessity are particularly allowable on the sabbath day;
 but we must take heed that we turn not this liberty into 
 licentiousness, and abuse God's favourable concessions and 
 condescensions to the prejudice of the work of the day. 

 6. Jesus Christ, though he allowed works of necessity on the sabbath
 day, will notwithstanding have us to know and remember that it is his 
 day, and therefore is to be spent in his service and to his honour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</I> In the kingdom of 
 the Redeemer, the sabbath day is to be turned into a <I>Lord's day;</I> 
 the property of it is, in some respects, to be altered, and it is to be 
 observed chiefly in honour of the Redeemer, as it had been before in 
 honour of the Creator, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+16:14,15">Jer. xvi. 14, 15</A>.

 In token of this, it shall not only have a new name, the <I>Lord's 
 day</I> (yet not forgetting the old, for it is a sabbath of rest still) 
 but shall be transferred to a new day, the first day of the week.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He justifies himself in doing <I>works of mercy</I> for others on 
 the sabbath day. Observe in this, 

 1. Christ on the sabbath day <I>entered into the synagogue.</I> Note,
 It is our duty, as we have opportunity, to sanctify sabbaths in
 religious assemblies. On the sabbath there ought to be a <I>holy
 convocation;</I> and our place must not be empty without very good
 reason. 

 2. In the synagogue, on the sabbath day, <I>he taught.</I> Giving and
 receiving instruction from Christ is very proper work for a sabbath
 day, and for a <I>synagogue.</I> Christ took all opportunities to
 teach, not only his disciples, but the multitude. 

 3. Christ's patient was one of his hearers. <I>A man whose right hand
 was withered</I> came to learn from Christ. Whether he had any
 expectation to be healed by him does not appear. But those that would
 be <I>cured</I> by the grace of Christ must be willing to <I>learn</I>
 the doctrine of Christ. 

 4. Among those who were the hearers of Christ's excellent doctrine,
 and the eye-witnesses of his glorious miracles, there were some who 
 came with no other design than to pick quarrels with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The scribes and Pharisees would not, as became <I>generous</I> 
 adversaries, give him fair warning that, if he did <I>heal</I> on the 
 sabbath day, they would construe it into a violation of the fourth 
 commandment, which they ought in honour and justice to have done, 
 because it was a case <I>without precedent</I> (none having ever cured 
 as he did), but they basely <I>watched him,</I> as the lion does his 
 prey, whether he would <I>heal on the sabbath day, that they might find 
 an accusation against him,</I> and surprise him with a prosecution. 

 5. Jesus Christ was neither <I>ashamed</I> nor <I>afraid</I> to own
 the purposes of his grace, in the face of those who, he knew, 
 confronted them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 <I>He knew their faults,</I> and what they designed, and he bade the 
 man <I>rise, and stand forth,</I> hereby to try the patient's faith and 
 boldness. 

 6. He appealed to his adversaries themselves, and to the convictions of
 natural conscience, whether it was the design of the fourth commandment 
 to restrain men from doing good on the sabbath day, that good which 
 their hand finds to do, which they have an opportunity for, and which 
 cannot so well be put off to another time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Is it lawful to do good, or evil, on the sabbath days?</I> No wicked 
 men are such <I>absurd</I> and <I>unreasonable</I> men as 
 <I>persecutors</I> are, who study to <I>do evil</I> to men for <I>doing 
 good.</I> 

 7. He healed the poor man, and restored him to the present use of his
 right hand, with a word's speaking, though he knew that his enemies 
 would not only take offence at it, but take advantage against him for 
 it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Let not us be drawn off, either from our duty or usefulness, by the
 oppression we meet with in it. 

 8. His adversaries were hereby enraged so much the more against him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Instead of being convinced by this miracle, as they ought to have been, 
 that he was a teacher come from God,--instead of being brought to be in 
 love with him as a benefactor to mankind,--they were <I>filled with 
 madness,</I> vexed that they could not frighten him from doing good, or 
 hinder the growth of his interest in the affections of the people. They 
 were <I>mad</I> at Christ, <I>mad</I> at the people, <I>mad</I> at 
 themselves. Anger is a <I>short madness,</I> malice is a <I>long</I> 
 one; <I>impotent</I> malice, especially <I>disappointed</I> malice; 
 such was theirs. When they could not prevent his working this miracle, 
 they <I>communed one with another what they might do to Jesus,</I> what 
 other way they might take to run him down. We may well stand amazed at 
 it that the sons of men should be so wicked as to do thus, and that the 
 Son of God should be so patient as to suffer it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a
 mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
 &nbsp; 13 And when it was day, he called <I>unto him</I> his disciples: and
 of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;
 &nbsp; 14 Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother,
 James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
 &nbsp; 15 Matthew and Thomas, James the <I>son</I> of Alph&aelig;us, and Simon
 called Zelotes,
 &nbsp; 16 And Judas <I>the brother</I> of James, and Judas Iscariot, which
 also was the traitor.
 &nbsp; 17 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the
 company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of
 all Jud&aelig;a and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and
 Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their
 diseases;
 &nbsp; 18 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were
 healed.
 &nbsp; 19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went
 virtue out of him, and healed <I>them</I> all.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses, we have our Lord Jesus in <I>secret,</I> in <I>his 
 family,</I> and in <I>public;</I> and in all three acting like 
 himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In <I>secret</I> we have him <I>praying to God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This evangelist takes frequent notice of Christ's retirements, to give 
 us an example of secret prayer, by which we must keep up our communion 
 with God daily, and without which it is impossible that the soul should 
 prosper. <I>In those days,</I> when his enemies were filled with 
 madness against him, and were contriving what to do to him, he went out 
 to <I>pray;</I> that he might answer the type of David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:4">Ps. cix. 4</A>),
 
 <I>For my love, they are my adversaries; but I give myself unto 
 prayer.</I> Observe, 

 1. He was <I>alone</I> with God; he <I>went out into a mountain, to
 pray,</I> where he might have no disturbance or interruption given him;
 we are never less alone than when we are <I>thus</I> alone. Whether
 there was any convenient place built upon this mountain, for devout
 people to retire to for their private devotions, as some think, and
 that that <I>oratory,</I> or <I>place of prayer,</I> is meant here by
 <B><I>he proseuche tou theou</I></B>, to me seems very uncertain. He
 went into a mountain for privacy, and therefore, probably, would not go
 to a place frequented by others. 

 2. He was <I>long</I> alone with God: <I>He continued all night in
 prayer.</I> We think one half hour a great deal to spend in the 
 <I>duties of the closet;</I> but Christ continued a <I>whole night</I> 
 in meditation and secret prayer. We have a great deal of 
 <I>business</I> at the throne of grace, and we should take a great 
 <I>delight</I> in communion with God, and by both these we may be kept 
 sometimes long at prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In his <I>family</I> we have him nominating his immediate 
 attendants, that should be the constant auditors of his doctrine and 
 eye-witnesses of his miracles, that hereafter they might be sent forth 
 as <I>apostles,</I> his <I>messengers</I> to the world, to preach his 
 gospel to it, and plant his church in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 After he had <I>continued all night in prayer,</I> one would have 
 thought that, <I>when it was day,</I> he should have reposed himself, 
 and got some sleep. No, as soon as any body was stirring, he <I>called 
 unto him his disciples.</I> In serving God, our great care should be, 
 not to <I>lose time,</I> but to make the end of one good duty the 
 beginning of another. Ministers are to be ordained with <I>prayer</I> 
 more than ordinarily <I>solemn.</I> The number of the apostles was 
 <I>twelve.</I> Their names are here recorded; it is the <I>third 
 time</I> that we have met with them, and in each of the <I>three</I> 
 places the <I>order</I> of them differs, to teach both ministers and 
 Christians not to be nice in precedency, not in <I>giving</I> it, much 
 less in <I>taking</I> it, but to look upon it as a thing not worth 
 taking notice of; let it be as it lights. He that in Mark was called 
 <I>Thaddeus,</I> in Matthew <I>Lebbeus,</I> whose surname was 
 <I>Thaddeus,</I> is here called <I>Judas the brother of James,</I> the 
 same that wrote the epistle of Jude. Simon, who in Matthew and Mark was 
 called the <I>Canaanite,</I> is here called <I>Simon Zelotes,</I> 
 perhaps for his great zeal in religion. Concerning these twelve here
 named we have reason to say, as the queen of Sheba did of Solomon's 
 servants, <I>Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, that 
 stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom;</I> never were men 
 so privileged, and yet one of them had a devil, and proved a traitor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 yet Christ, when he chose him, was not deceived in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In <I>public</I> we have him <I>preaching</I> and <I>healing,</I> 
 the two great works between which he divided his time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He came down with the twelve from the mountain, and <I>stood in the 
 plain,</I> ready to receive those that resorted to him; and there were 
 presently gathered about him, not only the <I>company of his 
 disciples,</I> who used to attend him, but also a great <I>multitude of 
 people,</I> a mixed multitude <I>out of all Judea and Jerusalem.</I> 
 Though it was some scores of miles from Jerusalem to that part of 
 Galilee where Christ now was,--though at Jerusalem they had abundance 
 of famous rabbin, that had great names, and bore a mighty sway,--yet 
 they came to hear Christ. They came also from the <I>sea-coast of Tyre 
 and Sidon.</I> Though they who lived there were generally men of 
 business, and though they bordered upon Canaanites, yet there were some 
 well affected to Christ; such there were dispersed in all parts, here 
 and there one. 

 1. They <I>came to hear him</I> and he <I>preached</I> to them. Those
 that have not good preaching near them had better travel far for it
 than be without it. It is worth while to go a great way to hear the
 word of Christ, and to go out of the way of other business for it. 

 2. They came to be <I>cured</I> by him, and he <I>healed</I> them.
 Some were troubled <I>in body,</I> and some <I>in mind;</I> some had 
 <I>diseases,</I> some had <I>devils;</I> but both the one and the 
 other, upon their application to Christ, were <I>healed,</I> for he has 
 power over <I>diseases</I> and <I>devils</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>),

 over the effects and over the causes. Nay, it should seem, those who 
 had no <I>particular diseases</I> to complain of yet found it a great 
 confirmation and renovation to their bodily <I>health</I> and 
 <I>vigour</I> to partake of the <I>virtue that went out of him;</I> for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 <I>the whole multitude sought to touch him,</I> those that were in 
 health as well as those that were sick, and they were all, one way or 
 other, the better for him: he <I>healed them all;</I> and who is there 
 that doth not need, upon some account or other, to be <I>healed?</I> 
 There is a <I>fulness of grace</I> in Christ, and healing virtue in 
 him, and ready to go out from him, that is enough for all, enough for 
 each.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here begins a practical discourse of Christ, which is continued to the
 end of the chapter, most of which is found in the <I>sermon upon the
 mount,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:1-7:29">Matt. v. and vii.</A>.

 Some think that this was preached at some other time and place, and
 there are other instances of Christ's preaching the same things, or to 
 the same purport, at different times; but it is probable that this is 
 only the evangelist's abridgment of that sermon, and perhaps that in 
 Matthew too is but an abridgment; the beginning and the conclusion are 
 much the same; and the story of the cure of the centurion's servant 
 follows presently upon it, both there and here, but it is not material. 
 In these verses, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Blessings pronounced upon <I>suffering saints,</I> as <I>happy</I> 
 people, though the world <I>pities them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 He <I>lifted up his eyes upon his disciples,</I> not only the 
 <I>twelve,</I> but the whole <I>company of them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 and directed his discourse to them; for, when he had healed the sick in 
 <I>the plain,</I> he went up again <I>to the mountain,</I> to preach.
 There he <I>sat,</I> as one having authority; thither <I>they come to 
 him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:1">Matt. v. 1</A>),

 and to them he directed his discourse, to them he applied it, and 
 taught them to apply it to themselves. When he had laid it down for a 
 truth, <I>Blessed are the poor in spirit,</I> he added, <I>Blessed are 
 ye poor.</I> All believers, that take the precepts of the gospel to 
 themselves, and <I>live by them</I> may take the promises of the gospel 
 to themselves and <I>live upon them.</I> And the application, as it is 
 here, seems especially designed to encourage the disciples, with 
 reference to the hardships and difficulties they were likely to meet 
 with, in following Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. "You are <I>poor,</I> you have <I>left all to follow me,</I> are 
 content to live upon alms with me, are never to expect any worldly 
 preferment in my service. You must work hard, and fare hard, as poor 
 people do; but you are blessed in your poverty, it shall be no 
 prejudice at all to your happiness; nay, you are blessed <I>for</I> it, 
 all your losses shall be abundantly made up to you, for <I>yours is the 
 kingdom of God,</I> all the comforts and graces of his kingdom here and 
 all the glories and joys of his kingdom hereafter; yours it <I>shall 
 be,</I> nay, yours <I>it is.</I>" Christ's <I>poor</I> are <I>rich in 
 faith,</I>

 2. "You <I>hunger now</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 you are not <I>fed to the full</I> as others are, you often rise 
 hungry, your <I>commons</I> are so <I>short;</I> or you are so intent 
 upon your work that you have not time to eat bread, you are glad of a 
 few <I>ears of corn</I> for a meal's meat; thus you hunger now in this 
 world, but in the other world <I>you shall be filled,</I> shall 
 <I>hunger no more,</I> nor <I>thirst any more.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. "You <I>weep now,</I> are often in tears, tears of repentance, tears 
 of sympathy; you are of them that mourn in Zion. But <I>blessed are 
 you;</I> your present sorrows are no <I>prejudices</I> to your future 
 joy, but <I>preparatories</I> for it: <I>You shall laugh.</I> You have 
 triumphs in reserve; you are but <I>sowing in tears,</I> and shall 
 shortly <I>reap in joy,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:5,6">Ps. cxxvi. 5, 6</A>.

 They that now <I>sorrow after a godly sort</I> are treasuring up
 comforts for themselves, or, rather, God is treasuring up comforts for 
 them; and the day is coming when their <I>mouth shall be filled with 
 laughing and their lips with rejoicing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:21">Job viii. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. "You now undergo <I>the world's ill will.</I> You must expect all 
 the base treatment that a spiteful world can give you for Christ's 
 sake, because you serve him and his interests; you must expect that 
 wicked men will <I>hate you,</I> because your doctrine and life convict 
 and condemn them; and those that have church-power in their hands will 
 <I>separate you,</I> will force you to separate yourselves, and then 
 excommunicate you for so doing, and lay you under the most ignominious 
 censures. They will pronounce anathemas against you, as scandalous and 
 incorrigible offenders. They will do this with all possible gravity and 
 solemnity, and pomp and pageantry of appeals to Heaven, to make the 
 world believe, and almost you yourselves too, that it is ratified in 
 heaven. Thus will they endeavour to make you odious to others and a 
 terror to yourselves." This is supposed to be the proper notion of 
 <B><I>aphorisosin hymas</I></B>--<I>they shall cast you out of their
 synagogues.</I> "And they that have not this power will not fail to 
 show their malice, to the utmost of their power; for <I>they will 
 reproach you,</I> will charge you with the blackest crimes, which you 
 are perfectly innocent of, will fasten upon you the blackest 
 characters, which you do not deserve; they will <I>cast out your name 
 as evil,</I> your name as Christians, as apostles; they will do all 
 they can to render these names odious." This is the application of the 
 eighth beatitude, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:10-12">Matt. v. 10-12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 "Such usage as this seems hard; but <I>blessed are you</I> when you are 
 so used. It is so far from depriving you of your happiness that it will 
 greatly add to it. It is an honour to you, as it is to a brave hero to 
 be employed in the wars, in the service of his prince; and therefore 
 <I>rejoice you in that day, and leap for joy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Do not only <I>bear it,</I> but <I>triumph</I> in it. For,"

 (1.) "You are hereby <I>highly dignified</I> in the <I>kingdom of 
 grace,</I> for you are treated as the prophets were before you, and 
 therefore not only need not be ashamed of it, but may justly rejoice in 
 it, for it will be an evidence for you that you <I>walk in the same 
 spirit,</I> and <I>in the same steps,</I> are engaged in the same 
 cause, and employed in the same service, with them." 

 (2.) "You will for this be abundantly <I>recompensed</I> in the 
 <I>kingdom of glory;</I> not only your services for Christ, but your 
 sufferings will come into the account: <I>Your reward is great in 
 heaven.</I> Venture upon your sufferings, in a full belief that the 
 glory of heaven will abundantly countervail all these hardships; so 
 that, though you may be losers for Christ, you shall not be losers by 
 him in the end."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>Woes</I> denounced against <I>prospering sinners as miserable 
 people,</I> though the world <I>envies them.</I> These we had not in 
 Matthew. It should seem, the best exposition of <I>these woes,</I> 
 compared with the foregoing <I>blessings,</I> is the parable of the 
 <I>rich man</I> and Lazarus. Lazarus had the blessedness of those that 
 are <I>poor,</I> and <I>hunger,</I> and <I>weep,</I> now, for in 
 Abraham's bosom all the promises made to them who did so were <I>made 
 good</I> to him; but the rich man had the <I>woes</I> that follow here, 
 as he had the character of those on whom these woes are entailed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is a <I>woe</I> to them that are <I>rich,</I> that is, that 
 <I>trust in riches,</I> that have abundance of this world's wealth, 
 and, instead of serving God with it, serve their lusts with it; woe to 
 them, for <I>they have received their consolation,</I> that which they 
 placed their happiness in, and were willing to take up with for a 
 portion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 They in their life-time received <I>their good things,</I> which, in 
 their account, were the <I>best things,</I> and all the good things 
 they are ever likely to receive from God. "You that are <I>rich</I> are 
 in temptation to <I>set your hearts</I> upon a <I>smiling</I> world, 
 and to say, <I>Soul, take thine ease</I> in the embraces of it, <I>This 
 is my rest for ever, here will I dwell;</I> and <I>then woe unto 
 you.</I>"

 (1.) It is the <I>folly</I> of carnal worldlings that they make the 
 things of this world <I>their consolation,</I> which were intended only 
 for their <I>convenience.</I> They please themselves with them, pride 
 themselves in them, and make them their heaven upon earth; and to them 
 the <I>consolations of God</I> are small, and of no account. 

 (2.) It is their misery that they are <I>put off</I> with them as 
 <I>their consolation.</I> Let them know it, to their terror, when they 
 are parted from these things, there is an end of all their comfort, a 
 final end of it, and nothing remains to them but everlasting misery and 
 torment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is a <I>woe</I> to them that are <I>full</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 that are <I>fed to the full,</I> and have <I>more than heart could 
 wish</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:7">Ps. lxxiii. 7</A>),

 that have their <I>bellies filled with the hid treasures of this 
 world</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>),

 that, when they have abundance of these, are <I>full,</I> and think 
 they have <I>enough,</I> they <I>need no more,</I> they <I>desire no 
 more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17">Rev. iii. 17</A>.

 <I>Now ye are full, now ye are rich,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:8">1 Cor. iv. 8</A>.

 They are <I>full of themselves,</I> without God and Christ. Woe to
 such, for <I>they shall hunger,</I> they shall shortly be 
 <I>stripped</I> and <I>emptied</I> of all the things they are so proud 
 of; and, when they shall have <I>left behind them</I> in the world all 
 those things which are their fulness, they shall <I>carry away with 
 them</I> such appetites and desires as the world they remove to will 
 afford them no gratifications of; for all the delights of sense, which 
 they are now so full of, will in hell be <I>denied,</I> and in heaven 
 <I>superseded.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here is a <I>woe</I> to them that <I>laugh now,</I> that have always 
 a <I>disposition to be merry,</I> and always something to <I>make merry 
 with;</I> that know no other joy than that which is carnal and sensual, 
 and know no other use of this world's good than purely to indulge that 
 carnal sensual joy that banishes sorrow, even godly sorrow, from their 
 minds, and are always entertaining themselves with the laughter of the 
 fool. <I>Woe unto such,</I> for it is but <I>now,</I> for a little 
 time, that they <I>laugh;</I> they shall <I>mourn and weep</I> shortly, 
 shall <I>mourn and weep</I> eternally, in a world where there is 
 nothing but <I>weeping and wailing,</I> endless, easeless, and 
 remediless sorrow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Here is a <I>woe</I> to them <I>whom all men speak well of,</I> that 
 is, who make it their great and only care to gain the praise and 
 applause of men, who value themselves upon that more than upon the 
 favour of God and his acceptance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>Woe unto you;</I> that is, it would be a bad sign that you were not 
 faithful to your trust, and to the souls of men, if you preached so as 
 that nobody would be disgusted; for your business is to tell people of 
 their faults, and, if you do that as you ought, you will get that 
 <I>ill will</I> which never <I>speaks well.</I> The false prophets 
 indeed, that flattered your father in their wicked ways, that 
 <I>prophesied smooth things</I> to them, were caressed and spoken well 
 of; and, if you be in like manner cried up, you will be justly 
 suspected to deal deceitfully as they did." We should desire to have 
 the approbation of those that are wise and good, and not be indifferent 
 to what people say of us; but, as we should despise the reproaches, so 
 we should also despise the praises, of the fools in Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses agree with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:38">Matt. v. 38</A>,

 to the end of that chapter: <I>I say unto you that hear</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 to all you that hear, and not to disciples only, for these are lessons 
 of universal concern. <I>He that has an ear, let him hear.</I> Those 
 that diligently hearken to Christ shall find he has something to say to 
 them well worth their hearing. Now the lessons Christ here teacheth us
 are,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That we must render to all their due, and be honest and just in all 
 our dealings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them 
 likewise;</I> for this is <I>loving your neighbour as yourselves.</I> 
 What we should expect, in reason, to be done to us, either in justice 
 or charity, by others, if they were in our condition and we in theirs, 
 that, as the matter stands, we must do to them. We must <I>put our 
 souls into their souls' stead,</I> and then pity and succour them, as 
 we should desire and justly expect to be ourselves pitied and 
 succoured.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That we must be free in <I>giving</I> to them that <I>need</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "<I>Give to every man that asketh of thee,</I> to every one that is a 
 proper object of charity, that wants necessaries, which thou hast 
 wherewithal to supply out of thy superfluities. Give to those that are 
 not able to help themselves, to those that have not relations in a 
 capacity to help them." Christ would have his disciples ready to 
 distribute, and willing to communicate, <I>to their power</I> in 
 ordinary cases, and beyond their power in extraordinary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That we must be generous in <I>forgiving</I> those that have been 
 any way injurious to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must not be <I>extreme</I> in <I>demanding</I> our right, when it 
 is denied us: "<I>Him that taketh away thy cloak,</I> either forcibly 
 or fraudulently, <I>forbid him not</I> by any violent means to <I>take 
 thy coat also,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Let him have that too, rather than fight for it. And

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 <I>of him that taketh thy goods</I>" (so Dr. Hammond thinks it should
 be read), "that borrows them, or that <I>takes them up</I> from thee 
 upon trust, of such do not <I>exact them;</I> if Providence have made 
 such insolvent, do not take the advantage of the law against them, but 
 rather lose it than <I>take them by the throat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:28">Matt. xviii. 28</A>.

 If a man run away in thy debt, and <I>take away thy goods</I> with him,
 do not perplex thyself, nor be incensed against him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We must not be rigorous in revenging a wrong when it is done us: 
 "<I>Unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek,</I> instead of 
 bringing an action against him, or sending for a writ for him, or 
 bringing him before a justice, <I>offer also the other;</I>" that is, 
 "pass it by, though thereby thou shouldest be in danger of bringing 
 upon thyself another like in dignity, which is commonly pretended in 
 excuse of taking the advantage of the law in such a case. If any one 
 <I>smite thee on the cheek,</I> rather than give another blow to him, 
 be ready to receive another from him;" that is, "leave it to God to 
 plead thy cause, and do thou sit down silent under the affront." When 
 we do thus, God will <I>smite our enemies,</I> as far as they are his, 
 <I>upon the cheek bone,</I> so as to <I>break the teeth of the 
 ungodly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:7">Ps. iii. 7</A>);

 for he hath said, <I>Vengeance is mine,</I> and he will make it appear 
 that it is so when we leave it to him to take vengeance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Nay, we must <I>do good to them that do evil to us.</I> This is that 
 which our Saviour, in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:27-36">these verses</A>,

 chiefly designs to teach us, as a law peculiar to his religion, and a
 branch of the perfection of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We must be kind to those from whom we have <I>received 
 injuries.</I> We must not only <I>love our enemies,</I> and bear a good 
 will to them, but we must <I>do good</I> to them, be as ready to do any 
 good office to them as to any other person, if their case call for it, 
 and it be in the power of our hands to do it. We must study to make it 
 appear, by positive acts, if there be an opportunity for them, that we 
 bear them no malice, nor see revenge. Do they <I>curse</I> us, speak 
 ill of us, and wish ill to us? Do they <I>despitefully use us,</I> in 
 word or deed? Do they endeavour to make us contemptible or odious? Let 
 us <I>bless them,</I> and <I>pray for them,</I> speak well of them, the 
 best we can, wish well to them, especially to their souls, and be 
 intercessors with God for them. This is repeated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>:

 <I>love your enemies,</I> and <I>do them good.</I> To recommend this 
 difficult duty to us, it is represented as a generous thing, and an 
 attainment few arrive at. <I>To love those that love us</I> has nothing 
 <I>uncommon</I> in it, nothing peculiar to Christ's disciples, for 
 <I>sinners</I> will <I>love those that love them.</I> There is nothing 
 self-denying in that; it is but following nature, even in its corrupt 
 state, and puts no force at all upon it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 it is no thanks to us to love those that say and do just as we would 
 have them. "And 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>)

 <I>if you do good to them that do good to you,</I> and return their 
 kindnesses, it is from a common principle of custom, honour, and 
 gratitude; and therefore <I>what thanks have you?</I> What credit are 
 you to the name of Christ, or what reputation do you bring to it? for 
 <I>sinners also,</I> that know nothing of Christ and his doctrine, 
 <I>do even the same.</I> But it becomes you to do something more 
 excellent and eminent, herein to out-do your neighbours, to do that 
 which sinners will not do, and which no principle of theirs can pretend 
 to reach to: you must <I>render good for evil;</I>" not that any thanks 
 are due to us, but <I>then</I> we are to our God <I>for a name and a 
 praise</I> and he will have the thanks.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We must be kind to those from whom we expect no manner of 
 advantage 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>Lend, hoping for nothing again.</I> It is meant of the rich lending 
 to the poor a little money for their necessity, to buy daily bread for 
 themselves and their families, or to keep them out of prison. In such a 
 case, we must <I>lend,</I> with a resolution not to demand interest for 
 what we lend, as we may most justly from those that borrow money to 
 make purchases withal, or to trade with. But that is not all; we must 
 <I>lend</I> though we have reason to suspect that what we <I>lend</I> 
 we <I>lose,</I> lend to those who are so poor that it is not probable 
 they will be able to pay us again. This precept will be best 
 illustrated by that law of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+15:7-10">Deut. xv. 7-10</A>),

 which obliges them to lend to a <I>poor brother</I> as much as he 
 <I>needed,</I> though the <I>year of release</I> was at hand. Here are 
 two motives to this generous charity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] It will redound to our profit; for our <I>reward shall be 
 great,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 What is given, or laid out, or lent and lost on earth, from a true 
 principle of charity, will be made up to us in the other world, 
 unspeakably to our advantage. "You shall not only be <I>repaid,</I> but 
 <I>rewarded,</I> greatly rewarded; it will be said to you, <I>Come, ye 
 blessed, inherit the kingdom.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It will redound to our honour; for herein we shall resemble God in 
 his goodness, which is the greatest glory: "<I>Ye shall be the children 
 of the Highest,</I> shall be owned by him as his children, being like 
 him." It is the glory of God that he is <I>kind to the unthankful and 
 to the evil,</I> bestows the gifts of common providence even upon the 
 worst of men, who are every day provoking him, and rebelling against 
 him, and using those very gifts to his dishonour. Hence he infers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 <I>Be merciful, as your Father is merciful;</I> this explains 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:48">Matt. v. 48</A>,

 "<I>Be perfect, as our Father is perfect.</I> Imitate your Father in 
 those things that are his brightest perfections." Those that are 
 <I>merciful</I> as God is <I>merciful,</I> even <I>to the evil and the 
 unthankful,</I> are <I>perfect</I> as God is <I>perfect;</I> so he is 
 pleased graciously to accept it, though infinitely falling short.
 Charity is called the <I>bond of perfectness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:14">Col. iii. 14</A>.

 This should strongly engage us to be merciful to our brethren, even
 such as have been injurious to us, not only that God is so to others, 
 but that he is so to us, though we have been, and are, evil and 
 unthankful; it is of his mercies that <I>we</I> are not consumed.</P>

 &nbsp; 39 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the
 blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?
 &nbsp; 40 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is
 perfect shall be as his master.
 &nbsp; 41 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's
 eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
 &nbsp; 42 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me
 pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself
 beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite,
 cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou
 see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.
 &nbsp; 43 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither
 doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
 &nbsp; 44 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men
 do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
 &nbsp; 45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth
 forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil
 treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of
 the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
 &nbsp; 46 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which
 I say?
 &nbsp; 47 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth
 them, I will show you to whom he is like:
 &nbsp; 48 He is like a man which built a house, and digged deep, and
 laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the
 stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it:
 for it was founded upon a rock.
 &nbsp; 49 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that
 without a foundation built a house upon the earth; against which
 the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the
 ruin of that house was great.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All these sayings of Christ we had before in Matthew; some of them in
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:1-29"><I>ch.</I> vii.</A>,

 others in other places. They were sayings that Christ often used; they
 needed only to be mentioned, it was easy to apply them. Grotius thinks
 that we need not be critical here in seeking for the coherence: they 
 are golden sentences, like Solomon's proverbs or parables. Let us 
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We ought to be very candid in our censures of others, because we 
 need grains of allowance ourselves: "Therefore <I>judge not</I> others, 
 because then <I>you</I> yourselves <I>shall not be judged;</I> 
 therefore <I>condemn not</I> others, because then <I>you</I> yourselves 
 <I>shall not be condemned,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Exercise towards others that charity which <I>thinks no evil,</I> which 
 <I>bears all things, believes</I> and <I>hopes all things;</I> and then 
 others will exercise that charity towards you. God will not
 <I>judge</I> and <I>condemn</I> you, men will not." They that are 
 merciful to other people's names shall find others merciful to 
 theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. If we are of a <I>giving</I> and a <I>forgiving</I> spirit, we 
 shall ourselves reap the benefit of it: <I>Forgive and you shall be 
 forgiven.</I> If we forgive the injuries done to us by others, others 
 will forgive our inadvertencies. If we forgive others' trespasses 
 against <I>us,</I> God will forgive our trespasses against <I>him.</I> 
 And he will be no less mindful of the <I>liberal</I> that <I>devise 
 liberal things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>Give, and it shall be given to you.</I> God, in his providence, will 
 recompense it to you; it is <I>lent</I> to him, and <I>he is not 
 unrighteous to forget</I> it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:10">Heb. vi. 10</A>),

 but he will <I>pay it again.</I> <I>Men</I> shall <I>return it into 
 your bosom;</I> for God often makes use of <I>men</I> as instruments, 
 not only of his <I>avenging,</I> but of his <I>rewarding</I> justice. 
 If we in a right manner give to others when they need, God will incline 
 the hearts of others to give to us when we need, and to give liberally, 
 <I>good measure pressed down and shaken together.</I> They that <I>sow 
 plentifully</I> shall <I>reap plentifully.</I> Whom God recompenses he 
 recompenses <I>abundantly.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We must expect to be dealt with ourselves as we deal with others: 
 <I>With the same measure that ye mete it shall be measured to you 
 again.</I> Those that deal <I>hardly</I> with others must acknowledge, 
 as Adoni-bezek did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:7">Judg. i. 7</A>),

 that God is righteous, if others deal hardly with them, and they may 
 expect to be paid in their own coin; but they that deal <I>kindly</I> 
 with others have reason to hope that, when they have occasion, God will 
 raise them up friends who will deal kindly with them. Though
 Providence does not always go by this rule, because the full and exact 
 retributions are reserved for another world, yet, ordinarily, it 
 observes a proportion sufficient to deter us from all acts of rigour 
 and to encourage us in all acts of beneficence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Those who put themselves under the guidance of the ignorant and 
 erroneous are likely to perish with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>Can the blind lead the blind?</I> Can the Pharisees, who are blinded 
 with pride, prejudice, and bigotry, <I>lead the blind</I> people into 
 the right way? <I>Shall not both fall</I> together <I>into the 
 ditch?</I> How can they expect any other? Those that are led by the 
 common opinion, course, and custom, of this world, are themselves 
 blind, and are led by the blind, and will perish with the world that 
 <I>sits in darkness.</I> Those that ignorantly, and at a venture, 
 <I>follow the multitude to do evil,</I> follow the blind in the broad 
 way that leads the many to <I>destruction.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Christ's followers cannot expect better treatment in the world than 
 their Master had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 Let them not promise themselves more honour or pleasure in the world 
 than Christ had, nor aim at the worldly pomp and grandeur which he was 
 never ambitious of, but always declined, nor affect that power in 
 secular things which he would not assume; but every one that would show 
 himself <I>perfect,</I> an established disciple, let him be <I>as his 
 Master</I>--dead to the world, and every thing in it, as his Master is; 
 let him live a life of labour and self-denial as his Master doth, and 
 make himself a servant of all; let him stoop, and let him toil, and do 
 all the good he can, and then he will be a complete disciple.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Those who take upon them to rebuke and reform others are concerned 
 to look to it that they be themselves blameless, and harmless, and 
 without rebuke, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:41,42"><I>v.</I> 41, 42</A>.

 1. Those with a very ill grace censure the faults of others who are not 
 aware of their own faults. It is very absurd for any to pretend to be 
 so quick-sighted as to spy small faults in others, like a mote in the 
 eye, when they are themselves so perfectly past feeling as not to 
 perceive <I>a beam in their own eye.</I> 

 2. Those are altogether unfit to help to reform others whose reforming
 charity does not begin at home. How canst thou offer thy service to thy 
 brother, to <I>pull out the mote from his eye,</I> which requires a 
 good eye as well as a good hand, when thou thyself hast a <I>beam in 
 thine own eye,</I> and makest no complaint of it? 

 3. Those therefore who would be serviceable to the souls of others must
 first make it appear that they are solicitous about their own souls. To 
 help to pull the mote out of our brother's eye is a good work, but then 
 we must qualify ourselves for it by beginning with ourselves; and our 
 reforming our own lives may, by the influence of example, contribute to 
 others reforming theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. We may expect that men's words and actions will be according as 
 <I>they</I> are, according as their hearts are, and according as their 
 principles are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The heart is the <I>tree,</I> and the words and actions are fruit 
 according to the nature of the tree, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:43,44"><I>v.</I> 43, 44</A>.

 If a man be really a <I>good man,</I> if he have a principle of grace 
 in his heart, and the prevailing bent and bias of the soul be towards 
 God and heaven, though perhaps he may not abound in fruit, though some 
 of his fruits be blasted, and though he may be sometimes like a tree in 
 winter, yet he does not <I>bring forth corrupt fruit;</I> though he may 
 not do you all the good he should, yet he will not in any material 
 instance do you hurt. If he cannot reform ill manners, he will not 
 <I>corrupt good manners.</I> If the fruit that a man brings forth be 
 <I>corrupt,</I> if a man's devotion tend to debauch the mind and 
 conversation, if a man's conversation be vicious, if he be a drunkard 
 or fornicator, if he be a swearer or liar, if he be in any instance 
 unjust or unnatural, his <I>fruit</I> is <I>corrupt,</I> and you may be 
 sure that he is not a <I>good tree.</I> On the other hand, a <I>corrupt 
 tree doth not bring forth good fruit,</I> though it may bring forth 
 green leaves; <I>for of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble 
 do they gather grapes.</I> You may, if you please, stick figs upon 
 thorns, and hang a bunch of grapes upon a bramble, but they neither 
 are, nor can be, the natural product of the trees; so neither can you 
 expect any <I>good conduct</I> from those who have justly a <I>bad 
 character.</I> If the fruit be good, you may conclude that the tree is 
 so; if the conversation be holy, heavenly, and regular, though you 
 cannot infallibly know the heart, yet you may charitably hope that it 
 is upright with God; for <I>every tree is known by its fruit.</I> But 
 the <I>vile person will speak villany</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:6">Isa. xxxii. 6</A>),

 and the experience of the moderns herein agrees with the <I>proverb of 
 the ancients,</I> that <I>wickedness proceedeth from the wicked,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:13">1 Sam. xxiv. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The heart is the <I>treasure,</I> and the words and actions are the 
 expenses or produce from that treasure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.
 
 This we had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:34,35">Matt. xii. 34, 35</A>.

 The reigning love of God and Christ in the heart denominates a man <I>a 
 good man;</I> and it is <I>a good treasure</I> a man may bring forth 
 that which is good. But where the love of the world and the flesh reign 
 there is an <I>evil treasure</I> in the heart, out of which an <I>evil 
 man</I> is continually bringing forth <I>that which is evil;</I> and by 
 what is brought forth you may know what is in the heart, as you may 
 know what is in the vessel, water or wine, by what is <I>drawn out from 
 it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:8">John ii. 8</A>.

 <I>Of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks;</I> what the mouth
 ordinarily speaks, speaks with relish and delight, generally agrees 
 with what is innermost and uppermost in the heart: <I>He that speaks of 
 the earth is earthly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:31">John iii. 31</A>.

 Not but that a good man may possibly drop a bad word, and a wicked man
 make use of a good word to serve a bad turn; but, for the most part, 
 the heart is as the words are, <I>vain</I> or <I>serious;</I> it 
 therefore concerns us to get our hearts filled, not only with 
 <I>good,</I> but with <I>abundance</I> of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. It is not enough to <I>hear</I> the sayings of Christ, but we 
 must <I>do</I> them; not enough to profess relation to him, as his 
 servants, but we must make conscience of obeying him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is putting an <I>affront upon him</I> to call him <I>Lord, 
 Lord,</I> as if we were wholly at his command, and had devoted 
 ourselves to his service, if we do not make conscience of conforming to 
 his will and serving the interests of his kingdom. We do but mock
 Christ, as they that in scorn said, <I>Hail, King of the Jews,</I> if 
 we call him ever so often <I>Lord, Lord,</I> and yet walk in the way of 
 our own hearts and in the sight of our own eyes. Why do we call him 
 <I>Lord, Lord,</I> in prayer (compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:21,22">Matt. vii. 21, 22</A>),

 if we do not obey his commands? He that <I>turns away his ear from 
 hearing the law, his prayer shall be an abomination.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is <I>putting a cheat</I> upon ourselves if we think that a bare 
 profession of religion will save us, that <I>hearing</I> the sayings of 
 Christ will bring us to heaven, without <I>doing</I> them. This he 
 illustrates by a similitude 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:47-49"><I>v.</I> 47-49</A>),
 
 which shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That those only make sure work for their souls and eternity, and 
 take the course that will stand them in stead in a trying time, who do 
 not only <I>come</I> to Christ as his scholars, and <I>hear his 
 sayings</I> but do them, who think, and speak, and act, in every thing 
 according to the established rules of his holy religion. They are like 
 a <I>house built on a rock.</I> These are they that <I>take pains</I> 
 in religion, as they do,--that <I>dig deep,</I> that found their hope
 upon Christ, who is the Rock of ages (and other foundation can no man 
 lay); these are they who <I>provide for hereafter,</I> who get ready 
 for the worst, who lay up in store a good foundation for the <I>time to 
 come,</I> for the <I>eternity to come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:19">1 Tim. vi. 19</A>.

 They who do thus do well for themselves; for,

 [1.] They shall keep their integrity, in times of temptation and 
 persecution; when others fall from their own stedfastness, as the seed 
 on the stony ground, they shall <I>stand fast in the Lord.</I>

 [2.] They shall keep their comfort, and peace, and hope, and joy, in 
 the midst of the greatest distresses. The <I>storms</I> and 
 <I>streams</I> of affliction shall not shock them, for their feet are 
 <I>set upon a rock,</I> a rock <I>higher than they.</I>

 [3.] Their everlasting welfare is secured. In death and judgment they
 are safe. Obedient believers are <I>kept by the power of Christ, 
 through faith, unto salvation,</I> and shall never perish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That those who rest in a bare hearing of the sayings of Christ, 
 and do not live up to them, are but preparing for a fatal 
 disappointment: <I>He that heareth and doeth not</I> (that knows his 
 duty, but lives in the neglect of it), he is like a man that <I>built a 
 house without a foundation.</I> He pleases himself with hopes that he
 has no ground for, and his hopes will fail him when he most needs the 
 <I>comfort</I> of them, and when he expects the <I>crowning</I> of 
 them; when the <I>stream beats vehemently</I> upon his house, it is 
 gone, the sand it is built upon is washed away, and <I>immediately it 
 falls,</I> Such is the <I>hope of the hypocrite, though he has gained, 
 when God takes away his soul;</I> it is as the spider's web, and the 
 giving up of the ghost.</P>
