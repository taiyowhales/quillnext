 After Christ's departure out of the temple, in the close of the
 foregoing chapter, and before this happened which is recorded in this
 chapter, he had been for some time abroad in the country, it is
 supposed about two or three months; in which interval of time Dr.
 Lightfoot and other harmonists place all the passages that occur from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:17-13:17">Luke x. 17 to xiii. 17</A>.

 What is recorded in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:1-8:59">
 <I>ch.</I> vii. and viii.</A>

 was at the feast of tabernacles, in September; what is recorded in this
 and the following chapter was at the feast of dedication in December,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:22"><I>ch.</I> x. 22</A>.

 Mr. Clark and others place this immediately after the foregoing
 chapter. In this chapter we have, 

 I. The miraculous cure of a man that was born blind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. The discourses which were occasioned by it.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And as <I>Jesus</I> passed by, he saw a man which was blind from
 <I>his</I> birth.
 &nbsp; 2  And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin,
 this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
 &nbsp; 3  Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his
 parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in
 him.
 &nbsp; 4  I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day:
 the night cometh, when no man can work.
 &nbsp; 5  As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
 &nbsp; 6  When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay
 of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with
 the clay,
 &nbsp; 7  And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is
 by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed,
 and came seeing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here sight given to a poor beggar that had been blind from his 
 birth. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The notice which our Lord Jesus took of the piteous case of this
 poor blind man 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>As Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth.</I> 
 The first words seem to refer to the last of the foregoing chapter, and 
 countenance the opinion of those who in the harmony place this story 
 immediately after that. There it was said, <B><I>paregen</I></B>--<I>he 
 passed by,</I> and here, without so much as repeating him name (though 
 our translators supply it) <B><I>kai parago</I></B>--<I>and as he 
 passed by.</I> 
 
 1. Though the Jews had so basely abused him, both by
 word and deed gave him the highest provocation imaginable, yet he did 
 not miss any opportunity of doing good among them, nor take up a 
 resolution, as justly he might have done, never to have favoured them 
 with any good offices. The cure of this blind man was a kindness to 
 <I>the public,</I> enabling him to work for his living who before was a 
 charge and burden to the neighbourhood. It is noble, and generous, and 
 Christ-like, to be willing to <I>serve the public,</I> even when we are 
 slighted and disobliged by them, or think ourselves so. Though he was 
 in his flight from a threatening danger, and escaping for his life, yet 
 he willingly halted and staid awhile to show mercy to this poor man. We 
 make more haste than good speed when we out-run opportunities of doing 
 good. 

 3. When the Pharisees drove Christ from them, he went to this poor
 blind beggar. Some of the ancients make this a figure of the bringing 
 of the gospel to the Gentiles, <I>who sat in darkness,</I> when the 
 Jews had rejected it, and driven it from them. 

 4. Christ took this poor blind man in his way, and cured him <I>in
 transitu--as he passed by.</I> Thus should we take occasions of doing 
 good, even as we <I>pass by,</I> wherever we are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 (1.) The condition of this poor man was very sad. He was <I>blind,</I> 
 and had been so <I>from his birth.</I> If the light is sweet, how 
 melancholy must it needs be for a man, all his days, <I>to eat in 
 darkness!</I> He that is <I>blind</I> has no <I>enjoyment</I> of the 
 light, but he that is <I>born blind</I> has no <I>idea</I> of it.
 Methinks such a one would give a great deal to have his curiosity 
 satisfied with but one day's sight of light and colours, shapes and 
 figures, though he were never to see them more. <I>Why is</I> the 
 <I>light</I> of life <I>given to one that is in this misery,</I> that 
 is deprived of the light of the sun, <I>whose way is</I> thus <I>hid, 
 and whom God hath</I> thus <I>hedged in?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:20">Job iii. 20-23</A>.

 Let us bless God that it was not our case. The eye is one of the most
 curious parts of the body, its structure exceedingly nice and fine. In 
 the formation of animals, it is said to be the first part that appears 
 distinctly discernible. What a mercy is it that there was no 
 miscarriage in the making of ours! Christ cured many that were blind by 
 disease or accident, but here he cured one that was <I>born blind.</I>

 [1.] That he might give an instance of his power to help in the most 
 desperate cases, and to relieve when none else can. 

 [2.] That he might give a <I>specimen</I> of the work of his grace upon 
 the souls of sinners, which gives sight to those that were by nature 
 blind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The compassions of our Lord Jesus towards him were very tender. He 
 <I>saw him;</I> that is, he took cognizance of his case, and looked 
 upon him with concern. When God is about to work deliverance, he is 
 said to see <I>the affliction;</I> so Christ saw this poor man. Others 
 saw him, but not as he did. This poor man could not see Christ, but 
 Christ saw him, and anticipated both his prayers and expectations with 
 a surprising cure. Christ is often found of those that seek him not, 
 nor see him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1">Isa. lxv. 1</A>.

 And, if we know or apprehend any thing of Christ, it is because we were
 first <I>known of him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:9">Gal. iv. 9</A>)

 and <I>apprehended</I> by him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:12">Phil. iii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The discourse between Christ and his disciples concerning this man. 
 When he <I>departed out of the temple</I> they went along with him: for 
 these were they that <I>continued with him in his temptations,</I> and 
 followed him whithersoever he went; and they lost nothing by their 
 adherence to him, but gained experience abundantly. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The question which the disciples put to their Master upon this blind 
 man's case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 When Christ looked upon him, they had an eye to him too; Christ's 
 compassion should kindle ours. It is probable that Christ told them 
 this poor man was born blind, or they knew it by common fame; but they 
 did not move Christ to heal him. Instead of this, they started a very 
 odd question concerning him: <I>Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his 
 parents, that he was born blind?</I> Now this question of theirs 
 was,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Uncharitably censorious.</I> They take it for granted that this 
 extraordinary calamity was the punishment of some uncommon wickedness, 
 and that this man was a sinner above all men that dwelt at Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:4">Luke xiii. 4</A>.

 For the <I>barbarous people</I> to infer, <I>Surely this man is a
 murderer,</I> was not so strange; but it was <I>inexcusable</I> in 
 them, who knew the scriptures, who had read that <I>all things come 
 alike to all,</I> and knew that it was adjudged in Job's case that the 
 greatest sufferers are not <I>therefore</I> to be looked upon as the 
 greatest sinners. The grace of repentance calls our own afflictions 
 <I>punishments,</I> but the grace of charity calls the afflictions of 
 others <I>trials,</I> unless the contrary is very evident.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was <I>unnecessarily curious.</I> Concluding this calamity to 
 be inflicted for some very heinous crime, they ask, <I>Who were the 
 criminals, this man or his parents?</I> And what was this to them? Or 
 what good would it do them to know it? We are apt to be more 
 inquisitive concerning other people's sins than concerning our own; 
 whereas, it is more our concern to know wherefore God contends with us 
 than wherefore he contends with others; for to judge ourselves is our 
 sin. They enquire, 

 [1.] Whether this man was punished thus for some sin of his own, either 
 committed or foreseen before his birth. Some think that the disciples 
 were tainted with the Pythagorean notion of the <I>pre-existence</I> of 
 souls, and their <I>transmigration</I> from one body to another. Was 
 this man's soul condemned to the dungeon of this blind body to punish 
 it for some great sin committed in another body which it had before 
 animated? The Pharisees seem to have had the same opinion of his case 
 when they said, <I>Thou wast altogether born in sin</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 as if all those, and those only, were born in sin whom nature had 
 <I>stigmatized.</I> Or,

 [2.] Whether he was punished for the wickedness of his parents, which 
 God sometimes <I>visits upon the children.</I> It is a good reason why 
 parents should take heed of sin, lest their children smart for it when 
 they are gone. Let not us thus be cruel to our own, as the <I>ostrich 
 in the wilderness.</I> Perhaps the disciples asked this, not as 
 believing that this was the punishment of some actual sin of his own or 
 his parents, but Christ having intimated to another patient that his 
 sin was the cause of this impotency

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:14"><I>ch.</I> v. 14</A>),

 "Master," say they, "whose sin is the cause of this impotency?" Being
 at a loss what construction to put upon this providence, they desire to 
 be informed. The equity of God's dispensations is always certain, for 
 <I>his righteousness is as the great mountains,</I> but not always to 
 be accounted for, for his <I>judgments are a great deep.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ's answer to this question. He was always <I>apt to teach,</I> 
 and to rectify his disciples' mistakes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He gives the reason of this poor man's blindness: "<I>Neither has 
 this man sinned nor his parents,</I> but he was born blind, and has 
 continued so to this day, that now at last <I>the works of God should 
 be made manifest in him,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Here Christ, who perfectly knew the secret springs of the divine 
 counsels, told them two things concerning such uncommon calamities:--

 [1.] That they are not always inflicted as punishments of sin. The 
 sinfulness of the whole race of mankind does indeed justify God in all 
 the miseries of human life; so that those who have the least share of 
 them must say that God is <I>kind,</I> and those who have the largest 
 share must not say that he is <I>unjust;</I> but many are made much 
 more <I>miserable</I> than others in this life who are not at all more 
 <I>sinful.</I> Not but that this man was a sinner, and his parents 
 sinners, but is was not any uncommon guilt that God had an eye to in 
 inflicting this upon him. Note, We must take heed of judging any to be 
 great sinners merely because they are great sufferers, lest we be 
 found, not only <I>persecuting those whom God has smitten</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:26">Ps. lxix. 26</A>),

 but accusing those whom he has justified, and <I>condemning</I> those 
 for whom <I>Christ died,</I> which is daring and dangerous,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:33,34">Rom. viii. 33, 34</A>.

 [2.] That they are sometimes intended purely <I>for the glory of
 God,</I> and the <I>manifesting of his works.</I> God has a sovereignty 
 over all his creatures and an exclusive right in them, and may make 
 them serviceable to his glory in such a way as he thinks fit, in doing 
 or suffering; and if God be glorified, either by us or in us, we were 
 not made <I>in vain.</I> This man was <I>born blind,</I> and it was 
 worth while for him to be so, and to continue thus long dark, <I>that 
 the works of God might be manifest in him.</I> That is, <I>First,</I> 
 That the <I>attributes of God</I> might be made manifest in him: his 
 justice in making sinful man liable to such grievous calamities; his 
 ordinary power and goodness in supporting a poor man under such a 
 grievous and tedious affliction, especially that his extraordinary 
 power and goodness might be manifested in curing him. Note, The
 difficulties of providence, otherwise unaccountable, may be resolved 
 into this--God intends in them to <I>show himself,</I> to declare his 
 glory, to make himself to be taken notice of. Those who regard him not 
 in the ordinary course of things are sometimes alarmed by things 
 extraordinary. How contentedly then may a good man be a <I>loser in his 
 comforts,</I> while he is sure that thereby God will be one way or 
 other a <I>gainer in his glory! Secondly,</I> That the counsels of God
 concerning the Redeemer might be manifested in him. He was <I>born 
 blind</I> that our Lord Jesus might have the honour of <I>curing 
 him,</I> and might therein prove himself sent of God to be the true 
 light to the world. Thus the fall of man was permitted, and the 
 <I>blindness</I> that followed it, that the works of God might be 
 manifest in <I>opening the eyes of the blind.</I> It was now a great 
 while since this man was born blind, and yet it never appeared till now 
 <I>why</I> he was so. Note, The intentions of Providence commonly do 
 not appear till a great while after the event, perhaps <I>many 
 years</I> after. The sentences in the book of providence are sometimes 
 <I>long,</I> and you must read a great way before you can apprehend the 
 sense of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He gives the reason of his own forwardness and readiness to help 
 and heal him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 It was not for ostentation, but in pursuance of his undertaking: <I>I 
 must work the works of him that sent me</I> (of which this is one), 
 <I>while it is day,</I> and working time; <I>the night cometh,</I> the 
 period of that day, <I>when no man can work.</I> This is not only a 
 reason shy Christ was constant in doing good to the souls and bodies of 
 men, but why particularly he did this, though it was the sabbath day, 
 on which works of necessity might be done, and he proves this to be a 
 work of necessity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] It was his Father's will: <I>I must work the works of him that 
 sent me.</I> Note, <I>First,</I> The Father, when he sent his Son into 
 the world, gave him <I>work to do;</I> he did not come into the world 
 to take state, but to do business; whom God sends he employs, for he 
 sends none to be idle. <I>Secondly,</I> The works Christ had to do were 
 the <I>works of him that sent him,</I> not only appointed <I>by 
 him,</I> but done <I>for him;</I> he was a worker together with God. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> He was pleased to lay himself under the strongest 
 obligations to do the business he was sent about: I <I>must work.</I> 
 He <I>engaged his heart,</I> in the covenant of redemption, to <I>draw 
 near,</I> and <I>approach</I> to God as Mediator, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:21">Jer. xxx. 21</A>.

 Shall we be willing to be <I>loose,</I> when Christ was willing to be
 <I>bound? Fourthly,</I> Christ, having laid himself under obligations
 to do his work, laid out himself with the utmost vigour and industry in 
 his work. He <I>worked the works</I> he had to do; did
 <B><I>ergazesthai ta erga</I></B>--<I>made a business of that which was 
 his business.</I> It is not enough to look at our work, and talk over 
 it, but we must work it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Now was his opportunity: I must work <I>while it is day,</I> while
 the time lasts which is appointed to work in, and while the light lasts 
 which is given to work by. Christ himself had <I>his day. First,</I> 
 All the business of the <I>mediatorial kingdom</I> was to be done 
 within the limits of time, and in this world; for at the end of the 
 world, when time shall be no more, the <I>kingdom shall be delivered up 
 to God, even the Father,</I> and the <I>mystery of God finished. 
 Secondly,</I> all the work he had to do <I>in his own person</I> here 
 on earth was to be done <I>before his death;</I> the time of his living 
 in this world is <I>the day</I> here spoken of. Note, The time of our 
 life is our day, in which it concerns us to do the <I>work of the 
 day.</I> Day-time is the proper season for work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:22,23">Ps. civ. 22, 23</A>);
 
 during the day of life we must be busy, not waste <I>day-time,</I> nor 
 play by <I>day-light;</I> it will be time enough to rest when our day 
 is done, for it is <I>but a day.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The period of his opportunity was at hand, and therefore he would 
 be busy; <I>The night comes when no man can work.</I> Note, The 
 consideration of our death approaching should quicken us to improve all 
 the opportunities of life, both for doing and getting good. <I>The 
 night comes,</I> it will come certainly, may come suddenly, is coming 
 nearer and nearer. We cannot compute how nigh our sun is, it may go 
 down at noon; nor can we promise ourselves a twilight between the day 
 of life and the night of death. When the night comes we <I>cannot 
 work,</I> because the light afforded us to work by is 
 <I>extinguished;</I> the grave is a land of darkness, and our work 
 cannot be done <I>in the dark.</I> And, besides, our time allotted us 
 for our work will then have <I>expired;</I> when our Master tied us to 
 duty he tied us to time too; when night comes, <I>call the 
 labourers;</I> we must then <I>show our work,</I> and receive according 
 to the things done. In the world of retribution we are no longer 
 probationers; it is too late to <I>bid</I> when the inch of candle is 
 <I>dropped.</I> Christ uses this as an argument with himself to be 
 diligent, though he had no opposition from within to struggle with; 
 much more need have we to work upon our hearts these and the like 
 considerations to quicken us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] His business in the world was to enlighten it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>As long as I am in the world,</I> and that will not be long, <I>I am 
 the light of the world.</I> He had said this before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:12"><I>ch.</I> viii. 12</A>.

 He is the <I>Sun of righteousness,</I> that has not only light in his
 wings for those that can see, but healing in his wings, or beams, for 
 those that are blind and cannot see, therein far exceeding in virtue 
 that great light which rules <I>by day.</I> Christ would cure this 
 blind man, the representative of a blind world, because he came to be 
 <I>the light of the world,</I> not only to give <I>light,</I> but to 
 give <I>sight.</I> Now this gives us, <I>First,</I> A great 
 <I>encouragement</I> to come to him, as a guiding, quickening, 
 refreshing light. To whom should we look but to him? Which way should 
 we turn our eyes, but to the light? We partake of the sun's light, and
 so we may of Christ's grace, without money and without price. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> A good <I>example</I> of usefulness in the world. What 
 Christ saith of himself, he saith of his disciples: <I>You are lights 
 in the world,</I> and, if so, <I>Let your light shine.</I> What were 
 candles made for but to burn?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The manner of the cure of the blind man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 The circumstances of the miracle are singular, and no doubt 
 significant. <I>When he had thus spoken</I> for the instruction of his
 disciples, and the opening of their understandings, he addressed 
 himself to the opening of the blind man's eyes. He did not defer it 
 till he could do it either more privately, for his greater safety, or 
 more publicly, for his greater honour, or till the sabbath was past, 
 when it would give less offence. What good we have opportunity of doing 
 we should do quickly; he that will never do a good work till there is 
 nothing to be objected against it will leave many a good work for ever 
 undone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:4">Eccl. xi. 4</A>.
 
 In the cure observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The preparation of the eye-salve. Christ <I>spat on the ground, and 
 made clay of the spittle.</I> He could have cured him with a word, as 
 he did others, but he chose to do it in this way to show that he is not 
 <I>tied</I> to any method. He made clay of his own spittle, because 
 there was no water near; and he would teach us not to be nice or 
 curious, but, when we have at any time occasion, to be willing to take 
 up with that which is <I>next hand,</I> if it will but serve the turn. 
 Why should we <I>go about</I> for that which may as well be had and 
 done a <I>nearer way?</I> Christ's making use of his own spittle 
 intimates that there is healing virtue in every thing that belongs to 
 Christ; clay made of Christ's spittle was much more precious than the 
 balm of Gilead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The application of it to the place: <I>He anointed the eyes of the 
 blind man with the clay.</I> Or, as the margin reads it, <I>He 
 spread</I> (<B><I>epechrise</I></B>), <I>he daubed the clay upon the 
 eyes of the blind man,</I> like a tender physician; he did it himself 
 with his own hand, though the patient was a beggar. Now Christ did 
 this, 

 (1.) To magnify his power in making a blind man to see by that method 
 which one would think more likely to make a seeing man blind. Daubing
 clay on the eyes would <I>close them</I> up, but never <I>open 
 them.</I> Note, The power of God often works by contraries; and he 
 makes men feel their own blindness before he gives them sight. 

 (2.) To give an intimation that it was his mighty hand, the very same 
 that at first made man out of <I>the clay;</I> for by him God <I>made 
 the worlds,</I> both the great world, and man the little world. Man was 
 <I>formed out of the clay,</I> and moulded like the clay, and here 
 Christ used the same materials to give sight to the body that at first 
 he used to give being to it. 

 (3.) To represent and typify the healing and opening of the eyes of the 
 mind by the grace of Jesus Christ. The design of the gospel is to 
 <I>open men's eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:18">Acts xxvi. 18</A>.

 Now the eye-salve that does the work is of Christ's preparing; it is
 made up, not as this, of his spittle, but of his blood, the blood and 
 water that came out of his pierced side; we must come to Christ for 
 <I>the eye-salve,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:18">Rev. iii. 18</A>.

 He only is <I>able,</I> and he only is <I>appointed,</I> to make it up,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:18">Luke iv. 18</A>.

 The means used in this work are very weak and unlikely, and are made 
 effectual only by the power of Christ; when a dark world was to be 
 enlightened, and nations of blind souls were to have their eyes opened, 
 God chose the <I>foolish things, and weak, and despised,</I> for the 
 doing of it. And the method Christ takes is first to make men feel 
 themselves blind, as this poor man did whose eyes were daubed with 
 clay, and then to give them sight. Paul in his conversion was <I>struck 
 blind</I> for three days, and then the <I>scales fell from his 
 eyes.</I> The way prescribed for getting spiritual wisdom is, <I>Let a 
 man become a fool, that he may be wise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:18">1 Cor. iii. 18</A>.

 We must be made uneasy with our blindness, as this man here, and then
 healed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The directions given to the patient, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 His physician said to him, <I>Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.</I> Not 
 that this washing was needful to effect the cure; but,

 (1.) Christ would hereby try his obedience, and whether he would with 
 an implicit faith obey the orders of one he was so much a stranger to. 
 
 (2.) He would likewise try how he stood affected to the tradition of 
 the elders, which taught, and perhaps had taught him (for many that are 
 <I>blind</I> are very knowing), that it was not lawful to wash the 
 eyes, no not with spittle medicinally, on the sabbath day, much less to 
 go to a pool of water to wash them. 

 (3.) He would hereby represent the method of spiritual healing, in 
 which, though the effect is owing purely to his power and grace, there 
 is duty to be done by us. Go, search the scriptures, attend upon the 
 ministry, converse with the wise; this is like washing in the pool of 
 Siloam. Promised graces must be expected in the way of instituted 
 ordinances. The waters of baptism were to those who had been trained up 
 in darkness like the pool of Siloam, in which they might not only wash 
 and be clean, but <I>wash, and have their eyes opened.</I> Hence they 
 that were baptized are said to be 
 <B><I>photisthentes</I></B>--<I>enlightened;</I> and the ancients 
 called baptism <B><I>photismos</I></B>--<I>illumination.</I> Concerning 
 the pool of Siloam observe,

 [1.] That it was supplied with water from mount Zion, so that these 
 were the <I>waters of the sanctuary</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:4">Ps. xlvi. 4</A>),

 living waters, which were <I>healing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+47:9">Ezek. xlvii. 9</A>.

 [2.] That the waters of Siloam had of old signified the throne and
 kingdom of the house of David, pointing at the Messiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:6">Isa. viii. 6</A>),

 and the Jews who <I>refused the waters of Shiloa,</I> Christ's doctrine 
 and law, and rejoiced in the tradition of the elders. Christ would try 
 this man, whether he would cleave to the waters of Siloam or no.

 [3.] The evangelist takes notice of the signification of the name, its 
 being interpreted <I>sent.</I> Christ is often called the <I>sent of 
 God,</I> the Messenger of the covenant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal. iii. 1</A>);

 so that when Christ sent him to the pool of Siloam he did in effect 
 send him to himself; for Christ is <I>all in all</I> to the healing of 
 souls. Christ as a prophet directs us to himself as a priest. <I>Go, 
 wash in the fountain opened,</I> a fountain of life, not a 
 <I>pool.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The patient's obedience to these directions: <I>He went his way 
 therefore,</I> probably led by some friend or other; or perhaps he was 
 so well acquainted with Jerusalem that he could find the way himself. 
 Nature often supplies the want of sight with an uncommon sagacity; and 
 <I>he washed his eyes;</I> probably the disciples, or some stander by, 
 informed him that he who bade him do it was that Jesus whom he had 
 heard so much of, else he would not have gone, at his bidding, on that 
 which looked so much like a fool's errand; in confidence of Christ's 
 power, as well as in obedience to his command, he went, and washed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The cure effected: <I>He came seeing.</I> There is more glory in 
 this concise narrative, <I>He went</I> and <I>washed,</I> and <I>came 
 seeing,</I> than in C&aelig;sar's <I>Veni, vidi, vici--I came, I saw, I
 conquered.</I> When the clay was <I>washed off</I> from his eyes, all 
 the other impediments were removed with it; so when the pangs and 
 struggles of the new birth are over, and the pains and terrors of 
 conviction past, the bands of sin fly off with them, and a glorious 
 light and liberty succeed. See here an instance, 

 (1.) Of the power of Christ. What cannot <I>he</I> do who could not 
 only do <I>this,</I> but do it <I>thus?</I> With a lump of clay laid on 
 either eye, and washed off again, he couched those cataracts 
 immediately which the most skilful oculist, with the finest instrument 
 and the most curious hand, could not remove. No doubt this is <I>he 
 that should come,</I> for by him the blind receive their sight. 

 (2.) It is an instance of the virtue of faith and obedience. This man 
 let Christ do what <I>he</I> pleased, and did what he appointed him to 
 do, and so was cured. Those that would be healed by Christ must be 
 ruled by him. He <I>came back</I> from the pool to his neighbours and 
 acquaintance, wondering and wondered at; he came <I>seeing.</I> This 
 represents the benefit gracious souls find in attending on instituted 
 ordinances, according to Christ's appointment; they have gone to the 
 pool of Siloam weak, and have come away strengthened; have gone 
 doubting, and come away satisfied; have gone mourning, and come away 
 rejoicing; have gone trembling, and come away triumphing; have gone 
 <I>blind,</I> and come away <I>seeing,</I> come away singing,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him
 that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
 &nbsp; 9  Some said, This is he: others <I>said,</I> He is like him: <I>but</I>
 he said, I am <I>he.</I>
 &nbsp; 10  Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Such a wonderful event as the giving of sight to a man born blind could 
 not but be the talk of the town, and many heeded it no more than they 
 do other town-talk, that is but nine days' wonder; but here we are told 
 what the neighbours said of it, for the confirmation of the matter of 
 fact. That which at first was not believed without <I>scrutiny</I> may 
 afterwards be admitted without <I>scruple.</I> Two things are debated 
 in this conference about it:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Whether this was the same man that had before been blind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The neighbours that lived near the place where he was born and bred, 
 and knew that he had been blind, could not but be amazed when they saw 
 that he had his eye-sight, had it on a sudden, and perfectly; and they 
 said, <I>Is not this he that sat and begged?</I> It seems, this blind 
 man was a common beggar, being disabled to work for his living; and so 
 discharged from the obligation of the law, that if <I>any would not 
 work, neither should he eat.</I> When he could not go about, he 
 <I>sat;</I> if we cannot <I>work</I> for God, we must <I>sit still</I> 
 quietly for him. When he could not labour, his parents not being able 
 to maintain him, he <I>begged.</I> Note, Those who cannot otherwise 
 subsist must not, like the unjust steward, be <I>ashamed to beg;</I> 
 let no man be ashamed of anything but sin. There are some common 
 beggars that are objects of charity, that should be distinguished; and 
 we must not let the bees starve for the sake of the drones or wasps 
 that are among them. As to this man, 

 (1.) It was well ordered by Providence that he on whom this miracle was 
 wrought should be a common beggar, and so generally known and 
 remarkable, by which means the truth of the miracle was better 
 attested, and there were more to witness against those infidel Jews who 
 would not believe <I>that he had been blind</I> than if he had been 
 maintained in his father's house. 

 (2.) It was the greater instance of Christ's condescension that he 
 seemed (as I may say) to take more pains about the cure of a common 
 beggar than of others. When it was for the advantage of his miracles 
 that they should be wrought on those that were remarkable, he pitched 
 upon those that were made so by their poverty and misery; not by their 
 dignity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In answer to this inquiry, 

 (1.) Some said, <I>This is he,</I> the very same man; and these are 
 witnesses to the truth of the miracle, for they had long known him 
 stone-blind. 

 (2.) Others, who could not think it possible that a man born blind 
 should thus on a sudden receive his sight, for that reason, and no 
 other, said, <I>He is not he, but is like him,</I> and so, by their 
 confession, if it be he, it is a great miracle that is wrought upon 
 him. Hence we may take occasion to think,

 [1.] Of the wisdom and power of Providence in ordering such a universal 
 variety of the faces of men and women, so that no two are so alike but 
 that they may be distinguished, which is necessary to society, and 
 commerce, and the administration of justice. And, 

 [2.] Of the wonderful change which the converting grace of God makes 
 upon some who before were very wicked and vile, but are thereby so 
 universally and visibly altered that one would not take them to be the 
 same persons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. This controversy was soon decided by the man himself: <I>He said, I 
 am he,</I> the very man that so lately sat and begged; "I am he that 
 was blind, and was an object of the charity of men, but now see, and am 
 a monument of the mercy and grace of God." We do not find that the 
 neighbours appealed to him in this matter, but he, hearing the debate, 
 interposed, and put an end to it. It is a piece of justice we owe to 
 our neighbours to rectify their mistakes, and to set things before 
 them, as far as we are able, in a true light. Applying it spiritually, 
 it teaches us that those who are savingly enlightened by the grace of 
 God should be ready to own what they were before that blessed change 
 was wrought, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:13,14">1 Tim. i. 13, 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he came to have his eyes opened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>.

 They will now turn aside, and <I>see this great sight,</I> and enquire 
 further concerning it. He did not <I>sound a trumpet</I> when he did 
 these alms, nor perform his cures <I>upon a stage;</I> and yet, like a 
 city upon a hill, they could not be hid. Two things these neighbours 
 enquire after:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The manner of the cure: <I>How were thine eyes opened?</I> The works 
 of the Lord being great, they ought to be <I>sought out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:2">Ps. cxi. 2</A>.
 
 It is good to observe the way and method of God's works, and they will
 appear the more wonderful. We may apply it spiritually; it is strange 
 that blind eyes should be opened, but more strange when we consider how 
 they are opened; how weak the means are that are used, and how strong 
 the opposition that is conquered. In answer to this enquiry the poor 
 man gives them a plain and full account of the matter: <I>A man that is 
 called Jesus made clay,--and I received sight.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Note, Those who have experienced special instances of God's power and 
 goodness, in temporal or spiritual things, should be ready upon all 
 occasions to communicate their experiences, for the glory of God and 
 the instruction and encouragement of others. See David's collection of 
 his experiences, his own and others', 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:4-6">Ps. xxxiv. 4-6</A>.

 It is a debt we owe to our benefactor, and to our brethren. God's
 favours are lost <I>upon</I> us, when they are lost <I>with us,</I> and 
 go no further.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The author of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Where is he?</I> Some perhaps asked this question out of curiosity. 
 "Where is he, that we may see him?" A man that did such cures as these 
 might well be a show, which one would go a good way for the sight of. 
 Others, perhaps, asked out of ill-will. "Where is he, that we may
 <I>seize</I> him?" There was a proclamation out for the discovering and 
 apprehending of him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:57"><I>ch.</I> xi. 57</A>);

 and the unthinking crowd, in spite of all reason and equity, will have
 ill thoughts of those that are put into an ill name. Some, we hope, 
 asked this question out of <I>good-will.</I> "Where is he, that we may 
 be acquainted with him? Where is he, that we may come to him, and share 
 in the favours he is so free of?" In answer to this, he could say 
 nothing: <I>I know not.</I> As soon as Christ had sent him to the pool 
 of Siloam, it should seem, he withdrew immediately (as he did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:13"><I>ch.</I> v. 13</A>),

 and did not stay till the man returned, as if he either doubted of the
 effect or waited for the man's thanks. Humble souls take more pleasure 
 in <I>doing good</I> than in hearing of it again; it will be time 
 enough to hear of it in the <I>resurrection of the just.</I> The man 
 had never seen Jesus, for by the time that he had gained his sight he 
 had lost his Physician; and he asked, it is probable, <I>Where is 
 he?</I> None of all the new and surprising objects that presented 
 themselves could be so grateful to him as one sight of Christ, but as 
 yet he knew no more of him than that he was called, and rightly called, 
 <I>Jesus--a Saviour.</I> Thus in the work of grace wrought upon the 
 soul we see the change, but see not the hand that makes it; for the way 
 of the Spirit is like that of the wind, which thou hearest the sound 
 of, but canst not tell <I>whence it comes nor whither it goes.</I></P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
 &nbsp; 14  And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and
 opened his eyes.
 &nbsp; 15  Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received
 his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I
 washed, and do see.
 &nbsp; 16  Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of
 God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can
 a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division
 among them.
 &nbsp; 17  They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him,
 that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
 &nbsp; 18  But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had
 been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents
 of him that had received his sight.
 &nbsp; 19  And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say
 was born blind? how then doth he now see?
 &nbsp; 20  His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our
 son, and that he was born blind:
 &nbsp; 21  But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath
 opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall
 speak for himself.
 &nbsp; 22  These <I>words</I> spake his parents, because they feared the
 Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did
 confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the
 synagogue.
 &nbsp; 23  Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
 &nbsp; 24  Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto
 him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
 &nbsp; 25  He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner <I>or no,</I> I know
 not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
 &nbsp; 26  Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened
 he thine eyes?
 &nbsp; 27  He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not
 hear: wherefore would ye hear <I>it</I> again? will ye also be his
 disciples?
 &nbsp; 28  Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but
 we are Moses' disciples.
 &nbsp; 29  We know that God spake unto Moses: <I>as for</I> this <I>fellow,</I>
 we know not from whence he is.
 &nbsp; 30  The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a
 marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <I>yet</I>
 he hath opened mine eyes.
 &nbsp; 31  Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be
 a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
 &nbsp; 32  Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened
 the eyes of one that was born blind.
 &nbsp; 33  If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
 &nbsp; 34  They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born
 in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One would have expected that such a miracle as Christ wrought upon the 
 blind man would have settled his reputation, and silenced and shamed 
 all opposition, but it had the contrary effect; instead of being 
 embraced as a prophet for it, he is prosecuted as a criminal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the information that was given in to the Pharisees 
 concerning this matter: <I>They brought to the Pharisees him that 
 aforetime was blind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They brought him to the great sanhedrim, which consisted chiefly of 
 Pharisees, at least the Pharisees in the sanhedrim were most active 
 against Christ. 

 1. Some think that those who brought this man to the Pharisees did it
 with a <I>good design,</I> to show them that this Jesus, whom they 
 persecuted, was not what they represented him, but really a great man, 
 and one that gave considerable proofs of a divine mission. What hath 
 convinced us of the truth and excellency of religion, and hath removed 
 our prejudices against it, we should be forward, as we have 
 opportunity, to offer to others for their conviction. 

 2. It should seem, rather, that they did it with an <I>ill design,</I>
 to exasperate the Pharisees the more against Christ, and there was no 
 need of this, for they were bitter enough of themselves. They brought
 him with such a suggestion as that in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:47,48"><I>ch.</I> xi. 47, 48</A>,

 <I>If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him.</I> Note,
 Those rulers that are of a persecuting spirit shall never want ill 
 instruments about them, that will blow the coals, and make them 
 worse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ground which was pretended for this information, and the colour 
 given to it. That which is good was never maligned but under the 
 imputation of something evil. And the crime objected here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 was that <I>it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened 
 his eyes.</I> The profanation of the sabbath day is certainly wicked, 
 and gives a man a very ill character; but the traditions of the Jews 
 had made that to be a violation of the law of the sabbath which was far 
 from being so. Many a time this matter was contested between Christ and 
 the Jews, that it might be settled for the benefit of the church in all 
 ages. But it may be asked, "Why would Christ not only work miracles on 
 the sabbath day, but work them in such a manner as he knew would give 
 offence to the Jews? When he had healed the impotent man, why should he 
 bid him carry his bed? Could he not have cured this blind man without 
 making clay?" I answer, 

 1. He would not seem to yield to the usurped power of the scribes and
 Pharisees. Their government was illegal, their impositions were 
 arbitrary, and their zeal for the rituals consumed the substantials of 
 religion; and therefore Christ would not <I>give place</I> to them, 
 <I>by subjection, no not for an hour.</I> Christ was made under the law 
 of God, but not under their law. 

 2. He did it that he might, both by word and action, expound the law of
 the fourth commandment, and vindicate it from their corrupt glosses, 
 and so teach us that a weekly sabbath is to be <I>perpetually</I> 
 observed in the church, one day in seven (for what need was there to 
 explain that law, if it must be presently abrogated?) and that it is 
 not to be so <I>ceremonially</I> observed by us as it was by the Jews? 
 Works of necessity and mercy are allowed, and the sabbath-rest to be 
 kept, not so much for its own sake as in order to the sabbath-work. 

 3. Christ chose to work his cures on the sabbath day to dignify and
 sanctify the day, and to intimate that spiritual cures should be 
 wrought mostly on the Christian sabbath day. How many blind eyes have
 been opened by the preaching of the gospel, that blessed eye-salve, on 
 the Lord's day! How many impotent souls cured on that day!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The trial and examination of this matter by the Pharisees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 So much passion, prejudice, and ill-humour, and so little reason, 
 appear here, that the discourse is nothing but crossing questions. One 
 would think, when a man in these circumstances was brought before them, 
 they would have been so taken up in admiring the miracle, and 
 congratulating the happiness of the poor man, that they could not have 
 been peevish with him. But their enmity to Christ had divested them of 
 all manner of humanity, and divinity too. Let us see how they teased 
 this man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They interrogated him concerning the cure itself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They doubted whether he had indeed been <I>born blind,</I> and 
 demanded proof of that which even the prosecutors had acknowledged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 They <I>did not believe,</I> that is, they would not, that he was 
 <I>born blind.</I> Men that seek occasion to quarrel with the clearest 
 truths may find it if they please; and they that resolve to <I>hold 
 fast deceit</I> will never want a handle to hold it by. This was not a 
 prudent caution, but a prejudiced infidelity. However, it was a good 
 way that they took for the clearing of this: <I>They called the parents 
 of the man who had received his sight.</I> This they did in hopes to 
 disprove the miracle. These parents were poor and timorous, and if they 
 had said that they could not be sure that this was their son, or that 
 it was only some weakness or dimness in his sight that he had been born 
 with, which if they had been able to get help for him might have been 
 cured long since, or had otherwise prevaricated, for fear of the court, 
 the Pharisees had gained their point, had robbed Christ of the honour 
 of this miracle, which would have lessened the reputation of all the 
 rest. But God so ordered and overruled this counsel of theirs that it 
 turned to the more effectual proof of the miracle, and left them under 
 a necessity of being either convinced or confounded. Now in this part 
 of the examination we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The questions that were put to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 They <I>asked them</I> in an imperious threatening way, "<I>Is this 
 your son?</I> Dare you swear to it? <I>Do you say he was born 
 blind?</I> Are you sure of it? Or did he but pretend to be so, to have 
 an excuse for his begging? <I>How then doth he now see?</I> That is 
 impossible, and therefore you had better unsay it." Those who cannot 
 bear the light of truth do all they can to <I>eclipse</I> it, and 
 hinder the discovery of it. Thus the <I>managers of evidence,</I> or 
 mismanagers rather, lead witnesses out of the way, and teach them how 
 to conceal or disguise the truth, and so involve themselves in a double 
 guilt, like that of Jeroboam, who sinned, and made Israel to sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Their answers to these interrogatories, in which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> They fully attest that which they could safely say in 
 this matter; <I>safely,</I> that is, upon their own knowledge, and 
 <I>safely,</I> that is, without running themselves into a 
 <I>premunire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>We know that this is our son</I> (for they were daily conversant
 with him, and had such a natural affection to him as the true mother 
 had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:26">1 Kings iii. 26</A>,

 which made them know it was <I>their own</I>); and we know that he was
 <I>born blind.</I> They had reason to know it, inasmuch as it had cost 
 them many a sad thought, and many a careful troublesome hour, about 
 him. How often had they looked upon him with grief, and lamented their 
 child's blindness more than all the burdens and inconveniences of their 
 poverty, and wished he had never been born, rather than be born to such 
 an uncomfortable life! Those who are ashamed of their children, or any
 of their relations, because of their bodily infirmities, may take a 
 reproof from <I>these</I> parents, who freely owned, This is <I>our 
 son,</I> though he was <I>born blind,</I> and lived upon alms.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> They cautiously decline giving any evidence concerning 
 his cure; partly because they were not themselves eye-witnesses of it, 
 and could say nothing to it <I>of their own knowledge;</I> and partly 
 because they found it was a <I>tender point,</I> and would not bear to 
 be meddled with. And therefore, having owned that he was <I>their 
 son</I> and was <I>born blind,</I> further these deponents say not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> Observe how warily they express themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>By what means he now seeth we know not,</I> or <I>who has opened 
 his eyes we know not,</I> otherwise than by <I>hearsay;</I> we can give 
 no account either by what means or by whose hand it was done." See how 
 the wisdom of this world teaches men to <I>trim</I> the matter in 
 critical junctures. Christ was accused as a sabbath-breaker, and as an 
 imposter. Now these parents of the blind man, though they were not
 eye-witnesses of the cure, were yet fully assured of it, and were bound 
 in gratitude to have borne their testimony to the honour of the Lord 
 Jesus, who had done their son so great a kindness; but they had not 
 courage to do it, and then thought it might serve to atone for their 
 not appearing in favour of him that they said nothing to his prejudice; 
 whereas, in the day of trial, he that is not <I>apparently</I> for 
 Christ is justly looked upon as <I>really against</I> him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:23,Mk+8:38">Luke xi. 23; Mark viii. 38</A>.

 That they might not be further urged in this matter, they refer
 themselves and the court to him: <I>He is of age, ask him, he shall 
 speak for himself.</I> This implies that while children are not of age 
 (while they are <I>infants,</I> such as cannot speak) it is incumbent
 upon their parents to <I>speak for them,</I> speak to God for them in
 prayer, speak to the church for them in baptism; but, when they are of
 age, it is fit that they should be asked whether they be willing to
 stand to that which their parents did for them, and let them speak for
 themselves. This man, though he was <I>born blind,</I> seems to have
 been of quick understanding above many, which enabled him to speak for
 himself better than his friends could speak for him. Thus God often by
 a kind providence makes up in the mind what is wanting in the body, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:23,24">1 Cor. xii. 23, 24</A>.

 His parents turning them over to him was only to save themselves from 
 trouble, and expose him; whereas they that had so great an interest in 
 his <I>mercies</I> had reason to embark with him in his <I>hazards</I> 
 for the honour of that Jesus who had done so much for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> See the reason why they were so cautious 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>):
 
 <I>Because they feared the Jews.</I> It was not because they would put 
 an honour upon their son, by making him his own advocate, or because 
 they would have the matter cleared by the <I>best hand,</I> but because 
 they would shift trouble off from themselves, as most people are in 
 care to do, no matter on whom they throw it. Near is my friend, and 
 near is my child, and perhaps near is my religion, but <I>nearer is 
 myself--Proximus egomet mihi.</I> But Christianity teaches another
 lesson, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:24,Es+8:6">1 Cor. x. 24; Esth. viii. 6</A>.

 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) The <I>late law</I> which the sanhedrim had made. It was 
 agreed and enacted by their authority that, if any man within their 
 jurisdiction did <I>confess</I> that Jesus <I>was Christ, he should be 
 put out of the synagogue.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>a.</I>] The crime designed to be punished, and so prevented, by 
 this statute, and that was embracing Jesus of Nazareth as the promised 
 Messiah, and manifesting this by any overt-act, which amounted to a 
 confessing of him. They themselves did expect a Messiah, but they could 
 by no means bear to think that this Jesus should be he, nor admit the 
 question whether he were or no, for two reasons:--<I>First,</I> Because
 his precepts were all so contrary to their traditional <I>laws.</I> The 
 spiritual worship he prescribed overthrew their formalities; nor did 
 any thing more effectually destroy their singularity and 
 narrow-spiritedness than that universal charity which he taught; 
 humility and mortification, repentance and self-denial, were lessons 
 new to them, and sounded harsh and strange in their ears. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Because him promises and appearances were so contrary 
 to their traditional hopes. They expected a Messiah in outward pomp and 
 splendour, that should not only free the nation from the Roman yoke, 
 but advance the grandeur of the sanhedrim, and make all the members of 
 it princes and peers: and now to hear of a Messiah whose outward 
 circumstances were all mean and poor, whose first appearance and 
 principal residence were in Galilee, a despised province, who never 
 made his court to them, nor sought their favour, whose followers were 
 neither sword-men nor gown-men, nor any men of honour, but contemptible 
 fishermen, who proposed and promised no redemption but from sin, no 
 consolation of Israel but what is spiritual and divine, and at the same 
 time bade his followers expect the cross, and count upon persecution; 
 this was such a reproach to all the ideas they had formed and filled 
 the minds of their people with, such a blow to their power and 
 interest, and such a disappointment to all their hopes, that they could 
 never be reconciled to it, nor so much as give it a fair or patient 
 hearing, but, right or wrong, it must be <I>crushed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>b.</I>] The penalty to be inflicted for this crime. If any should 
 own himself a disciple of Jesus, he should be deemed and taken as an 
 apostate from the faith of the Jewish church, and a rebel and traitor 
 against the government of it, and should therefore be <I>put out of the 
 synagogue,</I> as one that had rendered himself unworthy of the 
 honours, and incapable of the privileges, of their church; he should be 
 excommunicated, and expelled the commonwealth of Israel. Nor was this 
 merely an ecclesiastical censure, which a man that made no conscience 
 of their authority might slight, but it was, in effect, an 
 <I>outlawry,</I> which excluded a man from civil commerce and deprived 
 him of his liberty and property. Note, <I>First,</I> Christ's holy 
 religion, from its first rise, has been opposed by penal laws made 
 against the professors of it; as if men's consciences would otherwise 
 <I>naturally</I> embrace it, this unnatural force has been put upon 
 them. <I>Secondly,</I> The church's artillery, when the command of it 
 has fallen into ill hands, has often been turned against itself, and 
 ecclesiastical censures have been made to serve a carnal secular 
 interest. It is no new thing to see those cast out of the synagogue 
 that were the greatest ornaments and blessings of it, and to hear those 
 that expelled them say, <I>The Lord be glorified,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5">Isa. lxvi. 5</A>.

 Now of this edict it is said,

 1. That the Jews had agreed it, or <I>conspired</I> it. Their
 consultation and communion herein were a perfect conspiracy against the
 crown and dignity of the Redeemer, against the Lord and his Anointed.
 
 2. That they had already agreed it. Though he had been but a few
 months in any public character among them, and, one would think, in so 
 short a time could not have made them jealous of him, yet thus early 
 were they aware of his growing interest, and already agreed to do their 
 utmost to suppress it. He had lately made his escape out of the temple, 
 and, when they saw themselves baffled in their attempts to take him, 
 they presently took this course, to make it penal for any body to own 
 him. Thus unanimous and thus expeditious are the enemies of the church, 
 and their counsels; but he that <I>sits in heaven laughs at them,</I> 
 and <I>has them in derision,</I> and so may we.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) The influence which this law had upon the parents of the 
 blind man. They declined saying any thing of Christ, and shuffled it 
 off to their son, <I>because they feared the Jews.</I> Christ had 
 incurred the frowns of the government to do their son a kindness, but 
 they would not incur them to do him any honour. Note, <I>The fear of 
 man brings a snare</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:25">Prov. xxix. 25</A>),

 and often makes people deny and disown Christ, and his truths and ways, 
 and act against their consciences. Well, the parents have thus 
 disentangled themselves, and are discharged from any further 
 attendance; let us now go on with the examination of the man himself; 
 the doubt of the Pharisees, whether he was <I>born blind,</I> was put 
 out of doubt <I>by them;</I> and therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They enquired of <I>him</I> concerning the <I>manner of the 
 cure,</I> and made their remarks upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The same question which his neighbours had put to him <I>now again 
 the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight.</I> This they 
 enquired not with any sincere desire to find out the truth, by tracing 
 the report to the original, but with a desire to find an occasion 
 against Christ; for, if the man should relate the matter fully, they 
 would prove Christ a sabbath-breaker; if he should vary from his former 
 story, they would have some colour to suspect the whole to be a 
 collusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The same answer, in effect, which he had before given to his 
 neighbours, he here repeats to the Pharisees: <I>He put clay upon mine 
 eyes, and I washed, and do see.</I> He does not here speak of the 
 making of the clay, for indeed he had not seen it made. That 
 circumstance was not essential, and might give the Pharisees most 
 occasion against him, and therefore he waives it. In the former account 
 he said, <I>I washed, and received sight;</I> but lest they should 
 think it was only a glimpse for the present, which a heated imagination 
 might fancy itself to have, he now says, "<I>I do see:</I> it is a 
 complete and lasting cure."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The remarks made upon this story were very different, and 
 occasioned a debate in the court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Some took this occasion to censure and condemn Christ for 
 what he had done. Some of the Pharisees said, <I>This man is not of 
 God,</I> as he pretends, <I>because he keepeth not the sabbath day.</I> 
 
 1. The doctrine upon which this censure is grounded is very true--that
 those <I>are not of God</I>--those pretenders to prophecy not <I>sent of
 God,</I> those pretenders to saintship not <I>born of God</I>--who do
 not <I>keep the sabbath day.</I> Those that are of God will <I>keep the 
 commandments of God;</I> and this is his commandment, that we sanctify 
 the sabbath. Those that are of God keep up communion with God, and 
 delight to hear from him, and speak to him, and therefore will observe 
 the sabbath, which is a day appointed for intercourse with heaven. The 
 sabbath is called a <I>sign,</I> for the sanctifying of it is a sign of 
 a sanctified heart, and the profaning of it a sign of a profane heart. 
 But, 

 2. The application of it to our Saviour is very unjust, for he did
 religiously observe the sabbath day, and never in any instance violated 
 it, never did otherwise than <I>well</I> on the sabbath day. He did not 
 keep the sabbath according to the tradition of the elders and the 
 superstitious observances of the Pharisees, but he kept it according to 
 the command of God, and therefore, no doubt, he was of God, and his 
 miracles proved him to be <I>Lord also of the sabbath day.</I> Note, 
 much unrighteous and uncharitable judging is occasioned by men's making 
 the rules of religion more strict than God has made them, and adding 
 their own fancies to God's appointments, as the Jews here, in the case 
 of sabbath-sanctification. We ourselves may forbear such and such 
 things, on the sabbath day, as we find a distraction to us, and we do 
 well, but we must not therefore tie up others to the same strictness.
 Every thing that we take for a rule of practice must not presently be 
 made a rule of judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Others spoke in his favour, and very pertinently 
 urged, <I>How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?</I> It seems 
 that even in this <I>council of the ungodly</I> there were some that 
 were capable of a <I>free thought,</I> and were witnesses for Christ, 
 even in the midst of his enemies. The matter of fact was plain, that 
 this was a true miracle, the more it was searched into the more it was 
 cleared; and this brought his former similar works to mind, and gave 
 occasion to speak magnificently of them, <B><I>toiauta 
 semeia</I></B>--<I>such great signs,</I> so many, so evident. And the
 inference from it is very natural: Such things as these could never be 
 done by a <I>man that is a sinner,</I> that is, not by any mere man, in 
 his own name, and by his own power; or, rather, not by one that is a 
 cheat or an imposter, and in that sense a a sinner; such a one may 
 indeed show some <I>signs and lying wonders,</I> but not such signs and 
 true wonders as Christ wrought. How could a man produce such divine 
 credentials, if he had not a divine commission? Thus there was a 
 <I>division among them, a schism,</I> so the word is; they clashed in 
 their opinion, a warm debate arose, and the <I>house divided</I> upon 
 it. Thus God defeats the counsels of his enemies by dividing them; and 
 by such testimonies as these given against the malice of persecutors, 
 and the rubs they meet with, their designs against the church are 
 sometimes rendered ineffectual and always inexcusable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. After their enquiry concerning the cure, we must observe their 
 enquiry concerning the <I>author</I> of it. And here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What the man said of him, in answer to their enquiry. They ask him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 "<I>What sayest thou of him, seeing that he has opened thine eyes?</I> 
 What dost thou think of his doing this? And what idea hast thou of him 
 that did it?" If he should speak <I>slightly</I> of Christ, in answer 
 to this, as he might be tempted to do, to please them, now that he was 
 in their hands, as his parents had done--if he should say, "I know not 
 what to make of him; he may be a conjuror for aught I know, or some 
 mountebank"--they would have triumphed in it. Nothing confirms
 Christ's enemies in their enmity to him so much as the slights put upon 
 him by those that have passed for his friends. But, if he should speak 
 honourably of Christ, they would prosecute him upon their new law, 
 which did not except, no, not his own patient; they would make him an 
 example, and so deter others from applying to Christ for cures, for 
 which, though they came cheap from Christ, yet they would make them pay 
 dearly. Or perhaps Christ's friends proposed to have the man's own 
 sentiments concerning his physician, and were willing to know, since he 
 appeared to be a sensible man, what he thought of him. Note, Those 
 whose eyes Christ has opened know best what to say of him, and have 
 great reason, upon all occasions, to say well of him. What think we of 
 Christ? To this question the poor man makes a short, plain, and direct 
 answer: "<I>He is a prophet,</I> he is one inspired and sent of God to 
 preach, and work miracles, and deliver to the world a divine message." 
 There had been no prophets among the Jews for three hundred years; yet 
 they did not conclude that they should have no more, for they knew that 
 he was yet to come who should <I>seal up vision and prophecy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24">Dan. ix. 24</A>.

 It should seem, this man had not any thoughts that Christ was the
 Messiah, the great prophet, but one of the same rank with the other 
 prophets. The woman of Samaria concluded he was <I>a prophet</I> before 
 she had any thought of his being the Messiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:19"><I>ch.</I> iv. 19</A>);

 so this blind man thought well of Christ according to the light he had,
 though he did not think well enough of him; but, being faithful in what 
 he had already attained to, God revealed even <I>that</I> unto him. 
 This poor blind beggar had a clearer judgment of the things pertaining 
 to the kingdom of God, and saw further into the proofs of a divine 
 mission, than the <I>masters in Israel,</I> that assumed an authority 
 to judge of prophets.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What they said of him, in reply to the man's testimony. Having in 
 vain attempted to invalidate the evidence of the fact, and finding that 
 indeed a <I>notable miracle was wrought,</I> and they <I>could not deny 
 it,</I> they renew their attempt to banter it, and run it down, and do 
 all they can to shake the good opinion the man had of him that opened 
 his eyes, and to convince him that Christ was a bad man 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):
 
 <I>Give God the praise, we know that this man is a sinner.</I> Two ways 
 this is understood: 

 [1.] By way of <I>advice,</I> to take heed of ascribing the praise of 
 his cure to a sinful man, but to give it all to God, to whom it was 
 due. Thus, under colour of zeal for the honour of God, they rob Christ 
 of his honour, as those do who will not worship Christ as God, under 
 pretence of zeal for this great truth, that there is but one God to be 
 worshipped; whereas this is his declared will, that all men should 
 <I>honour the Son even as they honour the Father;</I> and in confessing 
 that Christ is Lord we <I>give glory to God the Father.</I> When God 
 makes use of men that are sinners as instruments of good to us, we must 
 <I>give God the glory,</I> for every creature is that to us which he 
 makes it to be; and yet there is gratitude owing to the instruments. It 
 was a good word, <I>Give God the praise,</I> but here it was ill used; 
 and there seems to be this further in it, "This man is <I>a sinner,</I> 
 a <I>bad man,</I> and therefore give the praise so much the more to 
 God, who could work by such an instrument." 

 [2.] By way of <I>adjuration;</I> so some take it. "We know (though
 thou dost not, who hast but lately come, as it were, into a new world) 
 that this man is <I>a sinner,</I> a great impostor, and cheats the 
 country; this we are sure of, therefore <I>give God praise</I>" (as 
 Joshua said to Achan) "by making an ingenuous confession of the fraud 
 and collusion which we are confident there is in this matter; in God's 
 name, man, tell the truth." Thus is God's name abused in papal 
 inquisitions, when by oaths, <I>ex officio,</I> they extort accusations 
 of <I>themselves</I> from the <I>innocent,</I> and of <I>others</I> 
 from the <I>ignorant.</I> See how basely they speak of the Lord Jesus: 
 <I>We know that this man is a sinner,</I> is a man of sin. In which we 
 may observe, <I>First,</I> Their insolence and pride. They would not
 have it thought, when they asked the man what he thought of him, that 
 they needed information; nay, they know very well that he is a sinner, 
 and nobody can convince them of the contrary. He had challenged them to 
 their faces

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:46"><I>ch.</I> viii. 46</A>)

 to <I>convince him of sin,</I> and they had nothing to say; but now
 behind his back they speak of him as a malefactor, convicted upon the 
 notorious evidence of the fact. Thus false accusers make up in 
 confidence what is wanting in proof. <I>Secondly,</I> The injury and 
 indignity hereby done to the Lord Jesus. When he became man, he took 
 upon him the form not only of a <I>servant,</I> but of a <I>sinner</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Rom. viii. 3</A>),

 and passed for a sinner in common with the rest of mankind. Nay, he
 was represented as a sinner of the first magnitude, a sinner above all 
 men; and, being <I>made sin for us,</I> he despised even this 
 shame.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The debate that arose between the Pharisees and this poor man 
 concerning Christ. They say, <I>He is a sinner;</I> he says, <I>He is a 
 prophet.</I> As it is an encouragement to those who are concerned for 
 the cause of Christ to hope that it shall never be lost for want of 
 witnesses, when they find a poor blind beggar picked up from the 
 way-side, and made a witness for Christ, to the faces of his most 
 impudent enemies; so it is an encouragement to those who are called out 
 to witness for Christ to find with what prudence and courage this man 
 managed his defence, according to the promise, <I>It shall be given you 
 in that same hour what you shall speak.</I> Though he had never seen 
 Jesus, he had felt his grace. Now in the parley between the Pharisees 
 and this poor man we may observe three steps:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He sticks to the certain matter of fact the evidence of which they 
 endeavour to shake. That which is doubtful is best resolved into that 
 which is plain, and therefore, 

 [1.] He adheres to that which to himself at least, and to his own 
 satisfaction, was past dispute 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>Whether he be a sinner or no I know not,</I> I will not now stand 
 to dispute, nor need I, the matter is plain, and though I should 
 altogether hold my peace would speak for itself;" or, as it might 
 better be rendered, "<I>If he be a sinner, I know it not,</I> I see no 
 reason to say so, but the contrary; for this <I>one thing I know,</I> 
 and can be more sure of than you can be of that of which you are so 
 confident, <I>that whereas I was blind, now I see,</I> and therefore 
 must not only say that he has been a good friend to me, but that he is 
 a <I>prophet;</I> I am both able and bound to speak well of him." Now 
 here, <I>First,</I> He tacitly reproves their great assurance of the 
 ill character they gave of the blessed Jesus: "You say that you 
 <I>know</I> him to be a <I>sinner;</I> I, who know him as well as you 
 do, cannot give any such character." <I>Secondly,</I> He boldly relies 
 upon his own experience of the power and goodness of the holy Jesus, 
 and resolves to abide by it. There is no disputing against experience, 
 nor arguing a man out of his senses; here is one that is properly an 
 eyewitness of the power and grace of Christ, though he had never seen 
 him. Note, As Christ's mercies are most valued by those that have felt 
 the want of them, that have been blind and now see, so the most 
 powerful and durable affections to Christ are those that arise from an 
 experimental knowledge of him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:1,Ac+4:20">1 John i. 1; Acts iv. 20</A>.

 The poor man does not here give a nice account of the method of the 
 cure, nor pretend to describe it <I>philosophically,</I> but in short, 
 <I>Whereas I was blind, now I see.</I> Thus in the work of grace in the 
 soul, though we cannot tell when and how, by what instruments and by 
 what steps and advances, the blessed change was wrought, yet we may 
 take the comfort of it if we can say, through grace, "<I>Whereas I was 
 blind, now I see.</I> I did live a carnal, worldly, sensual life, but, 
 thanks be to God, it is now otherwise with me,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:8">Eph. v. 8</A>.

 [2.] They endeavour to baffle and stifle the evidence by a needless
 repetition of their enquiries into it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>What did he to thee? How opened he thine eyes?</I> They asked these
 questions, <I>First,</I> Because they wanted something to say, and 
 would rather speak <I>impertinently</I> than seem to be silenced or run 
 a-ground. Thus eager disputants, that resolve they will have the last 
 word, by such vain repetitions, to avoid the shame of being silenced, 
 make themselves accountable for many idle words. <I>Secondly,</I>
 Because they hoped, by putting the man upon repeating his evidence, to 
 catch him tripping in it, or wavering, and then they would think they 
 had gained a good point.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He upbraids them with their obstinate infidelity and invincible 
 prejudices, and they revile him as a disciple of Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:27-29"><I>v.</I> 27-29</A>,

 where the man is more bold with them and they are more sharp upon him 
 than before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The man boldly upbraids them with their wilful and unreasonable 
 opposition to the evidence of this miracle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He would not gratify them with a repetition of the story, but bravely 
 replied, <I>I have told you already, and you did not hear, wherefore 
 would you hear it again, will you also be his disciples?</I> Some think 
 that he spoke <I>seriously,</I> and really expecting that they would be 
 convinced. "He had many disciples, I will be one, will you also come
 in among them?" Some zealous young Christians see so much reason for 
 religion that they are ready to think every one will presently be on 
 their mind. But it rather seems to be spoken <I>ironically: "Will you
 be his disciples?</I> No, I know you abhor the thoughts of it; why then 
 should you desire to hear that which will either make you his disciples 
 or leave you inexcusable if you be not?" Those that wilfully shut their 
 eyes against the light, as these Pharisees here did, <I>First,</I> Make 
 themselves contemptible and base, as these here did, who were justly 
 exposed by this poor man for denying the conclusion, when they had 
 nothing to object against either of the premises. <I>Secondly,</I> They 
 forfeit all the benefit of further instructions and means of knowledge 
 and conviction: they that have been told once, and <I>would not 
 hear,</I> why should they be told it again? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:9">Jer. li. 9</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:14">Matt. x. 14</A>.
 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> They hereby <I>receive the grace of God in vain.</I>
 This implied in that, "<I>Will you be his disciples?</I> No, you 
 resolve you will not; why then would you hear it again, only that you 
 may be his accusers and persecutors?" Those who will not see cause to 
 embrace Christ, and join with his followers, yet, one would think, 
 should see cause enough not to hate and persecute him and them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] For this they scorn and revile him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 When they could not resist the wisdom and spirit by which he spoke, 
 they broke out into a passion, and scolded him, began to call names, 
 and give him ill language. See what Christ's faithful witnesses must 
 expect from the adversaries of his truth and cause; let them count upon 
 <I>all manner of evil</I> to be said of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:11">Matt. v. 11</A>.

 The method commonly taken by unreasonable man is to make out with
 railing what is wanting in truth and reason.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> They taunted this man for his affection to Christ; they 
 said, <I>Thou art his disciple,</I> as if that were reproach enough, 
 and they could not say worse of him. "We scorn to be his disciples, and 
 will leave that preferment to thee, and such scoundrels as thou art." 
 They do what they can to put Christ's religion in an ill name, and to 
 represent the profession of it as a contemptible scandalous thing. They 
 <I>reviled him.</I> The Vulgate reads it, <I>maledixerunt eum--they
 cursed him;</I> and what was their curse? It was this, <I>Be thou his 
 disciple.</I> "May such a curse" (saith St. Augustine here) "ever be on 
 us and on our children!" If we take our measures of credit and disgrace 
 from the sentiment or rather clamours of a blind deluded world, we 
 shall <I>glory in our shame,</I> and be <I>ashamed of our glory.</I> 
 They had no reason to call this man a <I>disciple of</I> Christ, he had 
 neither seen him nor heard him preach, only he had spoken favourably of 
 a kindness Christ had done him, and this they could not bear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> They gloried in their relation to Moses as their 
 Master: "<I>We are Moses's disciples,</I> and do not either need or 
 desire any other teacher." Note, 

 1. Carnal professors of religion are very apt to trust to, and be proud
 of, the dignities and privileges of their profession, while they are 
 strangers to the principles and powers of their religion. These 
 Pharisees had before boasted of their good parentage: <I>We are 
 Abraham's seed;</I> here they boast of their good education, <I>We are 
 Moses's disciples;</I> as if these would save them. 

 2. It is sad to see how much one part of religion is opposed, under
 colour of zeal for another part. There was a perfect harmony between 
 Christ and Moses; Moses prepared for Christ, and Christ perfected 
 Moses, so that they might be disciples of Moses, and become the 
 disciples of Christ too; and yet they here put them in opposition, nor 
 could they have persecuted Christ but under the shelter of the abused 
 name of Moses. Thus those who gainsay the doctrine of free grace value
 themselves as promoters of man's duty, <I>We are Moses's disciples;</I> 
 while, on the other hand, those that cancel the obligation of the law 
 value themselves as the assertors of free grace, and as if none were 
 the disciples of Jesus but they; whereas, if we rightly understand the 
 matter, we shall see God's grace and man's duty meet together and kiss 
 and befriend each other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> They gave some sort of reason for their adhering to 
 Moses against Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>We know that God spoke unto Moses; as for this fellow, we know not 
 whence he is.</I> But did they not know that among other things which 
 God spoke unto Moses this was one, that they must expect another 
 prophet, and further revelation of the mind of God? yet, when our Lord 
 Jesus, pursuant to what God said to Moses, did appear, and gave 
 sufficient proofs of his being that prophet, under pretence of sticking 
 to the old religion, and the established church, they not only 
 forfeited, but forsook, their own mercies. In this argument of their 
 observe, 

 1. How impertinently they allege, in defence of their enmity to Christ,
 that which none of his followers ever denied: <I>We know that God spoke 
 unto Moses,</I> and, thanks be to God, we know it too, more plainly to 
 Moses than to any other of the prophets; but what then? God spoke to
 Moses, and does it therefore follow that Jesus is an impostor? Moses 
 was a prophet also? Moses spoke honourably of Jesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:46"><I>ch.</I> v. 46</A>),

 and Jesus spoke honourably of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:29">Luke xvi. 29</A>);

 they were both faithful in the same house of God, Moses as a servant,
 Christ as a Son; therefore their pleading Moses' divine warrant in 
 opposition to Christ's was an artifice, to make unthinking people 
 believe it was as certain that Jesus was a false prophet as that Moses 
 was a true one; whereas they were both true. 

 2. How absurdly they urge their ignorance of Christ as a reason to
 justify their contempt of him: <I>As for this fellow.</I> Thus 
 scornfully do they speak of the blessed Jesus, as if they did not think 
 it worth while to charge their memories with a name so inconsiderable; 
 they express themselves with as much disdain of the Shepherd of Israel 
 as if he had not been worthy to be <I>set with the dogs of their flock: 
 As for this fellow,</I> this sorry fellow, <I>we know not whence he 
 is.</I> They looked upon themselves to have the key of knowledge, that 
 none must preach without a license first had and obtained from them, 
 under the seal of their court. They expected that all who set up for 
 teachers should apply to them, and give them satisfaction, which this 
 Jesus had never done, never so far owned their power as to ask their 
 leave, and therefore they concluded him an intruder, and one that came 
 not in by the door: <I>They knew not whence</I> nor what <I>he was,</I> 
 and therefore concluded him a <I>sinner;</I> whereas those we know 
 little of we should judge charitably of; but proud and narrow souls 
 will think none good but themselves, and those that are in their 
 interest. It was not long ago that the Jews had made the contrary to 
 this an objection against Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:27"><I>ch.</I> vii. 27</A>):

 <I>We know this man whence he is, but when Christ comes no man knows
 whence he is.</I> Thus they could with the greatest assurance either 
 affirm or deny the same thing, according as they saw it would serve 
 their turn. They <I>knew not whence he was;</I> and whose fault was 
 that? 

 (1.) It is certain that they ought to have enquired. The Messiah was to 
 appear about this time, and it concerned them to look about them, and 
 examine every indication; but these priests, like those, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:6">Jer. ii. 6</A>,

 <I>said not, Where is the Lord?</I> 

 (2.) It is certain that they might have known whence he was, might not 
 only have known, by searching the register, that he was born in 
 Bethlehem; but by enquiring into his doctrine, miracles, and 
 conversation, they might have known that he was sent of God, and had 
 better orders, a better commission, and far better instructions, than 
 any they could give him. See the absurdity of infidelity. Men will not 
 know the doctrine of Christ because they are resolved they will not 
 believe it, and then pretend they do not believe it because they do not 
 know it. Such ignorance and unbelief, which support one another,
 aggravate one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He reasons with them concerning this matter, and they 
 excommunicate him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The poor man, finding that he had reason on his side, which they 
 could not answer, grows more bold, and, in prosecution of his argument, 
 is very close upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He wonders at their obstinate infidelity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>);

 not at all daunted by their frowns, nor shaken by their confidence, he 
 bravely answered, "<I>Why, herein is a marvelous thing,</I> the 
 strangest instance of wilful ignorance that ever was heard of among men 
 that pretend to sense, that <I>you know not whence he is,</I> and yet 
 he has opened mine eyes." Two things he wonders at:--

 1. That they should be strangers to a man so <I>famous.</I> He that
 could open the eyes of the blind must certainly be a considerable man, 
 and worth taking notice of. The Pharisees were inquisitive men, had a
 large correspondence and acquaintance, thought themselves the eyes of 
 the church and its watchmen, and yet that they should talk as if they 
 thought it below them to take cognizance of such a man as this, and 
 have conversation with him, this is a strange thing indeed. There are 
 many who pass for learned and knowing men, who understand business, and 
 can talk sensibly in other things, who yet are ignorant, to a wonder, 
 of the doctrine of Christ, who have no concern, no, not so much as a 
 curiosity, to acquaint themselves with that which the <I>angels desire 
 to look into.</I> 

 2. That they should question the divine mission of one that had
 undoubtedly wrought a divine miracle. When they said, <I>We know not 
 whence he is,</I> they meant, "We know not any proof that his doctrine 
 and ministry are from heaven." "Now this is strange," saith the poor 
 man, "that the miracle wrought upon me has not convinced you, and put 
 the matter out of doubt,--that you, whose education and studies give 
 you advantages above others of discerning the things of God, should 
 thus shut your eyes against the light." It is a <I>marvelous work and 
 wonder, when the wisdom of the wise thus perisheth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:14">Isa. xxix. 14</A>),

 that they deny the truth of that of which they cannot gainsay the 
 evidence. Note, 

 (1.) The unbelief of those who enjoy the means of knowledge and 
 conviction is indeed a marvelous thing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:6">Mark vi. 6</A>.

 (2.) Those who have themselves experienced the power and grace of the 
 Lord Jesus do especially wonder at the wilfulness of those who reject 
 him, and, having such good thoughts of him themselves, are amazed that 
 others have not. Had Christ opened the eyes of the Pharisees, they 
 would not have doubted his being a prophet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He argues strongly against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:31-33"><I>v.</I> 31-33</A>.

 They had determined concerning Jesus that he was not of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 but was a <I>sinner</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 in answer to which the man here proves not only that he was <I>not a 
 sinner</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 
 but that he was <I>of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> He argues here, 

 (<I>a.</I>) With great knowledge. Though he could not read a letter of 
 the book, he was well acquainted with the scripture and the things of 
 God; he had wanted the sense of seeing, yet had well improved that of 
 hearing, by which faith cometh; yet this would not have served him if 
 he had not had an extraordinary presence of God with him, and special 
 aids of his Spirit, upon this occasion.

 (<I>b.</I>) With great zeal for the honour of Christ, whom he could not 
 endure to hear run down, and evil spoken of. 

 (<I>c.</I>) With great boldness, and courage, and undauntedness, not 
 terrified by the proudest of his adversaries. Those that are ambitious 
 of the favours of God must not be afraid of the frowns of men. "See 
 here," saith Dr. Whitby, "a blind man and unlearned judging more 
 rightly of divine things than the whole learned council of the 
 Pharisees, whence we learn that we are not always to be led by the 
 authority of councils, popes, or bishops; and that it is not absurd for 
 laymen sometimes to vary from their opinions, these overseers being 
 sometimes guilty of great oversights."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> His argument may be reduced into form, somewhat like that of 
 David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:18-20">Ps. lxvi. 18-20</A>.

 The proposition in David's argument is, <I>If I regard iniquity in my
 heart, God will not hear me;</I> here it is to the same purport, <I>God 
 heareth not sinners:</I> the assumption there is, <I>But verily God 
 hath heard me;</I> here it is, Verily God hath heard Jesus, he hath 
 been honoured with the doing of that which was never done before: the 
 conclusion there is to the honour, <I>Blessed be God;</I> here to the 
 honour of the Lord Jesus, He is <I>of God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) He lays it down for an undoubted truth that none but good 
 men are the favourites of heaven 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>Now we know,</I> you know it as well as I, <I>that God heareth not 
 sinners;</I> but <I>if any man be a worshipper of God, and does his 
 will, him he heareth.</I> Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>a.</I>] The assertions, rightly understood, are true. <I>First,</I> 
 Be it spoken to the terror of the wicked, <I>God heareth not 
 sinners,</I> that is, such sinners as the Pharisees meant when they 
 said of Christ, <I>He is a sinner,</I> one that, under the shelter of 
 God's name, advanced the devil's interest. This bespeaks no 
 discouragement to repenting returning sinners, but to those that go on 
 still in their trespasses, that make their prayers not only consistent 
 with, but subservient to, their sins, as the hypocrites do; God will 
 not <I>hear</I> them, he will not own them, nor give an answer of peace 
 to their prayers. <I>Secondly,</I> Be it spoken to the comfort of the 
 righteous, <I>If any man be a worshipper of God, and does his will, him 
 he heareth.</I> Here is, 

 1. The complete character of a good man: he is one that <I>worships
 God,</I> and <I>does his will;</I> he is constant in his devotions at 
 set times, and regular in his conversation at all times. He is one that 
 makes it his business to glorify his Creator by the solemn adoration of 
 his name and a sincere obedience to his will and law; both must go 
 together. 

 2. The unspeakable comfort of such a man: him <I>God hears;</I> hears
 his complaints, and relieves him; hears his appeals, and rights him; 
 hears his praises, and accepts them; hears his prayers, and answers 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:15">Ps. xxxiv. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>b.</I>] The application of these truths is very pertinent to prove 
 that he, at whose word such a divine power was put forth as cured one 
 born blind, was not a bad man, but, having manifestly such an interest 
 in the holy God as that he <I>heard him always</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:31,32"><I>ch.</I> ix. 31, 32</A>),

 was certainly a holy one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) He magnifies the miracles which Christ had wrought, to 
 strengthen the argument the more 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes 
 of one that was born blind.</I> This is to show either,

 [<I>a.</I>] That it was a true miracle, and above the power of nature; 
 it was never heard that any man, by the use of natural means, had cured 
 one that was <I>born blind;</I> no doubt, this man and his parents had 
 been very inquisitive into cases of this nature, whether any such had 
 been helped, and could hear of none, which enabled him to speak this 
 with the more assurance. Or,

 [<I>b.</I>] That it was an extraordinary miracle, and beyond the 
 precedents of former miracles; neither Moses nor any of the prophets, 
 though they did great things, ever did such things as this, wherein 
 divine power and divine goodness seem to strive which should outshine.
 Moses wrought miraculous plagues, but Christ wrought miraculous cures.
 Note, <I>First,</I> The wondrous works of the Lord Jesus were such as 
 the like had never been done before. <I>Secondly,</I> It becomes those
 who have received mercy from God to magnify the mercies they have 
 received, and to speak honourably of them; not that thereby glory may 
 redound to themselves, and they may seem to be extraordinary favourites 
 of Heaven, but that God may have so much the more glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>c.</I>) He therefore concludes, <I>If this man were not of God, he 
 could no nothing,</I> that is, nothing extraordinary, no such thing as 
 <I>this;</I> and therefore, no doubt, he is <I>of God,</I> 
 notwithstanding his nonconformity to your traditions in the business of 
 the sabbath day. Note, What Christ did on earth sufficiently 
 demonstrated what he was in heaven; for, if he had not been sent of 
 God, he could not have wrought such miracles. It is true the man of sin 
 comes with <I>lying wonders,</I> but not with real miracles; it is 
 likewise supposed that a false prophet might, by divine permission, 
 give a <I>sign or a wonder</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:1,2">Deut. xiii. 1, 2</A>),

 yet the case is so put as that it would carry with it its own 
 confutation, for it is to enforce a temptation to serve other gods, 
 which was to set God <I>against himself.</I> It is true, likewise, that 
 many wicked people have in Christ's name done many wonderful works, 
 which did not prove those that wrought them to be of God, but him in 
 whose name they were wrought. We may each of us know by this whether we 
 are of God or no: <I>What do we?</I> What do we for God, for our souls, 
 in working out our salvation? What do we more than others?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The Pharisees, finding themselves unable either to answer his 
 reasonings or to bear them, fell foul upon him, and with a great deal 
 of pride and passion broke off the discourse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> What they <I>said.</I> Having nothing to reply to his 
 argument, they reflected upon his person: <I>Thou wast altogether born 
 in sin, and dost thou teach us?</I> They take that amiss which they had 
 reason to take kindly, and are cut to the heart with rage by that which 
 should have pricked them to the heart with penitence. Observe, 

 1. How they despised him, and what a severe censure they passed upon
 him: "<I>Thou wast not only born in sin,</I> as every man is, but 
 altogether so, wholly corrupt, and bearing about with thee in thy body 
 as well as in thy soul the marks of that corruption; thou wast one whom 
 nature <I>stigmatized.</I>" Had he still continued blind, it had been 
 barbarous to upbraid him with it, and thence to gather that he was more 
 deeply tainted with sin than other people; but it was most unjust to 
 take notice of it now that the cure had not only rolled away the 
 reproach of his blindness, but had <I>signalized</I> him as a favourite 
 of Heaven. Some take it thus: "Thou hast been a common beggar, and such 
 are too often common sinners, and thou hast, no doubt, been as bad as 
 any of them;" whereas by his discourse he had proved the contrary, and 
 had evinced a deep tincture of piety. But when proud imperious 
 Pharisees resolve to run a man down, any thing shall serve for a 
 pretence. 

 2. How they <I>disdain</I> to learn of him, or to receive instruction
 from him: <I>Dost thou teach us?</I> A mighty emphasis must be laid 
 here upon <I>thou</I> and <I>us.</I> "What! wilt <I>thou,</I> a silly 
 sorry fellow, ignorant and illiterate, that hast not seen the light of 
 the sun a day to an end, a beggar by the way-side, of the very dregs 
 and refuse of the town, wilt thou pretend to teach <I>us,</I> that are 
 the sages of the law and grandees of the church, that sit in Moses's 
 chair and are masters in Israel?" Note, Proud men scorn to be taught, 
 especially by their inferiors, whereas we should never think ourselves 
 too old, nor too wise, nor too good, to learn. Those that have much 
 wealth would have more; and why not those that have much knowledge? And 
 those are to be valued by whom we may improve in learning. What a poor 
 excuse was this for the Pharisees' infidelity, that it would be a 
 disparagement to them to be instructed, and informed, and convinced, by 
 such a silly fellow as this!</P>

 In these verses we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The tender care which our Lord Jesus took of this poor man 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):
 
 <I>When Jesus heard that they had cast him out</I> (for it is likely
 the town rang of it, and everybody cried out shame upon them for it), 
 then he <I>found him,</I> which implies his seeking him and looking 
 after him, that he might encourage and comfort him, 

 1. Because he had, to the best of his knowledge, spoken so very well,
 so bravely, so boldly, in defence of the Lord Jesus. Note, Jesus Christ 
 will be sure to stand by his witnesses, and own those that own him and 
 his truth and ways. Earthly princes neither do, nor can, take 
 cognizance of all that vindicate them and their government and 
 administration; but our Lord Jesus knows and observes all the faithful 
 testimonies we bear to him at any time, and a book of remembrance is 
 written, and it shall redound not only to our credit hereafter, but our 
 comfort now. 

 2. Because the Pharisees had cast him out and abused him. Besides the
 common regard which the righteous Judge of the world has to those who 
 suffer wrongfully

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:6">Ps. ciii. 6</A>),

 there is a particular notice taken of those that suffer in the cause of 
 Christ and for the testimony of a good conscience. Here was one poor 
 man suffering for Christ, and he took care that as his afflictions 
 abounded his consolations should <I>much more abound.</I> Note, 

 (1.) Though persecutors may exclude good men from their communion, yet 
 they cannot exclude them from communion with Christ, nor put them out 
 of the way of his visits. Happy are they who have a friend from whom 
 men cannot debar them. 

 (2.) Jesus Christ will graciously find and receive those who for his 
 sake are unjustly rejected and cast out by men. He will be a hiding 
 place to his outcasts, and appear, to the joy of those whom their 
 brethren hated and cast out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The comfortable converse Christ had with him, wherein he brings him 
 acquainted with the consolation of Israel. He had well improved the 
 knowledge he had, and now Christ gives him further instruction; for he 
 that is faithful in a little shall be entrusted with more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:12">Matt. xiii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Our Lord Jesus examines his faith: "<I>Dost thou believe on the Son 
 of God?</I> Dost thou give credit to the promises of the Messiah? Dost 
 thou expect his coming, and art thou ready to receive and embrace him 
 when he is manifested to thee?" This was that faith of the Son of God 
 by which the saints lived before his manifestation. Observe, 

 (1.) The Messiah is here called the <I>Son of God,</I> and so the Jews 
 had learned to call him from the prophecies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7,89:27">Ps. ii. 7; lxxxix. 27</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+Joh+1:49"><I>ch.</I> i. 49</A>,

 <I>Thou art the Son of God,</I> that is, the true Messiah. Those that
 expected the temporal kingdom of the Messiah delighted rather in 
 calling him the <I>Son of David,</I> which gave more countenance to 
 that expectation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:42">Matt. xxii. 42</A>.

 But Christ, that he might give us an idea of his kingdom, as purely
 spiritual and divine, calls himself the <I>Son of God,</I> and rather 
 <I>Son of man</I> in general than of David in particular.

 (2.) The desires and expectations of the Messiah, which the
 Old-Testament saints had, guided by and grounded upon the promise, were 
 graciously interpreted and accepted as their believing on the <I>Son of 
 God.</I> This faith Christ here enquires after: <I>Dost thou 
 believe?</I> Note, The great thing which is now required of us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:23">1 John iii. 23</A>),

 and which will shortly be enquired after concerning us, is our 
 <I>believing on the Son of God,</I> and by this we must stand or fall 
 for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The poor man solicitously enquires concerning the Messiah he was to 
 believe in, professing his readiness to embrace him and close with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</I> 

 (1.) Some think he did know that Jesus, who cured him, was the Son of 
 God, but did not know which was Jesus, and therefore, supposing this 
 person that talked with him to be a follower of Jesus, desired him to 
 do him the favour to direct him to his master; not that he might 
 satisfy his curiosity with the sight of him, but that he might the more 
 firmly believe in him, and profess his faith, and <I>know whom he had 
 believed.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:6,7,So+3:2,3">Cant. v. 6, 7; iii. 2, 3</A>.

 It is Christ only that can direct us to himself.

 (2.) Others think he did know that this person who talked with him was 
 Jesus, the same that cured him, whom he believed a great and good man 
 and a prophet, but did not yet know that he was the Son of God and the 
 true Messiah. "Lord, I believe there is a Christ to come; thou who hast 
 given me bodily sight, tell me, O tell me, who and where this Son of 
 God is." Christ's question intimated that the Messiah was come, and was 
 now among them, which he presently takes the hint of, and asks, 
 <I>Where is he, Lord?</I> The question was rational and just: <I>Who is 
 he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</I> For how could he believe in 
 one of whom he had not heard; the work of ministers is to tell us 
 <I>who the Son of God is,</I> that we may believe on him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:31"><I>ch.</I> xx. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Our Lord Jesus graciously reveals himself to him as that Son of God 
 on whom he must believe: <I>Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that 
 talketh with thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Thou needest not go far to find out the Son of God, <I>Behold the Word 
 is nigh thee.</I> We do not find that Christ did thus expressly, and in 
 so many words, reveal himself to any other as to this man here and to 
 the woman of <I>Samaria: I that speak unto thee am he.</I> He left 
 others to find out by arguments who he was, but to these weak and 
 foolish things of the world he chose to manifest himself, so as not to 
 the <I>wise and prudent.</I> Christ here describes himself to this man 
 by two things, which express his great favour to him:--

 (1.) <I>Thou hast seen him;</I> and he was much indebted to the Lord 
 Jesus for opening his eyes, that he might see him. Now he was made
 sensible, more than ever, what an unspeakable mercy it was to be cured 
 of his blindness, that he might see the Son of God, a sight which 
 rejoiced his heart more than that of the <I>light of this world.</I> 
 Note, The Greatest comfort of bodily eyesight is its serviceableness to 
 our faith and the interests of our souls. How contentedly might this 
 man have returned to his former blindness, like old Simeon, now that 
 his eyes had <I>seen God's salvation!</I> If we apply this to the 
 opening of the eyes of the mind, it intimates that spiritual sight is 
 given principally for this end, that we may see Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:6">2 Cor. iv. 6</A>.

 Can we say that by faith we have seen Christ, seen him in his beauty 
 and glory, in his ability and willingness to save, so seen him as to be 
 satisfied concerning him, to be satisfied in him? Let us give him the 
 praise, who opened our eyes.

 (2.) <I>It is he that talketh with thee;</I> and he was indebted to
 Christ for condescending to do this. He was not only favoured with a
 sight of Christ, but was admitted into fellowship and communion with 
 him. Great princes are willing to be <I>seen</I> by those whom yet they 
 will not vouchsafe to <I>talk with.</I> But Christ, by his word and 
 Spirit, talks with those whose desires are towards him, and in talking 
 with them manifests himself to them, as he did to the two disciples, 
 when he talked their hearts warm, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:32">Luke xxiv. 32</A>.

 Observe, This poor man was solicitously enquiring after the Saviour,
 when at the same time he saw him, and was talking with him. Note,
 Jesus Christ is often nearer the souls that seek him than they 
 themselves are aware of. Doubting Christians are sometimes saying, 
 <I>Where is the Lord?</I> and fearing that they are cast out from his 
 sight when at the same time it is he that <I>talks with them,</I> and 
 <I>puts strength into them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The poor man readily entertains this surprising revelation, and, in 
 a transport of joy and wonder, he said, <I>Lord, I believe, and he 
 worshipped him.</I> 

 (1.) He professed his faith in Christ: <I>Lord, I believe thee to be 
 the Son of God.</I> He would not dispute any thing that <I>he</I> said 
 who had shown such mercy to him, and wrought such a miracle for him, 
 nor doubt of the truth of a doctrine which was confirmed by such signs. 
 Believing with the heart, he thus confesses with the mouth; and now the 
 bruised reed was become a cedar. 

 (2.) He paid his homage to him: <I>He worshipped him,</I> not only gave 
 him the civil respect due to a great man, and the acknowledgments owing 
 to a kind benefactor, but herein gave him divine honour, and worshipped 
 him as the <I>Son of God</I> manifested in the flesh. None but God is 
 to be worshipped; so that in worshipping Jesus he owned him to be God. 
 Note, True faith will show itself in a humble adoration of the Lord 
 Jesus. Those who believe in him will see all the reason in the world
 to worship him. We never read any more of this man; but, it is very 
 likely, from henceforth he became a constant follower of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>39  And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that
 they which see not might see; and that they which see might be
 made blind.
 &nbsp; 40  And <I>some</I> of the Pharisees which were with him heard these
 words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?
 &nbsp; 41  Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no
 sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ, having spoken comfort to the poor man that was persecuted, here 
 speaks conviction to his persecutors, a specimen of the distributions 
 of trouble and rest at the great day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:6,7">2 Thess. i. 6, 7</A>.

 Probably this was not immediately after his discourse with the man, but
 he took the next opportunity that offered itself to address the 
 Pharisees. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The account Christ gives of his design in coming into the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 "<I>For judgment I am</I> come to order and administer the great 
 affairs of the <I>kingdom of God among men,</I> and am invested with a 
 judicial power in order thereunto, to be executed in conformity to the 
 wise counsels of God, and in pursuance of them." What Christ spoke, he 
 spoke not as a preacher in the pulpit, but as a king upon the throne, 
 and a judge upon the bench.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His business into the world was <I>great;</I> he came to keep the 
 assizes and general goal-delivery. He came <I>for judgment,</I> that 
 is, 

 (1.) To preach a doctrine and a law which would try men, and 
 effectually discover and distinguish them, and would be completely 
 fitted, in all respects, to be the rule of government now and of 
 judgment shortly. 

 (2.) To put a difference between men, by revealing the thoughts of many 
 hearts, and laying open men's true characters, by this one test, 
 whether they were well or ill affected to him. 

 (3.) To change the face of government in his church, to abolish the 
 Jewish economy, to take down that fabric, which, though erected for the 
 time by the hand of God himself, yet by lapse of time was antiquated, 
 and by the incurable corruptions of the managers of it was become 
 rotten and dangerous, and to erect a new building by another model, to 
 institute new ordinances and offices, to abrogate Judaism and enact 
 Christianity; <I>for</I> this <I>judgment he came into the world,</I> 
 and it was a great revolution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This great truth he explains by a metaphor borrowed from the miracle 
 which he had lately wrought. That <I>those who see not might see, and 
 that those who see might be made blind.</I> Such a difference of 
 Christ's coming is often spoken of; to some his gospel is a <I>savour 
 of life unto life,</I> to others of <I>death unto death.</I> 

 (1.) This is applicable to nations and people, that the Gentiles, who 
 had long been destitute of the light of divine revelation, might see 
 it; and the Jews, who had long enjoyed it, might have the things of 
 their peace hid from their eyes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:10,2:23">Hos. i. 10; ii. 23</A>.

 The Gentiles see a great light, while blindness is <I>happened unto 
 Israel,</I> and their <I>eyes are darkened.</I> 

 (2.) To particular sons. Christ came into the world,

 [1.] Intentionally and designedly to give sight to those that were
 spiritually blind; by his word to reveal the object, and by his Spirit 
 to heal the organ, that many precious souls might be turned <I>from 
 darkness to light.</I> He came <I>for judgment,</I> that is, to set 
 those at liberty from their dark prison that were willing to be 
 released, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1">Isa. lxi. 1</A>.

 [2.] Eventually, and in the issue, <I>that those who see might be made
 blind;</I> that those who have a high conceit of their own wisdom, and 
 set up that in contradiction to divine revelation, might be sealed up 
 in ignorance and infidelity. The preaching of the cross was 
 foolishness, and an infatuating think, to those who by wisdom <I>knew 
 not God.</I> Christ <I>came into the world for</I> this 
 <I>judgment,</I> to administer the affairs of a spiritual kingdom, 
 seated in men's minds. Whereas, in the Jewish church, the blessings and 
 judgments of God's government were mostly temporal, now the method of 
 administration should be changed; and as the good subjects of his 
 kingdom should be blessed with spiritual blessings in heavenly things, 
 such as arise from a due illumination of the mind, so the rebels should 
 be punished with spiritual plagues, not war, famine, and pestilence, as 
 formerly, but such as arise from a <I>judicial infatuation,</I> 
 hardness of heart, terror of conscience, strong delusions, vile 
 affections. In this way Christ will <I>judge between cattle and 
 cattle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:17,22">Ezek. xxxiv. 17, 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Pharisees' cavil at this. They were <I>with him,</I> not 
 desirous to learn any good from him, but to form evil against him; and 
 they said, <I>Are we blind also?</I> When Christ said that <I>those who 
 saw</I> should by his coming be made blind, they apprehended that he 
 meant them, who were the <I>seers</I> of the people, and valued 
 themselves on their <I>insight</I> and <I>foresight.</I> "Now," say 
 they, "we know that the common people are blind; but <I>are we blind 
 also?</I> What we? The rabbin, the doctors, the learned in the laws, 
 the graduates in the schools, <I>are we blind too?</I>" This is 
 <I>scandalum magnatum--a libel on the great.</I> Note, Frequently those
 that need reproof most, and deserve it best, though they have wit 
 enough to discern a <I>tacit</I> one, have not grace enough to bear a 
 <I>just</I> one. These Pharisees took this reproof for a reproach, as 
 those lawyers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:45">Luke xi. 45</A>):

 "<I>Are we blind also?</I> Darest thou say that we are blind, whose 
 judgment every one has such a veneration for, values, and yields to?" 
 Note, Nothing fortifies men's corrupt hearts more against the 
 convictions of the word, nor more effectually repels them, than the 
 good opinion, especially if it be a high opinion, which others have of 
 them; as if all that had gained applause with men must needs obtain 
 acceptance with God, than which nothing is more false and deceitful, 
 for God sees not as man sees.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's answer to this cavil, which, if it did not convince them, 
 yet silenced them: <I>If you were blind you should have no sin; but now 
 you say, We see, therefore your sin remaineth.</I> They gloried that 
 they were not blind, as the common people, were not so credulous and 
 manageable as they, but would <I>see with their own eyes,</I> having 
 abilities, as they thought, sufficient for their own guidance, so that 
 they needed not any body to lead them. This very thing which they 
 gloried in, Christ here tells them, was their shame and ruin. For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>If you were blind, you would have no sin.</I> 

 (1.) "If you had been really ignorant, your sin had not been so deeply 
 aggravated, nor would you have had so much sin to answer for as now you 
 have. If you were blind, as the poor Gentiles are, and many of your own 
 poor subjects, from whom you have taken the key of knowledge, you would 
 have had comparatively <I>no sin.</I>" The times of ignorance God 
 <I>winked at;</I> invincible ignorance, though it does not justify sin, 
 excuses it, and lessens the guilt. It will be more tolerable with those 
 that perish for lack of vision than with those that <I>rebel against 
 the light.</I> 

 (2.) "If you had been sensible of your own blindness, if when you would 
 see nothing else you could have seen the need of one to lead you, you 
 would soon have accepted Christ as your guide, and then you would 
 <I>have had no sin,</I> you would have submitted to an evangelical 
 righteousness, and have been put into a justified state." Note, Those 
 that are convinced of their disease are in a fair way to be cured, for 
 there is not a greater hindrance to the salvation of souls than 
 self-sufficiency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. "<I>But now you say, We see;</I> now that you have knowledge, and 
 are instructed out of the law, your sin is highly aggravated; and now 
 that you have a conceit of that knowledge, and think you see your way 
 better than any body can show it you, <I>therefore your sin 
 remains,</I> your case is desperate, and your disease incurable." And 
 as those are most blind who <I>will not see,</I> so their blindness is
 most dangerous who fancy they do see. No patients are so hardly managed 
 as those in a frenzy who say that they are <I>well,</I> and nothing 
 ails them. The sin of those who are self-conceited and self-confident 
 <I>remains,</I> for they reject the gospel of grace, and therefore the 
 guilt of their sin remains unpardoned; and they forfeit the Spirit of 
 grace, and therefore the power of their sin remains unbroken. <I>Seest 
 thou a wise man in his own conceit?</I> Hearest thou the Pharisees say, 
 <I>We see? There is more hope of a fool,</I> of a publican and a 
 harlot, than of such.</P>
