 <TR><TD><FONT SIZE=+1><I>The Traditions of the Elders; The Worst Defilement from Within.</I></FONT></TD>
 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the
 scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 2  And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with
 defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
 &nbsp; 3  For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash <I>their</I>
 hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
 &nbsp; 4  And <I>when they come</I> from the market, except they wash, they
 eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received
 to hold, <I>as</I> the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and
 of tables.
 &nbsp; 5  Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy
 disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread
 with unwashen hands?
 &nbsp; 6  He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied
 of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me
 with <I>their</I> lips, but their heart is far from me.
 &nbsp; 7  Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching <I>for</I> doctrines
 the commandments of men.
 &nbsp; 8  For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the
 tradition of men, <I>as</I> the washing of pots and cups: and many
 other such like things ye do.
 &nbsp; 9  And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of
 God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
 &nbsp; 10  For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso
 curseth father or mother, let him die the death:
 &nbsp; 11  But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, <I>It
 is</I> Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest
 be profited by me; <I>he shall be free.</I>
 &nbsp; 12  And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
 mother;
 &nbsp; 13  Making the word of God of none effect through your
 tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do
 ye.
 &nbsp; 14  And when he had called all the people <I>unto him,</I> he said
 unto them, Hearken unto me every one <I>of you,</I> and understand:
 &nbsp; 15  There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him
 can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are
 they that defile the man.
 &nbsp; 16  If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
 &nbsp; 17  And when he was entered into the house from the people, his
 disciples asked him concerning the parable.
 &nbsp; 18  And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding
 also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without
 entereth into the man, <I>it</I> cannot defile him;
 &nbsp; 19  Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly,
 and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?
 &nbsp; 20  And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth
 the man.
 &nbsp; 21  For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil
 thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
 &nbsp; 22  Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an
 evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
 &nbsp; 23  All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One great design of Christ's coming, was, to set aside the ceremonial 
 law which God made, and to put an end to it; to make way for which he 
 begins with the ceremonial law which men had made, and added to the law 
 of God's making, and discharges his disciples from the obligation of 
 that; which here he doth fully, upon occasion of the offence which the 
 Pharisees took at them for the violation of it. These Pharisees and
 scribes with whom he had this argument, are said to <I>come from 
 Jerusalem</I> down to Galilee--fourscore or a hundred miles, to pick 
 quarrels with our Saviour there, where they supposed him to have the 
 greatest interest and reputation. Had they come so far to be taught by 
 him, their zeal had been commendable; but to come so far to oppose him, 
 and to check the progress of his gospel, was great wickedness. It 
 should seem that the scribes and Pharisees at Jerusalem pretended not 
 only to a pre-eminence above, but to an authority over, the country 
 clergy, and therefore kept up their visitations and sent inquisitors 
 among them, as they did to John when he appeared, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:19">John i. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now in this passage we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the tradition of the elders was: by it all were enjoined to 
 <I>wash their hands</I> before meat; a cleanly custom, and no harm in 
 it; and yet as such to be over-nice in it discovers too great a care 
 about the body, which is <I>of the earth;</I> but they placed religion 
 in it, and would not leave it indifferent, as it was in its own nature; 
 people were at their liberty to do it or not to do it; but they 
 interposed their authority, and commanded all to do it upon pain of 
 excommunication; this they kept up as a <I>tradition of the elders.</I> 
 The Papists pretend to a zeal for the authority and antiquity of the 
 church and its canons, and talk much of councils and fathers, when 
 really it is nothing but a zeal for their own wealth, interest, and 
 dominion, that governs them; and so it was with the Pharisees.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the practice of the Pharisees and <I>all the 
 Jews,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 1. They <I>washed their hands oft;</I> they washed them,
 <B><I>pygme</I></B>; the critics find a great deal of work about that
 word, some making it to denote the frequency of their washing (so we
 render it); others think it signifies the pains they took in washing
 their hands; they washed with great care, they washed their hands <I>to
 their wrists</I> (so some); they lifted up their hands when they were
 wet, that the water might <I>run to their elbows.</I> 

 2. They particularly washed before they <I>ate bread;</I> that is,
 before they sat down to a solemn meal; for that was the rule; they must
 be sure to wash before they ate the bread on which they begged a
 blessing. "Whosoever eats the bread over which they recite the
 benediction, <I>Blessed be he that produceth bread,</I> must wash his
 hands before and after," or else he was thought to be defiled. 

 3. They took special care, when they came in <I>from the markets,</I> 
 to wash their hands; from the <I>judgment-halls,</I> so some; it 
 signifies any place of concourse where there were people of all sorts, 
 and, it might be supposed, some heathen or Jews under a ceremonial 
 pollution, by coming near to whom they thought themselves polluted; 
 saying, <I>Stand by thyself, come not near me, I am holier than 
 thou,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:5">Isa. lxv. 5</A>.

 They say, The rule of the rabbies was--That, if they washed their hands
 well in the morning, the first thing they did, it would serve for all 
 day, provided they kept alone; but, if they went into company, they 
 must not, at their return, either eat or pray till they had washed 
 their hands; thus the elders gained a reputation among the people for 
 sanctity, and thus they exercised and kept up an authority over their 
 consciences.

 4. They added to this the washing of <I>cups,</I> and <I>pots,</I> and
 <I>brazen vessels,</I> which they suspected had been made use of by
 heathens, or persons polluted; nay, and the very <I>tables</I> on which 
 they ate their meat. There were many cases in which, by the law of 
 Moses, washings were appointed; but they <I>added</I> to them, and
 enforced the observation of their own impositions as much as of God's
 institutions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the practice of Christ's disciples was; they knew what the law 
 was, and the common usage; but they understood themselves so well that 
 they would not be bound up by it: they ate bread with <I>defiled,</I> 
 that is, with <I>unwashen, hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Eating with <I>unwashen hands</I> they called eating with
 <I>defiled</I> hands; thus men keep up their superstitious vanities by
 putting every thing into an ill name that contradicts them. The
 disciples knew (it is probable) that the Pharisees had their eye upon
 them, and yet they would not humour them by a compliance with their
 traditions, but took their liberty as at other times, and ate bread
 with <I>unwashen</I> hands; and herein <I>their righteousness,</I> 
 however it might seem to come short, did really <I>exceed, that of the 
 scribes and Pharisees,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:20">Matt. v. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The offence which the Pharisees took at this; They <I>found 
 fault</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 they censured them as profane, and men of a loose conversation, or
 rather as men that would not submit to the power of the church, to 
 decree rites and ceremonies, and were therefore rebellious, factious, 
 and schismatical. They brought a complaint against them to their 
 Master, expecting that he should check them, and order them to conform; 
 for they that are fond of their own inventions and impositions, are 
 commonly ready to appeal to Christ, as if he should countenance them, 
 and as if his authority must interpose for the enforcing of them, and 
 the rebuking of those that do not comply with them. They do not ask, 
 Why do not thy disciples <I>do as we do?</I> (Though that was what they 
 meant, coveting to make themselves the standard.) But, Why do not they 
 <I>walk according to the tradition of the elders?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 To which it was easy to answer, that, by receiving the doctrine of 
 Christ, they had <I>more understanding than all their teachers,</I> yea 
 <I>more than the ancients,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:99,100">Ps. cxix. 99, 100</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ's vindication of them; in which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He argues with the Pharisees concerning the authority by which this 
 ceremony was imposed; and <I>they</I> were the fittest to be discoursed 
 with concerning that, who were the great sticklers for it: but this he 
 did not speak of publicly to the multitude (as appears by his
 <I>calling the people</I> to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 lest he should have seemed to stir them up to faction and discontent at 
 their governors; but addressed it as a reproof to the persons 
 concerned: for the rule is, <I>Suum cuique--Let every one have his 
 own.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He reproves them for their hypocrisy in pretending to honour God, 
 when really they had no such design in their religious observances 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>);

 <I>They honour me with their lips,</I> they pretend it is for the glory
 of God that they impose those things, to distinguish themselves from 
 the heathen; but really <I>their heart is far from God,</I> and is 
 governed by nothing but ambition and covetousness. They would be 
 thought hereby to appropriate themselves as a holy people to the Lord 
 their God, when really it is the furthest thing in their thought. They 
 rested in the outside of all their religious exercises, and their 
 hearts were not right with God in them, and this was worshipping God in 
 vain; for neither was he pleased with such sham-devotions, nor were 
 they profited by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He reproves them for placing religion in the inventions and 
 injunctions of their elders and rulers; They <I>taught for doctrines 
 the traditions of men.</I> When they should have been pressing upon 
 people the great principles of religion, they were enforcing the canons 
 of their church, and judged of people's being Jews or no, according as 
 they did, or did not, conform to them, without any consideration had, 
 whether they lived in obedience to God's laws or no. It was true, there 
 were <I>divers washings</I> imposed by the law of Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10">Heb. ix. 10</A>),
 
 which were intended to signify that inward purification of the heart
 from worldly fleshly lusts, which God requires as absolutely necessary 
 to our communion with him; but, instead of providing the substance, 
 they presumptuously added to the ceremony, and were very nice in 
 <I>washing pots and cups;</I> and observe, he adds, <I>Many other such 
 like things ye do,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Note, Superstition is an endless thing. If one human invention and 
 institution be admitted, though seemingly ever so innocent, as this of 
 washing hands, <I>behold, a troop comes,</I> a door is opened for 
 <I>many other such things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He reproves them for <I>laying aside the commandment of God,</I> 
 and overlooking that, not urging that in their preaching, and in their 
 discipline conniving at the violation of that, as if that were no 
 longer of force, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Note, It is the mischief of impositions, that too often they who are 
 zealous for them, have little zeal for the essential duties of 
 religion, but can contentedly see them laid aside. Nay, they
 <I>rejected the commandment of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 <I>He do fairly disannul and abolish the commandment of God;</I> and 
 even <I>by</I> your traditions <I>make the word of God of no 
 effect,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 God's statutes shall not only <I>lie forgotten,</I> as antiquated 
 obsolete laws, but they shall, in effect, <I>stand repealed,</I> that 
 their traditions may take place. They were entrusted to expound the 
 law, and to enforce it; and, under pretence of using that power, they 
 violated the law, and dissolved the bonds of it; destroying the text 
 with the comment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This he gives them a particular instance of, and a flagrant one--God 
 commanded children to <I>honour their parents,</I> not only by the law 
 of Moses, but, antecedent to that, by the law of nature; and whoso 
 <I>revileth,</I> or <I>speaketh evil of,</I> father or mother, <I>let 
 him die the death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Hence it is easy to infer, that it is the duty of children, if their
 parents be poor, to relieve them, according to their ability; and if
 those children are worthy to die, that curse their parents, much more
 those that starve them. But if a man will but conform himself in all
 points to the tradition of the elders, they will find him out an
 expedient by which he may be discharged from this obligation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 If his parents be in want and he has wherewithal to help them, but has
 no mind to do it, let him swear by the <I>Corban,</I> that is, by the 
 <I>gold of the temple,</I> and the <I>gift upon the altar,</I> that his 
 parents shall not be profited by him, that he will not relieve them; 
 and, if they ask any thing of him, let him tell them this, and it is 
 enough; as if by the obligation of this wicked vow he had discharged 
 himself from the obligation of God's holy law; thus Dr. Hammond 
 understands it: and it is said to be an ancient canon of the rabbin, 
 That vows take place in things commanded by the law, as well as in 
 things indifferent; so that, if a man make a vow which cannot be 
 ratified without breaking a commandment, the vow must be ratified, and 
 the commandment violated; so Dr. Whitby. Such doctrine as this the 
 Papists teach, discharging children from all obligation to their 
 parents by their monastic vows, and their entrance into religion, as 
 they call it. He concludes, <I>Any many such like things do ye.</I> 
 Where will men stop, when once they have made the word of God give way 
 to their tradition? These eager imposers of such ceremonies, at first 
 only <I>made light</I> of God's commandments <I>in comparison</I> with 
 their traditions, but afterward <I>made void</I> God's commandments, if 
 they stood <I>in competition</I> with them. All this, in effect, Isaiah 
 prophesied of them; what he said of the hypocrites of his own day, was 
 applicable to the scribes and Pharisees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Note, When we see, and complain of, the wickedness of the present 
 times, yet we do not <I>enquire wisely of that matter,</I> if we say 
 that all <I>the former days were better than these,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:10">Eccl. vii. 10</A>.

 The worst of hypocrites and evil doers have had their predecessors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He instructs the people concerning the principles upon which this 
 ceremony was grounded. It was requisite that this part of his discourse 
 should be public, for it related to daily practice, and was designed to 
 rectify a great mistake which the people were led into by their elders; 
 he therefore <I>called the people unto him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and bid them <I>hear and understand.</I> Note, It is not enough for the
 common people to <I>hear,</I> but they must <I>understand</I> what they 
 hear. When Christ would run down the tradition of the Pharisees about
 washing before meat, he strikes at the opinion which was the root of 
 it. Note, Corrupt customs are best cured by rectifying corrupt 
 notions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now that which he goes about to set them right in, is, what the 
 pollution is, which we are in danger of being damaged by, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 (1.) Not by the <I>meat we eat,</I> though it be eaten with unwashen 
 hands; that is but from without, and goes through a man. But, 

 (2.) It is by the breaking out of the corruption that is in our hearts; 
 the mind and conscience are defiled, guilt is contracted, and we become 
 odious in the sight of God by that which <I>comes out</I> of us; our 
 wicked thoughts and affections, words and actions, these defile us, and 
 these only. Our care must therefore be, to <I>wash our heart from 
 wickedness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He gives his disciples, in private, an explication of the 
 instructions he gave the people. They <I>asked</I> him, when they had 
 him by himself, <I>concerning the parable</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 for to them, it seems, it was a parable. Now, in answer to their
 enquiry,

 (1.) He reproves their dulness; "<I>Are ye so without understanding 
 also?</I> Are ye dull <I>also,</I> as dull as the people that 
 <I>cannot</I> understand, as dull as the Pharisees that <I>will 
 not?</I> Are ye <I>so</I> dull?" He doth not expect they should 
 understand every thing; "But are ye so weak as not to understand 
 <I>this?</I>"

 (2.) He explains this truth to them, that they might <I>perceive</I> 
 it, and then they would <I>believe</I> it, for it carried its own 
 evidence along with it. Some truths prove themselves, if they be but
 rightly explained and apprehended. If we understand the spiritual 
 nature of God and of his law, and what it is that is offensive to him, 
 and disfits us for communion with him, we shall soon perceive,

 [1.] That that which we eat and drink cannot defile us, so as to call 
 for any religious washing; it <I>goes into the stomach,</I> and passes 
 the several digestions and secretions that nature has appointed, and 
 what there may be in it that is defiling is voided and gone; <I>meats 
 for the belly, and the belly for meats,</I> but <I>God shall destroy 
 both it and them.</I> But, 

 [2.] It is that which <I>comes out from</I> the heart, the corrupt 
 heart, that defiles us. As by the ceremonial law, whatsoever (almost) 
 comes out of a man, defiles him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+15:2,De+23:13">Lev. xv. 2; Deut. xxiii. 13</A>),

 so what comes out from the <I>mind</I> of a man is that which defiles
 him before God, and calls for a religious washing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 <I>From within, out of the heart of men,</I> which they boast of the
 <I>goodness</I> of, and think is the best part of them, thence that 
 which defiles proceeds, thence comes all the mischief. As a corrupt 
 fountain sends forth corrupt streams, so doth a corrupt heart send 
 forth corrupt reasonings, corrupt appetites and passions, and all those 
 wicked words and actions which are produced by them. Divers particulars 
 are specified, as in Matthew; we had one there, which is not here, and 
 that is, <I>false witness-bearing;</I> but <I>seven</I> are mentioned 
 here, to be added to those we had there. <I>First, Covetousnesses,</I>
 for it is plural; <B><I>pleonexiai</I></B>--<I>immoderate desires</I> 
 of more of the wealth of the world, and the gratifications of sense, 
 and still more, still crying, <I>Give, give.</I> Hence we read of a 
 <I>heart exercised with covetous practices,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:14">2 Pet. ii. 14</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly, Wickedness</I>--<B><I>poneriai</I></B>; malice, hatred,
 and ill-will, a desire to do mischief, and a delight in mischief done.
 <I>Thirdly, Deceit;</I> which is wickedness covered and disguised, that 
 it may be the more securely and effectually committed. <I>Fourthly, 
 Lasciviousness;</I> that filthiness and foolish talking which the 
 apostle condemns; the eye full of adultery, and all wanton dalliances.
 <I>Fifthly,</I> The <I>evil eye;</I> the envious eye, and the covetous 
 eye, grudging others the good we give them, or do for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:6">Prov. xxiii. 6</A>),

 or grieving at the good they do or enjoy. <I>Sixthly, Pride</I>--<B>
 <I>hyperephania</I></B>; exalting ourselves in our own conceit above 
 others, and looking down with scorn and contempt upon others. 
 <I>Seventhly, Foolishness</I>--<B><I>aphrosyne</I></B>; imprudence, 
 inconsideration; some understand it especially of vainglorious 
 boasting, which St. Paul calls <I>foolishness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:1,19">2 Cor. xi. 1, 19</A>),

 because it is here joined with <I>pride;</I> I rather take it for that
 rashness in speaking and acting, which is the cause of so much evil. 
 <I>Ill-thinking</I> is put first, as that which is the spring of all 
 our <I>com</I>missions, and <I>unthinking</I> put last, as that which 
 is the spring of all our <I>o</I>missions. Of all these he concludes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 1. That they <I>come from within,</I> from the corrupt nature, the
 carnal mind, the evil treasure in the heart; justly is it said, that 
 the <I>inward part is very wickedness,</I> it must needs be so, when 
 all this comes from within. 

 2. That they <I>defile the man;</I> they render a man unfit for
 communion with God, they bring a stain upon the conscience; and, if not 
 mortified and rooted out, will shut men out of the new Jerusalem, into 
 which no <I>unclean thing shall enter.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre
 and Sidon, and entered into a house, and would have no man know
 <I>it:</I> but he could not be hid.
 &nbsp; 25  For a <I>certain</I> woman, whose young daughter had an unclean
 spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
 &nbsp; 26  The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she
 besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her
 daughter.
 &nbsp; 27  But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled:
 for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast <I>it</I>
 unto the dogs.
 &nbsp; 28  And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs
 under the table eat of the children's crumbs.
 &nbsp; 29  And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil
 is gone out of thy daughter.
 &nbsp; 30  And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone
 out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 I. How <I>humbly</I> Christ was pleased to <I>conceal himself.</I> 
 Never man was so cried up as he was in Galilee, and therefore, to teach 
 us, though not to decline any opportunity of doing good, yet not to be 
 fond of popular applause, he arose from thence, and <I>went into the 
 borders</I> of Tyre and Sidon, where he was little known; and there he 
 entered, not into a synagogue, or place of concourse, but <I>into a</I> 
 private <I>house,</I> and he <I>would have no man to know it;</I> 
 because it was foretold concerning him, <I>He shall not strive nor cry, 
 neither shall his voice be heard in the streets.</I> Not but that he 
 was willing to preach and heal here as well as in other places, but for 
 this he would be sought unto. Note, As there is a time to 
 <I>appear,</I> so there is a time to <I>retire.</I> Or, he would not be 
 known, because he was upon the borders of Tyre and Sidon, among 
 Gentiles, to whom he would not be so forward to show himself as to the 
 tribes of Israel, whose glory he was to be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How <I>graciously</I> he was pleased to <I>manifest himself,</I>
 notwithstanding. Though he would not carry a harvest of miraculous 
 cures into those parts, yet, it should seem, he came on purpose to drop 
 a handful, to let fall this one which we have here an account of. <I>He 
 could not be hid;</I> for, though a candle may be put under a bushel, 
 the sun cannot. Christ was too well known to be long
 <I>incognito--hid,</I> any where; the oil of gladness which he was
 anointed with, like ointment of the right hand, would betray itself,
 and fill the house with its odours. Those that had only heard his fame,
 could not converse with him, but they would soon say, "This must be
 Jesus." Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The application made to him by a poor woman in distress and trouble. 
 She was a Gentile, a Greek, <I>a stranger to the commonwealth of 
 Israel, an alien to the covenant of promise;</I> she was by extraction 
 a Syrophenician, and not in any degree proselyted to the Jewish 
 religion; she had a <I>daughter,</I> a <I>young</I> daughter, that was 
 possessed <I>with the devil.</I> How many and grievous are the 
 calamities that young children are subject to! Her address was, 

 (1.) Very humble, pressing, and importunate; <I>She heard of him,</I> 
 and <I>came, and fell at his feet.</I> Note, Those that would obtain 
 mercy from Christ, must throw themselves at his feet; must refer 
 themselves to him, humble themselves before him, and give up themselves 
 to be ruled by him. Christ never put any from him, that fell at his 
 feet, which a poor trembling soul may do, that has not boldness and 
 confidence to throw itself into his arms. 

 (2.) It was very particular; she tells him what she wanted. Christ gave 
 poor supplicants leave to be thus free with him; she besought him that 
 he would <I>cast forth the devil out of her daughter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Note, The greatest blessing we can ask of Christ for our children is, 
 that he would break the power of Satan, that is, the power of sin, in 
 their souls; and particularly, that he would cast forth the <I>unclean 
 spirit,</I> that they may be temples of the Holy Ghost, and he may 
 dwell in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The discouragement he gave to this address 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 He said unto her, "<I>Let the children first be filled;</I> let the
 Jews have all the miracles wrought for them, that they have occasion 
 for, who are in a particular manner God's chosen people; and let not 
 that which was intended for them, be thrown to those who are not of 
 God's family, and who have not that knowledge of him, and interest in 
 him, which they have, and who are as <I>dogs in comparison of them,</I> 
 vile and profane, and who are as <I>dogs to them,</I> snarling at them, 
 spiteful toward them, and ready to worry them." Note, Where Christ 
 knows the faith of poor supplicants to be strong, he sometimes delights 
 to try it, and put it to the stretch. But his saying, <I>Let the 
 children first be filled,</I> intimates that there was mercy in reserve 
 for the Gentiles, and not far off; for the Jews began already to be 
 surfeited with the gospel of Christ, and some of them had desired him 
 to <I>depart out of their coasts.</I> The children begin to play with 
 their meat, and their leavings, their loathings, would be a feast for 
 the Gentiles. The apostles went by this rule, <I>Let the children first 
 be filled,</I> let the Jews have the first offer; and if their full 
 souls loathe this honeycomb, <I>Lo, we turn to the Gentiles!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The turn she gave to this word of Christ, which made against her, 
 and her improvement of it, to make for her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 She said, "<I>Yes, Lord,</I> I own it is true that the <I>children's 
 bread</I> ought not to be cast to the dogs; but they were never denied 
 the <I>crumbs</I> of that bread, nay it belongs to them, and they are 
 allowed a place <I>under the table,</I> that they may be ready to 
 receive them. I ask not for a <I>loaf,</I> no, nor for a <I>morsel,</I> 
 only for a <I>crumb;</I> do not refuse me that." This she speaks, not 
 as undervaluing the mercy, or making light of it in itself, but 
 magnifying the abundance or miraculous cures with which she heard the 
 Jews were feasted, in comparison with which a single cure was but as a 
 crumb. Gentiles do not come in crowds, as the Jews do; <I>I come
 alone.</I> Perhaps she had heard of Christ's feeding five thousand 
 lately at once, after which, even when they had gathered up the 
 fragments, there could not but be some crumbs left for the dogs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The grant Christ thereupon made of her request. Is she thus humble, 
 thus earnest? For <I>this saying, Go thy way,</I> thou shalt have what 
 thou camest for, <I>the devil is gone out of thy daughter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 
 This encourages us to <I>pray</I> and not to <I>faint,</I> to continue 
 instant in prayer, not doubting but to prevail at last; the vision at 
 the end shall <I>speak, and not lie.</I> Christ's saying that is <I>was 
 done,</I> did it effectually, as at other times his saying, <I>Let it 
 be done;</I> for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 she <I>came to her house,</I> depending upon the word of Christ, that
 her daughter was healed, and so she <I>found it,</I> the <I>devil was 
 gone out.</I> Note, Christ can conquer Satan at a distance; and it was 
 not only when the demoniacs <I>saw him,</I> that they yielded to his 
 power (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:11"><I>ch.</I> iii. 11</A>),

 but when they saw him not, for the Spirit of the Lord is not
 <I>bound,</I> nor <I>bounded.</I> She found her daughter not in any 
 toss or agitation, but very quietly <I>laid on the bed,</I> and 
 reposing herself; waiting for her mother's return, to rejoice with her, 
 that she was so <I>finely well.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he
 came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of
 Decapolis.
 &nbsp; 32  And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an
 impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand
 upon him.
 &nbsp; 33  And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his
 fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
 &nbsp; 34  And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him,
 Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
 &nbsp; 35  And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his
 tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
 &nbsp; 36  And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the
 more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they
 published <I>it;</I>
 &nbsp; 37  And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all
 things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to
 speak.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus seldom staid long in a place, for he knew where his work lay, and attended the changes of it. When he had cured the woman of Canaan's daughter, he had done what he had to do in that place, and therefore presently left those parts, and
 returned <I>to the sea of Galilee,</I> whereabout his usual residence was; yet he did not come directly thither, but fetched a compass <I>through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis,</I> which lay mostly on the other side Jordan; such long walks did our
 Lord Jesus take, when he <I>went about doing
 good.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now here we have the story of a cure that Christ wrought, which is not 
 recorded by any other of the evangelists; it is of one that was
 <I>deaf</I> and <I>dumb.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His case was sad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 There were those that brought to him one that was <I>deaf;</I> some 
 think, born deaf, and then he must be dumb of course; others think that 
 by some distemper or disaster he was become deaf, or, at least, thick 
 of hearing; and he had an <I>impediment in his speech.</I> He was 
 <B><I>mogilalos</I></B>; some think that he was quite dumb; others, 
 that he could not speak but with great difficulty to himself, and so as 
 scarcely to be understood by those that heard him. He was 
 <I>tongue-tied,</I> so that he was perfectly unfit for conversation, 
 and deprived both of the pleasure and of the profit of it; he had not 
 the satisfaction either of hearing other people talk, or of telling his 
 own mind. Let us take occasion from hence to give thanks to God for 
 preserving to us the sense of hearing, especially that we may be 
 capable of hearing the word of God; and the faculty of speech, 
 especially that we may be capable of speaking God's praises; and let us 
 look with compassion upon those that are deaf or dumb, and treat them 
 with great tenderness. They that brought this poor man to Christ, 
 besought him that he would <I>put his hand upon him,</I> as the 
 prophets did upon those whom they <I>blessed</I> in the name of the 
 Lord. It is not said, They besought him to <I>cure him,</I> but to 
 <I>put his hand upon him,</I> to take cognizance of his case, and put 
 forth his power to do to him as he pleased.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His cure was solemn, and some of the circumstances of it were
 singular.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ <I>took him aside from the multitude,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Ordinarily, he wrought his miracles publicly before all the people, to 
 show that they would bear the strictest scrutiny and inspection; but 
 this he did privately, to show that he did not seek his own glory, and 
 to teach us to avoid every thing that savours of ostentation. Let us 
 learn of Christ to be humble, and to do good where no eye sees, but his 
 that is <I>all eye.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He used more significant actions, in the doing of this cure, than 
 usual. 

 (1.) He <I>put his fingers into his ears,</I> as if he would
 <I>syringe</I> them, and fetch out that which stopped them up.

 (2.) He spit upon his own finger, and then <I>touched his tongue,</I> 
 as if he would moisten his mouth, and so loosen that with which his 
 tongue was tied; these were no causes that could in the least 
 contribute to his cure, but only signs of the exerting of that power 
 which Christ had in himself to cure him, for the encouraging of his 
 faith, and theirs that brought him. The application was all from 
 himself, it was his own <I>fingers</I> that he put into his ears, and 
 his own <I>spittle</I> that he put upon his tongue; for he alone 
 heals.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He <I>looked up to heaven,</I> to give his Father the praise of what 
 he did; for he sought his praise, and did his will, and, as Mediator, 
 acted in dependence on him, and with an eye to him. Thus he signified 
 that it was by a divine power, a power her had as the Lord from heaven, 
 and brought with him thence, that he did this; for the <I>hearing 
 ear</I> and the <I>seeing eye</I> the <I>Lord has made,</I> and can 
 remake even <I>both of them.</I> He also hereby directed his patient 
 who could <I>see,</I> though he could not <I>hear,</I> to look up to 
 heaven for relief. Moses with his stammering tongue is directed to look 
 that way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:11">Exod. iv. 11</A>);

 <I>Who hath made man's mouth? Or who maketh the dumb or deaf, or the
 seeing or the blind? Have not I the Lord?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He sighed; not as if he found any difficulty in working this 
 miracle, or obtaining power to do it from his father; but thus he 
 expressed his pity for the miseries of human life, and his sympathy 
 with the afflicted in their afflictions, as one that was himself 
 <I>touched with the feeling of their infirmities.</I> And as to this 
 man, he <I>sighed,</I> not because he was loth to do him this kindness, 
 or did it with reluctancy; but because of the many temptations which he 
 would be exposed to, and the sins he would be in danger of, the 
 tongue-sins, after the restoring of his speech to him, which before he 
 was free from. He had better be <I>tongue-tied</I> still, unless he 
 have grace to <I>keep his mouth as with a bridle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:1">Ps. xxxix. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He said, <I>Ephphatha;</I> that is, <I>Be opened.</I> This was 
 nothing that looked like <I>spell</I> or <I>charm,</I> such as they 
 used, who had <I>familiar spirits,</I> who <I>peeped and muttered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19">Isa. viii. 19</A>.

 Christ speaks as one having authority, and power went along with the
 word. <I>Be opened,</I> served both parts of the cure; "Let the 
 <I>ears</I> be <I>opened,</I> let the <I>lips</I> be <I>opened,</I> let 
 him hear and speak freely, and let the restraint be taken off;" and the 
 effect was answerable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 <I>Straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was
 loosed,</I> and all was well: and happy he who, as soon as he had his 
 hearing and speech, had the blessed Jesus so near him to converse 
 with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this cure was, 

 (1.) A proof of Christ's being the Messiah; for it was foretold that by 
 his power the <I>ears of the deaf should be unstopped,</I> and the 
 <I>tongue of the dumb</I> should be made to <I>sing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:5,6">Isa. xxxv. 5, 6</A>.

 (2.) It was a specimen of the operations of his gospel upon the minds 
 of men. The great command of the gospel, and grace of Christ to poor 
 sinners, is <I>Ephphatha-Be opened.</I> Grotius applies it thus, that 
 the internal impediments of the mind are removed by the Spirit of 
 Christ, as those bodily impediments were by the word of his power. He 
 <I>opens the heart,</I> as he did Lydia's, and thereby opens the ear to 
 receive the word of God, and opens the mouth in prayer and praises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He ordered it to be kept very private, but it was made very public 
 
 (1.) It was his humility, that he <I>charged them they should tell no
 man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 Most men will proclaim their own goodness, or, at least, desire that
 others should proclaim it; but Christ, though he was himself in no 
 danger of being puffed up with it, knowing that we are, would thus set 
 us an example of self-denial, as in other things, so especially in 
 praise and applause. We should take pleasure in doing good, but not in 
 its being known.

 (2.) It was their zeal, that, though he charged them to say nothing of 
 it, yet they published it, before Christ would have had it published. 
 But they meant honestly, and therefore it is to be reckoned rather an 
 act of indiscretion than an act of disobedience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 But they that told it, and they that heard it, were <I>beyond measure 
 astonished,</I> <B><I>hyperperissos</I></B>--<I>more than above 
 measure;</I> they were exceedingly affected with it, and this was said 
 by every body, it was the common verdict, <I>He hath done all things 
 well</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>);

 whereas there were those that hated and persecuted him as an
 <I>evil-doer,</I> they are ready to witness for him, not only that he 
 has done no evil, but that he has done a great deal of good, and has 
 done it well, modestly and humbly, and very devoutly, and all gratis, 
 <I>without money and without price,</I> which added much to the lustre 
 of his good works. He <I>maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to 
 speak;</I> and that is <I>well,</I> it is well for them, it is well for 
 their relations, to whom they had been a burthen; and therefore 
 <I>they</I> are inexcusable who speak ill of him.</P>
