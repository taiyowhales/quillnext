 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is generally agreed that Christ's discourse in this and the next 
 chapter was at the close of the last supper, the night in which he was 
 betrayed, and it is a continued discourse, not interrupted as that in 
 the foregoing chapter was; and what he chooses to discourse of is very 
 pertinent to the present sad occasion of a farewell sermon. Now that he 
 was about to leave them, 

 I. They would be tempted to leave him, and return to Moses again; and
 therefore he tells them how necessary it was that they should by faith 
 adhere to him and abide in him. 

 II. They would be tempted to grow strange one to another; and therefore
 he presses it upon them to love one another, and to keep up that 
 communion when he was gone which had hitherto been their comfort. 

 III. They would be tempted to shrink from their apostleship when they
 met with hardships; and therefore he prepared them to bear the shock of
 the world's ill will. There are four words to which his discourse in
 this chapter may be reduced; 
 
 1. Fruit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.
 
 2. Love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:9-17">ver. 9-17</A>.
 
 3. Hatred, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:18-25">ver. 18-25</A>.
 
 4. The Comforter,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
 &nbsp; 2  Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and
 every <I>branch</I> that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may
 bring forth more fruit.
 &nbsp; 3  Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto
 you.
 &nbsp; 4  Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
 itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye
 abide in me.
 &nbsp; 5  I am the vine, ye <I>are</I> the branches: He that abideth in me,
 and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me
 ye can do nothing.
 &nbsp; 6  If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and
 is withered; and men gather them, and cast <I>them</I> into the fire,
 and they are burned.
 &nbsp; 7  If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask
 what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
 &nbsp; 8  Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so
 shall ye be my disciples.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here Christ discourses concerning the fruit, <I>the fruits of the 
 Spirit,</I> which his disciples were to bring forth, under the 
 similitude of a vine. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The doctrine of this similitude; what notion we ought to have of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That Jesus Christ is <I>the vine, the true vine.</I> It is an 
 instance of the humility of Christ that he is pleased to speak of 
 himself under low and humble comparisons. He that is <I>the Sun of 
 righteousness,</I> and <I>the bright and morning Star,</I> compares 
 himself to a <I>vine.</I> The church, which is Christ mystical, is a 
 vine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:8">Ps. lxxx. 8</A>),

 so is Christ, who is the church seminal. Christ and his church are thus 
 set forth. 

 (1.) He is <I>the vine,</I> planted in the vineyard, and not a 
 spontaneous product; planted in the earth, for his is <I>the Word made 
 flesh.</I> The vine has an unsightly unpromising outside; and Christ 
 had <I>no form nor comeliness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2">Isa. liii. 2</A>.

 The vine is a spreading plant, and Christ will be known as <I>salvation
 to the ends of the earth.</I> The fruit of the vine honours God and
 cheers man 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:13">Judg. ix. 13</A>),

 so does the fruit of Christ's mediation; it is <I>better than gold,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:19">Prov. viii. 19</A>.

 (2.) He is <I>the true vine,</I> as truth is opposed to pretence and
 counterfeit; he is really a fruitful plant, a plant of renown. He is
 not like that wild vine which deceived those who gathered of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:39">2 Kings iv. 39</A>),
 
 but a true vine. Unfruitful trees are said to <I>lie</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:17">Hab. iii. 17</A>.

 <I>marg.</I>), but Christ is a vine that will not deceive. Whatever
 excellency there is in any creature, serviceable to man, it is but a 
 shadow of that grace which is in Christ for his people's good. He is 
 that true vine typified by Judah's vine, which enriched him with the 
 blood of the grape 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:11">Gen. xlix. 11</A>),

 by Joseph's vine, the branches of which <I>ran over the wall</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:22">Gen. xlix. 22</A>),
 
 by Israel's vine, under which he <I>dwelt safely,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:25">1 Kings iv. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That believers are branches of this vine, which supposes that Christ 
 is the root of the vine. The root is unseen, and our <I>life is hid 
 with Christ;</I> the root bears the tree 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:18">Rom. xi. 18</A>),

 diffuses sap to it, and is all in all to its flourishing and 
 fruitfulness; and in Christ are all supports and supplies. The branches 
 of the vine are many, some on one side of the house or wall, others on 
 the other side; yet, meeting in the root, are all but one vine; thus 
 all good Christians, though in place and opinion distant from each 
 other, yet meet in Christ, the centre of their unity. Believers, like 
 the branches of the vine, are weak, and insufficient to stand of 
 themselves, but as they are borne up. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+15:2">Ezek. xv. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That <I>the Father is the husbandman,</I> 
 <B><I>georgos</I></B>--<I>the land-worker.</I> Though <I>the earth is
 the Lord's,</I> it yields him no fruit unless he work it. God has not 
 only a propriety in, but a care of, the vine and all the branches. He 
 <I>hath planted, and watered, and gives the increase;</I> for <I>we are
 God's husbandry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:9">1 Cor. iii. 9</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:1,2,27:2,3">Isa. v. 1, 2; xxvii. 2, 3</A>.

 He had an eye upon Christ, the root, and upheld him, and made him to 
 flourish <I>out of a dry ground.</I> He has an eye upon all the 
 branches, and prunes them, and watches over them, that nothing hurt 
 them. Never was any husbandman so wise, so watchful, about his 
 vineyard, as God is about his church, which therefore must needs 
 prosper.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The duty taught us by this similitude, which is to <I>bring forth 
 fruit,</I> and, in order to this, to <I>abide</I> in Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must be fruitful. From a vine we look for grapes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:2">Isa. v. 2</A>),

 and from a Christian we look for Christianity; this is the 
 <I>fruit,</I> a Christian temper and disposition, a Christian life and 
 conversation, Christian devotions and Christian designs. We must honour 
 God, and do good, and exemplify the purity and power of the religion we 
 profess; and this is bearing fruit. The disciples here must be 
 fruitful, as Christians, in all <I>the fruits of righteousness,</I> and 
 as apostles, in diffusing the savour of the knowledge of Christ. To 
 persuade them to this, he urges,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The doom of the unfruitful 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 They are <I>taken away.</I>
 
 [1.] It is here intimated that there are many who pass for
 <I>branches</I> in Christ who yet do <I>not bear fruit.</I> Were they 
 really united to Christ by faith, they would bear fruit; but being only 
 tied to him by the thread of an outward profession, though they seem to
 be branches, they will soon be seen to be dry ones. Unfruitful
 professors are unfaithful professors; professors, and no more. It might
 be read, <I>Every branch that beareth not fruit in me,</I> and it comes
 much to one; for those that do not bear fruit in Christ, and in his
 Spirit and grace, are as if they bore no fruit at all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:1">Hos. x. 1</A>.

 [2.] It is here threatened that they shall be <I>taken away,</I> in 
 justice to them and in kindness to the rest of the branches. From him 
 that has not real union with Christ, and fruit produced thereby, 
 <I>shall be taken away even that which he seemed to have,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:18">Luke viii. 18</A>.
 
 Some think this refers primarily to Judas.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The promise made to the fruitful: <I>He purgeth them, that they 
 may bring forth more fruit.</I> Note, 

 [1.] Further fruitfulness is the blessed reward of forward 
 fruitfulness. The first blessing was, <I>Be fruitful;</I> and it is 
 still a great blessing. 

 [2.] Even fruitful branches, in order to their further fruitfulness, 
 have need of purging or pruning; <B><I>kathairei</I></B>--<I>he taketh 
 away that which is superfluous</I> and luxuriant, which hinders its 
 growth and fruitfulness. The best have that in them which is peccant, 
 <I>aliquid amputandum--something which should be taken away;</I> some 
 notions, passions, or humours, that want to be purged away, which 
 Christ has promised to do by his word, and Spirit, and providence; and 
 these shall be taken off by degrees in the proper season. 

 [3.] The purging of fruitful branches, in order to their greater 
 fruitfulness, is the care and work of the great husbandman, for his own 
 glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The benefits which believers have by the doctrine of Christ, the 
 power of which they should labour to exemplify in a fruitful 
 conversation: <I>Now you are clean,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 [1.] Their society was clean, now that Judas was expelled by that word
 of Christ, <I>What thou doest, do quickly;</I> and till they were got 
 clear of him <I>they were not all clean.</I> The word of Christ is a 
 distinguishing word, and separates <I>between the precious and the 
 vile;</I> it will purify <I>the church of the first-born</I> in the 
 great dividing day. 

 [2.] They were each of them clean, that is, sanctified, by the truth of 
 Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:17"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 17</A>);

 that faith by which they received the word of Christ <I>purified their
 hearts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:9">Acts xv. 9</A>.

 The Spirit of grace by the word refined them from the dross of the 
 world and the flesh, and purged out of them <I>the leaven of the 
 scribes and Pharisees,</I> from which, when they saw their inveterate 
 rage and enmity against their Master, they were now pretty well 
 cleansed. Apply it to all believers. The word of Christ is spoken to
 them; there is a cleansing virtue in that word, as it works grace, and 
 works out corruption. It cleanses as fire cleanses the gold from its 
 dross, and as physic cleanses the body from its disease. We then 
 evidence that we are cleansed by the word when we <I>bring forth fruit 
 unto holiness.</I> Perhaps here is an allusion to the law concerning 
 vineyards in Canaan; the fruit of them was as unclean, and 
 uncircumcised, the first three years after it was planted, and <I>the 
 fourth year it</I> was to <I>be holiness of praise unto the Lord;</I> 
 and then it was clean, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:23,24">Lev. xix. 23, 24</A>.

 The disciples had now been three years under Christ's instruction; and 
 <I>now you are clean.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The glory that will redound to God by our fruitfulness, with the 
 comfort and honour that will come to ourselves by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 If we <I>bear much fruit,</I>

 [1.] Herein our Father will be glorified. The fruitfulness of the 
 apostles, as such, in the diligent discharge of their office, would be 
 to the glory of God in the conversion of souls, and the offering of 
 them up to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:9,16">Rom. xv. 9, 16</A>.

 The fruitfulness of all Christians, in a lower or narrower sphere, is
 to the glory of God. By the eminent good works of Christians many are
 brought to <I>glorify our Father who is in heaven.</I> 

 [2.] So shall we be Christ's disciples indeed, approving ourselves so, 
 and making it to appear that we are really what we call ourselves. So 
 shall we both evidence our discipleship and adorn it, and be to our 
 Master <I>for a name and a praise,</I> and a glory, that is, disciples 
 indeed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:11">Jer. xiii. 11</A>.

 So shall we be owned by our Master in the great day, and have the 
 reward of disciples, a share <I>in the joy of our Lord.</I> And the 
 more fruit we bring forth, the more we abound in that which is good, 
 the more he is glorified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In order to our fruitfulness, we must abide in Christ, must keep up 
 our union with him by faith, and do all we do in religion in the virtue 
 of that union. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The duty enjoined 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Abide in me, and I in you.</I> Note, It is the great concern of all 
 Christ's disciples constantly to keep up a dependence upon Christ and 
 communion with him, habitually to adhere to him, and actually to derive 
 supplies from him. Those that are come to Christ must abide in him: 
 "<I>Abide in me,</I> by faith; <I>and I in you,</I> by my Spirit; 
 <I>abide in me,</I> and then fear not but I will <I>abide in you;</I>" 
 for the communion between Christ and believers never fails on his side. 
 We must abide in Christ's word by a regard to it, and it in us as a 
 <I>light to our feet.</I> We must abide in Christ's merit as our 
 righteousness and plea, and it in us as our support and comfort. The 
 knot of the branch abides in the vine, and the sap of the vine abides 
 in the branch, and so there is a constant communication between 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The necessity of our abiding in Christ, in order to our 
 fruitfulness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>):

 "<I>You cannot bring forth fruit, except you abide in me;</I> but, if 
 you do, you <I>bring forth much fruit; for,</I> in short, <I>without 
 me,</I> or separate from me, <I>you can do nothing.</I>" So necessary 
 is it to our comfort and happiness that we be fruitful, that the best 
 argument to engage us to abide in Christ is, that otherwise we cannot 
 be fruitful. 

 [1.] Abiding in Christ is necessary in order to our doing much good. He 
 that is constant in the exercise of faith in Christ and love to him, 
 that lives upon his promises and is led by his Spirit, <I>bringeth 
 forth much fruit,</I> he is very serviceable to God's glory, and his 
 own account in the great day. Note, Union with Christ is a noble 
 principle, productive of all good. A life of faith in the Son of God is 
 incomparably the most excellent life a man can live in this world; it 
 is regular and even, pure and heavenly; it is useful and comfortable, 
 and all that answers the end of life. 

 [2.] It is necessary to our doing any good. It is not only a means of 
 cultivating and increasing what good there is already in us, but it is
 the root and spring of all good: "<I>Without me you can do nothing:</I>
 not only no great thing, <I>heal the sick, or raise the dead,</I> but 
 nothing." Note, We have as necessary and constant a dependence upon the 
 grace of the Mediator for all the actions of the spiritual and divine 
 life as we have upon the providence of the Creator for all the actions 
 of the natural life; for, as to both, it is in the divine power <I>that 
 we live, move, and have our being.</I> Abstracted from the merit of 
 Christ, we can do nothing towards our justification; and from the 
 Spirit of Christ nothing towards our sanctification. <I>Without Christ
 we can do nothing</I> aright, nothing that will be fruit pleasing to 
 God or profitable to ourselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:5">2 Cor. iii. 5</A>.

 We depend upon Christ, not only as the vine upon the wall, for support;
 but, as the branch on the root, for sap.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The fatal consequences of forsaking Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>If any man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch.</I> This 
 is a description of the fearful state of hypocrites that are <I>not in 
 Christ,</I> and of apostates that <I>abide not in Christ.</I> 

 [1.] They are cast forth as dry and withered branches, which are 
 plucked off because they cumber the tree. It is just that those should 
 have no benefit by Christ who think they have no need of him; and that 
 those who reject him should be rejected by him. Those that abide not in 
 Christ shall be abandoned by him; they are left to themselves, to fall 
 into scandalous sin, and then are justly cast out of the communion of 
 the faithful. 

 [2.] They are withered, as a branch broken off from the tree. Those 
 that abide not in Christ, though they may flourish awhile in a 
 plausible, at least a passable profession, yet in a little time wither 
 and come to nothing. Their parts and gifts wither; their zeal and 
 devotion wither; their credit and reputation wither; their hopes and 
 comforts wither, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:11-13">Job viii. 11-13</A>.

 Note, Those that bear no fruit, after while will bear no leaves. <I>How 
 soon is that fig-tree withered away</I> which Christ has cursed!

 [3.] <I>Men gather them.</I> Satan's agents and emissaries pick them
 up, and make an easy prey of them. Those that fall off from Christ
 presently fall in with sinners; and the sheep that wander from Christ's 
 fold, the devil stands ready to seize them for himself. When the Spirit 
 of the Lord had departed from Saul, an evil spirit possessed him. 

 [4.] They <I>cast them into the fire,</I> that is, they are cast into 
 the fire; and those who seduce them and draw them to sin do in effect 
 cast them there; for they <I>make them children of hell.</I> Fire is 
 the fittest place for withered branches, for they are good for nothing 
 else,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+15:2-4">Ezek. xv. 2-4</A>.

 [5.] <I>They are burned;</I> this follows of course, but it is here 
 added very emphatically, and makes the threatening very terrible. They 
 will not be consumed in a moment, like <I>thorns under a pot</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:6">Eccl. vii. 6</A>),

 but <B><I>kaietai</I></B>, they are burning for ever in a fire, which
 not only cannot be quenched, but will never spend itself. This comes of 
 quitting Christ, this is the end of barren trees. Apostates are 
 <I>twice dead</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:12">Jude 12</A>),

 and when it is said, <I>They are cast into the fire and are burned,</I>
 it speaks as if they were twice damned. Some apply men's gathering
 them to the ministry of the angels in the great day, when they shall 
 gather out of Christ's kingdom all things that offend, and shall 
 <I>bundle the tares for the fire.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The blessed privilege which those have that <I>abide in Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>If my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will</I> of my 
 Father in my name, <I>and it shall be done.</I> See here, 

 [1.] How our union with Christ is maintained--by the word: <I>If you 
 abide in me;</I> he had said before, <I>and I in you;</I> here he 
 explains himself, <I>and my words abide in you;</I> for it is in the 
 word that Christ is set before us, and offered to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:6-8">Rom. x. 6-8</A>.

 It is in the word that we receive and embrace him; and so where the
 <I>word of Christ dwells richly</I> there Christ dwells. If the word be 
 our constant guide and monitor, if it be in us as at home, then we 
 abide in Christ, and he in us.

 [2.] How our communion with Christ is maintained--by prayer: <I>You 
 shall ask what you will, and it shall be done to you.</I> And what can 
 we desire more than to have what we will for the asking? Note, Those 
 that abide in Christ as their heart's delight shall have, through 
 Christ, their heart's desire. If we have Christ, we shall want nothing
 that is good for us. Two things are implied in this 
 promise:--<I>First,</I> That if we abide in Christ, and his word in us, 
 we shall not ask any thing but what is proper to be done for us. The 
 promises abiding in us lie ready to be turned into prayers; and the 
 prayers so regulated cannot but speed. <I>Secondly,</I> That if we
 <I>abide in Christ and his word</I> we shall have such an interest in 
 God's favour and Christ's mediation that we shall have an answer of 
 peace to all our prayers.</P>

 &nbsp; 13  Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
 life for his friends.
 &nbsp; 14  Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
 &nbsp; 15  Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth
 not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all
 things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
 &nbsp; 16  Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained
 you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and <I>that</I> your
 fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father
 in my name, he may give it you.
 &nbsp; 17  These things I command you, that ye love one another.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ, who is love itself, is here discoursing concerning love, a 
 fourfold love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning the Father's love to him; and concerning this he here 
 tells us, 
 
 1. That the Father did love him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>As the Father hath loved me.</I> He loved him as Mediator: <I>This 
 is my beloved Son.</I> He was the Son of his love. He loved him, and 
 gave <I>all things into his hand;</I> and yet so <I>loved the world</I> 
 as to deliver him up for us all. When Christ was entering upon his 
 sufferings he comforted himself with this, that his Father loved him. 
 Those whom God loves as a Father may despise the hatred of all the 
 world. 
 
 2. That he abode in his Father's love,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He continually loved his Father, and was beloved of him. Even when he
 was made sin and a curse for us, and <I>it pleased the Lord to bruise
 him,</I> yet he abode in his Father's love. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:33">Ps. lxxxix. 33</A>.

 Because he continued to love his Father, he went cheerfully through his
 sufferings, and therefore his Father continued to love him.

 3. That therefore he abode in his Father's love because he kept his
 Father's law: <I>I have kept my Father's commandments,</I> as Mediator, 
 and so <I>abide in his love.</I> Hereby he showed that he continued to 
 love his Father, that he went on, and went through, with his 
 undertaking, and therefore the Father continued to love him. His soul 
 <I>delighted in him,</I> because he <I>did not fail, nor was 
 discouraged,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1-4">Isa. xlii. 1-4</A>.

 We having broken the law of creation, and thereby thrown ourselves out 
 of the love of God; Christ satisfied for us by obeying the law of 
 redemption, and so he abode in his love, and restored us to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning his own love to his disciples. Though he leaves them, he 
 loves them. And observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The pattern of this love: <I>As the Father has loved me, so have I 
 loved you.</I> A strange expression of the condescending grace of 
 Christ! As the Father loved him, who was most worthy, he loved them, 
 who were most unworthy. The Father loved him as his Son, and he loves 
 them as his children. <I>The Father gave all things into his hand;</I> 
 so, with himself, <I>he freely giveth us all things.</I> The Father 
 loved him as Mediator, as head of the church, and the great trustee of 
 divine grace and favour, which he had not for himself only, but for the 
 benefit of those for whom he was entrusted; and, says he, "I have been 
 a faithful trustee. As the Father has committed his love to me, so I 
 transmit it to you." Therefore the Father was well pleased with him, 
 that he might be well pleased with us in him; and loved him, that in 
 him, as beloved, he might <I>make us accepted,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:6">Eph. i. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The proofs and products of this love, which are four:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ loved his disciples, for he laid down his life for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Greater</I> proof of <I>love hath no man</I> to show <I>than 
 this,</I> to <I>lay down his life for his friend.</I> And this is the 
 love wherewith <I>Christ hath loved us,</I> he is our 
 <B><I>antipsychos</I></B>--<I>bail for us,</I> body for body, life for 
 life, though he knew our insolvency, and foresaw how much the 
 engagement would cost him. Observe here, 

 [1.] The extent of the love of the children of men to one another. The 
 highest proof of it is laying down one's life for a friend, to save his 
 life, and perhaps there have been some such heroic achievements of 
 love, more than <I>plucking out one's own eyes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:15">Gal. iv. 15</A>.

 If <I>all that a man has he will give for his life,</I> he that gives
 this for his friend gives all, and can give no more; this may sometimes
 be our duty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:16">1 John iii. 16</A>.

 Paul was ambitious of the honour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:17">Phil. ii. 17</A>);

 and <I>for a good man some will even dare to die,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:7">Rom. v. 7</A>.

 It is love in the highest degree, which is <I>strong as death.</I> 

 [2.] The excellency of the love of Christ beyond all other love. He has 
 not only equaled, but exceeded, the most illustrious lovers. Others 
 have laid down their lives, content that they should be taken from 
 them; but Christ gave up his, was not merely passive, but made it his 
 own act and deed. The life which others have laid down has been but of 
 equal value with the life for which it was laid down, and perhaps less 
 valuable; but Christ is infinitely more worth than ten thousand of us. 
 Others have thus laid down their lives for their friends, but Christ 
 laid down his for us <I>when we were enemies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:8,10">Rom. v. 8, 10</A>.
 
 <I>Plusquam ferrea aut lapidea corda esse oportet, qu&aelig; non
 emolliet tam incomparabilis divini amoris suavitas--Those hearts must 
 be harder than iron or stone which are not softened by such 
 incomparable sweetness of divine love.</I>--Calvin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ loved his disciples, for he took them into a covenant of 
 friendship with himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 "If you approve yourselves by your obedience my disciples indeed, 
 <I>you are my friends,</I> and shall be treated as friends." Note, The 
 followers of Christ are the friends of Christ, and he is graciously 
 pleased to call and account them so. Those that do the duty of his 
 servants are admitted and advanced to the dignity of his friends. David 
 had one servant in his court, and Solomon one in his, that was in a 
 particular manner <I>the king's friend</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:37,1Ki+4:5">2 Sam. xv. 37; 1 Kings iv. 5</A>);

 but this honour have all Christ's servants. We may in some particular 
 instance befriend a stranger; but we espouse all the interests of a 
 friend, and concern ourselves in all his cares: thus Christ takes 
 believers to be his friends. He visits them and converses with them as 
 his friends, bears with them and makes the best of them, is afflicted 
 in their afflictions, and takes pleasure in their prosperity; he pleads 
 for them in heaven and takes care of all their interests there. Have 
 friends but one soul? He that is joined to the Lord is <I>one 
 spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:17">1 Cor. vi. 17</A>.

 Though they often show themselves unfriendly, he is a friend that loves 
 at all times. Observe how endearingly this is expressed here.

 [1.] He will not <I>call them servants,</I> though they call him
 <I>Master</I> and <I>Lord.</I> Those that would be like Christ in 
 humility must not take a pride in insisting upon all occasions on their 
 authority and superiority, but remember that their servants are their 
 fellow-servants. But, 

 [2.] He will <I>call them his friends;</I> he will not only love them, 
 but will let them know it; for <I>in his tongue is the law of 
 kindness.</I> After his resurrection he seems to speak with more 
 affectionate tenderness of and to his disciples than before. <I>Go to 
 my brethren,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17"><I>ch.</I> xx. 17</A>.

 <I>Children, have you any meat?</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:5"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 5</A>.
 
 But observe, though Christ called <I>them his friends,</I> they called
 themselves <I>his servants:</I> Peter, <I>a servant of Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:1">1 Pet. i. 1</A>),
 
 and so James,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:1"><I>ch.</I> i. 1</A>.

 The more honour Christ puts upon us, the more honour we should study to
 do him; the higher in his eyes, the lower in our own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Christ loved his disciples, for he was very free in communicating 
 his mind to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "Henceforth you shall not be kept so much in the dark as you have been, 
 like <I>servants</I> that are only told their present work; but, when 
 the Spirit is poured out, you shall know your Master's designs as 
 <I>friends. All things that I have heard of my Father I have declared 
 unto you.</I>" As to the secret will of God, there are many things 
 which we must be content not to know; but, as to the revealed will of 
 God, Jesus Christ has faithfully handed to us what he received of the 
 Father,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18,Mt+11:27"><I>ch.</I> i. 18; Matt. xi. 27</A>.

 The great things relating to man's redemption Christ declared to his
 disciples, that they might declare them to others; they were the men of
 his counsel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:11">Matt. xiii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Christ loved his disciples, for he chose and ordained them to be
 the prime instruments of his glory and honour in the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 
 <I>I have chosen you, and ordained you,</I> His love to them 
 appeared,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] In their election, their election to their apostleship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:70"><I>ch.</I> vi. 70</A>):

 <I>I have chosen you twelve.</I> It did not begin on their side: <I>You
 have not chosen me,</I> but I first <I>chose you.</I> Why were they
 admitted to such an intimacy with him, employed in such an embassy for
 him, and endued with such power from on high? It was not owing to their
 wisdom and goodness in choosing him for their Master, but to his favour
 and grace in choosing them for his disciples. It is fit that Christ
 should have the choosing of his own ministers; still he does it by his
 providence and Spirit. Though ministers make that holy calling their
 own choice, Christ's choice is prior to theirs and directs and
 determines it. Of all that are chosen to grace and glory it may be
 said, They have not chosen Christ, but he had chosen them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:7,8">Deut. vii. 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] In their ordination: <I>I have ordained you;</I> <B><I>hetheka 
 hymas</I></B>--"<I>I have put you</I> into the ministry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:12">1 Tim. i. 12</A>),
 
 put you into commission." By this it appeared that he took them for his 
 friends when he crowned their heads with such an honour, and filled 
 their hands with such a trust. It was a mighty confidence he reposed in 
 them, when he made them his ambassadors to negotiate the affairs of his 
 kingdom in this lower world, and the prime ministers of state in the 
 administration of it. The treasure of the gospel was committed to them, 
 <I>First,</I> That it might be propagated: that you should go, 
 <B><I>hina hymeis hypagete</I></B>--"<I>that you should go as under a
 yoke</I> or burden, for the ministry is a work, and you that go about 
 it must resolve to undergo a great deal; <I>that you may go</I> from 
 place to place all the world over, and <I>bring forth fruit.</I>" They 
 were ordained, not to sit still, but to go about, to be diligent in 
 their work, and to lay out themselves unweariedly in doing good. They 
 were ordained, not to beat the air, but to be instrumental in God's 
 hand for the bringing of nations into obedience to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:13">Rom. i. 13</A>.
 
 Note, Those whom Christ ordains should and shall be fruitful; should
 labour, and shall not labour in vain. <I>Secondly,</I> That it might be 
 perpetuated; that the fruit may remain, that the good effect of their 
 labours may continue in the world from generation to generation, to the 
 end of time. The church of Christ was not to be a short-lived thing, as 
 many of the sects of the philosophers, that were a nine days' wonder; 
 it did not <I>come up in a night,</I> nor should it <I>perish in a 
 night,</I> but be as the days of heaven. The sermons and writings of 
 the apostles are transmitted to us, and we at this day are built upon 
 that foundation, ever since the Christian church was first founded by 
 the ministry of the apostles and seventy disciples; as one generation 
 of ministers and Christians has passed away, still another has come. By 
 virtue of that great charter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:19">Matt. xxviii. 19</A>),

 Christ has a church in the world, which, as our lawyers say of bodies 
 corporate, does <I>not die,</I> but lives in a succession; and thus 
 <I>their fruit remains</I> to this day, and shall do while the earth 
 remains.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] His love to them appeared in the interest they had at the throne 
 of grace: <I>Whatsoever you shall ask of my Father, in my name, he will 
 give it you.</I> Probably this refers in the first place to the power 
 of working miracles which the apostles were clothed with, which was to 
 be drawn out by prayer. "Whatever gifts are necessary to the 
 furtherance of your labours, whatever help from heaven you have 
 occasion for at any time, it is but ask and have." Three things are 
 here hinted to us for our encouragement in prayer, and very encouraging 
 they are. <I>First,</I> That we have a God to go to who is a Father; 
 Christ here calls him <I>the Father,</I> both mine and yours; and the 
 Spirit in the word and in the heart teaches us to cry, <I>Abba, Father.
 Secondly,</I> That we come in a good name. Whatever errand we come upon 
 to the throne of grace according to God's will, we may with a humble 
 boldness mention Christ's name in it, and plead that we are related to 
 him, and he is concerned for us. <I>Thirdly,</I> That an answer of
 peace is promised us. What you come for shall be given you. This great 
 promise made to that great duty keeps up a comfortable and gainful 
 intercourse between heaven and earth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Concerning the disciples' love to Christ, enjoined in 
 consideration of the great love wherewith he had loved them. Three 
 things he exhorts them to:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To continue in his love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 "Continue in your love to me, and in mine to you." Both may be taken 
 in. We must place our happiness in the continuance of Christ's love to 
 us, and make it our business to give continued proofs of our love to 
 Christ, that nothing may tempt us to withdraw from him, or provoke him 
 to withdraw from us. Note, All that love Christ should continue in 
 their love to him, that is, be always loving him, and taking all 
 occasions to show it, and love to the end. The disciples were to go
 out upon service for Christ, in which they would meet with many 
 troubles; but, says Christ, "<I>Continue in my love.</I> Keep up your 
 love to me, and then all the troubles you meet with will be easy; love 
 made seven years' hard service easy to Jacob. Let not the troubles you
 meet with for Christ's sake quench your love to Christ, but rather 
 quicken it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To let his joy remain in them, and fill them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This he designed in those precepts and promises given them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That his joy might remain in them. The words are so placed, in the 
 original, that they may be read either, 

 [1.] That <I>my joy in you may remain.</I> If they bring forth much 
 fruit, and continue in his love, he will continue to rejoice in them as 
 he had done. Note, Fruitful and faithful disciples are the joy of the 
 Lord Jesus; he <I>rests in his love</I> to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:17">Zeph. iii. 17</A>.

 As there is a transport of joy in heaven in the conversion of sinners,
 so there is a remaining joy in the perseverance of saints. Or,

 [2.] That <I>my joy,</I> that is, your joy in me, <I>may remain.</I> It 
 is the will of Christ that his disciples should constantly and 
 continually rejoice in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:4">Phil. iv. 4</A>.

 The joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment, but the joy of those who
 abide in Christ's love is a continual feast. The word of the Lord 
 enduring for ever, the joys that flow from it, and are founded on it, 
 do so too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>That your joy might be full;</I> not only that you might be 
 full of joy, but that your joy in me and in my love may rise higher and 
 higher, till it come to perfection, when you <I>enter into the joy of 
 your Lord.</I>" Note, 

 [1.] Those and those only that have Christ's joy remaining in them have 
 their joy full; worldly joys are empty, soon surfeit but never satisfy. 
 It is only wisdom's joy that will fill the soul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:8">Ps. xxxvi. 8</A>.

 [2.] The design of Christ in his world is to <I>fill the joy</I> of his
 people; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:4">1 John i. 4</A>.

 This and the other he hath said, that our joy might be fuller and
 fuller, and perfect at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. To evidence their love to him by keeping his commandments: "<I>If 
 you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 This will be an evidence of the fidelity and constancy of your love to 
 me, and then you may be sure of the continuance of my love to you." 
 Observe here,

 (1.) The promise "<I>You shall abide in my love</I> as in a dwelling 
 place, at home in Christ's love; as in a resting place, at ease in 
 Christ's love; as in a stronghold, safe in it. <I>You shall abide in my 
 love,</I> you shall have grace and strength to persevere in loving me." 
 If the same hand that first shed abroad the love of Christ in our 
 hearts did not keep us in that love, we should not long abide in it, 
 but, through the love of the world, should go <I>out of love</I> with 
 Christ himself. 

 (2.) The condition of the promise: <I>If you keep my commandments.</I> 
 The disciples were to keep Christ's commandments, not only by a 
 constant conformity to them themselves, but by a faithful delivery of 
 them to others; they were to keep them as trustees, in whose hands that 
 great <I>depositum</I> was lodged, for they were to <I>teach all things 
 that Christ had commanded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20">Matt. xxviii. 20</A>.

 <I>This commandment</I> they must <I>keep without spot</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:14">1 Tim. vi. 14</A>),

 and thus they must show that they abide in his love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To induce them to keep his commandments, he urges, 

 [1.] His own example: <I>As I have kept my Father's commandments, and 
 abide in his love.</I> Christ submitted to the law of mediation, and so 
 preserved the honour and comfort of it, to teach us to submit to the 
 laws of the Mediator, for we cannot otherwise preserve the honour and 
 comfort of our relation to him. 

 [2.] The necessity of it to their interest in him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>You are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you</I> and not 
 otherwise." Note, <I>First,</I> Those only will be accounted Christ's 
 faithful friends that approve themselves his obedient servants; for 
 those that will not have him to reign over them shall be treated as his 
 enemies. <I>Idem velle et idem nolle ea demum vera est 
 amicitia--Friendship involves a fellowship of aversions and 
 attachments.</I>--Sallust. <I>Secondly,</I> It is universal obedience 
 to Christ that is the only acceptable obedience; to obey him in every 
 thing that he commands us, not <I>excepting,</I> much less <I>excepting 
 against,</I> any command.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Concerning the <I>disciples' love one to another,</I> enjoined as
 an evidence of their love to Christ, and a grateful return for his love
 to them. We must keep his commandments, and this is his commandment,
 that we <I>love one another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:12,17"><I>v.</I> 12, and again, <I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 No one duty of religion is more frequently inculcated, nor more 
 pathetically urged upon us, by our Lord Jesus, than that of mutual 
 love, and for good reason. 

 1. It is here recommended by Christ's pattern

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>as I have loved you.</I> Christ's love to us should direct and 
 engage our love to each other; in this manner, and from this motive, we 
 should love one another, as, and because, Christ has loved us. He here 
 specifies some of the expressions of his love to them; he called them 
 friends, communicated his mind to them, was ready to give them what 
 they asked. <I>Go you and do likewise.</I> 

 2. It is required by his precept. He interposes his authority, has made
 it one of the statute-laws of his kingdom. Observe how differently it 
 is expressed in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:12,17">these two verses</A>, 

 and both very emphatic. 

 (1.) <I>This is my commandment</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 as if this were the most necessary of all the commandments. As under 
 the law the prohibition of idolatry was the commandment more insisted 
 on than any other, foreseeing the people's addictedness to that sin, so 
 Christ, foreseeing the addictedness of the Christian church to 
 uncharitableness, has laid most stress upon this precept. 

 (2.) <I>These things I command you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He speaks as if he were about to give them many things in charge, and 
 yet names this only, <I>that you love one another;</I> not only because 
 this includes many duties, but because it will have a good influence 
 upon all.</P>

 persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours
 also.
 &nbsp; 21  But all these things will they do unto you for my name's
 sake, because they know not him that sent me.
 &nbsp; 22  If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had
 sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.
 &nbsp; 23  He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
 &nbsp; 24  If I had not done among them the works which none other man
 did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated
 both me and my Father.
 &nbsp; 25  But <I>this cometh to pass,</I> that the word might be fulfilled
 that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here Christ discourses concerning <I>hatred,</I> which is the character 
 and genius of the devil's kingdom, as love is of the kingdom of Christ. 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who they are in whom this hatred is found--the world, the children of
 this world, as distinguished from the children of God; those who are in 
 the interests of the god of this world, whose image they bear, and 
 whose power they are subject to; all those, whether Jews or Gentiles, 
 who would not come into the church of Christ, which he audibly called, 
 and visibly separates from this evil world. The calling of these <I>the 
 world</I> intimates, 

 1. Their number; there were a world of people that opposed Christ and
 Christianity. Lord, how were they increased that troubled the Son of 
 David! I fear, if we should put it to the vote between Christ and 
 Satan, Satan would out-poll us quite. 

 2. Their confederacy and combination; these numerous hosts are
 embodied, and are as one,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:5">Ps. lxxxiii. 5</A>.

 Jews and Gentiles, that could agree in nothing else, agreed to
 persecute Christ's minister. 

 3. Their spirit and disposition; they are <I>men of the world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:13,14">Ps. xvi. 13, 14</A>),

 wholly devoted to this world and the things of it, and never thinking
 of another world. The people of God, though they are taught to hate
 the sins of sinners, yet not their persons, but to love and do good to 
 all men. A malicious, spiteful, envious spirit, is not the spirit of 
 Christ, but of the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Who are they against whom this hatred is levelled-against the 
 disciples of Christ, against Christ himself, and against the 
 Father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The world hates the disciples of Christ: <I>The world hateth you</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 and he speaks of it as that which they must expect and count upon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,
 
 as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:13">1 John iii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Observe how this comes in here. 

 [1.] Christ had expressed the great kindness he had for them as 
 friends; but, lest they should be puffed up with this, there was given 
 them, as there was to Paul, a <I>thorn in the flesh,</I> that is, as it 
 is explained there, reproaches and persecutions for Christ's sake, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:7,10">2 Cor. xii. 7, 10</A>.

 [2.] He had appointed them their work, but tells them what hardships
 they should meet with in it, that it might not be a surprise to them, 
 and that they might prepare accordingly.

 [3.] He had charged them to <I>love one another,</I> and need enough 
 they had to love one another, for the world would hate them; to be kind 
 to one another, for they would have a great deal of unkindness and 
 ill-will from those that were without. "Keep peace among yourselves, 
 and this will fortify you against the world's quarrels with you." Those 
 that are in the midst of enemies are concerned to hold together.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Observe what is here included.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The world's enmity against the followers of Christ: it <I>hateth 
 them.</I> Note, Whom Christ blesseth the world curseth. The favourites 
 and heirs of heaven have never been the darlings of this world, since 
 the old enmity was put between the seed of the woman and of the 
 serpent. Why did Cain hate Abel, but <I>because his works were 
 righteous?</I> Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing; Joseph's 
 brethren hated him because his father loved him; Saul hated David 
 because <I>the Lord was with him;</I> Ahab hated Micaiah because of his 
 prophecies; such are the causeless causes of the world's hatred.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The fruits of that enmity, two of which we have here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 <I>First,</I> They will persecute you, because they hate you, for 
 hatred is a restless passion. It is the common lot of those who will 
 live godly in Christ Jesus to <I>suffer persecution,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:12">2 Tim. iii. 12</A>.
 
 Christ foresaw what ill usage his ambassadors would meet with in the
 world, and yet, for the sake of those few that by their ministry were
 to be called out of the world, he sent them forth as sheep in the midst
 of wolves. <I>Secondly,</I> Another fruit of their enmity is implied,
 that they would reject their doctrine. When Christ says, <I>If they
 have kept my sayings, they will keep yours,</I> he means, They will
 keep yours, and regard yours, no more than they have regarded and kept
 mine. Note, The preachers of the gospel cannot but take the despising
 of their message to be the greatest injury that can be done to
 themselves; as it was a great affront to Jeremiah to say, <I>Let us not
 give heed to any of his words,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:18">Jer. xviii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The causes of that enmity. The world will hate them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Because they do not belong to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>If you were of the world,</I> of its spirit, and in its interests, 
 if you were carnal and worldly, <I>the world would love you</I> as its 
 own; but, because you are called out of the world, it hates you, and 
 ever will." Note, 

 1. We are not to wonder if those that are devoted to the world are
 caressed by it as its friends; most men <I>bless the covetous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:3,49:18">Ps. x. 3; xlix. 18</A>.

 2. Nor are we to wonder if those that are delivered from the world are
 maligned by it as its enemies; when Israel is rescued out of Egypt, the 
 Egyptians will pursue them. Observe, The reason why Christ's disciples
 are not of the world is not because they have by their own wisdom and 
 virtue distinguished themselves from the world, but because Christ hath 
 chosen them out of it, to set them apart for himself; and this is the 
 reason why the world hates them; for,

 (1.) The glory which by virtue of this choice they are designed for 
 sets them above the world, and so makes them the objects of its envy. 
 The saints shall judge the world, and the upright have dominion, and 
 therefore they are hated. 

 (2.) The grace which by virtue of this choice they are endued with sets 
 them against the world; they swim against the stream of the world, and 
 are not conformed to it; they witness against it, and are not conformed 
 to it. This would support them under all the calamities which the 
 world's hatred would bring upon them, that they were hated because they 
 were the choice and the chosen ones of the Lord Jesus, and were not of 
 the world. Now, 

 [1.] This was no just cause for the world's hatred of them. If we do 
 any thing to make ourselves hateful, we have reason to lament it; but, 
 if men hate us for that for which they should love and value us, we 
 have reason to pity them, but no reason to perplex ourselves. Nay, 

 [2.] This was just cause for their own joy. He that is hated because he 
 is rich and prospers cares not who has the vexation of it, while he has 
 the satisfaction of it.</P>

 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Much more may those hug themselves whom the world hates, but whom 
 Christ loves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> "Another cause of the world's hating you will be 
 because you do belong to Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>For my name's sake.</I>" Here is the core of the controversy; 
 whatever is pretended, this is the ground of the quarrel, they hate 
 Christ's disciples because they <I>bear his name,</I> and <I>bear up 
 his name</I> in the world. Note, 

 1. It is the character of Christ's disciples that they stand up for his 
 name. The name into which they were baptized is that which they will 
 live and die by. 

 2. It has commonly been the lot of those that appear for Christ's name
 to suffer for so doing, to suffer many things, and hard things, <I>all 
 these things.</I> It is matter of comfort to the greatest sufferers if 
 they suffer for Christ's name's sake. <I>If you be reproached for the 
 name of Christ, happy are you</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:14">1 Pet. iv. 14</A>),

 happy indeed, considering not only the honour that is imprinted upon 
 those sufferings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:41">Acts v. 41</A>),

 but the comfort that is infused into them, and especially the crown of 
 glory which those sufferings lead to. <I>If we suffer with Christ,</I>
 and for Christ, <I>we shall reign with him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> After all, it is the world's ignorance that is the true 
 cause of its enmity to the disciples of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Because they know not him that sent me.</I> 

 1. They know not God. If men had but a due acquaintance with the very 
 first principles of natural religion, and did but know God, though they 
 did not embrace Christianity, yet they could not hate and persecute it. 
 Those have no knowledge who eat up God's people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:4">Ps. xiv. 4</A>.

 2. They know not God as he that sent our Lord Jesus, and authorized him
 to be the great Mediator of the peace. We do not rightly know God if we
 do not know him in Christ, and those who persecute those whom he sends
 make it to appear that they know not that he was sent of God. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The world hates Christ himself. And this is spoken of here for two 
 ends:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To mitigate the trouble of his followers, arising from the world's 
 hatred, and to make it the less strange, and the less grievous 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 <I>You know that it hated me before you,</I> <B><I>proton 
 hymon</I></B>. We read it as signifying priority of time; he began in 
 the bitter cup of suffering, and then left us to pledge him; but it may 
 be read as expressing his superiority over them: "<I>You know</I> that 
 it hated me, <I>your first,</I> your chief and captain, your leader and 
 commander." 

 [1.] If Christ, who excelled in goodness, and was perfectly innocent 
 and universally beneficent, was hated, can we expect that any virtue or 
 merit of ours should screen us from malice? 

 [2.] If our Master, the founder of our religion, met with so much 
 opposition in the planting of it, his servants and followers can look 
 for no other in propagating and professing it. For this he refers them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 to his own word, at their admission into discipleship: <I>Remember the 
 word that I said unto you.</I> It would help us to understand Christ's 
 latter sayings to compare them with his former sayings. Nor would any 
 thing contribute more to the making of us easy than remembering the 
 words of Christ, which will expound his providences. Now in this word 
 there is, <I>First,</I> A plain truth: <I>The servant is not greater 
 than his Lord.</I> This he had said to them. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:24">Matt. x. 24</A>.

 Christ is our Lord, and therefore we must diligently attend all his
 motions, and patiently acquiesce in all his disposals, for the servant 
 is inferior to his lord. The plainest truths are sometimes the 
 strongest arguments for the hardest duties; Elihu answers a multitude 
 of Job's murmurings with this one self-evident truth, that God is 
 greater than man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:12">Job xxxiii. 12</A>.

 So here is, <I>Secondly,</I> A proper inference drawn from it: "<I>If
 they have persecuted men,</I> as you have seen, and are likely to see 
 much more, <I>they will also persecute you;</I> you may expect it and 
 count upon it: for,"

 1. "You will do the same that I have done to provoke them; you will 
 reprove them for their sins, and call them to repentance, and give them 
 strict rules of holy living, which they will not bear." 

 2. "You cannot do more than I have done to oblige them; after so great
 an instance, let none wonder if they suffer ill for doing well." He 
 adds, "<I>If they have kept my sayings, they will keep yours also;</I> 
 as there have been a few, and but a few, that have been wrought upon by 
 my preaching, so there will be by yours a few, and but a few." Some 
 give another sense of this, making <B><I>eteresan</I></B> to be put for 
 <B><I>pareteresan</I></B>. "If they have lain in wait for my sayings, 
 with a design to ensnare me, they will in like manner lie in wait to 
 entangle you in your talk."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To aggravate the wickedness of this unbelieving world, and to 
 discover its exceeding sinfulness; to hate and persecute the apostles 
 was bad enough, but in them to hate and persecute Christ himself was 
 much worse. The world is generally in an ill name in scripture, and 
 nothing can put it into a worse name than this, that it hated Jesus 
 Christ. There is a world of people that are haters of Christ. Two 
 things he insists upon to aggravate the wickedness of those that hated 
 him:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That there was the greatest reason imaginable why they should love 
 him; men's good words and good works usually recommend them; now as to 
 Christ,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> His words were such as merited their love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>If I had not spoken unto them,</I> to court their love, <I>they had 
 not had sin,</I> their opposition had not amounted to a hatred of me, 
 their sin had been comparatively no sin. But now that I have said so 
 much to them to recommend myself to their best affections they have no 
 pretence, no excuse for their sin." Observe here, 

 1. The advantage which those have that enjoy the gospel; Christ in it 
 comes and speaks to them; he spoke in person to the men of that 
 generation, and is still speaking to us by our Bibles and ministers, 
 and as one that has the most unquestionable authority over us, and 
 affection for us. Every word of his is pure, carries with it a 
 commanding majesty, and yet a condescending tenderness, able, one would 
 think, to charm the deafest adder.

 2. The excuse which those have that enjoy not the gospel: "<I>If I had
 not spoken to them,</I> if they had ever heard of Christ and of 
 salvation by him, <I>they had not had sin.</I>"

 (1.) Not this kind of sin. They had not been chargeable with a contempt
 of Christ if he had not come and made a tender of his grace to them. As 
 <I>sin is not imputed where there is no law,</I> so unbelief is not 
 imputed where there is no gospel; and, where it is imputed, it is thus 
 far the only damning sin, that, being a sin against the remedy, other 
 sin would not damn if the guilt of them were not bound on with this. 
 
 (2.) Not such a degree of sin. If they had not had the gospel among 
 them, their other sins had not been so bad; for the <I>times of 
 ignorance God winked at,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:47,48">Luke xii. 47, 48</A>.

 3. The aggravated guilt which those lie under to whom Christ has
 <I>come and spoken in vain,</I> whom he has called and invited in vain, 
 with whom he has reasoned and pleaded in vain; <I>They have no cloak 
 for their sin;</I> they are altogether inexcusable, and in the judgment 
 day will be speechless, and will not have a word to say for themselves. 
 Note, The clearer and fuller the discoveries are which are made to us 
 of the grace and truth of Jesus Christ, the more is said to us that is 
 convincing and endearing, the greater is our sin if we do not love him 
 and believe in him. The word of Christ strips sin of its cloak, that it 
 may appear sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> His works were such as merited their love, as well as 
 his words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 "<I>If I had not done among them,</I> in their country, and before 
 their eyes, such works as <I>no other man ever did, they had not had 
 sin;</I> their unbelief and enmity had been excusable, and they might 
 have had some colour to say that my word was not to be credited, if not 
 otherwise confirmed;" but he produced satisfactory proofs of his divine 
 mission, <I>works which no other man did.</I> Note, 

 1. As the Creator demonstrates his power and Godhead by his works

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:20">Rom. i. 20</A>),

 so doth the Redeemer. His miracles, his mercies, works of wonder and
 works of grace, prove him sent of God, and sent on a kind errand. 

 2. Christ's works were such as <I>no man ever did.</I> No common
 person that had not a commission from heaven, and God with him, could 
 work miracles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:2"><I>ch.</I> iii. 2</A>.

 And no prophet ever wrought such miracles, so many, so illustrious. 
 Moses and Elias wrought miracles as servants, by a derived power; but 
 Christ, as a Son, by his own power. This was it that amazed the
 people, that with authority he commanded diseases and devils

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:27">Mark i. 27</A>);

 they owned they never saw the like,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:12">Mark ii. 12</A>.

 They were all good works, works of mercy; and this seems especially
 intended here, for he is upbraiding them with this, that they hated
 him. One that was so universally useful, more than ever any man was, 
 one would think, should have been universally beloved, and yet even he 
 is hated. 

 3. The works of Christ enhance the guilt of sinners' infidelity and
 enmity to him, to the last degree of wickedness and absurdity. If they 
 had only heard his words, and not seen his works,--if we had only his 
 sermons upon record, and not his miracles, unbelief might have pleaded 
 want of proof; but now it has no excuse. Nay, the rejecting of Christ,
 both by them and us, has in it the sin, not only of obstinate unbelief, 
 but of base ingratitude. They saw Christ to be most amiable, and 
 studious to do them a kindness; yet they hated him, and studied to do 
 him mischief. And we see in his word that great love wherewith he loved 
 us, and yet are not wrought upon by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That there was no reason at all why they should hate him. Some 
 that at one time will say and do that which is recommending, yet at 
 another time will say and do that which is provoking and disobliging; 
 but our Lord Jesus not only did much to merit men's esteem and 
 good-will, but never did any thing justly to incur their displeasure; 
 this he pleads by quoting a scripture for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>This comes to pass,</I> this unreasonable hatred of me, and of my 
 disciples for my sake, <I>that the word might be fulfilled which is 
 written in their law</I>" (that is, in the Old Testament, which is a 
 law, and was received by them as a law), "<I>They hated me without a 
 cause;</I>" this David speaks of himself as a type of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:19,69:4">Ps. xxxv. 19; lxix. 4</A>.

 Not, <I>First,</I> Those that hate Christ hate him without any just
 cause; enmity to Christ is unreasonable enmity. We think those deserve 
 to be hated that are haughty and froward, but Christ is meek and lowly, 
 compassionate and tender; those also that under colour of complaisance 
 are malicious, envious, and revengeful, but Christ devoted himself to 
 the service of those that used him, nay, and of those that abused him; 
 toiled for others' ease, and impoverished himself to enrich us. Those 
 we think hateful that are <I>hurtful to kings and provinces,</I> and 
 disturbers of the public peace; but Christ, on the contrary, was the 
 greatest blessing imaginable to his country, and yet was hated. He 
 testified indeed that <I>their works were evil,</I> with a design to 
 make them good, but to hate him for this cause was to hate him without 
 cause. <I>Secondly,</I> Herein the scripture was fulfilled, and the 
 antitype answered the type. Saul and his courtiers hated David without 
 cause, for he had been serviceable to him with his harp, and with his 
 sword; Absalom and his party hated him, though to him he had been an 
 indulgent father, and to them a great benefactor. Thus was the Son of 
 David hated, and hunted most unjustly. Those that hated Christ did not 
 design there in to fulfil the scripture; but God, in permitting it, had 
 that in his eye; and it confirms our faith in Christ as the Messiah 
 that even this was foretold concerning him, and, being foretold, was 
 accomplished in him. And we must not think it strange or hard if it 
 have a further accomplishment in us. We are apt to justify our 
 complaints of injuries done us with this, that they are causeless, 
 whereas the more they are so the more they are like the sufferings of 
 Christ, and may be the more easily borne.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. In Christ the world hates God himself; this is twice said here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>He that hateth me,</I> though he thinks his hatred goes no further, 
 yet really he <I>hates my Father also.</I> And again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>,

 They have <I>seen and hated both me and my Father.</I> Note,

 (1.) There are those that hate God, notwithstanding the beauty of his 
 nature and the bounty of his providence; they are enraged at his 
 justice, as the devils that believe it and tremble, are vexed at his 
 dominion, and would gladly <I>break his bands asunder.</I> Those who 
 cannot bring themselves to deny that there is a God, and yet wish there 
 were none, they see and hate him. 

 (2.) Hatred of Christ will be construed and adjudged hatred of God, for 
 he is in his person his Father's express image, and in his office his 
 great agent and ambassador. God will have all men to honour the Son as 
 they honour the Father, and therefore what entertainment the Son has, 
 that the Father has. Hence it is easy to infer that those who are 
 enemies to the Christian religion, however they may cry up natural 
 religion, are really enemies to all religion. Deists are in effect
 atheists, and those that ridicule the light of the gospel would, if 
 they could, extinguish even natural light, and shake off all 
 obligations of conscience and the fear of God. Let an unbelieving 
 malignant world know that their enmity to the gospel of Christ will be 
 looked upon in the great day as an enmity to the blessed God himself; 
 and let all that suffer for righteousness' sake, according to the will 
 of God, take comfort from this; if God himself be hated in them, and 
 struck at through him, they need not be either ashamed of their cause 
 or afraid of the issue.</P>

 Christ having spoken of the great opposition which his gospel was 
 likely to meet with in the world, and the hardships that would be put 
 upon the preachers of it, lest any should fear that they and it would 
 be run down by that violent torrent, he here intimates to all those 
 that were well-wishers to his cause and interest what effectual 
 provision was made for supporting it, both by the principal testimony 
 of the Spirit

 and the subordinate testimony of the apostles
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),
 
 and testimonies are the proper supports of truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is here promised that the blessed Spirit shall maintain the cause
 of Christ in the world, notwithstanding the opposition it should meet
 with. Christ, when he was reviled, committed his injured cause to his
 Father, and did not lose by his silence, for the Comforter came,
 pleaded it powerfully, and carried it triumphantly. "<I>When the
 Comforter</I> or Advocate <I>is come, who proceedeth from the
 Father,</I> and <I>whom I will send</I> to supply the want of my bodily
 presence, <I>he shall testify of me</I> against those that <I>hate me
 without cause.</I>" We have more in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:26">this verse</A>

 concerning the Holy Ghost than in any one verse besides in the Bible;
 and, being baptized into his name, we are concerned to acquaint 
 ourselves with him as far as he is revealed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is an account of him in his essence, or subsistence rather. He 
 is <I>the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father.</I> Here, 
 
 (1.) He is spoken of as a distinct person; not a quality or property, 
 but a person under the proper name of a <I>Spirit,</I> and proper title 
 of the <I>Spirit of truth,</I> a title fitly given him where he is 
 brought in testifying. 

 (2.) As a divine person, that <I>proceedeth from the Father,</I> by 
 out-goings that were of old, <I>from everlasting.</I> The spirit or 
 breath of man, called the <I>breath of life,</I> proceeds from the man, 
 and by it modified he delivers his mind, by it invigorated he sometimes 
 exerts his strength to <I>blow out</I> what he would extinguish, and 
 <I>blow up</I> what he would excite. Thus the blessed Spirit is the
 emanation of divine light, and the energy of divine power. The rays of 
 the sun, by which it dispenses and diffuses its light, heat, and 
 influence, proceed from the sun, and yet are one with it. The 
 <I>Nicene</I> Creed says, The Spirit <I>proceedeth from the Father and 
 the Son,</I> for he is called the <I>Spirit of the Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:6">Gal. iv. 6</A>.
 
 And the Son is here said to <I>send him.</I> The Greek church chose
 rather to say, <I>from the Father by the Son.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In his mission. 

 (1.) He will come in a more plentiful effusion of his gifts, graces, 
 and powers, than had ever yet been. Christ had been long the <B><I>ho 
 erchomenos</I></B>--<I>he that should come;</I> now the blessed Spirit 
 is so. 
 
 (2.) <I>I will send him to you from the Father.</I> He had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:16"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 16</A>),

 <I>I will pray the Father, and he shall send you the Comforter,</I>
 which bespeaks the Spirit to be the fruit of the intercession Christ
 makes within the veil: here he says, <I>I will send him,</I> which
 bespeaks him to be the fruit of his dominion within the veil. The
 Spirit was sent, 

 [1.] By Christ as Mediator, now <I>ascended on high to give gifts unto 
 men,</I> and all power being given to him.

 [2.] From the Father: "Not only from heaven, my Father's house" (the
 Spirit was given in a <I>sound from heaven,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:2">Acts ii. 2</A>),

 "but according to my Father's will and appointment, and with his
 concurring power and authority." 

 [3.] To the apostles to instruct them in their preaching, enable them 
 for working, and carry them through their sufferings. He was given to 
 them and their successors, both in Christianity and in the ministry; to 
 them and their seed, and their seed's seed, according to that promise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:21">Isa. lix. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. In his office and operations, which are two:--

 (1.) One implied in the title given to him; he is the <I>Comforter,</I> 
 or <I>Advocate.</I> An advocate for Christ, to maintain his cause 
 against the world's infidelity, a comforter to the saints against the 
 world's hatred. 

 (2.) Another expressed: <I>He shall testify of me.</I> He is not only 
 an advocate, but a witness for Jesus Christ; he is one of the three 
 that <I>bear record in heaven,</I> and the first of the three that 
 <I>bear witness on earth.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7,8">1 John v. 7, 8</A>.

 He instructed the apostles, and enabled them to work miracles; he 
 indited the scriptures, which are the standing witnesses that 
 <I>testify of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:39"><I>ch.</I> v. 39</A>.

 The power of the ministry is derived from the Spirit, for he qualifies
 ministers; and the power of Christianity too, for he sanctifies 
 Christians, and in both testifies of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It is here promised that the apostles also, by the Spirit's 
 assistance, should have the honour of being Christ's witnesses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):
 
 <I>And you also shall bear witness</I> of me, being competent 
 witnesses, for <I>you have been with</I> me from the beginning of my 
 ministry. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the apostles were appointed to be witnesses for Christ in the
 world. When he had said, <I>The Spirit shall testify,</I> he adds, 
 <I>And you also shall bear witness.</I> Note, The Spirit's working is 
 not to supersede, but to engage and encourage ours. Though the Spirit 
 testify, ministers also must bear their testimony, and people attend to 
 it; for the Spirit of grace witnesses and works by the means of grace. 
 The apostles were the first witnesses that were called in the famous 
 trial between Christ and the prince of this world, which issued in the 
 ejectment of the intruder. This intimates, 

 (1.) The work cut out for them; they were to attest the truth, the 
 whole truth, and nothing but the truth, concerning Christ, for the 
 recovering of his just right, and the maintaining of his crown and 
 dignity. Though Christ's disciples fled when they should have been 
 witnesses for him upon his trial before the high priest and Pilate, yet 
 after the Spirit was poured out upon them they appeared courageous in 
 vindication of the cause of Christ against the accusations it was 
 loaded with. The truth of the Christian religion was to be proved very 
 much by the evidence of matter of fact, especially Christ's 
 resurrection, of which the apostles were in a particular manner chosen 
 witnesses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:41">Acts x. 41</A>),
 
 and they bore their testimony accordingly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:15,5:32">Acts iii. 15; v. 32</A>.

 Christ's ministers are his witnesses. 

 (2.) The honour put upon them hereby--that they should be <I>workers 
 together with God.</I> "The <I>Spirit shall testify of me,</I> and you 
 also, under the conduct of the Spirit, and in concurrence with the 
 Spirit (who will preserve you from mistaking in that which you relate 
 on your own knowledge, and will inform you of that which you cannot 
 know but by revelation), <I>shall bear witness.</I>" This might 
 encourage them against the hatred and contempt of the world, that 
 Christ had honoured them, and would own them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they were qualified to be so: <I>You have been with me from the 
 beginning.</I> They not only heard his public sermons, but had constant 
 private converse with him. He <I>went about doing good,</I> and, while 
 others saw the wonderful and merciful works that he did in their own 
 town and country only, those that went about with him were witnesses of 
 them all. They had likewise opportunity of observing the unspotted 
 purity of his conversation, and could witness for him that they never 
 saw in him, nor heard from him, any thing that had the least tincture 
 of human frailty. Note. 

 (1.) We have great reason to receive the record which the apostles gave 
 of Christ, for they did not speak by hearsay, but what they had the 
 greatest assurance of imaginable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:16,1Jo+1:1,3">2 Pet. i. 16; 1 John i. 1, 3</A>.

 (2.) Those are best able to bear witness for Christ that have
 themselves been with him, by faith, hope, and love, and by living a 
 life of communion with God in him. Ministers must first learn Christ, 
 and then preach him. Those speak best of the things of God that speak
 experimentally. It is particularly a great advantage to have been 
 acquainted with Christ <I>from the beginning,</I> to understand all 
 things from the <I>very first,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:3">Luke i. 3</A>.

 To have been with him from the beginning of our days. An early
 acquaintance and constant converse with the gospel of Christ will make 
 a man like a good householder.</P>
