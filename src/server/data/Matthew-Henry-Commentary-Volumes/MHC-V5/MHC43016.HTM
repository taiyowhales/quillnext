 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Among other glorious things God hath spoken of himself this is one, I
 wound, and I heal,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:39">
 Deut. xxxii. 39</A>.

 Christ's discourse in this chapter, which continues and concludes his
 farewell sermon to his disciples, does so. 

 I. Here are wounding words in the notice he gives them of the troubles
 that were before them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. Here are healing words in the comforts he administers to them for
 their support under those troubles, which are five:--

 1. That he would send them the Comforter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:7-15">ver. 7-15</A>.
 
 2. That he would visit them again at his resurrection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:16-22">ver. 16-22</A>.

 3. That he would secure to them an answer of peace to all their prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:23-27">ver. 23-27</A>.

 4. That he was now but returning to his Father,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:28-32">ver. 28-32</A>.

 5. That, whatever troubles they might meet with in this world, by 
 virtue of his victory over it they should be sure of peace in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:33">ver. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
 offended.
 &nbsp; 2  They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time
 cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God
 service.
 &nbsp; 3  And these things will they do unto you, because they have not
 known the Father, nor me.
 &nbsp; 4  But these things have I told you, that when the time shall
 come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I
 said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.
 &nbsp; 5  But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you
 asketh me, Whither goest thou?
 &nbsp; 6  But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath
 filled your heart.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ dealt faithfully with his disciples when he sent them forth on 
 his errands, for he told them the worst of it, that they might sit down 
 and count the cost. He had told them in the chapter before to expect 
 the world's hatred; now here in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gives them a reason why he alarmed them thus with the expectation 
 of trouble: <I>These things have I spoken unto you, that you should not 
 be offended,</I> or <I>scandalized,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 1. The disciples of Christ are apt to be offended at the cross; and the
 offence of the cross is a dangerous temptation, even to good men, to
 turn back from the ways of God, or turn aside out of them, or drive on
 heavily in them; to quit either their integrity or their comfort. It is
 not for nothing that a suffering time is called <I>an hour of
 temptation.</I> 

 2. Our Lord Jesus, by giving us notice of trouble, designed to take off
 the terror of it, that it might not be a surprise to us. Of all the 
 adversaries of our peace, in this world of troubles, none insult us 
 more violently, nor put our troops more into disorder, than 
 disappointment does; but we can easily welcome a guest we expect, and 
 <I>being fore-warned are fore-armed--Pr&aelig;moniti, 
 pr&aelig;muniti.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He foretels particularly what they should suffer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "Those that have power to do it shall <I>put you out of their 
 synagogues;</I> and this is not the worst, <I>they shall kill you." 
 Ecce duo-gladii--Behold two swords</I> drawn against the followers of 
 the Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sword of ecclesiastical censure; this is drawn against them by 
 the Jews, for they were the only pretenders to church-power. They shall 
 <I>cast you out of their synagogues;</I> <B><I>aposynagogous poiesousin 
 hymas</I></B>--<I>they shall make you excommunicates.</I> 

 (1.) "They shall cast you out of the particular synagogues you were 
 members of." At first, they scourged them in their synagogues as 
 contemners of the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:17">Matt. x. 17</A>),

 and at length cast them out as incorrigible. 

 (2.) "They shall cast you out of the congregation of Israel in general, 
 the national church of the Jews; shall debar you from the privileges of 
 that, put you into the condition of an outlaw," <I>qui caput gerit 
 lupinum--to be knocked on the head, like another wolf;</I> "they will 
 look upon you as Samaritans, as heathen men and publicans." 
 <I>Interdico tibi aqua et igne--I forbid you the use of water and 
 fire.</I> And were it not for the penalties, forfeitures, and 
 incapacities, incurred hereby, it would be no injury to be thus driven 
 out of a house infected and falling. Note, It has often been the lot
 of Christ's disciples to be unjustly excommunicated. Many a good truth 
 has been branded with an anathema, and many a child of God <I>delivered 
 to Satan.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The sword of civil power: "The time cometh, <I>the hour is come;</I> 
 now things are likely to be worse with you than hitherto they have 
 been; when you are expelled as heretics, they will <I>kill you, and 
 think they do God service,</I> and others will think so too." 

 (1.) You will find them really cruel: They will <I>kill you.</I> 
 Christ's sheep have been accounted as sheep for the slaughter; the 
 twelve apostles (we are told) were all put to death, except John. 
 Christ had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:27"><I>ch.</I> xv. 27</A>),

 You shall <I>bear witness,</I> <B><I>martyreite</I></B>--<I>you shall
 be martyrs,</I> shall seal the truth with your blood, your heart's 
 blood. 

 (2.) You will find them <I>seemingly conscientious;</I> they will think 
 they do God service; they will seem <B><I>latreian 
 prospherein</I></B>--<I>to offer a good sacrifice</I> to God; as those 
 that cast out God's servants of old, and said, <I>Let the Lord be 
 glorified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5">Isa. lxvi. 5</A>.

 Note, 

 [1.] It is possible for those that are real enemies to God's service to 
 pretend a mighty zeal for it. The devil's work has many a time been 
 done in God's livery, and one of the most mischievous enemies 
 Christianity ever had sits <I>in the temple of God.</I> Nay, 

 [2.] It is common to patronise an enmity to religion with a color of 
 duty to God, and service to his church. God's people have suffered the 
 greatest hardships from conscientious persecutors. Paul verily thought 
 he <I>ought to do</I> what he did <I>against the name of Jesus.</I> 
 This does not at all lessen the sin of the persecutors, for villanies 
 will never be consecrated by putting the name of God to them; but it 
 does enhance the sufferings of the persecuted, to die under the 
 character of being enemies to God; but there will be a resurrection of 
 names as well as of bodies at the great day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives them the true reason of the world's enmity and rage 
 against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>These things will they do unto you,</I> not because you have done 
 them any harm, but <I>because they have not known the Father, nor 
 me.</I> Let this comfort you, that none will be your enemies but the 
 worst of men." Note, 

 1. Many that pretend to know God are wretchedly ignorant of him. Those
 that pretend to <I>do him service</I> thought they knew him, but it was 
 a wrong notion they had of him. Israel transgressed the covenant, and 
 yet cried, <I>My God, we know thee.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:1,2">Hos. viii. 1, 2</A>.

 2. Those that are ignorant of Christ cannot have any right knowledge of 
 God. In vain do men pretend to know God and religion, while they slight 
 Christ and Christianity. 

 3. Those are very ignorant indeed of God and Christ that think it an
 acceptable piece of service to persecute good people. Those that know 
 Christ know that he <I>came not into the world to destroy men's lives, 
 but to save them;</I> that he rules by the power of truth and love, not 
 of fire and sword. Never was such a persecuting church as that which 
 makes <I>ignorance the mother of devotion.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He tells them why he gave them notice of this now, and why not 
 sooner.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Why he told them of it now 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 not to discourage them, or add to their present sorrow; nor did he tell 
 them of their danger that they might contrive how to avoid it, but that 
 "when <I>the time shall come</I> (and you may be sure it will come), 
 you may <I>remember that I told you.</I>" Note, When suffering times 
 come it will be of use to us to remember what Christ has told us of 
 sufferings. 

 (1.) That our belief of Christ's foresight and faithfulness may be 
 confirmed; and, 

 (2.) That the trouble may be the less grievous, for we were told of it 
 before, and we took up our profession in expectation of it, so that it 
 ought not to be a surprise to us, nor looked upon as a wrong to us. As 
 Christ in his sufferings, so his followers in theirs, should have an 
 eye to the <I>fulfilling of the scripture.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Why he did not tell them of it sooner: "<I>I spoke not this to you 
 from the beginning</I> when you and I came to be first acquainted, 
 because <I>I was with you.</I>" 

 (1.) While he was with them, he bore the shock of the world's malice, 
 and stood in the front of the battle; against him the powers of 
 darkness levelled all their force, not against <I>small or great,</I> 
 but only against the <I>king of Israel,</I> and therefore he did not 
 need to say so much to them of suffering, because it did not fall much 
 to their share; but we do find that from the beginning he bade them 
 prepare for sufferings; and therefore, 

 (2.) It seems rather to be meant of the promise of <I>another 
 comforter.</I> This he had said little of to them <I>at the 
 beginning,</I> because he was himself with them to instruct, guide, and 
 comfort them, and then they needed not the promise of the Spirit's 
 extraordinary presence. The children of the bride-chamber would not 
 have so much need of a comforter till the bridegroom should be <I>taken 
 away.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He expresses a very affectionate concern for the present sadness of 
 his disciples, upon occasion of what he had said to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 "<I>Now</I> I am to be no longer with you, but <I>go my way to him that 
 sent me,</I> to repose there, after this fatigue; and <I>none of you 
 asketh me,</I> with any courage, <I>Whither goest thou?</I> But, 
 instead of enquiring after that which would comfort you, you pore upon 
 that which looks melancholy, and <I>sorrow has filled your 
 heart.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He had told them that he was about to leave them: <I>Now I go my 
 way.</I> He was not driven away by force, but voluntarily departed; his 
 life was not extorted from him, but deposited by him. He went <I>to him 
 that sent him,</I> to give an account of his negotiation. Thus, when we 
 depart out of this world, we <I>go to him that sent us</I> into it, 
 which should make us all solicitous to live to good purposes, 
 remembering we have a commission to execute, which must be returned at 
 a certain day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He had told them what hard times they must suffer when he was gone, 
 and that they must not expect such an easy quiet life as they had had. 
 Now, if these were the legacies he had to leave to them, who had 
 <I>left all</I> for him, they would be tempted to think they had made a 
 sorry bargain of it, and were, for the present, in a consternation 
 about it, in which their master sympathizes with them, yet blames them,

 (1.) That they were careless of the means of comfort, and did not stir
 up themselves to seek it: <I>None of you asks me, Whither goest
 thou?</I> Peter had started this question 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:36"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 36</A>),

 and Thomas had seconded it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:5"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 5</A>),

 but they did not pursue it, they did not take the answer; they were in
 the dark concerning it, and did not enquire further, nor seek for 
 fuller satisfaction; they did not continue seeking, continue knocking. 
 See what a compassionate teacher Christ is, and how condescending to 
 the weak and ignorant. Many a teacher will not endure that the learner 
 should ask the same question twice; if he cannot take a thing quickly, 
 let him go without it; but our Lord Jesus knows how to deal with babes, 
 that must be taught with <I>precept upon precept.</I> If the disciples 
 here would have found that his going away was for his advancement, and 
 therefore his departure from them should not inordinately trouble them 
 (for why should they be against his preferment?) and for their 
 advantage, and therefore their sufferings for him should not 
 inordinately trouble them; for a sight of <I>Jesus at the right hand of 
 God</I> would be an effectual support to them, as it was to Stephen. 
 Note, A humble believing enquiry into the design and tendency of the 
 darkest dispensations of Providence would help to reconcile us to them, 
 and to grieve the less, and fear the less, because of them; it will 
 silence us to ask, Whence came they? but will abundantly satisfy us to 
 ask, Whither go they? for we know they <I>work for good,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:28">Rom. viii. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That they were too intent, and pored too much, upon the occasions 
 of their grief: <I>Sorrow has filled their hearts.</I> Christ had said 
 enough to fill them with joy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:11"><I>ch.</I> xv. 11</A>);

 but by looking at that only which made against them, and overlooking
 that which made for them, they were so full of sorrow that there was no 
 room left for joy. Note, It is the common fault and folly of melancholy 
 Christians to dwell upon the dark side of the cloud, to meditate 
 nothing but terror, and turn a deaf ear to <I>the voice of joy and 
 gladness.</I> That which filled the disciples' hearts with sorrow, and 
 hindered the operation of the cordials Christ administered, was too 
 great an affection to this present life. They were big with hopes of 
 their Master's external kingdom and glory, and that they should shine 
 and reign with him: and now, instead of that, to hear of nothing but 
 bonds and afflictions, this filled them with sorrow. Nothing is a 
 greater prejudice to our joy in God than <I>the love of the world;</I> 
 and <I>the sorrow of the world,</I> the consequence of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you
 that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come
 unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.
 &nbsp; 8  And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
 righteousness, and of judgment:
 &nbsp; 9  Of sin, because they believe not on me;
 &nbsp; 10  Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me
 no more;
 &nbsp; 11  Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
 &nbsp; 12  I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear
 them now.
 &nbsp; 13  Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide
 you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but
 whatsoever he shall hear, <I>that</I> shall he speak: and he will show
 you things to come.
 &nbsp; 14  He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall
 show <I>it</I> unto you.
 &nbsp; 15  All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I,
 that he shall take of mine, and shall show <I>it</I> unto you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As it was usual with the Old Testament prophets to comfort the church 
 in its calamities with the promise of the Messiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6,Mic+5:6,Zec+3:8">Isa. ix. 6; 
 Mic. v. 6; Zech. iii. 8</A>);

 so, the Messiah being come, the promise of the Spirit was the great 
 cordial, and is still.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three things we have here concerning <I>the Comforter's 
 coming:</I>--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That Christ's departure was absolutely necessary to the Comforter's 
 coming, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The disciples were so loth to believe this that Christ saw cause to
 assert it with a more than ordinary solemnity: <I>I tell you the 
 truth.</I> We may be confident of <I>the truth</I> of everything that 
 Christ told us; he has no design to impose upon us. Now, to make them
 easy, he here tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In general, <I>It was expedient for them that he should go away.</I> 
 This was strange doctrine, but if it was true it was comfortable 
 enough, and showed them how absurd their sorrow was. <I>It is 
 expedient,</I> not only for me, but <I>for you</I> also, <I>that I go 
 away;</I> though they did not see it, and are loth to believe it, so it 
 is. Note, 

 (1.) Those things often seem grievous to us that are really expedient 
 for us; and particularly our going away when we have finished our 
 course. 

 (2.) Our Lord Jesus is always for that which is most expedient for us, 
 whether we think so or no. He deals not with us according to the folly 
 of our own choice, but graciously over-rules it, and gives us the 
 physic we are loth to take, because he knows it is good for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>It was therefore expedient</I> because it was in order to the 
 sending of the Spirit. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That Christ's going was in order to the Comforter's coming.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] This is expressed negatively: <I>If I go not away, the Comforter 
 will not come.</I> And why not? <I>First,</I> So it was settled in the 
 divine counsels concerning this affair, and the measure must not be 
 altered; <I>shall the earth be forsaken for them?</I> He that gives
 freely may recall one gift before he bestows another, while we would
 fondly hold all. <I>Secondly,</I> It is congruous enough that the
 ambassador extraordinary should be recalled, before the envoy come,
 that is constantly to reside. <I>Thirdly,</I> The sending of the Spirit
 was to be the fruit of Christ's purchase, and that purchase was to be
 made by his death, which was his going away. <I>Fourthly,</I> It was to
 be an answer to his intercession within the veil. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:16"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 16</A>.

 Thus must this gift be both paid for, and prayed for, by our Lord
 Jesus, that we might learn to put the greater value upon it. 
 <I>Fifthly,</I> The great argument the Spirit was to use in convincing 
 the world must be Christ's ascension into heaven, and his welcome here. 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:10,Joh+7:39"><I>v.</I> 10, 
 and <I>ch.</I> vii. 39</A>.

 <I>Lastly,</I> The disciples must be weaned from his bodily presence, 
 which they were too apt to dote upon, before they were duly prepared to 
 receive the spiritual aids and comforts of a new dispensation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It is expressed positively: <I>If I depart I will send him to 
 you;</I> as though he had said, "Trust me to provide effectually that 
 you shall be no loser by my departure." The glorified Redeemer is not 
 unmindful of his church on earth, nor will ever leave it without its 
 necessary supports. Though he <I>departs, he sends the Comforter,</I> 
 nay, he departs on purpose to send him. Thus still, though one 
 generation of ministers and Christians depart, another is raised up in 
 their room, for Christ will maintain his own cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That the presence of Christ's Spirit in his church is so much 
 better, and more desirable, than his bodily presence, that it was 
 really expedient for us that he should go away, to send the Comforter. 
 His corporal presence could be put in one place at one time, but his 
 Spirit is every where, in all places, at all times, wherever <I>two or 
 three are gathered in his name.</I> Christ's bodily presence draws 
 men's eyes, his Spirit draws their hearts; that was <I>the letter</I> 
 which <I>kills,</I> his <I>Spirit gives life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the coming of <I>the Spirit</I> was absolutely necessary to 
 the carrying on of Christ's interests on earth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>And when he is come,</I> <B><I>elthon ekeinos</I></B>. He that is 
 sent is willing of himself to come, and at his first coming he will do 
 this, <I>he will reprove,</I> or, as the margin reads it, <I>he will 
 convince the world,</I> by your ministry, concerning <I>sin, 
 righteousness, and judgment.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See here what the office of the Spirit is, and on what errand he is 
 sent. 

 (1.) To <I>reprove.</I> The Spirit, by the word and conscience, is a 
 reprover; ministers are reprovers by office, and by them the Spirit 
 reproves. 

 (2.) To <I>convince.</I> It is a law-term, and speaks the office of the 
 judge in summing up the evidence, and setting a matter that has been 
 long canvassed in a clear and true light. He shall <I>convince,</I> 
 that is, "He shall put to silence the adversaries of Christ and his 
 cause, by discovering and demonstrating the falsehood and fallacy of 
 that which they have maintained, and the truth and certainty of that 
 which they have opposed." Note, Convincing work is the Spirit's work; 
 he can do it effectually, and none but he; man may open the cause, but 
 it is the Spirit only that can open the heart. The Spirit is called the 
 <I>Comforter</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and here it is said, <I>He shall convince.</I> One would think this 
 were cold comfort, but it is the method the Spirit takes, first to 
 convince, and then to comfort; first to lay open the wound, and then to 
 apply healing medicines. Or, taking conviction more generally, for a 
 demonstration of what is right, it intimates that the Spirit's comforts 
 are solid, and grounded upon truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See who they are whom he is to reprove and convince: <I>The 
 world,</I> both Jew and Gentile. 

 (1.) He shall give the world the most powerful means of conviction, for 
 the apostles shall go into all the world, backed by the Spirit, to 
 preach the gospel, fully proved. 

 (2.) He shall sufficiently provide for the taking off and silencing of 
 the objections and prejudices of the world against the gospel. Many an 
 infidel was <I>convinced of all and judged of all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:24">1 Cor. xiv. 24</A>.
 
 (3.) He shall effectually and savingly convince many in the world, some 
 in every age, in every place, in order to their conversion to the faith 
 of Christ. Now this was an encouragement to the disciples, in reference 
 to the difficulties they were likely to meet with, 

 [1.] That they should see good done, Satan's kingdom <I>fall like 
 lightning,</I> which would be their joy, as it was his. Even this 
 malignant world the Spirit shall work upon; and the conviction of 
 sinners is the comfort of faithful ministers. 

 [2.] That this would be the fruit of their services and sufferings, 
 these should contribute very much to this good work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. See what the Spirit shall convince the world of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Of sin</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>because they believe not on me.</I> 

 [1.] The Spirit is sent to convince sinners of sin, not barely to tell 
 them of it; in conviction there is more than this; it is to prove it 
 upon them, and force them to own it, as they

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:9"><I>ch.</I> viii. 9</A>)

 that were <I>convicted of their own consciences. Make them to know
 their abominations.</I> The Spirit convinces of the fact of sin, that 
 we have done so and so; of the fault of sin, that we have done ill in 
 doing so; of the folly of sin, that we have acted against right reason, 
 and our true interest; of the filth of sin, that by it we are become 
 odious to God; of the fountain of sin, the corrupt nature; and lastly, 
 of the fruit of sin, that the end thereof is death. The Spirit 
 demonstrates the depravity and degeneracy of the whole world, that all 
 the world is guilty before God. 

 [2.] The Spirit, in conviction, fastens especially upon the sin of 
 unbelief, their not believing in Christ, <I>First,</I> As the great 
 reigning sin. There was, and is, a world of people, that believe not in 
 Jesus Christ, and they are not sensible that it is their sin. Natural 
 conscience tells them that murder and theft are sin; but it is a 
 supernatural work of the spirit to convince them that it is a sin to 
 suspend their belief of the gospel, and to reject the salvation offered 
 by it. Natural religion, after it has given us its best discoveries and 
 directions, lays and leaves us under this further obligation, that 
 whatever divine revelation shall be made to us at any time, with 
 sufficient evidence to prove it divine, we accept it, and submit to it. 
 This law those transgress who, when <I>God speaketh to us by his Son, 
 refuse him that speaketh;</I> and therefore it is sin.
 <I>Secondly,</I> As the great ruining sin. Every sin is so in its own 
 nature; no sin is so to them that believe in Christ; so that it is 
 unbelief that damns sinners. It is because of this that they cannot 
 <I>enter into rest,</I> that they cannot <I>escape the wrath of 
 God;</I> it is a sin against the remedy. <I>Thirdly,</I> As that which 
 is at the bottom of all sin; so Calvin takes it. The Spirit shall 
 convince the world that the true reason why sin reigns among them is 
 because they are not by faith united to Christ. <I>Ne putimus vel 
 guttam unam rectitudinis sine Christo nobis inesse--Let us not suppose 
 that, apart from Christ, we have a drop of rectitude.</I>--Calvin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no 
 more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 We may understand this, 

 [1.] Of Christ's personal righteousness. He shall convince the world 
 that Jesus of Nazareth was Christ the righteous

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1">1 John ii. 1</A>),
 
 as the centurion owned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:47">Luke xxiii. 47</A>),
 
 <I>Certainly this was a righteous man.</I> His enemies put him under 
 the worst of characters, and multitudes were not or would not be 
 convinced but that he was a bad man, which strengthened their 
 prejudices against his doctrine; but he is <I>justified by the 
 spirit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16">1 Tim. iii. 16</A>),

 he is proved to be a <I>righteous man,</I> and not, a deceiver; and 
 then the point is in effect gained; for he is either the great Redeemer 
 or a great cheat; but a cheat we are sure he is not. Now by what medium 
 or argument will the Spirit convince men of the sincerity of the Lord 
 Jesus? Why, <I>First,</I> Their <I>seeing him no more</I> will 
 contribute something towards the removal of their prejudices; they 
 shall see him no more <I>in the likeness of sinful flesh, in the form 
 of a servant,</I> which made them slight him. Moses was more respected 
 after his removal than before. But, <I>Secondly,</I> His <I>going to 
 the Father</I> would be a full conviction of it. The coming of the 
 Spirit, according to the promise, was a proof of Christ's exaltation to 
 God's <I>right hand</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:33">Acts ii. 33</A>),

 and this was a demonstration of his righteousness; for the holy God 
 would never set a deceiver at his right hand. 

 [2.] Of Christ's righteousness communicated to us for our justification 
 and salvation; that everlasting righteousness which Messiah was to 
 bring in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24">Dan. ix. 24</A>.

 Now, <I>First,</I> The Spirit shall convince men of this righteousness.
 Having by convictions of sin shown them their need of a righteousness, 
 lest this should drive them to despair he will show them where it is to 
 be had, and how they may, upon their believing, be acquitted from 
 guilt, and accepted as righteous in God's sight. It was hard to 
 convince those of this righteousness that <I>went about to establish 
 their own</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:3">Rom. x. 3</A>),

 but the Spirit will do it. <I>Secondly,</I> Christ's ascension is the
 great argument proper to convince men of this righteousness: <I>I go to 
 the Father, and,</I> as an evidence of my welcome with him, <I>you 
 shall see me no more.</I> If Christ had left any part of his 
 undertaking unfinished, he had been sent back again; but now that we 
 are sure he is <I>at the right hand of God,</I> we are sure of being 
 justified through him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) <I>Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Observe here, 

 [1.] The devil, <I>the prince of this world,</I> was judged, was
 discovered to be a great deceiver and destroyer, and as such judgment 
 was entered against him, and execution in part done. He was cast out of 
 the Gentile world when his oracles were silenced and his altars 
 deserted, cast out of the bodies of many in Christ's name, which 
 miraculous power continued long in the church; he was cast out of the 
 souls of people by the grace of God working with the gospel of Christ; 
 he <I>fell as lightning from heaven.</I> 

 [2.] This is a good argument wherewith the Spirit convinces the world 
 of judgment, that is, <I>First,</I> Of inherent holiness and 
 sanctification, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:18">Matt. xii. 18</A>.

 By <I>the judgment of the prince of this world,</I> it appears that
 Christ is stronger than Satan, and can disarm and dispossess him, and 
 set up his throne upon the ruin of his. <I>Secondly,</I> Of a new and
 better dispensation of things. He shall show that Christ's errand into 
 the world was to set things to right in it, and to introduce times of 
 reformation and regeneration; and he proves it by this, that <I>the 
 prince of this world,</I> the great master of misrule, is judged and 
 expelled. All will be well when his power is broken who made the 
 mischief. <I>Thirdly,</I> Of the power and dominion of the Lord Jesus.
 He shall convince the world that <I>all judgment is committed to 
 him,</I> and that he is the <I>Lord of all,</I> which is evident by 
 this, that he has judged the prince of this world, has broken <I>the 
 serpent's head, destroyed him that had the power of death, and spoiled 
 principalities;</I> if Satan be thus subdued by Christ, we may be sure 
 no other power can stand before him. <I>Fourthly,</I> Of the final day
 of judgment: all the obstinate enemies of Christ's gospel and kingdom 
 shall certainly be reckoned with at last, for the devil, their 
 ringleader, is judged.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That the coming of the Spirit would be of unspeakable advantage to 
 the disciples themselves. The Spirit has work to do, not only on the 
 enemies of Christ, to convince and humble them, but upon his servants 
 and agents, to instruct and comfort them; and therefore it was 
 <I>expedient for them that he should go away.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He intimates to them the tender sense he had of their present 
 weakness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>I have yet many things to say unto you</I> (not which should have
 been said, but which he could and would have said), <I>but you cannot 
 bear them now.</I> See what a teacher Christ is. 

 (1.) None like him for copiousness; when he has said much, he has still 
 many things more to say; treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid in 
 him, if we be not straitened in ourselves. 

 (2.) None like him for compassion; he would have told them more of 
 <I>the things pertaining to the kingdom of God,</I> particularly of the 
 rejection of the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles, but they could 
 not bear it, it would have confounded and stumbled them, rather than 
 have given them any satisfaction. When, after his resurrection, they 
 spoke to him of <I>restoring the kingdom to Israel,</I> he referred 
 them to <I>the coming of the Holy Ghost,</I> by which they should 
 receive power to bear those discoveries which were so contrary to the 
 notions they had received that they could not <I>bear them now.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He assures them of sufficient assistances, by the pouring out of the 
 Spirit. They were now conscious to themselves of great dulness, and 
 many mistakes; and what shall they do now their master is leaving them? 
 "<I>But when he, the Spirit of Truth, is come,</I> you will be easy, 
 and all will be well." Well indeed; for he shall undertake to guide the 
 apostles, and glorify Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To guide the apostles. He will take care,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That they do not miss their way: <I>He will guide you;</I> as the 
 camp of Israel was guided through the wilderness by <I>the pillar of 
 cloud and fire.</I> The Spirit guided their tongues in speaking, and 
 their pens in writing, to secure them from mistakes. The Spirit is 
 given us to be our guide 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:14">Rom. viii. 14</A>),

 not only to show us the way, but to go along with us, by his continued 
 aids and influences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That they do not come short of their end: <I>He will guide them 
 into all truth,</I> as the skilful pilot guides the ship into the port 
 it is bound for. To be led <I>into a truth</I> is more than barely to 
 know it; it is to be intimately and experimentally acquainted with it; 
 to be piously and strongly affected with it; not only to have the 
 notion of it in our heads, but the relish and savour and power of it in 
 our hearts; it denotes a gradual discovery of truth shining more and 
 more: "He shall lead you by those truths that are plain and easy to 
 those that are more difficult." But how into <I>all truth?</I> The 
 meaning is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Into the whole truth relating to their embassy; whatever 
 was needful or useful for them to know, in order to the due discharge 
 of their office, they should be fully instructed in it; what truths 
 they were to teach others the Spirit would teach them, would give them 
 the understanding of, and enable them both to explain and to 
 defend.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Into nothing but the truth. All that <I>he shall guide 
 you into</I> shall be <I>truth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27">1 John ii. 27</A>);

 <I>the anointing is truth.</I> In the following words he proves both 
 these:--

 1. "The Spirit shall teach nothing but the truth, <I>for he shall not
 speak of himself</I> any doctrine distinct from mine, <I>but whatsoever 
 he shall hear,</I> and knows to be the mind of the Father, <I>that,</I> 
 and that only, <I>shall he speak.</I>" This intimates,

 (1.) That the testimony of the Spirit, in the word and by the apostles, 
 is what we may rely upon. The <I>Spirit</I> knows <I>and searches all 
 things, even the deep things of God,</I> and the apostles received that 
 Spirit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:10,11">1 Cor. ii. 10, 11</A>),

 so that we may venture our souls upon the Spirit's word.

 (2.) That the testimony of the Spirit always concurs with the word of 
 Christ, <I>for he does not speak of himself,</I> has no separate 
 interest or intention of his own, but, as in essence so in records, he 
 <I>is one with the Father and the Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:7">1 John v. 7</A>.

 Men's word and spirit often disagree, but the eternal Word and the
 eternal Spirit never do.

 2. "He shall teach you all truth, and keep back nothing that is
 profitable for you, for <I>he will show you things to come.</I>" The 
 Spirit was in the apostles a Spirit of prophecy; it was foretold that 
 he should be so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:28">Joel ii. 28</A>),

 and he was so. <I>The Spirit showed them things to come,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+11:28,20:23,21:11">Acts xi. 28; xx. 23; xxi. 11</A>.

 The Spirit spoke of the apostasy of the <I>latter times,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:1">1 Tim. iv. 1</A>.

 John, when he was in the Spirit had <I>things to come</I> shown him in 
 vision. Now this was a great satisfaction to their own minds, and of 
 use to them in their conduct, and was also a great confirmation of 
 their mission. Jansenius has a pious note upon this: We should not
 grudge that the Spirit does not <I>show us things to come</I> in this 
 world, as he did to the apostles; let it suffice that the Spirit in the 
 word hath <I>shown us things to come</I> in the other world, which are 
 our chief concern.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The Spirit undertook to glorify Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 [1.] Even the sending of the Spirit was the glorifying of Christ. God
 the Father glorified him in heaven, and the Spirit glorified him on
 earth. It was the honour of the Redeemer that the Spirit was both sent
 in his name and sent on his errand, to carry on and perfect his
 undertaking. All the gifts and graces of the Spirit, all the preaching
 and all the writing of the apostles, under the influence of the Spirit,
 the tongues, and miracles, were to glorify Christ. 

 [2.] The Spirit glorified Christ by leading his followers into <I>the 
 truth as it is in Jesus,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:21">Eph. iv. 21</A>.

 He assures them, <I>First,</I> that the Spirit should communicate the
 things of Christ to them: <I>He shall receive of mine, and shall show 
 it unto you.</I> As in essence <I>he proceeded from the Son,</I> so in 
 influence and operation he derived from him. <I>He shall take</I>
 <B><I>ek tou emou</I></B>--<I>of that which is mine.</I> All that the 
 Spirit shows us, that is, applies to us, for our instruction and 
 comfort, all that he gives us for our strength and quickening, and all 
 that he secures and seals to us, did all belong to Christ, and was had 
 and received from him. All was his, for he bought it, and paid dearly 
 for it, and therefore he had reason to call it his own; his, for he 
 first received it; it was given him as the head of the church, to be 
 communicated by him to all his members. The Spirit came not to erect a 
 new kingdom, but to advance and establish the same kingdom that Christ 
 had erected, to maintain the same interest and pursue the same design; 
 those therefore that pretend to the Spirit, and vilify Christ, give 
 themselves the lie, for he came to glorify Christ. <I>Secondly,</I>
 That herein the things of God should be communicated to us. Lest any 
 should think that the receiving of this would not make them much the 
 richer, he adds, <I>All things that the Father hath are mine.</I> As 
 God, all that self-existent light and self-sufficient happiness which 
 <I>the Father has,</I> he has; as Mediator, <I>all things are delivered 
 to him of the Father</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Matt. xi. 27</A>);

 all that <I>grace and truth</I> which God designed to show us he lodged 
 in the hands of the Lord Jesus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:19">Col. i. 19</A>.

 Spiritual blessings in heavenly things are given by the Father to the 
 Son for us, and the Son entrusts the Spirit to convey them to us. Some 
 apply it to that which goes just before: <I>He shall show you things to 
 come,</I> and so it is explained by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:1">Rev. i. 1</A>.

 God gave <I>it to Christ, and he signified it to John, who wrote what
 the Spirit said,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little
 while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.
 &nbsp; 17  Then said <I>some</I> of his disciples among themselves, What is
 this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see
 me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because
 I go to the Father?
 &nbsp; 18  They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little
 while? we cannot tell what he saith.
 &nbsp; 19  Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said
 unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A
 little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while,
 and ye shall see me?
 &nbsp; 20  Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and
 lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful,
 but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
 &nbsp; 21  A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour
 is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she
 remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into
 the world.
 &nbsp; 22  And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again,
 and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from
 you.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus, for the comfort of his sorrowful disciples, here 
 promises that he would visit them again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Observe the intimation he gave them of the comfort he designed them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Here he tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they should now shortly lose the sight of him: <I>A little 
 while, and you</I> that have seen me so long, and still desire to 
 <I>see me, shall not see me;</I> and therefore, if they had any good 
 question to ask him, they must ask quickly, for he was now taking his 
 leave of them. Note, It is good to consider how near to a period our
 seasons of grace are, that we may be quickened to improve them while 
 they are continued. Now our eyes see our teachers, see the days <I>of 
 the Son of man;</I> but, perhaps, yet a <I>little while, and we shall 
 not see them.</I> They lost the sight of Christ, 

 (1.) At his death, when he withdrew from this world, and never after 
 showed himself openly in it. The most that death does to our Christian 
 friends is to take them out of our sight, not out of being, not out of 
 bliss, but out of all relation to us, only out of sight, and then not 
 out of mind. 

 (2.) At his ascension, when he withdrew from them (from those who,
 after his resurrection, had for some time conversed with him), <I>out 
 of their sight; a cloud received</I> him, and, though they looked up 
 steadfastly after him, <I>they saw him no more,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:9,10,2Ki+2:12">Acts i. 9, 10; 2 Kings ii. 12</A>.
 
 See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:16">2 Cor. v. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That yet they should speedily recover the sight of him; <I>Again a 
 little while, and you shall see me,</I> and therefore you ought not to 
 <I>sorrow as those that have no hope.</I> His farewell was not a final 
 farewell; they should see him again, 

 (1.) At his resurrection, soon after his death, when <I>he showed 
 himself alive,</I> by many infallible proofs, and this in a very little 
 while, not forty hours. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:2">Hos. vi. 2</A>.

 (2.) By the pouring out of the Spirit, soon after his ascension, which 
 scattered the mists of ignorance and mistake they were almost lost in, 
 and gave them a much clearer insight into the mysteries of Christ's 
 gospel than they had yet had. The Spirit's coming was Christ's visit to 
 his disciples, not a transient but a permanent one, and such a visit as 
 abundantly retrieved the sight of him. 

 (3.) At his second coming. They saw him again as they removed one by 
 one to him at death, and they shall see him together at the end of 
 time, when <I>he shall come in the clouds, and every eye shall see 
 him.</I> It might be truly said of this that it was but <I>a little 
 while, and they should see him;</I> for what are the days of time, to 
 the days of eternity?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:8,9">2 Pet. iii. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He assigns the reason: "<I>Because I go to the Father;</I> and 
 therefore," 

 (1.) "I must leave you for a time, because my business calls me to the 
 upper world, and you must be content to spare me, for really my 
 business is yours." 

 (2.) "Therefore you shall see me again shortly, for the Father will not 
 detain me to your prejudice. If I go upon your errand, you shall see me 
 again as soon as my business is done, as soon as is convenient."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It should seem, all this refers rather to his going away at death, and 
 return at his resurrection, than his going away at the ascension, and 
 his return at the end of time; for it was his death that was their 
 grief, not his ascension 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:52">Luke xxiv. 52</A>),

 and between his death and resurrection it was indeed a <I>little 
 while.</I> And it may be read, not, <I>yet a little while</I> (it is 
 not <B><I>eti mikron</I></B>, as it is

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:35"><I>ch.</I> xii. 35</A>),

 but <B><I>mikron</I></B>--<I>for a little while you shall not see
 me,</I> namely, the three days of his lying in the grave; and again, 
 <I>for a little while you shall see me,</I> namely, the forty days 
 between his resurrection and ascension. Thus we may say of our 
 ministers and Christian friends, <I>Yet a little while, and we shall 
 not see them,</I> either they must leave us or we must leave them, but 
 it is certain that we must part shortly, and yet not part for ever. It 
 is but a good night to those whom we hope to see with <I>joy in the 
 morning.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The perplexity of the disciples upon the intimation given them; 
 they were at a loss what to make of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>);

 <I>Some of them said,</I> softly, <I>among themselves,</I> either some 
 of the weakest, that were least able, or some of the most inquisitive, 
 that were most desirous, to understand him, <I>What is this that he 
 saith to us?</I> Though Christ had often spoken to this purport before, 
 yet still they were in the dark; though <I>precept be upon precept,</I> 
 it is in vain, unless God gave the understanding. Now see here, 

 1. The disciples' weakness, in that they could not understand so plain
 a saying, to which Christ had already given them a key, having told 
 them so often in plain terms that he should <I>be killed, and the third 
 day rise again;</I> yet, say they, <I>We cannot tell what he saith;</I> 
 for,

 (1.) <I>Sorrow had filled their heart,</I> and made them unapt to 
 receive the impressions of comfort. The darkness of ignorance and the 
 darkness of melancholy commonly increase and thicken one another; 
 mistakes cause griefs, and then griefs confirm mistakes. 

 (2.) The notion of Christ's secular kingdom was so deeply rooted in 
 them that they could make no sense at all of those sayings of his which 
 they knew not how to reconcile with that notion. When we think the 
 scripture must be made to agree with the false ideas we have imbibed, 
 no wonder that we complain of difficulty; but when our reasonings are 
 captivated to revelation, the matter becomes easy. 

 (3.) It should seem, that which puzzled them was the <I>little 
 while.</I> If he must go at least, yet they could not conceive how he 
 should leave them quickly, when his stay hitherto had been so short, 
 and so little while, comparatively. Thus it is hard for us to represent 
 to ourselves that change as near which yet we know will come certainly, 
 and may come suddenly. When we are told, <I>Yet a little while</I> and 
 we must go hence, <I>yet a little while</I> and we must <I>give up our 
 account,</I> we know not how to digest it; for we always took the 
 vision to be <I>for a great while to come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:27">Ezek. xii. 27</A>.

 2. Their willingness to be instructed. When they were at a loss about
 the meaning of Christ's words, they conferred together upon it, and 
 asked help of one another. By mutual converse about divine things we 
 both borrow the light of others and improve our own. Observe how 
 exactly they repeat Christ's words. Though we cannot fully solve every 
 difficulty we meet with in scripture, yet we must not therefore throw 
 it by, but revolve what we cannot explain, and wait <I>till God shall 
 reveal even this unto us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The further explication of what Christ had said.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See here <I>why</I> Christ explained it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 because he <I>knew they were desirous to ask him,</I> and designed it. 
 Note, The knots we cannot untie we must bring to him who alone can give 
 an understanding. Christ <I>knew they were desirous to ask him,</I>
 but were bashful and ashamed to ask. Note, Christ takes cognizance of 
 pious desires, though they be not as yet offered up, the <I>groanings 
 that cannot be uttered,</I> and even <I>anticipates them with the 
 blessings of his goodness.</I> Christ instructed those who he <I>knew 
 were desirous to ask him,</I> though they did not ask. <I>Before we 
 call, he answers.</I> Another reason why Christ explained it was 
 because he observed them canvassing this matter among themselves: 
 "<I>Do you enquire this among yourselves?</I> Well, I will make it easy 
 to you." This intimates to us who they are that Christ will teach: 

 (1.) The humble, that confess their ignorance, for so much their 
 enquiry implied. 

 (2.) The diligent, that use the means they have: "<I>Do you 
 enquire?</I> You shall be taught. <I>To him that hath shall be 
 given.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See here <I>how</I> he explained it; not by a nice and critical 
 descant upon the words, but by bringing the thing more closely to them; 
 he had told them of <I>not seeing him, and seeing him,</I> and they did 
 not apprehend the meaning, and therefore he explains it by their 
 sorrowing and rejoicing, because we commonly measure things according 
 as they affect us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>You shall weep and lament,</I> for my departure, <I>but the world 
 shall rejoice</I> in it; <I>and you shall be sorrowful,</I> while I am 
 absent, <I>but,</I> upon my return to you, <I>your sorrow will be 
 turned into joy.</I> But he says nothing of the <I>little while,</I> 
 because he saw that this perplexed them more than any thing; and it is 
 of no consequence to us to know <I>the times and the seasons.</I> Note, 
 Believers have joy or sorrow according as they have or have not a sight 
 of Christ, and the tokens of his presence with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What Christ says here, and in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>,

 of their sorrow and joy, is primarily to be understood of the present
 state and circumstances of the disciples, and so we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Their grief foretold: <I>You shall weep and lament, and you shall 
 be sorrowful.</I> The sufferings of Christ could not but be the sorrow 
 of his disciples. They wept for him because they loved him; the pain of
 our friend is a pain to ourselves; when they slept, it was for sorrow,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:45">Luke xxii. 45</A>.

 They wept for themselves, and their own loss, and the sad apprehensions 
 they had of what would become of them when he was gone. It could not
 but be a grief to lose him for whom they had left their all, and from 
 whom they had expected so much. Christ has given notice to his 
 disciples beforehand to expect sorrow, that they may treasure up 
 comforts accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The world's rejoicing at the same time: <I>But the world shall 
 rejoice.</I> That which is the grief of saints is the joy of sinners. 
 <I>First,</I> Those that are <I>strangers to Christ</I> will continue 
 in their carnal mirth, and not at all interest themselves in their 
 sorrows. <I>It is nothing to them that pass by,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:12">Lam. i. 12</A>.

 Nay, <I>Secondly,</I> Those that are <I>enemies to Christ</I> will
 rejoice because they hope they have conquered him, and ruined his 
 interest. When the chief priests had Christ upon the cross, we may
 suppose they made merry over him, as those that dwell on earth over the 
 slain witnesses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>.

 Let it be no surprise to us if we see others triumphing, when we are
 <I>trembling for the ark.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The return of joy to them in due time: <I>But your sorrow shall be 
 turned into joy.</I> As <I>the joy of the hypocrite,</I> so the sorrow 
 of the true Christian, is <I>but for a moment. The disciples were glad 
 when they saw the Lord.</I> His resurrection was <I>life from the 
 dead</I> to them, and their sorrow for Christ's sufferings was turned 
 into a joy of such a nature as could not be damped and embittered by 
 any sufferings of their own. They were <I>sorrowful, and yet always 
 rejoicing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:10">2 Cor. vi. 10</A>),

 had sorrowful lives and yet joyful hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is applicable to all the faithful followers of the Lamb, and 
 describes the common case of Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Their condition and disposition are both mournful; sorrows are 
 their lot, and seriousness is their temper: those that are acquainted 
 with Christ must, as he was, be <I>acquainted with grief;</I> they 
 <I>weep and lament</I> for that which others make light of, their own 
 sins, and the sins of those about them; they mourn with sufferers that 
 mourn, and mourn for sinners that mourn not for themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The world, at the same time, goes away with all the mirth; they 
 laugh now, and spend their days so jovially that one would think they 
 neither knew sorrow nor feared it. Carnal mirth and pleasures are 
 surely none of the best things, for then the worst men would not have 
 so large a share of them, and the favourites of heaven be such 
 strangers to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Spiritual mourning will shortly be turned into eternal rejoicing. 
 <I>Gladness is sown for the upright in heart, that sow tears,</I> and 
 without doubt <I>they will</I> shortly <I>reap in joy.</I> Their sorrow 
 will not only be followed with joy, but turned into it; for the most 
 precious comforts take rise from pious griefs. Thus he illustrates by a 
 similitude taken from a woman in travail, to whose sorrows he compares 
 those of his disciples, for their encouragement; for it is the will of 
 Christ that his people should be a comforted people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Here is the similitude or parable itself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>A woman,</I> we know, <I>when she is in travail, hath sorrow,</I> 
 she is in exquisite pain, <I>because her hour is come,</I> the hour 
 which nature and providence have fixed, which she has expected, and 
 cannot escape; <I>but as soon as she is delivered of the child,</I> 
 provided she be safely delivered, and the child be, though a 
 <I>Jabez</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:9">1 Chron. iv. 9</A>),
 
 yet not a <I>Benoni</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:18">Gen. xxxv. 18</A>),

 then <I>she remembers no more the anguish,</I> her groans and 
 complaints are over, and the after--pains are more easily borne, <I>for 
 joy that a man is born into the world,</I> <B><I>anthropos</I></B>, one 
 of the human race, a child, be it son or daughter, for the word 
 signifies either. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> The fruit of the curse, in the sorrow and pain of a woman in 
 travail, according to the sentence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:16">Gen. iii. 16</A>),

 <I>In sorrow shalt thou bring forth.</I> These pains are extreme, the 
 greatest griefs and pains are compared to them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:6,Isa+13:3,Jer+4:31,6:24">Ps. xlviii. 6;
 Isa. xiii. 3; Jer. iv. 31; vi. 24</A>),
 
 and they are inevitable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:3">1 Thess. v. 3</A>.

 See what this world is; all its roses are surrounded with thorns, all 
 the children of men are upon this account foolish children, that they 
 are <I>the heaviness of her that bore them</I> from the very first. 
 This comes of sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> The fruit of the blessing, in <I>the joy there is for a child 
 born into the world.</I> If God had not preserved the blessing in force 
 after the fall, <I>Be fruitful and multiply,</I> parents could never 
 have looked upon their children with any comfort; but what is the fruit 
 of a blessing is matter of joy; the birth of a living child is, 
 
 (<I>a.</I>) The parents' joy; it makes them very glad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:15">Jer. xx. 15</A>.
 
 Though children are certain cares, uncertain comforts, and often prove
 the greatest crosses, yet it is natural to us to rejoice at their
 birth. Could we be sure that our children, like John, would <I>be
 filled with the Holy Ghost,</I> we might, indeed, like his parents,
 have <I>joy and gladness</I> in their birth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:14,15">Luke i. 14, 15</A>.

 But when we consider, not only that they are born in sin, but, as it is 
 expressed, that <I>they are born into the world,</I> a world of snares 
 and a vale of tears, we shall see reason to rejoice with trembling, 
 lest it should prove <I>better for them that they had never been 
 born.</I>

 (<I>b.</I>) It is such joy as makes the anguish not to be remembered,
 or <I>remembered as waters that pass away,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:16">Job xi. 16</A>.

 <I>H&aelig;c olim meminisse juvabit.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:51">Gen. xli. 51</A>.

 Now this is very proper to set forth, 

 [<I>a.</I>] The sorrows of Christ's disciples in this world; they are 
 like travailing pains, sure and sharp, but not to last long, and in 
 order to a joyful product; they are in <I>pain to be delivered,</I> as 
 the church is described

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:2">Rev. xii. 2</A>),
 
 and <I>the whole creation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:22">Rom. viii. 22</A>.

 And, 

 [<I>b.</I>] Their joys after these sorrows, which will <I>wipe away all 
 tears,</I> for <I>the former things are passed away,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:4">Rev. xxi. 4</A>.

 When they are born into that blessed world, and reap the fruit of all 
 their services and sorrows, the toil and anguish of this world will be 
 no more remembered, as Christ's were not, when <I>he saw of the travail 
 of his soul</I> abundantly to his satisfaction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:11">Isa. liii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The application of the similitude 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>You now have sorrow,</I> and are likely to have more, <I>but I will 
 see you again,</I> and you me, and then all will be well."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> Here again he tells them of their <I>sorrow: "You now 
 therefore have sorrow; therefore,</I> because I am leaving you," as is 
 intimated in the antithesis, <I>I will see you again.</I> Note, 
 Christ's withdrawings are just cause of grief to his disciples. <I>If 
 he hide his face,</I> they cannot be <I>troubled.</I> When the sun 
 sets, the sun-flower will hang the head. And Christ takes notice of 
 these griefs, has a bottle for the tears, and a book for the sighs, of 
 all gracious mourners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> He, more largely than before, assures them of a return of 
 joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:5,11">Ps. xxx. 5, 11</A>.

 He himself went through his own griefs, and bore ours, <I>for the joy
 that was set before him;</I> and he would have us encourage ourselves 
 with the same prospect. Three things recommend the joy:--

 (<I>a.</I>) The cause of it: "<I>I will see you again.</I> I will make 
 you a kind and friendly visit, to enquire after you, and minister 
 comfort to you." Note, 

 [<I>a.</I>] Christ will graciously return to those that wait for him, 
 though <I>for a small moment</I> he has seemed <I>to forsake them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:7">Isa. liv. 7</A>.

 Men, when they are exalted, will scarcely look upon their inferiors; 
 but the exalted Jesus will visit his disciples. They shall not only see 
 him in his glory, but he will see them in their meanness.

 [<I>b.</I>] Christ's returns are returns of joy to all his disciples.
 When clouded evidences are cleared up and interrupted communion is 
 revived, <I>then is the mouth filled with laughter.</I>

 (<I>b.</I>) The cordiality of it: <I>Your heart shall rejoice.</I> 
 Divine consolation <I>put gladness into the heart.</I> Joy in the heart 
 is solid, and not flashy; it is secret, and that which a <I>stranger 
 does not intermeddle with;</I> it is sweet, and gives a good man 
 satisfaction in himself; it is sure, and not easily broken in upon. 
 Christ's disciples should heartily rejoice in his returns, sincerely 
 and greatly. 

 (<I>c.</I>) The continuance of it: <I>Your joy no man taketh from 
 you.</I> Men will attempt to take their joy from them; they would if 
 they could; but they shall not prevail. Some understand it of the 
 eternal joy of those that are glorified; those that have <I>entered 
 into the joy of the Lord shall go no more out.</I> Our joys on earth we 
 are liable to be robbed of by a thousand accidents, but heavenly joys 
 are everlasting. I rather understand it of the spiritual joys of those 
 that are sanctified, particularly the apostles' joy in their 
 apostleship. <I>Thanks be to God,</I> says Paul, in the name of the 
 rest, <I>who always causes us to triumph,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:14">2 Cor. ii. 14</A>.

 A malicious world would have taken it from them, they would have lost
 it; but, when they took everything else from them, they could not take 
 this; <I>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.</I> They could not rob 
 them of their joy, because they could not <I>separate them from the 
 love of Christ,</I> could not rob them of their God, nor of their 
 <I>treasure in heaven.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I
 say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he
 will give <I>it</I> you.
 &nbsp; 24  Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall
 receive, that your joy may be full.
 &nbsp; 25  These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the
 time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but
 I shall show you plainly of the Father.
 &nbsp; 26  At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you,
 that I will pray the Father for you:

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 An answer to their askings is here promised, for their further comfort. 
 Now there are two ways of asking: asking by way of enquiry, which is 
 the asking of the ignorant; and asking by way of request, which is the 
 asking of the indigent. Christ here speaks of both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By way of enquiry, they should not need to ask 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 "<I>In that day you shall ask me nothing;</I>" <B><I>ouk erotesete 
 ouden</I></B>--<I>you shall ask no questions;</I> "you shall have such 
 a clear knowledge of gospel mysteries, by the opening of your 
 understandings, that you shall not need to enquire" (as
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:11">Heb. viii. 11</A>,

 <I>they shall not teach</I>); "you shall have more knowledge on a 
 sudden than hitherto you have had by diligent attendance." They had 
 asked some ignorant questions (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:2"><I>ch.</I> ix. 2</A>),

 some ambitious questions (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:1">Matt. xviii. 1</A>),

 some distrustful ones (as
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:27">Matt. xix. 27</A>),

 some impertinent ones, (as
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:21"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 21</A>),

 some curious ones (as
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:6">Acts i. 6</A>);

 but after the Spirit was poured out, nothing of all this. In the story
 <I>of the apostles' Acts</I> we seldom find them asking questions, as 
 David, <I>Shall I do this?</I> Or, <I>Shall I go thither?</I> For they 
 were constantly under a divine guidance. In that weighty case of 
 preaching <I>the gospel to the Gentiles,</I> Peter went, <I>nothing 
 doubting,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:20">Acts x. 20</A>.

 Asking questions supposes us at a loss, or at least at a stand, and the 
 best of us have need to ask questions; but we should aim at such a full 
 assurance of understanding that we may not hesitate, but be constantly 
 led in a plain path both of truth and duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now for this he gives a reason

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 which plainly refers to this promise, that they should not need to ask
 questions: "<I>These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs,</I> in 
 such a way as you have thought not so plain and intelligible as you 
 could have wished, <I>but the time cometh when I shall show you 
 plainly,</I> as plainly as you can desire, <I>of the Father,</I> so 
 that you shall not need to ask questions."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great thing Christ would lead them into was the knowledge of 
 God: "<I>I will show you the Father,</I> and bring you acquainted with 
 him." This is that which Christ designs to give and which all true 
 Christians desire to have. When Christ would express the greatest 
 favour intended for his disciples, he tells them that it would, <I>show 
 them plainly of the Father;</I> for what is the happiness of heaven, 
 but immediately and everlastingly to see God? <I>To know God as the 
 Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</I> is the greatest mystery for the 
 understanding to please itself with the contemplation of; and to know 
 him as our Father is the greatest happiness for the will and affections 
 to please themselves with the choice and enjoyment of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Of this he had hitherto spoken to them in proverbs, which are wise 
 and instructive sayings, but figurative, and resting in generals. 
 Christ had spoken many things very plainly to them, and expounded his 
 parables privately to the disciples, but, 

 (1.) Considering their dulness, and unaptness to receive what he said 
 to them, he might be said to speak in proverbs; what he said to them 
 was as a book sealed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:11">Isa. xxix. 11</A>.

 (2.) Comparing the discoveries he had made to them, in what he had 
 spoken to their ears, with what he would make to them when he would 
 <I>put his Spirit into their heart,</I> all hitherto had been proverbs. 
 It would be a pleasing surprise to themselves, and they would think 
 themselves in a new world, when they would reflect upon all their 
 former notions as confused and enigmatical, compared with their present 
 clear and distinct knowledge of divine things. <I>The ministration of 
 the letter</I> was nothing to <I>that of the Spirit,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:8-11">2 Cor. iii. 8-11</A>.
 
 (3.) Confining it to what he had said of <I>the Father,</I> and the
 counsels of <I>the Father.</I> what he had said was very dark, compared
 with what was shortly to be revealed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:2">Col. ii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He would speak to them <I>plainly,</I> 
 <B><I>parresia</I></B>--<I>with freedom,</I> of the Father. When the
 Spirit was poured out, the apostles attained to a much greater 
 knowledge of divine things than they had before, as appears by the 
 utterance the Spirit gave them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:4">Acts ii. 4</A>.

 They were led into the mystery of those things of which they had
 previously a very confused idea; and what the Spirit showed them Christ 
 is here said to show them, for, as the Father speaks by the Son, so the 
 Son by the Spirit. But this promise will have its full accomplishment 
 in heaven, where we shall see the Father as he is, <I>face to face,</I> 
 not as we do now, <I>through a glass darkly</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</A>),

 which is matter of comfort to us under the cloud of present darkness, 
 by reason of which we cannot <I>order our speech,</I> but often 
 disorder it. While we are here, we have many questions to ask 
 concerning the invisible God and the invisible world; but in that day 
 we shall see all things clearly, and <I>ask no more questions.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He promises that by way of request they should ask nothing in vain. 
 it is taken for granted that all Christ's disciples give themselves to 
 prayer. He has taught them by his precept and pattern to be much in 
 prayer; this must be their support and comfort when he had left them; 
 their instruction, direction, strength, and success, must be fetched in 
 by prayer. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is an express promise of a grant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The preface to this promise is such as makes it inviolably sure, and
 leaves no room to question it: "<I>Verily, verily, I say unto you,</I> 
 I pledge my veracity upon it." The promise itself is incomparably rich 
 and sweet; the golden sceptre is here held out to us, with the word, 
 <I>What is thy petition, and it shall be granted?</I> For he says, 
 <I>Whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it to 
 you.</I> We had it before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:13"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 13</A>.

 What would we more? The promise is as express as we can desire. 

 (1.) We are here taught how to seek; we must <I>ask the Father in 
 Christ's name;</I> we must have an eye to God as a Father, and come as 
 children to him; and to Christ as Mediator, and come as clients. Asking 
 of the Father includes a sense of spiritual blessings, with a 
 conviction that they are to be had from God only. It included also 
 humility of address to him, with a believing confidence in him, as a 
 Father able and ready to help us. Asking in Christ's name includes an 
 acknowledgment of our own unworthiness to receive any favour from God, 
 a complacency in the method God has taken of keeping up a 
 correspondence with us by his Son, and an entire dependence upon Christ 
 as <I>the Lord our Righteousness.</I> 

 (2.) We are here told how we shall speed: <I>He will give it to 
 you.</I> What more can we wish for than to have what we want, nay, to 
 have what we will, in conformity to God's will, for the asking? He 
 <I>will give it to you</I> from whom <I>proceedeth every good and 
 perfect gift.</I> What Christ purchased by the merit of his death, he 
 needed not for himself, but intended it for, and consigned it to, his 
 faithful followers; and having given a valuable consideration for it, 
 which was accepted in full, by this promise he draws a bill as it were 
 upon the treasury in heaven, which we are to present by prayer, and 
 <I>in his name</I> to ask for that which is purchased and promised, 
 according to the true intent of the new covenant. Christ had promised 
 them great illumination by the Spirit, but they must pray for it, and 
 did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:14">Acts i. 14</A>.

 God will for this be enquired of. He had promised them perfection
 hereafter, but what shall they do in the mean time? They must continue
 praying. Perfect fruition is reserved for the land of our rest; asking
 and receiving are the comfort of the land of our pilgrimage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is an invitation for them to petition. It is thought sufficient 
 if great men permit addresses, but Christ calls upon us to petition,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He looks back upon their practice hitherto: <I>Hitherto have you 
 asked nothing in my name.</I> This refers either 

 [1.] To the matter of their prayers: "You have asked nothing 
 comparatively, nothing to what you might have asked, and will ask when 
 the Spirit is poured out." See what a generous benefactor our Lord 
 Jesus is, above all benefactors; he gives liberally, and is so far from 
 upbraiding us with the frequency and largeness of his gifts that he 
 rather upbraids us with the seldomness and straitness of our requests: 
 "<I>You have asked nothing</I> in comparison of what you want, and what 
 I have to give, and have promised to give." We are told to <I>open our 
 mouth wide.</I> Or, 

 [2.] To the name in which they prayed. They prayed many a prayer, but 
 never so expressly in the name of Christ as now he was directing them 
 to do; for he had not as yet offered up that great sacrifice in the 
 virtue of which our prayers were to be accepted, nor entered upon his 
 intercession for us, the incense whereof was to perfume all our 
 devotions, and so enable us to pray in his name. Hitherto they had
 cast out devils, and healed diseases, in the name of Christ, as a king 
 and a prophet, but they could not as yet distinctly pray in his name as 
 a priest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He looks forward to their practice for the future: <I>Ask and you 
 shall receive, that your joy may be full.</I> Here, 

 [1.] He directs them to ask for all that they needed and he had 
 promised. 

 [2.] He assures them that they shall <I>receive.</I> What we ask from a 
 principle of grace God will graciously give: <I>You shall receive 
 it.</I> There is something more in this than the promise that he will 
 give it. He will not only give it, but give you to receive it, give you 
 the comfort and benefit of it, <I>a heart to eat of it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+6:2">Eccl. vi. 2</A>.
 
 [3.] That hereby <I>their joy shall be full.</I> This denotes,
 <I>First.</I> The blessed effect of the <I>prayer of faith;</I> it
 helps to fill up the <I>joy of faith.</I> Would we have our joy full,
 as full as it is capable of being in this world, we must be <I>much in
 prayer.</I> When we are told to <I>rejoice evermore,</I> it follows
 immediately, <I>Pray without ceasing.</I> See how high we are to aim in
 prayer--not only at peace, but joy, a <I>fulness of joy.</I> Or,
 <I>Secondly,</I> The blessed effects of the <I>answer of peace:</I>
 "Ask, and you shall receive that which will <I>fill your joy.</I>"
 God's gifts, through Christ, fill the treasures of the soul, they fill
 its joy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:21">Prov. viii. 21</A>.

 "Ask for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and you shall receive it; and
 whereas other knowledge <I>increaseth sorrow</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:18">Eccl. i. 18</A>),

 the knowledge he gives will increase, will fill, <I>your joy.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here are the grounds upon which they might hope to speed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>),
 
 which are summed up in short by the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1">1 John ii. 1</A>):

 "<I>We have an advocate with the Father.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We have an advocate; as to this, Christ saw cause at present not 
 to insist upon it, only to make the following encouragement shine the 
 brighter: "<I>I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for 
 you.</I> Suppose I should not tell you that I will intercede for you, 
 should not undertake to solicit every particular cause you have 
 depending there, yet it may be a general ground of comfort that I have 
 settled a correspondence between you and God, have erected a throne of 
 grace, and consecrated for you a <I>new and living way into the 
 holiest.</I>" He speaks as if they needed not any favours, when he had 
 prevailed for the gift of the Holy Ghost to <I>make intercession within 
 them,</I> as Spirit of adoption, crying <I>Abba, Father;</I> as if they 
 had no further need of him to pray for them now, but we shall find that 
 he does more for us than he says he will. Men's performances often come 
 short of their promises, but Christ's go beyond them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We have to do with a Father, which is so great an encouragement 
 that it does in a manner supersede the other: "<I>For the Father 
 himself loveth you,</I> <B><I>philei hymas</I></B>, he is a friend to 
 you, and you cannot be better befriended." Note, The disciples of 
 Christ are the beloved of God himself. Christ not only turned away 
 God's wrath from us, and brought us into a covenant of peace and 
 reconciliation, but purchased his favour for us, and brought us into a 
 covenant of friendship. Observe what an emphasis is laid upon this 
 "<I>The Father himself loveth you,</I> who is perfectly happy in the 
 enjoyment of himself, whose self-love is both his infinite rectitude 
 and his infinite blessedness; yet he is pleased to love you." The 
 Father himself, whose favour you have forfeited, and whose wrath you 
 have incurred, and with whom you need an advocate, he himself now loves 
 you. Observe, 

 [1.] Why the Father loved the disciples of Christ: <I>Because you have 
 loved me, and have believed that I am come from God,</I> that is, 
 because you are my disciples indeed: not as if the love began on their 
 side, but when by his grace he has wrought in us a love to him he is 
 well pleased with the work of his own hands. See here, <I>First,</I> 
 What is the character of Christ's disciples; they love him, because 
 they <I>believe he came out from God,</I> is the only-begotten of the 
 Father, and his high-commissioner to the world. Note, Faith in Christ
 works by love to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:6">Gal. v. 6</A>.

 If we believe him to be the Son of God, we cannot but love him as
 infinitely lovely in himself; and if we believe him to be our Saviour, 
 we cannot but love him as the most kind to us. Observe with what 
 respect Christ is pleased to speak of his disciples' love to him, and 
 how kindly he took it; he speaks of it as that which recommended them 
 to his Father's favour: "You have loved me and believed in me when the 
 world has hated and rejected me; and you shall be distinguished 
 yourselves." <I>Secondly,</I> See what advantage Christ's faithful 
 disciples have, the Father loves them, and that because they love 
 Christ; so well pleased is he in him that he is well pleased with all 
 his friends.

 [2.] What encouragement this gave them in prayer. They need not fear 
 speeding when they came to one that loved them, and wished them well.
 <I>First,</I> This cautions us against hard thoughts of God. When we 
 are taught in prayer to plead Christ's merit and intercession, it is 
 not as if all the kindness were in Christ only, and in God nothing but 
 wrath and fury; no, the matter is not so, the Father's love and 
 good-will appointed Christ to be the Mediator; so that we owe Christ's 
 merit to God's mercy in giving him for us. <I>Secondly,</I> Let it
 cherish and confirm in us good thoughts of God. Believers, that love
 Christ, ought to know that God loves them, and therefore to come boldly 
 to him as children to a loving Father.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world:
 again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
 &nbsp; 29  His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly,
 and speakest no proverb.
 &nbsp; 30  Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest
 not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou
 camest forth from God.
 &nbsp; 31  Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
 &nbsp; 32  Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be
 scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and
 yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
 &nbsp; 33  These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might
 have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of
 good cheer; I have overcome the world.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things Christ here comforts his disciples with:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. With an assurance that, though he was leaving the world, he was 
 returning to his Father, from whom he came forth 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:28-32"><I>v.</I> 28-32</A>,

 where we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A plain declaration of Christ's mission from the Father, and his 
 return to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>I came forth from the Father, and am come,</I> as you see, <I>into 
 the world. Again, I leave the world,</I> as you will see shortly, 
 <I>and go to the Father.</I> This is the conclusion of the whole 
 matter. There was nothing he had more inculcated upon them than these 
 two things--whence he came, and whither he went, the <I>Alpha</I> and 
 <I>Omega</I> of the <I>mystery of godliness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:16">1 Tim. iii. 16</A>),

 that the Redeemer, in his entrance, was <I>God manifest in the 
 flesh,</I> and in his exit was <I>received up into glory.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) These two great truths are here, 

 [1.] Contracted, and put into a few words. Brief summaries of Christian 
 doctrine are of great use to young beginners. The principles of the 
 oracles of God brought into a little compass in creeds and catechisms 
 have, like the beams of the sun contracted in a burning glass, conveyed 
 divine light and heat with a wonderful power. Such we have,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:28,Ec+12:13,1Ti+1:15,Tit+2:11,12,1Jo+5:11">Job xxviii. 28;
 Eccl. xii. 13; 1 Tim. i. 15; Tit. ii. 11, 12; 1 John v. 11</A>;

 much in a little. 

 [2.] Compared, and set the one over against the other. There is an 
 admirable harmony in divine truths; they both corroborate and 
 illustrate one another; Christ's coming and his going do so. Christ had 
 commended his disciples for believing that he came forth from God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and thence infers the necessity and equity of his returning to God 
 again, which therefore should not seem to them either strange or sad. 
 Note, The due improvement of what we know and own would help us into 
 the understanding of that which seems difficult and doubtful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) If we ask concerning the Redeemer <I>whence he came,</I> and
 <I>whither he went,</I> we are told, 

 [1.] That he <I>came from the Father,</I> who sanctified and sealed 
 him; and he came into this world, this lower world, this world of 
 mankind, among whom by his incarnation he was pleased to incorporate 
 himself. Here his business lay, and hither he came to attend it. He 
 left his home for this strange country; his palace for this cottage; 
 wonderful condescension! 

 [2.] That, when he had done his work on earth, he left the world, and 
 went back to his Father at his ascension. He was not forced away, but 
 made it his own act and deed to leave the world, to return to it no 
 more till he comes to put an end to it; yet still he is spiritually 
 present with his church, and will be to the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The disciples' satisfaction in this declaration 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>):

 <I>Lo, now speakest though plainly.</I> It should seem, this one word 
 of Christ did them more good than all the rest, though he had said many 
 things likely enough to fasten upon them. The Spirit, as the wind, 
 blows when and where, and by what word he pleases; perhaps a word that 
 has been <I>spoken once, yea twice,</I> and not perceived, yet, being 
 often repeated, takes hold at last. Two things they improved in by this 
 saying:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In knowledge: <I>Lo, now speakest thou plainly.</I> When they were 
 in the dark concerning what he said, they did not say, <I>Lo, now 
 speakest thou obscurely,</I> as blaming him; but now that they 
 apprehend his meaning they give him glory for condescending to their 
 capacity: <I>Lo, now speakest thou plainly.</I> Divine truths are most 
 likely to do good when they are spoken plainly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:4">1 Cor. ii. 4</A>.

 Observe how they triumphed, as the mathematician did with his
 <B><I>heureka, heureka</I></B>, when he had hit upon a demonstration he 
 had long been in quest of: <I>I have found it, I have found it.</I> 
 Note, When Christ is pleased to speak plainly to our souls, and to 
 bring us with open face to behold his glory, we have reason to rejoice 
 in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In faith: <I>Now are we sure.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What was the matter of their faith: <I>We believe that thou camest 
 forth from God.</I> He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>)

 that they did believe this; "Lord" (say they) "we do believe it, and we
 have cause to believe it, and we know that we believe it, and have the 
 comfort of it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What was the motive of their faith--his omniscience. This proved
 him a teacher come from God, and more than a prophet, that he knew all 
 things, which they were convinced of by this that he resolved those 
 doubts which were hid in their hearts, and answered the scruples they
 had not confessed. Note, Those know Christ best that know him by
 experience, that can say of his power, It works in me; of his love, He
 loved me. And this proves Christ not only to have a divine mission, but
 to be a divine person, that he is a discerner of the thoughts and
 intents of the heart, therefore the essential, eternal Word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12,13">Heb. iv. 12, 13</A>.

 He has made all the churches to know that he searches the reins and the 
 heart,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:23">Rev. ii. 23</A>.

 This confirmed the faith of the disciples here, as it made the first
 impression upon the woman of Samaria that Christ <I>told her all the 
 things that ever she did</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:29"><I>ch.</I> iv. 29</A>),

 and upon Nathanael that Christ <I>saw him under the fig-tree,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:48,49"><I>ch.</I> i. 48, 49</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These words, <I>and needest not that any man should ask thee,</I> may 
 bespeak either, <I>First,</I> Christ's aptness to teach. He prevents us 
 with his instructions, and is communicative of the <I>treasures of 
 wisdom and knowledge</I> that are hid in him, and needs not to be 
 importuned. Or, <I>Secondly,</I> His ability to teach: "Thou needest 
 not, as other teachers, to have the learners' doubts told thee, for 
 thou knowest, without being told, what they stumble at." The best of 
 teachers can only answer what is spoken, but Christ can answer what is 
 thought, what we are afraid to ask, as the disciples were, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:32">Mark ix. 32</A>.
 
 Thus he <I>can have compassion,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:2">Heb. v. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The gentle rebuke Christ gave the disciples for their confidence 
 that they now understood him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 Observing how they triumphed in their attainments, he said, "<I>Do you
 now believe?</I> Do you now look upon yourselves as advanced and 
 confirmed disciples? Do you now think you shall make no more blunders? 
 Alas! you know not your own weakness; you will very shortly <I>be 
 scattered every man to his own,</I>" &c. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A question, designed to put them upon consideration: <I>Do you now 
 believe?</I> 

 [1.] "If now, why not sooner? Have you not heard the same things many a 
 time before?" Those who after many instructions and invitations are at 
 last persuaded to believe have reason to be ashamed that they stood it 
 out so long. 

 [2.] "If now, why not ever? When an hour of temptation comes, where 
 will your faith be then?" As far as there is inconstancy in our faith 
 there is cause to question the sincerity of it, and to ask, "Do we 
 indeed believe?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) A prediction of their fall, that, how confident soever they were 
 now of their own stability, in a little time they would all desert him, 
 which was fulfilled that very night, when, upon his being seized by a 
 party of the guards, <I>all his disciples forsook him and fled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:56">Matt. xxvi. 56</A>.
 
 They were scattered,

 [1.] From one another; they shifted every one for his own safety,
 without any care or concern for each other. Troublous times are times
 of scattering to Christian societies; in the cloudy and dark day the 
 flock of Christ is dispersed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:12">Ezek. xxxiv. 12</A>.

 So Christ, as a society, is not visible.

 [2.] Scattered for him: <I>You shall leave me alone.</I> They should
 have been witnesses for him upon his trial, should have ministered to 
 him in his sufferings; if they could have given him no comfort they 
 might have done him some credit; but they were ashamed of his chain, 
 and afraid of sharing with him in his sufferings, and left him alone. 
 Note, Many a good cause, when it is distressed by its enemies, is 
 deserted by its friends. The disciples had <I>continued with Christ</I> 
 in his other temptations and yet turned their back upon him now; those 
 that are tried, do not always prove trusty. If we at any time find our 
 friends unkind to us, let us remember that Christ's were so to him. 
 When they left him alone, they were scattered <I>every man to his 
 own;</I> not to their own possessions or habitations, these were in 
 Galilee; but to their own friends and acquaintance in Jerusalem; every 
 one went his own way, where he fancied he should be most safe. Every
 man to secure his own; himself and his own life. Note, Those will not 
 dare to suffer for their religion that <I>seek their own things</I> 
 more than the <I>things of Christ,</I> and that look upon the things of 
 this world as their <B><I>ta idia</I></B>--<I>their own property,</I> 
 and in which their happiness is bound up. Now observe here, 
 <I>First,</I> Christ knew before that his disciples would thus desert 
 him in the critical moment, and yet he was still tender of them, and in 
 nothing unkind. We are ready to say of some, "If we could have foreseen 
 their ingratitude, we would not have been so prodigal of our favours to 
 them;" Christ did foresee theirs, and yet was kind to them.
 <I>Secondly,</I> He told them of it, to be a rebuke to their exultation 
 in their present attainments: "<I>Do you now believe?</I> Be not 
 high-minded, but fear; for you will find your faith so sorely shaken as 
 to make it questionable whether it be sincere or no, in a little time." 
 Note, even when we are taking the comfort of our graces, it is good to 
 be reminded of our dangers from our corruptions. When our faith is 
 strong, our love flaming, and our evidences are clear, yet we cannot 
 infer thence that <I>to-morrow shall be as this day.</I> Even when we 
 have most reason to think we stand, yet we have reason enough to take 
 heed lest we fall. <I>Thirdly,</I> He spoke of it as a thing very
 near. <I>The hour was</I> already <I>come,</I> in a manner, when they 
 would be as shy of him as ever they had been fond of him. Note, A 
 little time may produce great changes, both concerning us and in 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) An assurance of his own comfort notwithstanding: <I>Yet I am not 
 alone.</I> He would not be thought to complain of their deserting him, 
 as if it were any real damage to him; for in their absence he should be 
 sure of his Father's presence, which was <I>instar omnium--every thing:
 The Father is with me.</I> We may consider this, 

 [1.] As a privilege peculiar to the Lord Jesus; the Father was so with 
 him in his sufferings as he never was with any, for still he was <I>in 
 the bosom of the Father.</I> The divine nature did not desert the human 
 nature, but supported it, and put an invincible comfort and an 
 inestimable value into his sufferings. The Father had engaged to be 
 with him in his whole undertaking

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:21">Ps. lxxxix. 21</A>,

 &c.), and to preserve him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:8">Isa. xlix. 8</A>);

 this emboldened him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7">Isa. l. 7</A>.

 Even when he complained of his Father's forsaking him, yet he called
 him <I>My God,</I> and presently after was so well assured of his 
 favourable presence with him as to commit his Spirit into his hand. 
 This he had comforted himself with all along 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:29"><I>ch.</I> viii. 29</A>),

 <I>He that sent me is with me, the Father hath not left me alone,</I>
 and especially now at last. This assists our faith in the 
 acceptableness of Christ's satisfaction; no doubt, the Father was well 
 pleased in him, for he went along with him in his undertaking from 
 first to last. 

 [2.] As a privilege common to all believers, by virtue of their union 
 with Christ; when they are alone, they are <I>not alone,</I> but <I>the 
 Father is with them. First,</I> When solitude is their choice, when 
 they are alone, as Isaac in the field, Nathanael under the fig-tree, 
 Peter upon the house-top, meditating and praying, the Father is with 
 them. Those that converse with God in solitude are never less alone 
 than when alone. A good God and a good heart are good company at any 
 time. <I>Secondly,</I> When solitude is their affliction, their enemies 
 lay them alone, and their friends leave them so, their company, like 
 Job's, is made desolate; yet they are not so much alone as they are 
 thought to be, <I>the Father is with them,</I> as he was with Joseph in 
 his bonds and with John in his banishment. In their greatest troubles 
 they are as one whom his father pities, as one whom his mother 
 comforts. And, while we have God's favourable presence with us, we are 
 happy, and ought to be easy, though all the world forsake us. <I>Non 
 deo tribuimus justum honorem nisi solus ipse nobis sufficiat--We do not 
 render due honour to God, unless we deem him alone 
 all-sufficient.</I>--Calvin.</P>

 II. He comforts them with a promise of peace in him, by virtue of his 
 victory over the world, whatever troubles they might meet with in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 "<I>These things have I spoken, that in me you might have peace;</I> 
 and if you have it not in me you will not have it at all, for <I>in the 
 world you shall have tribulation;</I> you must expect no other, and yet 
 may cheer up yourselves, for <I>I have overcome the world.</I>" 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The end Christ aimed at in preaching this farewell sermon to his 
 disciples: <I>That in him they might have peace.</I> He did not hereby 
 intend to give them a full view of that doctrine which they were 
 shortly to be made masters of by the pouring out of the Spirit, but 
 only to satisfy them for the present that his departure from them was 
 really for the best. Or, we may take it more generally: Christ had said 
 all this to them that by enjoying him they might have the best 
 enjoyment of themselves. Note,

 (1.) It is the will of Christ that his disciples should have peace 
 within, whatever their troubles may be without. 

 (2.) Peace in Christ is the only true peace, and in him alone believers 
 have it, for <I>this man shall be the peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:5">Mic. v. 5</A>.

 Through him we have peace with God, and so in him we have peace in our 
 own minds.

 (3.) The word of Christ aims at this, <I>that in him we may have
 peace.</I> Peace is the <I>fruit of the lips, and of his lips,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:19">Isa. lvii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The entertainment they were likely to meet with in the world: "You 
 shall not have outward peace, never expect it." Though they were sent 
 to proclaim <I>peace on earth,</I> and <I>good-will towards men,</I> 
 they must expect trouble on earth, and ill-will from men. Note, It has 
 been the lot of Christ's disciples to have more or less tribulation in 
 this world. Men persecute them because they are so good, and God 
 corrects them because they are no better. Men design to cut them off 
 from the earth, and God designs by affliction to make them meet for 
 heaven; and so between both <I>they shall have tribulation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The encouragement Christ gives them with reference hereto: <I>But be 
 of good cheer,</I> <B><I>tharseite</I></B>. "Not only be of good 
 comfort, but be of good courage; have a good heart on it, all shall be 
 well." Note, In the midst of the tribulations of this world it is the 
 duty and interest of Christ's disciples to be of good cheer, to keep up
 their delight in God whatever is pressing, and their hope in God
 whatever is threatening; as sorrowful indeed, in compliance with the
 temper of the climate, and yet always rejoicing, always cheerful 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:10">2 Cor. vi. 10</A>),
 
 even <I>in tribulation,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:3">Rom. v. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The ground of that encouragement: <I>I have overcome the world.</I> 
 Christ's victory is a Christian triumph. Christ overcame the prince of 
 this world, disarmed him, and cast him out; and still treads Satan 
 under our feet. He overcame the children of this world, by the 
 conversion of many to the faith and obedience of his gospel, making 
 them the children of his kingdom. When he sends his disciples to preach 
 the gospel to all the world, "<I>Be of good cheer,</I>" says he, "<I>I 
 have overcome the world</I> as far as I have gone, and so shall you; 
 though you have tribulation in the world, yet you shall gain your 
 point, and captivate the world," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2">Rev. vi. 2</A>.

 He overcame the wicked of the world, for many a time he put his enemies
 to silence, to shame; "And be you of good cheer, for the Spirit will 
 enable you to do so too." He overcame the evil things of the world by 
 submitting to them; he endured the cross, despising it and the shame of 
 it; and he overcame the good things of it by being wholly dead to them; 
 its honours had no beauty in his eye, its pleasures no charms. Never 
 was there such a conqueror of the world as Christ was, and we ought to 
 be encouraged by it,

 (1.) Because Christ has overcome the world before us; so that we may 
 look upon it as a conquered enemy, that has many a time been baffled. 
 Nay, 

 (2.) He has conquered it for us, as the captain of our salvation. We
 are interested in his victory; by his cross the world is <I>crucified 
 to us,</I> which bespeaks it completely conquered and put into our 
 possession; all is yours, even <I>the world.</I> Christ having overcome 
 the world, believers have nothing to do but to pursue their victory, 
 and divide the spoil; and this we do by faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:4">1 John v. 4</A>.

 <I>We are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</I></P>
