 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 John Baptist said concerning Christ, He must increase, but I must 
 decrease; and so it proved. For, after John had baptized Christ, and 
 borne his testimony to him, we hear little more of his ministry; he had 
 done what he came to do, and thenceforward there is as much talk of 
 Jesus as ever there had been of John. As the rising Sun advances, the 
 morning star disappears. Concerning Jesus Christ we have in this 
 chapter, 

 I. The temptation he underwent, the triple assault the tempter made
 upon him, and the repulse he gave to each assault, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. The teaching work he undertook, the places he preached in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:12-16">ver. 12-16</A>),

 and the subject he preached on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:17">ver. 17</A>.

 III. His calling of disciples, Peter and Andrew, James and John, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:18-22">ver. 18-22</A>.

 IV. His curing diseases
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:23,24">ver. 23, 24</A>),

 and the great resort of the people to him, both to be taught and to be 
 healed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be
 tempted of the devil.
 &nbsp; 2  And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
 afterward an hungred.
 &nbsp; 3  And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son
 of God, command that these stones be made bread.
 &nbsp; 4  But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live
 by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
 mouth of God.
 &nbsp; 5  Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth
 him on a pinnacle of the temple,
 &nbsp; 6  And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself
 down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
 concerning thee: and in <I>their</I> hands they shall bear thee up,
 lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
 &nbsp; 7  Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not
 tempt the Lord thy God.
 &nbsp; 8  Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high
 mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the
 glory of them;
 &nbsp; 9  And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if
 thou wilt fall down and worship me.
 &nbsp; 10  Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
 written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt
 thou serve.
 &nbsp; 11  Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and
 ministered unto him.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of a famous duel, fought hand to hand, between 
 Michael and the dragon, the Seed of the woman and the seed of the 
 serpent, nay, the serpent himself; in which the seed of the woman 
 suffers, being <I>tempted,</I> and so has his heel bruised; but the 
 serpent is quite baffled in his temptations, and so has his head 
 broken; and our Lord Jesus comes off a Conqueror, and so secures not 
 only comfort, but conquest at last, to all his faithful followers. 
 Concerning Christ's temptation, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when it happened: <I>Then;</I> there is an emphasis laid 
 upon that. Immediately after <I>the heavens were opened</I> to him, and 
 <I>the Spirit descended on him,</I> and he was declared to be the Son 
 of God, and the Saviour of the world, the next news we hear of him is, 
 he is <I>tempted;</I> for <I>then</I> he is best able to grapple with 
 the temptation. Note, 

 1. Great privileges, and special tokens of divine favour, will not
 secure us from being <I>tempted.</I> Nay, 

 2. After great honours put upon us, we must expect something that is 
 humbling; as Paul has a messenger of Satan sent to buffer him, after he 
 had been in the third heavens. 

 3. God usually prepares his people for temptation before he calls them
 to it; he <I>gives strength according to the day,</I> and, before a 
 sharp trial, gives more than ordinary comfort.

 4. The assurance of our sonship is the best preparative for temptation.
 If the good Spirit witness to our adoption, that will furnish us with 
 an answer to all the suggestions of the evil spirit, designed either to 
 debauch or disquiet us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Then,</I> when he was newly come from a solemn ordinance, when he 
 was baptized, <I>then</I> he was <I>tempted.</I> Note, After we have 
 been admitted into the communion of God, we must expect to be set upon 
 by Satan. The enriched soul must double its guard. <I>When thou has 
 eaten and art full, then beware. Then,</I> when he began to show 
 himself publicly to Israel, <I>then</I> he was <I>tempted,</I> so as he 
 never had been while he lived in privacy. Note, The Devil has a 
 particular spite at useful persons, who are not only good, but given to 
 do good, especially at their first setting out. It is the advice of the 
 Son of Sirach 
 
 (<U>Ecclesiasticus ii. 1</U>),

 <I>My son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thyself for
 temptation.</I> Let young ministers know what to expect, and arm 
 accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The place where it was; <I>in the wilderness;</I> probably in the 
 great wilderness of <I>Sinai,</I> where Moses and Elijah <I>fasted 
 forty days,</I> for no part of <I>the wilderness</I> of Judea was so 
 abandoned to wild beasts as this is said to have been, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:13">Mark i. 13</A>.

 When Christ was baptized, he did not go to Jerusalem, there to publish
 the glories that had been put upon him, but retired into a wilderness.
 After communion with God, it is good to be private awhile, lest we lose 
 what we have received, in the crowd and hurry of worldly business.
 Christ withdrew into the wilderness,

 1. To gain advantage to himself. Retirement gives an opportunity for
 meditation and communion with God; even they who are called to the most
 active life must yet have their contemplative hours, and must first 
 find time to be alone with God. Those are not fit to speak of the
 things of God in public to others, who have not first conversed with 
 those things in secret by themselves. When Christ would appear as <I>a
 Teacher come from God,</I> it shall not be said of him, "He is newly 
 come from travelling, he has been abroad, and has seen the world;" but, 
 "He is newly come out of the desert, he has been alone conversing with 
 God and his own heart." 

 2. To give advantage to the tempter, that he might have a readier 
 access to him than he could have had in company. Note, Though solitude
 is a friend to a good heart, yet Satan knows how to improve it against 
 us. <I>Woe to him that is alone.</I> Those who, under pretence of
 sanctity and devotion, retire into dens and deserts, find that they are 
 not out of reach of their spiritual enemies, and that there they want 
 the benefit of the communion with saints. Christ retired,

 (1.) To make his victory the more illustrious, he gave the enemy sun 
 and wind on his side, and yet baffled him. He might give the Devil 
 advantage, for <I>the prince of this world had nothing</I> in him; but 
 he has in us, and therefore we must pray not to be <I>led into 
 temptation,</I> and must keep out of harm's way.

 (2.) That he might have an opportunity to do his best himself, that he 
 might be exalted in his own strength; for so it was written, <I>I have 
 trod the wine-press alone,</I> and of the people there was none with 
 me. Christ entered the lists without a second.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The preparatives for it, which were two.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was directed to the combat; he did not wilfully thrust himself 
 upon it, but he <I>was led up of the Spirit to be tempted of the 
 Devil.</I> The Spirit that <I>descended upon him like a dove</I> made 
 him meek, and yet made him bold. Note, Our care must be, not to enter 
 into temptation; but if God, by his providence, order us into 
 circumstances of temptation for our trial, we must not think it 
 strange, but double our guard. <I>Be strong in the Lord, resist 
 stedfast in the faith,</I> and all shall be well. If we presume upon 
 our own strength, and tempt the devil to tempt us, we provoke God to 
 leave us to ourselves; but, whithersoever God leads us, we may hope he 
 will go along with us, and bring us off <I>more than 
 conquerors.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ was <I>led to be tempted of the Devil,</I> and of him only. 
 Others are tempted, <I>when they are drawn aside of their own lust and 
 enticed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:14">Jam. i. 14</A>);

 the Devil takes hold of that handle, and ploughs with that heifer; but
 our Lord Jesus had no corrupt nature, and therefore he was led 
 securely, without any fear or trembling, as a champion into the field, 
 <I>to be tempted</I> purely by <I>the Devil.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now Christ's temptation is, 

 (1.) An instance of his own condescension and humiliation. Temptations 
 are <I>fiery darts, thorns in the flesh, buffetings, siftings, 
 wrestlings, combats,</I> all which denote hardship and suffering; 
 <I>therefore</I> Christ submitted to them, because he would humble 
 himself, <I>in all things to be made like unto his brethren;</I> thus 
 he <I>gave his back to the smiters.</I>

 (2.) An occasion of Satan's confusion. There is no conquest without a 
 combat. Christ was tempted, that he might overcome the tempter. Satan
 tempted the first Adam, and triumphed over him; but he shall not always 
 triumph, the second Adam shall overcome him and <I>lead captivity 
 captive.</I>

 (3.) Matter of comfort to all the saints. In the temptation of Christ 
 it appears, that our enemy is subtle, spiteful, and very daring in his 
 temptations; but it appears withal, that he is not invincible. Though 
 he is <I>a strong man armed,</I> yet the Captain of our salvation is 
 <I>stronger than he.</I> It is some comfort to us to think that Christ 
 suffered, being <I>tempted;</I> for thus it appears that temptations, 
 if not yielded to, are not sins, they are afflictions only, and such as 
 may be pleased. And we have a High Priest who knows, by experience, 
 what it is to be <I>tempted,</I> and who therefore is the more tenderly 
 touched with <I>the feelings of our infirmities</I> in an hour of
 temptation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:18,4:15">Heb. ii. 18; iv. 15</A>.

 But it is much more a comfort to think that Christ conquered, being
 <I>tempted,</I> and conquered for us; not only that the enemy we 
 grapple with is a conquered, baffled, disarmed enemy, but that we are 
 interested in Christ's victory over him, and through him are <I>more 
 than conquerors.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was dieted for the combat, as wrestlers, who are <I>temperate in 
 all things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:25">1 Cor. ix. 25</A>);

 but Christ beyond any other, for he <I>fasted forty days and forty
 nights,</I> in compliance with the type and example of Moses the great 
 lawgiver, and of Elias, the great reformer, of the Old Testament. John 
 Baptist came as Elias, in those things that were moral, but not in such 
 things as were miraculous

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:41">John x. 41</A>);

 that honour was reserved for Christ. Christ needed not to fast for
 mortification (he had no corrupt desires to be subdued); yet he 
 <I>fasted,</I>

 (1.) That herein he might humble himself, and might seem as one
 abandoned, <I>whom no man seeketh after.</I>

 (2.) That he might give Satan both occasion and advantage against him;
 and so make his victory over him the more illustrious.

 (3.) That he might sanctify and recommend fasting to us, when God in
 his providence calls to it, or when we are reduced to straits, and are 
 destitute of daily food, or when it is requisite for the keeping under 
 of the body, or the quickening of prayer, those excellent preparatives 
 for temptation. If good people are brought low, if they want friends 
 and succours, this may comfort them, that their Master himself was in 
 like manner exercised. A man may want bread, and yet be a favourite of 
 heaven, and under the conduct of the Spirit. The reference which the 
 Papists make of their lent-fast to this fasting of Christ <I>forty 
 days,</I> is a piece of foppery and superstition which the law of our 
 land witnesses against, Stat. 5 Eliz. chap. 5 sect. 39, 40. <I>When he 
 fasted forty days he was</I> never hungry; converse with heaven was 
 instead of meat and drink to him, but <I>he was afterwards an 
 hungred,</I> to show that he was really and truly Man; and he took upon 
 him our natural infirmities, that he might atone for us. Man fell by 
 eating, and that way we often sin, and therefore Christ <I>was an 
 hungred.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The temptations themselves. That which Satan aimed at, in all his 
 temptations, was, to bring him to <I>sin against God,</I> and so to 
 render him for ever incapable of being a Sacrifice for the sins of 
 others. Now, whatever the colours were, that which he aimed at was, to 
 bring him, 

 1. To despair of his Father's goodness. 

 2. To presume upon his Father's power. 

 3. To alienate his Father's honour, by giving it to Satan. In the two
 former, that which he tempted him <I>to,</I> seemed innocent, and there 
 in appeared the subtlety of the tempter; in the last, that which he 
 tempted him <I>with,</I> seemed desirable. The two former are artful 
 temptations, which there was need of great wisdom to discern; the last 
 was a strong temptation, which there was need of great resolution to 
 resist; yet he was baffled in them all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He tempted him to despair of his Father's goodness, and to distrust 
 his Father's care concerning him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) See how the temptation was managed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 <I>The tempter came to him.</I> Note, The Devil is <I>the tempter,</I>
 and therefore he is <I>Satan--an adversary;</I> for those are our worst 
 enemies, that entice us to sin, and are Satan's agents, are doing his 
 work, and carrying on his designs. He is called emphatically <I>the 
 tempter,</I> because he was so to our first parents, and still is so, 
 and all other tempters are set on work by him. <I>The tempter came</I> 
 to Christ in a visible appearance, not terrible and affrighting, as 
 afterward in his agony in the garden; no, if ever the Devil 
 <I>transformed himself into an angel of light,</I> he did so now, and 
 pretended to be a good genius, a guardian angel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe the subtlety of <I>the tempter,</I> in joining this first 
 temptation with what went before to make it the stronger. 

 [1.] Christ began to be hungry, and therefore the motion seemed very 
 proper, to turn <I>stones</I> into <I>bread</I> for his necessary 
 support. Note, It is one of the wiles of Satan to take advantage of our 
 outward condition, in that to plant the battery of his temptations. He 
 is an adversary no less watchful than spiteful; and the more ingenious 
 he is to take advantage against us, the more industrious we must be to 
 give him none. When he began to be hungry, and that in a 
 <I>wilderness,</I> where there was nothing to be had, then the Devil 
 assaulted him. Note, Want and poverty are a great temptation to 
 discontent and unbelief, and the use of unlawful means for our relief, 
 under pretence that necessity has no law; and it is excused with this 
 that hunger will break through stone walls, which yet is no excuse, for 
 the law of God ought to be stronger to us than stone walls. Agur prays 
 against poverty, not because it is an affliction and reproach, but 
 because it is a temptation; <I>lest I be poor, and steal.</I> Those 
 therefore who are reduced to straits, have need to double their guard; 
 it is better to starve to death, than live and thrive by sin. 

 [2.] Christ was lately declared to be <I>the Son of God,</I> and here 
 the Devil tempts him to doubt of that; <I>If thou be the Son of 
 God.</I> Had not the Devil known that the Son of God was to come into 
 the world, he would not have said this; and had he not suspected that 
 this was he, he would not have said it to him, nor durst he have said 
 it if Christ had not now drawn a veil over his glory, and if the Devil 
 had not now put on an impudent face.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> "Thou has now an occasion to question whether <I>thou be 
 the Son of God</I> or no; for can it be, that <I>the Son of God,</I> 
 who is <I>Heir of all things,</I> should be reduced to such straits? If 
 God were thy Father, he would not see thee starve, for <I>all the 
 beasts of the forest are his,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:10,12">Ps. l. 10, 12</A>.

 It is true there <I>was a voice from heaven, This is my beloved 
 Son,</I> but surely it was delusion, and thou was imposed upon by it; 
 for either God is not thy Father, or he is a very unkind one." Note,

 1. The great thing Satan aims at, in tempting good people, is to
 overthrow their relation to God as a Father, and so to cut off their 
 dependence on him, their duty to him, and their communion with him. The 
 good Spirit, as the Comforter of the brethren, witnesses that they are 
 the <I>children of God;</I> the evil spirit, as the accuser of the 
 brethren, does all he can to shake that testimony. 

 2. Outward afflictions, wants and burdens, are the great arguments 
 Satan uses to make the people of God question their sonship; as if 
 afflictions could not consist with, when really they proceed from, 
 God's fatherly love. They know how to answer this temptation, who can
 say with holy Job, <I>Though he slay me, though he</I> starve me, 
 <I>yet I will trust in him,</I> and love him as a Friend, even when he 
 seems to come forth against me as an Enemy. 

 3. The Devil aims to shake our faith in the word of God, and bring us
 to question the truth of that. Thus he began with our first parents; 
 <I>Yea, has God said</I> so and so? Surely he has not. So here, <I>Has 
 God said</I> that thou art his <I>beloved Son?</I> Surely he did not 
 say so; or if he did it is not true. We then <I>give place to the 
 Devil,</I> when we question the truth of any word that God has spoken; 
 for his business, as the father of lies, is to oppose the true sayings 
 of God. 

 4. The Devil carries on his designs very much by possessing people with 
 hard thoughts of God, as if he were unkind, or unfaithful, and had 
 forsaken or forgotten those who had ventured their all with him. He 
 endeavored to beget in our first parents a notion that God forbade them 
 the tree of knowledge, because he grudged them the benefit of it; and 
 so here he insinuates to our Saviour, that his Father had cast him off, 
 and left him to shift for himself. But see how unreasonable this 
 suggestion was, and how easily answered. If Christ seemed to be a mere 
 Man now, because he was hungry, why was he not confessed to be more 
 than a Man, even the <I>Son of God,</I> when for <I>forty days he 
 fasted,</I> and was not hungry?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> "Thou hast now an opportunity to show that thou art 
 <I>the son of God. If thou art the Son of God,</I> prove it by this, 
 <I>command these stones</I>" (a heap of which, probably, lay now before 
 him) "<I>be made bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 John Baptist said but the other day, that God <I>can out of stone raise
 up children to Abraham,</I> a divine power therefore can, no doubt, out 
 of stones, make bread for those children; if there thou has that power, 
 exert it now in a time of need for thyself." He does not say, <I>Pray 
 to thy Father</I> that he would turn them into <I>bread;</I> but 
 <I>command</I> it to be done; thy Father hath forsaken thee, set up for 
 thyself, and be not beholden to him. The Devil is for nothing that is 
 humbling, but every thing that is assuming; and gains his point, if he
 can but bring men off from their dependence upon God, and possess them 
 with an opinion of their self-sufficiency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) See how this temptation was resisted and overcome.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Christ refused to comply with it. He would not <I>command these 
 stones to be made bread;</I> not because he could not; his power, which 
 soon after this turned <I>stones</I> into <I>bread;</I> but he would 
 not. And why would he not? At first view, the thing appears justifiable 
 enough, and the truth is, the more plausible a temptation is, and the 
 greater appearance there is of good in it, the more dangerous it is. 
 This matter would bear a dispute, but Christ was soon aware of the 
 snake in the grass, and would not do any thing, <I>First,</I> That 
 looked like questioning the truth of the voice he heard from heaven, or 
 putting that upon a new trial which was already settled. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> That looked like distrusting his Father's care of him, 
 or limiting him to one particular way of providing for him. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> That looked like setting up for himself, and being his 
 own carver; or, <I>Fourthly,</I> That looked like gratifying Satan, by 
 doing a thing at his motion. Some would have said, To give the Devil 
 his due, this was good counsel; but for those <I>who wait upon God,</I> 
 to consult <I>him,</I> is more than his due; it is like enquiring of 
 the god Ekron, when there is a God in Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He was ready to reply to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 <I>He answered and said, It is written.</I> This is observable, that
 Christ answered and baffled all the temptations of Satan with, <I>It is 
 written.</I> He is himself the eternal Word, and could have produced 
 the mind of God without having recourse to the writings of Moses; but 
 he put honour upon the scripture, and, to set us an example, he 
 appealed to what was written in the law; and he says this to Satan, 
 taking it for granted that he knew well enough what was written. It is 
 possible that those who are the Devil's children may yet know very well 
 what is written in God's book; <I>The devils believe and tremble.</I> 
 This method we must take when at any time we are tempted to sin; resist 
 and repel the temptation with, <I>It is written.</I> The Word of God is 
 <I>the sword of the Spirit,</I> the only offensive weapon in all the 
 Christian armoury

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:17">Eph. vi. 17</A>);

 and we may say of it as David of Goliath's sword, <I>None is like
 that</I> in our spiritual conflicts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This answer, as all the rest, is taken out of the book of 
 <I>Deuteronomy,</I> which signifies <I>the second law,</I> and in which 
 there is very little ceremonial; the Levitical sacrifices and 
 purifications could not drive away Satan, though of divine institution, 
 much less holy water and the sign of the cross, which are of human 
 invention; but moral precepts and evangelical promises, mixed with 
 faith, these are <I>mighty, through God,</I> for the vanquishing of 
 Satan. This is here quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:3">Deut. viii. 3</A>,

 where the reason given why God fed the Israelites with manna is,
 because he would teach them that <I>man shall not live by bread 
 alone.</I> This Christ applies to his own case. Israel was God's son, 
 whom he <I>called out of Egypt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:1">Hos. xi. 1</A>),
 
 so was Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:15"><I>ch.</I> ii. 15</A>);

 Israel was then in a wilderness, Christ was so now, perhaps the same
 wilderness. Now, <I>First,</I> The Devil would have him question his 
 sonship, because he was in straits; no, says he, Israel was God's son, 
 and a son he was very tender of and whose manners he bore 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:18">Acts xiii. 18</A>);
 
 and yet he brought them into straits; and it follows there
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:5">Deut. viii. 5</A>),
 
 <I>As a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth
 thee.</I> Christ, <I>being a Son,</I> thus <I>learns obedience.
 Secondly,</I> The Devil would have him distrust his Father's love and 
 care. "No," says he, "that would be to do as Israel did, who, when they 
 were in want, said, <I>Is the Lord among us?</I> and, <I>Can he furnish 
 a table in the wilderness? Can he give bread?" Thirdly,</I> The Devil 
 would have him, as soon as he began to be hungry, immediately looking 
 out for supply; whereas God, for wise and holy ends, suffered Israel to 
 hunger before he fed them; to humble them, and prove them. God will 
 have his children, when they want, not only to wait on him, but to wait 
 for him. <I>Fourthly,</I> The Devil would have him to supply himself 
 with bread. "No," says Christ, "what need is there of that? It is a 
 point long since settled, and incontestably proved, that man may live 
 without bread, as Israel in the wilderness lived forty years upon 
 manna." It is true, God in his providence ordinarily maintains men by 
 <I>bread out of the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:5">Job xxviii. 5</A>);

 but he can, if he please, make use of other means to keep men alive;
 <I>any word proceeding out of the mouth of God,</I> any thing that God 
 shall order and appoint for that end, will be as good a livelihood for
 man as bread, and will maintain him as well. As we may <I>have 
 bread,</I> and yet not be nourished, if God deny his blessing 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ha+1:6,9,Mic+6:14">Hag. i. 6, 9; Mic. vi. 14</A>;

 for though bread is <I>the staff of life,</I> it is God's blessing that
 is <I>the staff of bread</I>), so we may <I>want bread,</I> and yet be 
 nourished some other way. God sustains Moses and Elias without bread, 
 and Christ himself just now for forty days; he sustained Israel with 
 bread from heaven, angels' food; Elijah with bread sent miraculously by 
 ravens, and another time with the widow's meal miraculously multiplied; 
 therefore Christ need not turn stones into bread, but trust God to keep 
 him alive some other way now that he is hungry, as he had done forty 
 days before he hungred. Note, As in our great abundance we must not 
 think to live <I>without</I> God, so in our greatest straits we must 
 learn to live <I>upon</I> God; and when <I>the fig-tree does not 
 blossom,</I> and <I>the field yields no meat,</I> when all ordinary 
 means of succour and support are cut off, yet then we must <I>rejoice 
 in the Lord;</I> then we must not think to command what we will, though 
 contrary to his command, but must humbly pray for what he thinks fit to 
 give us, and be thankful for the bread of our allowance, though it be a 
 short allowance. Let us learn of Christ here to be at God's finding, 
 rather than at our own; and not to take any irregular courses for our 
 supply, when our wants are ever so pressing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:3">Ps. xxxvii. 3</A>).
 
 <I>Jehovah-jireh;</I> some way or other <I>the Lord will provide.</I>
 It is better to live poorly upon the fruits of God's goodness, than 
 live plentifully upon the products of our own sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He tempted him to presume upon his Father's power and protection. 
 See what a restless unwearied adversary the Devil is! If he fail in one 
 assault, he tries another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now in this second attempt we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What the temptation was, and how it was managed. In general, 
 finding Christ so confident of his Father's care of him, in point of 
 nourishment, he endeavors to draw him to presume upon that care in 
 point of safety. Note, We are in danger of missing our way, both on the 
 right hand and on the left, and therefore must take heed, lest, when we 
 avoid one extreme, we be brought by the artifices of Satan, to run into 
 another; lest, by overcoming our prodigality, we fall into 
 covetousness. Nor are any extremes more dangerous than those of despair 
 and presumption, especially in the affairs of our souls. Some who have 
 obtained a persuasion that Christ is able and willing to save them 
 <I>from</I> their sins, are then tempted to presume that he will save 
 them <I>in</I> their sins. Thus when people begin to be zealous in 
 religion, Satan hurries them into bigotry and intemperate heats.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now in this temptation we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] How he made way for it. He took Christ, not by force against his 
 will, but moved him to go, and went along with him, to Jerusalem. 
 Whether Christ went upon the ground, and so went up the stairs to the 
 top of the temple, or whether he went in the air, is uncertain; but so 
 it was, that he was <I>set upon a pinnacle,</I> or spire; <I>upon the 
 fane</I> (so some), <I>upon the battlements</I> (so others), <I>upon
 the wing</I> (so the word is), <I>of the temple.</I> Now observe, 
 <I>First,</I> How submissive Christ was, in suffering himself to be 
 hurried thus, that he might let Satan do his worst and yet conquer him. 
 The patience of Christ here, as afterward in his sufferings and death, 
 is more wonderful than the power of Satan or his instruments; for 
 neither he nor they could have any power against Christ but <I>what was 
 given them from above.</I> How comfortable is it, that Christ, who let 
 loose this power of Satan against himself, does not in like manner let 
 it loose against us, but restrains it, for he <I>knows our frame! 
 Secondly,</I> How subtle the Devil was, in the choice of the place for 
 his temptations. Intending to solicit Christ to an ostentation of his 
 own power, and a vain-glorious presumption upon God's providence, he 
 fixes him on a public place in Jerusalem, a populous city, and <I>the 
 joy of the whole earth;</I> in the temple, one of the wonders of the 
 world, continually gazed upon with admiration by some one or other. 
 There he might make himself remarkable, and be taken notice of by 
 everybody, and prove himself the Son of God; not, as he was urged in 
 the former temptation, in the obscurities of a wilderness, but before 
 multitudes, upon the most eminent stage of action.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. That Jerusalem is here called the <I>holy city;</I> for so it was in 
 name and profession, and there was in it a <I>holy seed,</I> that was 
 the <I>substance thereof.</I> Note, There is no city on earth so holy 
 as to exempt and secure us from the Devil and his temptations. The 
 first <I>Adam</I> was tempted in the <I>holy garden,</I> the second in 
 the <I>holy city.</I> Let us not, therefore, in any place, be off our 
 watch. Nay, the <I>holy city</I> is the place where he does, with great 
 advantage and success, tempt men to pride and presumption; but, blessed 
 be God, into the Jerusalem above, that holy city, no unclean thing 
 shall enter; there we shall be for ever out of temptation. 

 2. That he <I>set him upon a pinnacle of the temple,</I> which (as 
 Josephus describes it, <I>Antiq.</I> 15. 412) was so very high, that it 
 would make a man's head giddy to look down to the bottom. Note, 
 Pinnacles of the temple are places of temptation; I mean,

 (1.) High places are so; they are slippery places; advancement in the
 world makes a man a fair mark for Satan to shoot his fiery darts at. 
 God casts down, that he may raise up; the Devil raises up, that he may 
 cast down: therefore they who would take heed of <I>falling,</I> must 
 take heed of <I>climbing.</I>

 (2.) High places <I>in the church</I> are, in a special manner,
 dangerous. They who excel in gifts, who are in eminent stations, and 
 have gained great reputation, have need to keep humble; for Satan will 
 be sure to aim at them, to puff them up with pride, that they may 
 <I>fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</I> Those that <I>stand 
 high</I> are concerned to <I>stand fast.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] How he moved it; "<I>If thou be the Son of God,</I> now show 
 thyself to the world, and prove thyself to be so; <I>cast thyself 
 down,</I> and then," <I>First,</I> "Thou wilt be admired, as <I>under 
 the special protection of heaven.</I> When they see thee receive no 
 hurt by a fall from such a precipice, they will say" (as the barbarous 
 people did of Paul) "that thou art a God." Tradition says, that 
 <I>Simon Magnus</I> by this very thing attempted to prove himself a 
 god, but that his pretensions were disproved, for he fell down, and was 
 miserably bruised. "Nay," <I>Secondly,</I> "Thou wilt be received, as 
 coming <I>with a special commission from heaven.</I> All Jerusalem will 
 see and acknowledge, not only that thou art more than a man, but that 
 thou art that <I>Messenger,</I> that <I>Angel of the covenant,</I> that 
 should <I>suddenly come to the temple</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal. iii. 1</A>),

 and from thence descend into the streets of the holy city; and thus the
 work of convincing the Jews will be cut short, and soon done."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, The Devil said, <I>Cast thyself down.</I> The Devil could not 
 cast him down, though a little thing would have done it, from the top 
 of a spire. Note, The power of Satan is a limited power; <I>hitherto he 
 shall come, and no further.</I> Yet, if the Devil <I>had cast him 
 down,</I> he had not gained his point; that had been his suffering 
 only, not his sin. Note, Whatever real mischief is done us, it is of 
 <I>our own doing;</I> the Devil can but persuade, he cannot compel; he 
 can but say, <I>Cast thyself down;</I> he cannot cast us down. Every 
 man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and not forced, 
 but enticed. Therefore let us not <I>hurt ourselves,</I> and then, 
 blessed be God, no one else can hurt us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:12">Prov. ix. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] How he backed this motion with a scripture; <I>For it is written, 
 He shall give his angels charge concerning thee.</I> But <I>is Saul 
 also among the prophets?</I> Is Satan so well versed in scripture, as 
 to be able to quote it so readily? It seems, he is. Note, It is 
 possible for a man to have his head full of scripture-notions, and his 
 mouth full of scripture-expressions, while his heart is full of 
 reigning enmity to God and all goodness. The knowledge which the devils 
 have of the scripture, increases both their mischievousness and their 
 torment. Never did the devil speak with more vexation to himself, than 
 when he said to Christ, <I>I know thee who thou art.</I> The devil 
 would persuade Christ to <I>throw himself down,</I> hoping that he 
 would be his own murderer, and that there would be an end of him and 
 his undertaking, which he looked upon with a jealous eye; to encourage 
 him to do it, he tells him, that there was no danger, that the good
 angels would protect him, for so was the promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:11">Ps. xci. 11</A>),

 <I>He shall give his angels charge over thee.</I> In this
 quotation,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> There was <I>something right.</I> It is true, there is 
 such a promise of the ministration of the angels, for the protection of 
 the saints. The devil knows it by experience; for he finds his attempts 
 against them fruitless, and he frets and rages at it, as he did at the 
 hedge about Job, which he speaks of so sensibly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:10">Job i. 10</A>.

 He was also right in applying it to Christ, for to him all the promises
 of the protection of the saints primarily and eminently belong, and to 
 them, in and through him. That promise, that <I>not a bone of theirs 
 shall be broken</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:20">Ps. xxxiv. 20</A>),

 was fulfilled in Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:36">John xix. 36</A>.

 The angels guard the saints for Christ's sake,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:5,11">Rev. vii. 5, 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> There was a great deal <I>wrong in it;</I> and perhaps 
 the devil had a particular spite against this promise, and perverted 
 it, because it often stood in his way, and baffled his mischievous 
 designs against the saints. See here, 

 1. How he <I>misquoted</I> it; and that was <I>bad.</I> The promise
 is, They shall <I>keep thee;</I> but how? <I>In all thy ways;</I> not 
 otherwise; if we <I>go out of our way,</I> out of the way of our duty, 
 we forfeit the promise, and put ourselves out of God's protection. Now 
 this word made against the tempter, and therefore he industriously left 
 it out. If Christ had <I>cast himself down,</I> he had been <I>out of 
 his way,</I> for he had no call so to expose himself. It is good for us 
 upon all occasions to consult the scriptures themselves, and not to 
 take things upon trust, that we may not be imposed upon by those that 
 maim and mangle the word of God; we must do as the noble 
 <I>Bereans,</I> who searched the scriptures daily. 

 2. How he <I>misapplied</I> it; and that was <I>worse.</I> Scripture is 
 abused when it is pressed to patronize sin; and when men thus wrest it 
 to their own temptation, they do it to <I>their own destruction</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:16">2 Pet. iii. 16</A>.

 This promise is firm, and stands good; but the devil made an ill use of
 it, when he used it as an encouragement to presume upon the divine 
 care. Note, It is no new thing for the <I>grace of God</I> to be 
 <I>turned into wantonness;</I> and for men to take encouragement in sin 
 from the discoveries of God's good will to sinners. But <I>shall we 
 continue in sin, that grace may abound?</I> throw ourselves down, that 
 the angels may bear us up? God forbid.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How Christ overcame this temptation; he resisted and overcame it, 
 as he did the former, with, <I>It is written.</I> The devil's 
 <I>abusing</I> of scripture did not prevent Christ from using it, but 
 he presently urges, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:16">Deut. vi. 16</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</I> The meaning of this is
 not, Therefore thou must not tempt me; but, Therefore I <I>must not 
 tempt</I> my Father. In the place whence it is quoted, it is in the 
 plural number, <I>You shall not tempt;</I> here it is singular, <I>Thou 
 shalt not.</I> Note, We are <I>then</I> likely to get good by the word 
 of God, when we hear and receive general promises as speaking to us in 
 particular. Satan said, <I>It is written;</I> Christ says, <I>It is 
 written;</I> not that one scripture contradicts another. God is one, 
 and his word one, and he is one mind, but that is a promise, this is a 
 precept, and therefore that is to be explained and applied by this; for 
 scripture is the best interpreter of scripture; and they who prophesy, 
 who expound scripture, must do it according to the proportion of faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:6">Rom. xii. 6</A>),

 consistently with practical godliness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If Christ should <I>cast himself down,</I> it would be the tempting of 
 God, 

 [1.] As it would be <I>requiring a further confirmation</I> of that 
 which was so well confirmed. Christ was abundantly satisfied that God 
 was already his Father, and took care of him, and gave his angels a 
 charge concerning him; and therefore to put it upon a new experiment, 
 would be to tempt him, as the Pharisees tempted Christ; when they had 
 so many signs on earth, they demanded a <I>sign from heaven.</I> This 
 is limiting the <I>Holy One of Israel.</I> 

 [2.] As it would be <I>requiring a special preservation</I> of him, in 
 doing that which he had no call to. If we expect that because God has 
 promised not to forsake us, therefore he should follow us out of the 
 way of our duty; that because he has promised to supply our wants, 
 therefore he should humour us, and please our fancies; that because he 
 has promised to keep us, we may wilfully thrust ourselves into danger, 
 and may expect the desired end, without using the appointed means; this 
 is presumption, this is tempting God. And it is an aggravation of the 
 sin, that he is the Lord our God; it is an abuse of the privilege we 
 enjoy, in having him for our God; he has thereby encouraged us to trust 
 him, but we are very ungrateful, if therefore we tempt him; it is 
 contrary to our duty to him as our God. This is to affront him whom we 
 ought to honour. Note, We must never promise ourselves any more than
 God has promised us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He tempted him to the most <I>black and horrid idolatry,</I> with 
 the proffer of the <I>kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them.</I> 
 And here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How the devil made this push at our Saviour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 The worst temptation was reserved for the last. Note, Sometimes the
 saint's last encounter is with the sons of <I>Anak,</I> and the parting 
 blow is the sorest; therefore, whatever temptation we have been 
 assaulted by, still we must prepare for worse; must be armed for all 
 attacks, with the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the 
 left.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this temptation, we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What he <I>showed him--all the kingdoms of the world.</I> In order
 to do this, he took him to an <I>exceeding high mountain;</I> in hopes 
 of prevailing, as Balak with Balaam, he changed his ground. The 
 pinnacle of the temple is not high enough; the prince of the power of 
 the air must have him further up into his territories. Some think this 
 high mountain was on the other side of Jordan, because there we find 
 Christ next after the temptation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:28,29">John i. 28, 29</A>.

 Perhaps it was <I>mount Pisgah,</I> whence Moses, in communion with
 God, had all the kingdoms of Canaan shown him. Hither the blessed Jesus 
 was carried for the advantage of a prospect; as if the devil could show 
 him more of the world than he knew already, who made and governed it. 
 Thence he might discover some of the kingdoms situate about Judea, 
 though not <I>the glory of them;</I> but there was doubtless a juggle 
 and a delusion of Satan's in it; it is probable that that which he 
 showed him, was but a landscape, an airy representation in a cloud, 
 such as that great deceiver could easily frame and put together; 
 setting forth, in proper and lively colours, the glories and the 
 splendid appearances of princes; their robes and crowns, their retinue, 
 equipage, and lifeguards; the pomp of thrones, and courts, and stately 
 palaces, the sumptuous buildings in cities, the gardens and fields 
 about the country-seats, with the various instances of their wealth, 
 pleasure, and gaiety; so as might be most likely to strike the fancy, 
 and excite the admiration and affection. Such was this show, and his 
 taking him up into a high mountain, was but to <I>humour the thing,</I> 
 and to colour the delusion; in which yet the blessed Jesus did not 
 suffer himself to be imposed upon, but saw through the cheat, only he 
 permitted Satan to take his own way, that his victory over him might be 
 the more illustrious. Hence observe, concerning <I>Satan's 
 temptations,</I> that, <I>First,</I> They often <I>come in at the 
 eye,</I> which is blinded to the things it should see, and dazzled with 
 the vanities it should be turned from. The first sin began in the eye,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:6">Gen. iii. 6</A>.

 We have therefore need to make a covenant with our eyes, and to pray
 that God would <I>turn them away from beholding vanity. Secondly,</I> 
 That temptations commonly take rise from the world, and the things in 
 it. The <I>lust of the flesh,</I> and of <I>the eye,</I> with the
 <I>pride of life,</I> are the topics from which the devil fetches most 
 of his arguments. <I>Thirdly,</I> That it is a <I>great cheat</I> which 
 the devil puts upon poor souls, in his temptations. He deceives, and so 
 destroys; he imposes upon men with shadows and fast colours; shows the 
 world and the glory of it, and hides from men's eyes the sin and sorrow 
 and death which stain the pride of all this glory, the cares and 
 calamities which attend great possessions, and the thorns which crowns 
 themselves are lined with. <I>Fourthly,</I> That the <I>glory of the 
 world</I> is the most <I>charming</I> temptation to the 
 <I>unthinking</I> and <I>unwary,</I> and that by which men are most 
 imposed upon. <I>Laban's</I> sons grudge <I>Jacob all this glory;</I> 
 the <I>pride of life</I> is the most dangerous snare.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What he <I>said to him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 <I>All these things I will give thee, if thou wilt fall down and
 worship me.</I> See,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> How <I>vain the promise</I> was. <I>All these things I 
 will give thee.</I> He seems to take it for granted, that in the former 
 temptations he had in part gained his point, and proved that Christ was 
 not the <I>Son of God,</I> because he had not given him those evidences 
 of it which he demanded; so that here he looks upon him as a mere man. 
 "Come," says he, "it seems that God whose Son thou thinkest thyself to 
 be deserts thee, and starves thee--a sign that he is not thy Father;
 but if thou wilt be ruled by me, I will provide better for thee than 
 so; own me for thy father, and ask my blessing, and <I>all this will I 
 give thee.</I>" Note, Satan makes an easy prey of men, when he can 
 persuade them to think themselves abandoned of God. The fallacy of this 
 promise lies in that, <I>All this will I give thee.</I> And what was 
 <I>all that?</I> It was but a map, a picture, a mere phantasm, that had 
 nothing in it real or solid, and this he would give him; a goodly 
 prize! Yet such are Satan's proffers. Note, Multitudes lose the sight 
 of that which is, by setting their eyes on that which is not. The 
 devil's baits are all a sham; they are shows and shadows with which he 
 deceives them, or rather they deceive themselves. The <I>nations of the 
 earth</I> had been, long before, promised to the Messiah; if he be 
 <I>the Son of God,</I> they belong to him; Satan pretends now to be a 
 good angel, probably one of those that were set over kingdoms, and to 
 have received a commission to deliver possession to him according to 
 promise. Note, We must take heed of receiving even that which God hath 
 promised, out of the devil's hand; we do so when we precipitate the 
 performance, by catching at it in a sinful way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> How <I>vile</I> the <I>condition</I> was; <I>If thou 
 will fall down, and worship me.</I> All the worship which the heathen 
 performed to their gods, was directed to the devil 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:17">Deut. xxxii. 17</A>),

 who is therefore called the <I>god of this world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:4,1Co+10:20">2 Cor. iv. 4; 1 Cor. x. 20</A>.

 And fain would he draw Christ into his interests, and persuade him, now
 that he set up for a Teacher, to preach up the Gentile idolatry, and to 
 introduce it again among the Jews, and then the nations of the earth 
 would soon flock in to him. What temptation could be more hideous, more 
 black? Note, The best of saints may be tempted to the worst of sins, 
 especially when they are under the power of melancholy; as, for 
 instance, to atheism, blasphemy, murder, self-murder, and what not.
 This is their affliction, but while there is no consent to it, nor 
 approbation of it, it is not their sin; Christ was tempted to worship 
 Satan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) See how Christ warded off the thrust, baffled the assault, and 
 came off a conqueror. He rejected the proposal,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] With <I>abhorrence</I> and <I>detestation;</I> <I>Get thee hence, 
 Satan.</I> The two former temptations had something of colour, which 
 would admit a consideration, but this was so gross as not to bear a 
 parley; it appears abominable at the first sight, and therefore is 
 immediately rejected. If the best friend we have in the world suggests 
 such a thing as this to us, <I>Go, serve other gods,</I> he must not be 
 heard with patience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:6,8">Deut. xiii. 6, 8</A>.

 Some temptations have their wickedness written in their forehead, they
 are open before-hand; they are not to be disputed with, but rejected; 
 "<I>Get thee hence, Satan.</I> Away with it, I cannot bear the thought 
 of it!" While Satan tempted Christ to do himself a mischief, by casting 
 himself down, though he yielded not, yet he heard it; but now that the 
 temptation flies in the face of God, he cannot bear it; <I>Get thee 
 hence, Satan.</I> Note, It is a just indignation, which rises at the 
 proposal of any thing that reflects on the honour of God, and strikes 
 at his crown. Nay, whatever is an abominable thing, which we are sure 
 the Lord hates, we must thus abominate it; far be it from us that we 
 should have any thing to do with it. Note, It is good to be 
 <I>peremptory</I> in resisting temptation, and to <I>stop our ears</I> 
 to Satan's charms.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] With an argument fetched from scripture. Note, In order to the 
 strengthening of our resolutions against sin, it is good to see what a 
 great deal of reason there is for those resolutions. The argument is 
 very suitable, and exactly to the purpose, taken from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:13,10:20">Deut. vi. 13, and x. 20</A>.

 <I>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou 
 serve.</I> Christ does not dispute whether he were an angel of light, 
 as he pretended, or not; but though he were, yet he must not be 
 worshipped, because that is an honour due to God only. Note, It is good 
 to make our answers to temptation as full and as brief as may be, so as 
 not to leave room for objections. Our Saviour has recourse to the 
 fundamental law in this case, which is indispensable, and universally 
 obligatory. Note, Religious worship is due to God only, and must not be 
 given to any creature; it is a flower of the crown which cannot be 
 alienated, a branch of God's glory which he will not give to another, 
 and which he would not give to his own Son, by obliging all men to 
 <I>honour the Son, even as they honour the Father,</I> if he had not 
 been God, <I>equal to him,</I> and <I>one with him.</I> Christ quotes 
 this law concerning religious worship, and quotes it with application 
 to himself; <I>First,</I> To show that in his estate of humiliation he 
 was himself <I>made under this law:</I> though, as God, he was 
 worshipped, yet, as Man, he did worship God, both publicly and 
 privately. He obliges us to no more than what he was first pleased to 
 oblige himself to. Thus it became him to fulfil all righteousness.
 <I>Secondly,</I> To show that the law of religious worship is of 
 eternal obligation: though he abrogated and altered many institutions 
 of worship, yet this fundamental law of nature--That God only is to be 
 worshipped, he came to ratify, and confirm, and enforce upon us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. We have here the end and issue of this combat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Though the children of God may be exercised with many and great
 temptations, yet God will not suffer them to be tempted above the 
 strength which either they have, or he will put into them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:13">1 Cor. x. 13</A>.

 It is but for a season that they are in heaviness, through manifold
 temptations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the issue was glorious, and much to Christ's honour: for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The devil was baffled, and quitted the field; <I>Then the devil 
 leaveth him,</I> forced to do so by the power that went along with that 
 word of command, <I>Get thee hence, Satan.</I> He made a shameful and 
 inglorious retreat, and came off with disgrace; and the more daring his 
 attempts had been, the more mortifying was the foil that was given him. 
 <I>Magnis tamen excidit ausis--The attempt, however, in which he failed,
 was daring.</I> Then, when he had done his worst, had tempted him with 
 <I>all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,</I> and found 
 that he was not influenced by that bait, that he could not prevail with 
 that temptation with which he had overthrown so many thousands of the 
 children of men, then he leaves him; then he gives him over as more 
 than a man. Since this did not move him, he despairs of moving him, and 
 begins to conclude, that he is the <I>Son of God,</I> and that it is in 
 vain to tempt him any further. Note, If we resist the devil, he will 
 flee from us; he will yield, if we keep our ground; as when 
 <I>Naomi</I> saw that <I>Ruth was steadfastly resolved, she left off 
 speaking to her.</I> When the devil left our Saviour, he owned himself 
 fairly beaten; his head was broken by the attempt he made to <I>bruise 
 Christ's heel.</I> He left him because he had <I>nothing in him,</I> 
 nothing to take hold of; he saw it was to no purpose, and so gave over. 
 Note, The devil, though he is an enemy to all saints, is a conquered 
 enemy. The Captain of our salvation has defeated and disarmed him; we 
 have nothing to do but to <I>pursue the victory.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The holy angels came and attended upon our victorious Redeemer; 
 <I>Behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</I> They came in a 
 visible appearance, as the devil had done in the temptation. While the 
 devil was making his assaults upon our Saviour, the angels stood at a 
 distance, and their immediate attendance and administration were 
 suspended, that it might appear that he vanquished Satan in his own 
 strength, and that his victory might be the more illustrious; and that 
 afterward, when <I>Michael</I> makes use of <I>his angels</I> in 
 fighting with the <I>dragon and his angels,</I> it might appear, that 
 it is not because he <I>needs them,</I> or could not do his work 
 without them, but because he is pleased to honour them so far as to 
 employ them. One angel might have served to bring him food, but here
 are many attending him, to testify their respect to him, and their 
 readiness to receive his commands. Behold this! It is worth taking 
 notice of; 

 (1.) That as there is a world of wicked, malicious spirits that fight
 against Christ and his church, and all particular believers, so there 
 is a world of holy, blessed spirits engaged and employed for them. In 
 reference to our <I>war with devils,</I> we may take abundance of 
 comfort from our <I>communion with angels.</I>

 (2.) That Christ's victories are the angels' triumphs. The angels came
 to congratulate Christ on his success, to rejoice with him, and to give 
 him the glory due to his name; for that was sung with a loud voice in 
 heaven, when the great dragon was cast out

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:9,10">Rev. xii. 9, 10</A>),

 <I>Now is come salvation and strength.</I>

 (3.) That the angels ministered to the Lord Jesus, not only food, but
 whatever else he wanted after this great fatigue. See how the
 instances of Christ's condescension and humiliation were balanced with 
 tokens of his glory. As when he was <I>crucified in weakness,</I> yet 
 he <I>lived by the power of God;</I> so when in weakness he was 
 tempted, was hungry and weary, yet by his divine power he commanded the 
 ministration of angels. Thus the Son of man did eat angels' food, and,
 like Elias, is fed by an angel in the wilderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:4,7">1 Kings xix. 4, 7</A>.

 Note, Though God may suffer his people to be brought into wants and
 straits, yet he will take effectual care for their supply, and will 
 rather send angels to feed them, than see them perish. <I>Trust in the
 Lord, and verily thou shalt be fed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:3">Ps. xxxvii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ was thus succoured after the temptation, 

 [1.] For his encouragement to go on in his undertaking, that he might 
 see the powers of heaven siding with him, when he saw the powers of 
 hell set against him. 

 [2.] For our encouragement to trust in him; for as he knew, by 
 experience, what it was to <I>suffer, being tempted,</I> and how hard 
 that was, so he knew what it was to be succoured, being tempted, and 
 how comfortable that was; and therefore we may expect, not only that he 
 will sympathize with his tempted people, but that he will come in with 
 seasonable relief to them; as our great Melchizedec, who met Abraham 
 when he returned from the battle, and as the angels here ministered to 
 him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he
 departed into Galilee;
 &nbsp; 13  And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which
 is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
 &nbsp; 14  That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
 prophet, saying,
 &nbsp; 15  The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, <I>by</I> the
 way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
 &nbsp; 16  The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to
 them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung
 up.
 &nbsp; 17  From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent:
 for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of Christ's preaching in the synagogues of 
 Galilee, for he came into the world to be a Preacher; the great 
 salvation which he wrought out, he himself began to publish 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:3">Heb. ii. 3</A>)
 
 to show how much his heart <I>was</I> upon it, and ours <I>should</I>
 be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Several passages in the other gospels, especially in that of St. John, 
 are supposed, in the order of the story of Christ's life, to intervene 
 between his temptation and his preaching in Galilee. His first 
 appearance after his temptation, was when John Baptist pointed to him, 
 saying, <I>Behold the Lamb of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:29">John i. 29</A>.

 After that, he went up to Jerusalem, to the passover

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:12-25">John ii.</A>),

 discoursed with Nicodemus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:1-21">John iii.</A>),

 with the woman of Samaria

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:1-42 ">John iv.</A>),

 and then returned into Galilee, and preached there. But Matthew, having
 had his residence in Galilee, begins his story of Christ's public 
 ministry with his preaching there, which here we have an account of.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time; <I>When Jesus had heard that John was cast into 
 prison,</I> then he <I>went into Galilee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, The cry of the saints' sufferings comes up into the ears of the 
 Lord Jesus. If John be cast into prison, Jesus hears it, takes 
 cognizance of it, and steers his course accordingly: <I>he remembers 
 the bonds</I> and afflictions that abide his people. Observe,

 1. Christ did <I>not</I> go into the country, <I>till he heard of</I>
 John's imprisonment; for he must have time given him to <I>prepare the 
 way of the Lord,</I> before the Lord himself appear. Providence wisely 
 ordered it, that John should be <I>eclipsed</I> before Christ <I>shone 
 forth;</I> otherwise the minds of people would have been distracted 
 between the two; one would have said, <I>I am of John,</I> and another, 
 <I>I am of Jesus.</I> John must be Christ's harbinger, but not his 
 rival. The moon and stars are lost when the sun rises. John had done 
 his work by the baptism of repentance, and then he was laid aside. The 
 witnesses were slain when they had finished their testimony, and not 
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:7">Rev. xi. 7</A>.

 2. He <I>did</I> go into the country as soon as he heard of John's 
 imprisonment; not only to provide for his own safety, knowing that the 
 Pharisees in Judea were as much enemies to him as Herod was to John, 
 but to supply the want of John Baptist, and to build upon the good 
 foundation he had laid. Note, God will not leave himself without 
 witness, nor his church without guides; when he removes one useful 
 instrument, he can raise up another, for he has the residue of the 
 Spirit, and he will do it, if he has work to do. <I>Moses my servant is 
 dead,</I> John is cast into prison; now, therefore, Joshua, arise; 
 Jesus, arise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The place where he preached; in Galilee, a remote part of the 
 country, that lay furthest from Jerusalem, as was there looked upon 
 with contempt, as rude and boorish. The inhabitants of that country 
 were reckoned stout men, fit for soldiers, but not polite men, or fit 
 for scholars. Thither Christ went, there he set up the standard of his 
 gospel; and in this, as in other things, he humbled himself.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The particular city he chose for his residence; not Nazareth, where 
 he had been bred up; no, he left Nazareth; particular notice is taken 
 of that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 And with good reason did he leave Nazareth; for the men of that city
 <I>thrust him out</I> from among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:29">Luke iv. 29</A>.

 He made them his first, and a very fair, offer of his service, but they
 rejected him and his doctrine, and were filled with indignation at him 
 and it; and therefore he left Nazareth, and shook off the dust of his 
 feet for a testimony against those there, who would not have him to 
 teach them. Nazareth was the first place that refused Christ, and was
 therefore refused by him. Note, It is just with God, to take the gospel 
 and the means of grace from those that slight them, and thrust them 
 away. Christ will not stay long where he is not welcome. Unhappy
 Nazareth! <I>If thou hadst known</I> in this thy day the things that
 belong to thy peace, how well had it been for thee! <I>But now they are 
 hid from thine eyes.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But he <I>came and dwelt in Capernaum,</I> which was a city of Galilee, 
 but many miles distant from Nazareth, a great city and of much resort. 
 It is said here to be <I>on the sea coast,</I> not the <I>great 
 sea,</I> but the sea of Tiberias, an inland water, called also <I>the 
 lake of Gennesaret.</I> Close by the falling of Jordan into the sea 
 stood Capernaum, in the tribe of Naphtali, but bordering upon Zebulun; 
 hither Christ came, and here he dwelt. Some think that his father 
 Joseph had a habitation here, others that he took a house or lodgings 
 at least; and some think it more than probable, that he dwelt in the 
 house of Simon Peter; however, here he fixed not constantly, for he 
 went about doing good; but this was for some time his head quarters: 
 what little rest he had, was here; here he had a place, though not a 
 place of his own, to lay his head on. And at Capernaum, it should seem, 
 he was welcome, and met with better entertainment than he had at 
 Nazareth. Note, If some reject Christ, yet others will receive him, and 
 bid him welcome. Capernaum is glad of Nazareth's leavings. If Christ's 
 own countrymen be not gathered, yet he will be glorious. "And thou, 
 Capernaum, has now a day of it; thou art now lifted up to heaven; be 
 wise for thyself, and know the time of thy visitation."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The prophecy that was fulfilled is this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:14-16"><I>v.</I> 14-16</A>.
 
 It is quoted from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:1,2">Isa. ix. 1, 2</A>,

 but with some variation. The prophet in that place is foretelling a
 greater darkness of affliction to befal the contemners of Immanuel, 
 than befel the countries there mentioned, either in their first 
 captivity under Benhadad, which was but light

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:20">1 Kings xv. 20</A>),

 or in their second captivity under the Assyrian, which was much
 heavier, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:29">2 Kings xv. 29</A>.

 The punishment of the Jewish nation for rejecting the gospel should be
 sorer than either (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:21,22">Isa. viii. 21, 22</A>);

 for those captivated places had some reviving in their bondage, and saw
 a great light again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:2"><I>ch.</I> ix. 2</A>.

 This is Isaiah's sense; but the Scripture has many fulfillings; and the
 evangelist here takes only the latter clause, which speaks of the 
 return of the light of liberty and prosperity to those countries that 
 had been in the darkness of captivity, and applies it to the appearing 
 of the gospel among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The places are spoken of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>The land of Zebulun is</I> rightly said to be <I>by the sea
 coast,</I> for <I>Zebulun</I> was a <I>haven of ships,</I> and 
 <I>rejoiced</I> in her <I>going out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:13,De+33:18">Gen. xlix. 13; Deut. xxxiii. 18</A>.

 Of Naphtali, it had been said, that he should <I>give goodly words</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:21">Gen. xlix. 21</A>),

 and should be <I>satisfied with favour</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:23">Deut. xxxiii. 23</A>),

 for from him began the gospel; goodly words indeed, and such as bring
 to a soul God's satisfying favour. The country beyond Jordan is 
 mentioned likewise, for there we sometimes find Christ preaching, and 
 Galilee of the Gentiles, the upper Galilee to which the Gentiles 
 resorted for traffic, and where they were mingled with the Jews; which 
 intimates a kindness in reserve for the poor Gentiles. When Christ
 came to Capernaum, the gospel came to all those places round about; 
 such diffusive influences did the Sun of righteousness cast.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, concerning the inhabitants of these places, observe, 

 (1.) The posture they were in before the gospel came among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 they were <I>in darkness.</I> Note, Those that are without Christ, are
 in the dark, nay, they are darkness itself; as the darkness that was 
 upon the <I>face of the deep.</I> Nay, they were <I>in the region and 
 shadow of death;</I> which denotes not only <I>great darkness,</I> as 
 the grave is a <I>land of darkness,</I> but <I>great danger.</I> A man 
 that is desperately sick, and not likely to recover, is in the 
 <I>valley of the shadow of death,</I> though not quite dead; so the 
 poor people were on the borders of damnation, though not yet 
 damned-dead in law. And, which is worst of all, they were 
 <I>sitting</I> in this condition. Sitting in a continuing posture;
 where we sit, we mean to stay; they were in the dark, and likely to be 
 so, despairing to find the way out. And it is a contented posture;
 they were in the dark, and they loved darkness, they chose it rather 
 than light; they were willingly ignorant. Their condition was sad; it 
 is still the condition of many great and mighty nations, which are to 
 be thought of, and prayed for, with pity. But <I>their</I> condition is 
 more sad, who sit in darkness in the midst of gospel-light. He that is 
 in the dark because it is night, may be sure that the sun will shortly 
 arise; but he that is in the dark because he is blind, will not so soon 
 have his eyes opened. We have the light, but what will that avail us, 
 if we be not the light in the Lord?

 (2.) The privilege they enjoyed, when Christ and his gospel came among
 them; it was as great a reviving as ever light was to a benighted 
 traveller. Note, When the gospel comes, light comes; when it comes to 
 any place, when it comes to any soul, it makes day there, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:19,Lu+1:78,79">John iii. 19; Luke i. 78, 79</A>.

 Light is discovering, it is directing; so is the gospel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is a <I>great</I> light; denoting the clearness and evidence of 
 gospel-revelations; not like the light of a candle, but the light of 
 the sun when he goes forth in his strength. <I>Great</I> in comparison 
 with the light of the law, the shadows of which were now done away. It 
 is a <I>great light,</I> for it discovers great things and of vast 
 consequence; it will last long, and spread far. And it is a <I>growing 
 light,</I> intimated in that word, It is <I>sprung up.</I> It was but 
 <I>spring of day</I> with them; now the day dawned, which afterward 
 <I>shone more and more.</I> The gospel-kingdom, like a grain of 
 mustard-seed or the morning light, was small in its beginnings, gradual 
 in its growth, but great in its perfection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, the light <I>sprang up to them;</I> they did not go to seek 
 it, but were prevented with the blessings of this goodness. It came 
 upon them ere they were aware, at the time appointed, by the disposal 
 of him who <I>commandeth the morning,</I> and <I>causes the day-spring 
 to know its place, that it may take hold of the ends of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:12,13">Job xxxviii. 12, 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The text he preached upon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>From that time,</I> that is, from the time of his coming into
 Galilee, into the land of Zebulun and Naphtali, from that time, he 
 began to preach. He had been preaching, before this, in Judea, and had 
 made and baptized many disciples

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:1">John iv. 1</A>);

 but his preaching was not so public and constant as now it began to be.
 The work of the ministry is so great and awful, that it is fit to be 
 entered upon by steps and gradual advances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The subject which Christ dwelt upon now in his preaching (and it was 
 indeed the sum and substance of all his preaching), was the very same 
 John has preached upon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:2"><I>ch.</I> iii. 2</A>);

 <I>Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand;</I> for the gospel is
 the same for substance under various dispensations; the commands the 
 same, and the reasons to enforce them the same; an <I>angel from 
 heaven</I> dares not preach any other gospel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:8">Gal. i. 8</A>),

 and will preach this, for it is the <I>everlasting gospel. Fear God,
 and,</I> by repentance, <I>give honour to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:6,7">Rev. xiv. 6, 7</A>.

 Christ put a great respect upon John's ministry, when he preached to
 the same purport that John had preached before him. By this he showed 
 that John was his messenger and ambassador; for when he brought the 
 errand himself, it was the same that he had sent by him. Thus did God 
 confirm the word of his messenger,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xliv. 26</A>.

 The Son came on the same errand that the servants came on

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:37"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 37</A>),

 to <I>seek fruit,</I> fruits meet for repentance. Christ had lain in
 the bosom of the Father, and could have preached sublime notions of 
 divine and heavenly things, that should have alarmed and amused the 
 learned world, but he pitches upon this old, plain text, <I>Repent, for 
 the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</I> 

 [1.] This he preached <I>first</I> upon; he began with this. Ministers 
 must not be ambitious of broaching new opinions, framing new schemes, 
 or coining new expressions, but must content themselves with plain, 
 practical things, with the word that is <I>nigh us,</I> even <I>in our 
 mouth,</I> and <I>in our heart.</I> We need not go up to heaven, nor 
 down to the deep, for matter or language in our preaching. As John 
 prepared Christ's way, so Christ prepared his own, and made way for the 
 further discoveries he designed, with the doctrine of repentance. <I>If 
 any man</I> will do this part of <I>his will, he shall know</I> more of 
 <I>his doctrine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.

 [2.] This is preached <I>often</I> upon; wherever he went, this was his 
 subject, and neither he nor his followers ever reckoned it worn 
 threadbare, as those would have done, that have <I>itching ears,</I> 
 and are fond of novelty and variety more than that which is truly 
 edifying. Note, That which has been preached and heard before, may yet 
 very profitably be preached and heard again; but then it should be 
 preached and heard better, and with new affections; what Paul had said 
 before, he said again, <I>weeping,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1,18">Phil. iii. 1, 18</A>.

 [3.] This he preached as gospel; "Repent, review your ways, and return 
 to yourselves." Note, The doctrine of repentance is right 
 gospel-doctrine. Not only the austere Baptist, who was looked upon as
 a melancholy, morose man, but the sweet and gracious Jesus, whose lips 
 dropped as a honey-comb, preached repentance; for it is an unspeakable 
 privilege that room is left for repentance. 

 [4.] The reason is still the same; The <I>kingdom of heaven is at 
 hand;</I> for it was not reckoned to be fully come, till that pouring 
 out of the Spirit after Christ's ascension. John had preached the 
 kingdom of heaven at hand above a year before this; but now it was so 
 much the stronger; now is the <I>salvation nearer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:11">Rom. xiii. 11</A>.

 We should be so much the more quickened to our duty, <I>as we see the
 day approaching,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren,
 Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into
 the sea: for they were fishers.
 &nbsp; 19  And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you
 fishers of men.
 &nbsp; 20  And they straightway left <I>their</I> nets, and followed him.
 &nbsp; 21  And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James
 <I>the son</I> of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with
 Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
 &nbsp; 22  And they immediately left the ship and their father, and
 followed him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When Christ began to preach, he began to <I>gather disciples,</I> who 
 should now be the <I>hearers,</I> and hereafter the <I>preachers,</I> 
 of his doctrine, who should now be witnesses <I>of</I> his miracles, 
 and hereafter <I>concerning</I> them. Now, in these verses, we have an 
 account of the first disciples that he called into fellowship with 
 himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And this was an instance, 

 1. Of <I>effectual calling</I> to Christ. In all his preaching he gave
 a common call to all the country, but in this he gave a special and 
 particular call to those that were given him by the Father. Let us see 
 and admire the power of Christ's grace, own his word to be the rod of 
 his strength, and wait upon him for those powerful influences which are 
 necessary to the efficacy of the gospel call--those distinguishing 
 influences. All the country was <I>called,</I> but these were <I>called 
 out,</I> were <I>redeemed from among them.</I> Christ was so manifested 
 to them, as he was not manifested unto the world. 

 2. It was an instance of <I>ordination,</I> and appointment to the work 
 of the ministry. When Christ, as a Teacher, set up his great school, 
 one of his first works was to appoint ushers, or under masters, to be 
 employed in the work of instruction. Now he began to give gifts unto 
 men, to put the treasure into earthen vessels. It was an early
 instance of his care for the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now we may observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>Where</I> they were called--by the <I>sea of Galilee,</I> where
 Jesus was walking, Capernaum being situated near that sea. Concerning 
 this sea of Tiberias, the Jews have a saying, That of all the seven 
 seas that God made, he made choice of none but the sea of Gennesaret; 
 which is very applicable to Christ's choice of it, to honour it, as he 
 often did, with his presence and his miracles. Here, on the banks of 
 the sea, Christ was walking for contemplation, as Isaac in the field; 
 hither he went to call his disciples; not to Herod's court (for few 
 mighty or noble are called), not to Jerusalem, among the chief priests 
 and the elders, but to the sea of Galilee; surely Christ sees not as 
 man sees. Not but that the same power which effectually called Peter 
 and Andrew would have wrought upon Annas and Caiaphas, for with God 
 nothing is impossible; but, as in other things, so in his converse and 
 attendance, he would humble himself, and show that God has <I>chosen the
 poor of this world.</I> Galilee was a remote part of the nation, the 
 inhabitants were less cultivated and refined, their very language was 
 broad and uncouth to the curious, their <I>speech betrayed them.</I> 
 They who were picked up at the sea of Galilee, had not the advantages 
 and improvements, no, not of the more polished Galileans; yet thither 
 Christ went, to call his apostles that were to be the prime ministers 
 of state in his kingdom, for he <I>chooses the foolish things of this 
 world, to confound the wise.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>Who</I> they were. We have an account of the call of two pair of 
 brothers in these verses--Peter and Andrew, James and John; the two
 former, and, probably, the two latter also, had had acquaintance with 
 Christ before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:40,41">John i. 40, 41</A>),

 but were not till now called into a close and constant attendance upon
 him. Note, Christ brings poor souls by degrees into fellowship with 
 himself. They had been disciples of John, and so were the better 
 disposed to follow Christ. Note, Those who have submitted to the 
 discipline of repentance, shall be welcome to the joys of faith. We may 
 observe concerning them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they were <I>brothers.</I> Note, It is a blessed thing, when 
 they who are <I>kinsmen according to the flesh</I> (as the apostle 
 speaks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:3">Rom. ix. 3</A>),

 are brought together into a spiritual alliance to Jesus Christ. It is
 the honour and comfort of a house, when those that are of the 
 <I>same</I> family, are of <I>God's</I> family.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they were <I>fishers.</I> Being fishers, 

 (1.) They were <I>poor men:</I> if they had had estates, or any
 considerable stock in trade, they would not have made fishing their 
 trade, however, they might have made it their recreation. Note, Christ 
 does not despise the poor, and therefore we must not; the poor are 
 evangelized, and the Fountain of honour sometimes gives more abundant 
 honour to that part which most lacked.

 (2.) They were <I>unlearned men,</I> not bred up to books or literature
 as Moses was, who was conversant with all the learning of the 
 Egyptians. Note, Christ sometimes chooses to endow those with the gifts 
 of grace who have least to show of the gifts of nature. Yet this will 
 not justify the bold intrusion of ignorant and unqualified men into the 
 work of the ministry: extraordinary gifts of knowledge and utterance 
 are not now to be expected, but requisite abilities must be obtained in 
 an ordinary way, and without a competent measure of these, none are to 
 be admitted to that service.

 (3.) They were <I>men of business,</I> who had been bred up to labour.
 Note, Diligence in an honest calling is pleasing to Christ, and no 
 hindrance to a holy life. Moses was called from keeping sheep, and
 David from following the ewes, to eminent employments. Idle people lie 
 more open to the temptations of Satan than to the calls of God.

 (4.) They were men that were accustomed to <I>hardships</I> and
 hazards; the fisher's trade, more than any other, is laborious and 
 perilous; fishermen must be often wet and cold; they must watch, and 
 wait, and toil, and be often in <I>perils by waters.</I> Note, Those 
 who have learned to bear hardships, and run hazards, are best prepared 
 for the fellowship and discipleship of Jesus Christ. Good soldiers of 
 Christ must endure hardness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. <I>What they were doing.</I> Peter and Andrew were then using 
 their nets, they were fishing; and James and John were <I>mending their 
 nets,</I> which was an instance of their industry and good husbandry. 
 They did not go to their father for money to buy new nets, but took 
 pains to mend their old ones. It is commendable to make what we have go 
 as far, and last as long, as may be. James and John were <I>with their 
 father Zebedee,</I> ready to assist him, and make his business easy to 
 him. Note, It is a happy and hopeful presage, to see children careful 
 of their parents, and dutiful to them. Observe, 

 1. They were <I>all</I> employed, all very busy, and none idle. Note,
 When Christ comes, it is good to be found doing. "Am I in Christ?" is a 
 very needful question for us to ask ourselves; and, next to that, "Am I 
 in my calling?" 

 2. They were <I>differently</I> employed; two of them were fishing,
 and two of them <I>mending their nets.</I> Note, Ministers should be 
 always employed, either in teaching or studying; they may always find 
 themselves something to do, if it be not their own fault; and 
 <I>mending their nets,</I> is, in its season, as necessary work as 
 fishing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. <I>What the call was</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 <I>Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</I> They had followed
 Christ before, as ordinary disciples

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:37">John i. 37</A>),

 but so they might follow Christ, and follow their calling too;
 therefore they were called to a more close and constant attendance, and 
 must leave their calling. Note, Even they who had been called to follow 
 Christ, have need to be called to follow on, and to follow nearer, 
 especially when they are designed for the work of the ministry.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What Christ intended them for; <I>I will make you fishers of 
 men;</I> this alludes to their former calling. Let them be not proud of 
 the new honour designed them, they are still but fishers; let them not 
 be afraid of the new work cut out for them, for they have been used to 
 fishing, and fishers they are still. It was usual with Christ to speak 
 of spiritual and heavenly things under such allusions, and in such 
 expressions, as took rise from common things that offered themselves to 
 his view. David was called from feeding sheep to feed God's Israel; and 
 when he is a king, is a shepherd. Note, 

 (1.) Ministers are <I>fishers of men,</I> not to destroy them, but to
 save them, by bringing them into another element. They must fish, not 
 for wrath, wealth, honour, and preferment, to gain them to themselves, 
 but for souls, to gain them to Christ. <I>They watch for your souls</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:17">Heb. xiii. 17</A>),

 <I>and seek not yours, but you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:14,16">2 Cor. xii. 14, 16</A>.

 (2.) It is Jesus Christ that makes them so; <I>I will make you fishers
 of men.</I> It is he that qualifies men for this work, calls them to 
 it, authorizes them in it, gives them commission to fish for souls, and 
 wisdom to win them. Those ministers are likely to have comfort in their 
 work, who are thus made by Jesus Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What they must do in order to this; <I>Follow me.</I> They must 
 separate themselves to a diligent attendance on him, and set themselves 
 to a humble imitation of him; must follow him as their Leader. Note, 
 
 (1.) Those whom Christ employs in any service for him, must first be
 fitted and qualified for it. 

 (2.) Those who would <I>preach Christ,</I> must first <I>learn</I>
 Christ, and learn of him. How can we expect to bring others to the 
 knowledge of Christ, if we do not know him well ourselves?

 (3.) Those who would get an acquaintance with Christ, must be diligent
 and constant in their attendance on him. The apostles were prepared for 
 their work, by <I>accompanying Christ all the time that he went in and 
 out among them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:21">Acts i. 21</A>.

 There is no learning comparable to that which is got by following
 Christ. Joshua, by ministering to Moses, is fitted to be his successor.

 (4.) Those who are to fish for men, must therein follow Christ, and do
 it as he did, with diligence, faithfulness, and tenderness. Christ is
 the great pattern for preachers, and they ought to be <I>workers 
 together with him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. What was the <I>success</I> of this call. Peter and Andrew
 <I>straightway left their nets</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 and James and John <I>immediately left the ship and their father</I>

 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);

 <I>and they</I> all <I>followed him.</I> Note, Those who would follow
 Christ aright, must <I>leave all</I> to follow him. Every Christian 
 must leave all in affection, set loose to all, must <I>hate father and 
 mother</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:26">Luke xiv. 26</A>),

 must love them less than Christ, must be ready to part with his
 interest in them rather than with his interest in Jesus Christ; but 
 those who are devoted to the work of the ministry are, in a special 
 manner, concerned to disentangle themselves from all the affairs of 
 this life, that they may give themselves wholly to that work which 
 requires the whole man. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This instance of the power of the Lord Jesus gives us good 
 encouragement to depend upon the sufficiency of his grace. How strong 
 and effectual is his word! <I>He speaks, and it is done.</I> The same 
 power goes along with this word of Christ, <I>Follow me,</I> that went 
 along with that word, <I>Lazarus, come forth;</I> a power <I>to make 
 willing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This instance of the pliableness of the disciples, gives us a good 
 example of obedience to the command of Christ. Note, It is the good 
 property of all Christ's faithful servants to come when they are 
 called, and to follow their Master wherever he leads them. They 
 objected not their present employments, their engagements to their 
 families, the difficulties of the service they were called to, or their 
 own unfitness for it; but, being called, they obeyed, and, like 
 Abraham, <I>went out not knowing whither they went,</I> but knowing 
 very well whom they followed. James and John <I>left their father:</I> 
 it is not said what became of him; their mother Salome was a constant 
 follower of Christ; no doubt, their father Zebedee was a believer, but 
 the call to follow Christ fastened on the young ones. Youth is the 
 learning age, and the labouring age. The priests ministered in the 
 prime of their life.</P>

 Christ Preaches in Galilee; Miracles of Christ in Galilee.</I></FONT></TD>
 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their
 synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing
 all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the
 people.
 &nbsp; 24  And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought
 unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and
 torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those
 which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed
 them.
 &nbsp; 25  And there followed him great multitudes of people from
 Galilee, and <I>from</I> Decapolis, and <I>from</I> Jerusalem, and <I>from</I>
 Judea, and <I>from</I> beyond Jordan.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 I. What an industrious preacher Christ was; He <I>went about all 
 Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the 
 kingdom.</I> Observe, 

 1. <I>What</I> Christ preached--<I>the gospel of the kingdom. The 
 kingdom of heaven,</I> that is, of grace and glory, is emphatically 
 <I>the kingdom, the kingdom</I> that was now to come; that kingdom 
 which shall survive, as it doth surpass, all the kingdoms of the earth. 
 <I>The gospel</I> is the charter of that kingdom, containing the King's 
 coronation oath, by which he has graciously obliged himself to pardon, 
 protect, and save the subjects of that kingdom; it contains also their 
 oath of allegiance, by which they oblige themselves to observe his 
 statutes and seek his honour; this is <I>the gospel of the kingdom;</I> 
 this Christ was himself the Preacher of, that our faith in it might be 
 confirmed. 

 2. <I>Where</I> he preached--<I>in the synagogues;</I> not there only, 
 but there chiefly, because those were <I>the places of concourse,</I> 
 where <I>wisdom</I> was to <I>lift up her voice</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:21">Prov. i. 21</A>);

 because they were <I>places of concourse</I> for religious worship, and
 there, it was to be hoped, the minds of the people would be prepared to 
 receive <I>the gospel;</I> and there the scriptures of the Old 
 Testament were read, the exposition of which would easily introduce 
 <I>the gospel of the kingdom.</I> 

 3. <I>What pains he took</I> in preaching; He <I>went about all
 Galilee, teaching.</I> He might have issued out a proclamation to 
 summon all to come to him; but, to show his humility, and the 
 condescensions of his grace, he goes to them; for he <I>waits to be 
 gracious,</I> and comes <I>to seek and save.</I> Josephus says, There 
 were above two hundred cities and towns in Galilee, and all, or most of 
 them, Christ visited. He <I>went about doing good.</I> Never was there
 such an itinerant preacher, such an indefatigable one, as Christ was; 
 he went from town to town, to beseech poor sinners to be reconciled to 
 God. This is an example to ministers, to lay themselves out to do good, 
 and to <I>be instant,</I> and constant, in <I>season, and out of 
 season,</I> to preach the word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What a powerful physician Christ was; he <I>went about</I> not only 
 <I>teaching,</I> but <I>healing,</I> and both with his word, that he 
 might magnify that above all his name. <I>He sent his word, and healed 
 them.</I> Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What diseases he cured--all without exception. He <I>healed all
 manner of sickness, and all manner of disease.</I> There are diseases 
 which are called <I>the reproach of physicians,</I> being obstinate to 
 all the methods they can prescribe; but even those were the glory of 
 this Physician, for <I>he healed them</I> all, however inveterate. His 
 word was the true <I>panpharmacon--all-heal.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three general words are here used to intimate this; he healed every 
 sickness, <B><I>noson</I></B>, as blindness, lameness, fever, dropsy; 
 every <I>disease,</I> or languishing, <B><I>malakian</I></B>, as fluxes 
 and consumptions; and all <I>torments,</I> <B><I>basanous</I></B>, as 
 gout, stone, convulsions, and such like torturing distempers; whether 
 the disease was acute or chronical; whether it was a racking or a 
 wasting disease; none was too bad, none too hard, for Christ to heal 
 with a word's speaking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three particular diseases are specified; <I>the palsy,</I> which is the 
 greatest weakness of the body; <I>lunacy,</I> which is the greatest 
 malady of the mind, and <I>possession of the Devil,</I> which is the 
 greatest misery and calamity of both, yet Christ healed all: for he is 
 the sovereign Physician both of soul and body, and has command of all 
 diseases.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What patients he had. A physician who was so easy of access, so sure 
 of success, who cured immediately, without either a painful suspense 
 and expectation, or such painful remedies as are worse than the 
 disease; who cured gratis, and took no fees, could not but have 
 abundance of patients. See here, what flocking there was to him from 
 all parts; great multitudes of people came, not only <I>from 
 Galilee</I> and the country about, but even <I>from Jerusalem</I> and 
 <I>from Judea,</I> which lay a great way off; for <I>his fame went 
 throughout all Syria,</I> not only among all the people of the Jews, 
 but among the neighbouring nations, which, by the report that now 
 spread far and near concerning him, would be prepared to receive his 
 gospel, when afterwards it should be brought them. <I>This</I> is given 
 as the reason why such multitudes came to him, because his fame had 
 spread so widely. Note, What we hear of Christ from others, should 
 invite us to him. The queen of Sheba was induced, by the fame of 
 Solomon, to pay him a visit. The voice of fame is "Come, and see." 
 Christ both <I>taught and healed.</I> They who came for cures, met with 
 instruction concerning <I>the things that belonged to their peace.</I> 
 It is well if any thing will bring people to Christ; and they who come 
 to him will find more in him than they expected. These Syrians, like 
 Naaman the Syrian, coming to be healed of their diseases, many of them 
 being converts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:15,17">2 Kings v. 15, 17</A>.

 They sought health for the body, and obtained the salvation of the
 soul; like Saul, who sought the asses, and found the kingdom. Yet it 
 appeared, by the issue, that many of those who rejoiced in Christ as a 
 Healer, forgot him as a Teacher.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now concerning the cures which Christ wrought, let us, once for all, 
 observe the <I>miracle,</I> the <I>mercy,</I> and the <I>mystery,</I> 
 of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>miracle</I> of them. They were wrought in such a manner, as 
 plainly spake them to be the immediate products of a divine and 
 supernatural power, and they were God's seal to his commission. Nature 
 could not do these things, it was the God of nature; the cures were 
 many, of diseases incurable by the art of the physician, of persons 
 that were strangers, of all ages and conditions; the cures were wrought 
 openly, before many witnesses, in mixed companies of persons that would 
 have denied the matter of fact, if they could have had any colour for 
 so doing; no cure ever failed, or was afterwards called in question; 
 they were wrought speedily, and not (as cures by natural causes) 
 gradually; they were perfect cures, and wrought with a word's speaking; 
 all which proves him <I>a Teacher come from God,</I> for, otherwise, 
 none could have done the works that he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:2">John iii. 2</A>.

 He appeals to these as credentials,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:4,5,Joh+5:36"><I>ch.</I> xi. 4, 5; John v. 36</A>.

 It was expected that the Messiah should work miracles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:31">John vii. 31</A>);
 
 miracles of this nature
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:5,6">Isa. xxxv. 5, 6</A>);

 and we have this indisputable proof of his being the Messiah; never was
 there any man that did thus; and therefore his healing and his 
 preaching generally went together, for the former confirmed the latter; 
 thus here he <I>began to</I> do <I>and to</I> teach, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:1">Acts i. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>mercy</I> of them. The miracles that Moses wrought, to 
 prove his mission, were most of them plagues and judgments, to intimate 
 the terror of that dispensation, though from God; but the miracles that 
 Christ wrought, were most of them cures, and all of them (except the 
 cursing of the barren fig tree) blessings and favours; for the gospel 
 dispensation is founded, and built up in love, and grace, and 
 sweetness; and the management is such as tends not to affright but to 
 allure us to obedience. Christ designed by his cures to win upon
 people, and to ingratiate himself and his doctrine into their minds, 
 and so to draw them with the bands of love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:4">Hos. xi. 4</A>.

 The miracle of them proved his doctrine <I>a faithful saying,</I> and
 convinced men's judgments; the mercy of them proved it <I>worthy of all 
 acceptation,</I> and wrought upon their affections. They were not only 
 <I>great</I> works, but <I>good works,</I> that he <I>showed them 
 from</I> his <I>Father</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:32">John x. 32</A>);

 and this goodness was intended to <I>lead men to repentance</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:4">Rom. ii. 4</A>),

 as also to show that kindness, and beneficence, and doing good to all,
 to the utmost of our power and opportunity, are essential branches of 
 that holy religion which Christ came into the world to establish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The <I>mystery</I> of them. Christ, by curing <I>bodily 
 diseases,</I> intended to show, that his great errand into the world 
 was to cure <I>spiritual maladies.</I> He is the <I>Sun of 
 righteousness,</I> that <I>arises with</I> this <I>healing under his 
 wings.</I> As the Converter of sinners, he is the <I>Physician of 
 souls,</I> and has taught us to call him so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:12,13"><I>ch.</I> ix. 12, 13</A>.

 Sin is the <I>sickness, disease,</I> and <I>torment</I> of the soul;
 Christ <I>came to take away sin,</I> and so to heal these. And the 
 particular stories of the cures Christ wrought, may not only be applied 
 spiritually, by way of allusion and illustration, but, I believe, are 
 very much intended to reveal to us spiritual things, and to set before 
 us the way and method of Christ's dealing with souls, in their 
 conversion and sanctification; and those cures are recorded, that were 
 most significant and instructive this way; and they are therefore so to 
 be explained and improved, to the honour and praise of that glorious
