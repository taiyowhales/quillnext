 In this chapter we have,

 I. Some particular discourses which Christ had with his disciples, in
 which he teaches them to take heed of giving offence, and to forgive
 the injuries done them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>),

 encourages them to pray for the increase of their faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>),

 and then teaches them humility, whatever service they had done for God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 II. His cleansing ten lepers, and the thanks he had from one of them
 only, and he a Samaritan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:11-19">ver. 11-19</A>.

 III. His discourse with his disciples, upon occasion of an enquiry of
 the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should appear,

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that
 offences will come: but woe <I>unto him,</I> through whom they come!
 &nbsp; 2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
 neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of
 these little ones.
 &nbsp; 3 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against
 thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
 &nbsp; 4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and
 seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou
 shalt forgive him.
 &nbsp; 5 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
 &nbsp; 6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard
 seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by
 the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.
 &nbsp; 7 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,
 will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go
 and sit down to meat?
 &nbsp; 8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may
 sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and
 drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
 &nbsp; 9 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that
 were commanded him? I trow not.
 &nbsp; 10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things
 which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we
 have done that which was our duty to do.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the <I>giving of offences</I> is a <I>great sin,</I> and that 
 which we should every one of us avoid and carefully watch against, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 We can expect no other than that offences will come, considering the
 perverseness and frowardness that are in the nature of man, and the wise 
 purpose and counsel of God, who will carry on his work even by those 
 offences, and bring good out of evil. <I>It is</I> almost <I>impossible 
 but that offences will come,</I> and therefore we are concerned to 
 provide accordingly; but <I>woe to him through whom they come,</I> his 
 doom will be heavy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 more terrible than that of the worst of the malefactors who are 
 condemned to be thrown into the sea, for they perish under a load of 
 guilt more <I>ponderous</I> than that of <I>millstones.</I> This 
 includes a woe, 

 1. To persecutors, who offer any injury to the least of Christ's
 <I>little ones,</I> in word or deed, by which they are discouraged in 
 serving Christ, and doing their duty, or in danger of being driven off 
 from it. 

 2. To seducers, who corrupt the truths of Christ and his ordinances,
 and so <I>trouble the minds of the disciples;</I> for they are those by 
 whom <I>offences come.</I> 

 3. To those who, under the profession of the Christian name, live
 scandalously, and thereby weaken the bands and sadden the hearts of 
 God's people; for by them the offence comes, and it is no abatement of 
 their guilt, nor will be any of their punishment, that it is impossible 
 but offences will come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the <I>forgiving of offences</I> is a <I>great duty,</I> and 
 that which we should every one of us make conscience of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Take heed to yourselves.</I> This may refer either to what goes 
 before, or to what follows: <I>Take heed that you offend not one of 
 these little ones.</I> Ministers must be very careful not to say or do 
 any thing that may be a discouragement to weak Christians; there is 
 need of great caution, and they ought to speak and act very 
 considerately, for fear of this: or, "When <I>your brother trespasses 
 against you,</I> does you any injury, puts any slight or affront upon 
 you, if he be accessary to any damage done you in your property or 
 reputation, <I>take heed to yourselves at such a time,</I> lest you be 
 put into a passion; lest, when your spirits are provoked, you <I>speak 
 unadvisedly,</I> and rashly vow to revenge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:29">Prov. xxiv. 29</A>):

 <I>I will do so to him as he hath done to me.</I> Take heed what you 
 say at such a time, lest you say amiss."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. If you are permitted to <I>rebuke him,</I> you are advised to do so. 
 Smother not the resentment, but give it vent. <I>Tell him his 
 faults;</I> show him wherein he has not done well nor fairly by you, 
 and, it may be, you will perceive (and you must be very willing to 
 perceive it) that you mistook him, that it was not a <I>trespass 
 against you,</I> or not designed, but an <I>oversight,</I> and then you 
 will beg his pardon for misunderstanding him; as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:30,31">Josh. xxii. 30, 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. You are commanded, upon his repentance, to forgive him, and to be 
 perfectly reconciled to him: <I>If he repent, forgive him;</I> forget 
 the injury, never think of it again, much less upbraid him with it. 
 Though he do not repent, you must not therefore bear malice to him, nor 
 meditate revenge; but, it he do not at least <I>say that he 
 repents,</I> you are not bound to be so free and familiar with him as 
 you have been. If he be guilty of gross sin, to the offence of the 
 Christian community he is a member of, let him be gravely and mildly 
 reproved for his sin, and, upon his repentance, received into 
 friendship and communion again. This the apostle calls 
 <I>forgiveness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:7">2 Cor. ii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. You are to repeat this every time he repeats his trespass, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 "If he could be supposed to be either so negligent, or so impudent, as
 to <I>trespass against thee seven times in a day,</I> and as often 
 profess himself sorry for his fault, and promise not again to offend in 
 like manner, continue to <I>forgive him." Humanum est errare--To ere is 
 human.</I> Note, Christians should be of a forgiving spirit, willing to 
 make the best of every body, and to make all about them easy; forward 
 to extenuate faults, and not to aggravate them; and they should 
 contrive as much to show that they have forgiven an injury as others to 
 show that they resent it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That we have all need to get our <I>faith</I> strengthened, 
 because, as that grace grows, all other graces grow. The more firmly we 
 believe the doctrine of Christ, and the more confidently we rely upon 
 the grace of Christ, the better it will be with us every way. Now 
 observe here, 

 1. The address which the disciples made to Christ, for the
 strengthening of their faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 <I>The apostles</I> themselves, so they are here called, though they
 were prime ministers of state in Christ's kingdom, yet acknowledged the 
 weakness and deficiency of their faith, and saw their need of Christ's 
 grace for the improvement of it; they <I>said unto the Lord, "Increase 
 our faith,</I> and perfect what is lacking in it." Let the discoveries 
 of faith be more clear, the desires of faith more strong, the 
 dependences of faith more firm and fixed, the dedications of faith more 
 entire and resolute, and the delights of faith more pleasing. Note, the 
 increase of our faith is what we should earnestly desire, and we should 
 offer up that desire to God in prayer. Some think that they put up this 
 prayer to Christ upon occasion of his pressing upon them the duty of 
 forgiving injuries: "<I>Lord, increase our faith,</I> or we shall never 
 be able to practise such a difficult duty as this." Faith in God's 
 pardoning mercy will enable us to get over the greatest difficulties 
 that lie in the way of our forgiving our brother. Others think that it 
 was upon some other occasion, when the apostles were run aground in 
 working some miracle, and were reproved by Christ for the weakness of 
 their faith, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:16">Matt. xvii. 16</A>,

 &c. To him that <I>blamed</I> them they must apply themselves for grace
 to <I>mend</I> them; to him they cry, <I>Lord, increase our faith.</I> 
 
 2. The assurance Christ gave them of the wonderful efficacy of true
 faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>If ye had faith as a grain of mustard-seed,</I> so <I>small</I> as 
 mustard-seed, but yours is yet less than the least; or so <I>sharp</I> 
 as <I>mustard-seed,</I> so pungent, so exciting to all other graces, as 
 mustard to the animal spirits," and therefore used in palsies, "you 
 might do wonders much beyond what you now do; nothing would be too hard 
 for you, that was fit to be done for the glory of God, and the 
 confirmation of the doctrine you preach, yea, though it were the 
 <I>transplanting of a tree</I> from the earth <I>to the sea.</I>" See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:20">Matt. xvii. 20</A>.

 As with God <I>nothing is impossible,</I> so are all <I>things possible
 to him that can believe.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That, whatever we do in the service of Christ, we must be very 
 humble, and not imagine that we can merit any favour at his hand, or 
 claim it as a debt; even the apostles themselves, who did so much more 
 for Christ than others, must not think that they had thereby made him 
 their debtor. 

 1. We are all <I>God's servants</I> (his <I>apostles</I> and
 <I>ministers</I> are in a special manner <I>so</I>), and, as servants, 
 are bound to do all we can for his honour. Our whole strength and our 
 whole time are to be employed for him; for <I>we are not our own,</I> 
 nor at our own disposal, but at our Master's. 

 2. As God's servants, it becomes us to fill up our time with duty, and
 we have a variety of work appointed us to do; we ought to make the end 
 of one service the beginning of another. The servant that has been 
 <I>ploughing,</I> or <I>feeding cattle, in the field,</I> when he 
 <I>comes home</I> at night has work to do still; he must <I>wait at 
 table,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 When we have been employed in the duties of a religious conversation,
 that will not excuse us from the exercises of devotion; when we have 
 been <I>working for God,</I> still we must be <I>waiting on God,</I> 
 waiting on him continually.

 3. Our principal care here must be to do the duty of our relation, and
 leave it to our Master to give us the comfort of it, when and how he 
 thinks fit. No servant expects that his master should say to him, <I>Go 
 and sit down to meat;</I> it is time enough to do that when we have 
 <I>done our day's work.</I> Let us be in care to finish our work, and 
 to do that well, and then the reward will come in due time. 

 4. It is fit that Christ should be served before us: <I>Make ready
 wherewith I may sup, and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink.</I> 
 Doubting Christians say that they cannot give to Christ the glory of 
 his love as they should, because they have not yet obtained the comfort 
 of it; but this is wrong. First let Christ have the glory of it, let us 
 attend him with our praises, and then we shall <I>eat and drink</I> in 
 the comfort of that love, and in this there is a feast. 

 5. Christ's servants, when they are to wait upon him, must <I>gird
 themselves,</I> must free themselves from every thing that is 
 entangling and encumbering, and fit themselves with a close application 
 of mind to go on, and go through, with their work; they must <I>gird up 
 the loins of their mind.</I> When we have prepared for Christ's 
 entertainment, have <I>made ready wherewith he may sup,</I> we must 
 then <I>gird ourselves,</I> to attend him. This is expected from 
 servants, and Christ might require it from us, but he does not insist 
 upon it. He was <I>among his disciples as one that served,</I> and came 
 not, as other masters, to take state, and <I>to be ministered unto, but 
 to minister;</I> witness his washing his disciples' feet. 

 6. Christ's servants do not so much as merit his thanks for any service
 they do him: "<I>Does he thank that servant?</I> Does he reckon himself 
 indebted to him for it? No, by no means." No good works of ours can 
 merit any thing at the hand of God. We expect God's favour, not because 
 we have by our services made him a debtor to us, but because he has by 
 his promises made himself a debtor to his own honour, and this we may 
 plead with him, but cannot sue for a <I>quantum meruit--according to 
 merit.</I> 

 7. Whatever we do for Christ, though it should be more perhaps than
 some others do, yet it is no more than is our duty to do. Though we
 should <I>do all things that are commanded us,</I> and alas! in many
 things we come short of this, yet there is no work of 
 <I>supererogation;</I> it is but what we are bound to by that first and 
 great commandment of <I>loving God</I> with <I>all our heart and 
 soul,</I> which includes the utmost. 

 8. The best servants of Christ, even when they do the best services,
 must humbly acknowledge that they are <I>unprofitable servants;</I> 
 though they are not those unprofitable servants that bury their 
 talents, and shall be cast into <I>utter darkness,</I> yet as to 
 Christ, and any advantage that can accrue to him by their services, 
 they are <I>unprofitable;</I> our <I>goodness extendeth not unto 
 God,</I> nor <I>if we are righteous is he the better,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:2,Job+22:2,35:7">Ps. xvi. 2; Job xxii. 2; xxxv. 7</A>.

 God cannot be a <I>gainer</I> by our services, and therefore cannot be
 made a <I>debtor</I> by them. He has no need of us, nor can our 
 services make any addition to his perfections. It becomes us therefore 
 to call ourselves <I>unprofitable servants,</I> but to call his service 
 a profitable service, for God is happy without us, but we are undone 
 without him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed
 through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
 &nbsp; 12 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten
 men that were lepers, which stood afar off:
 &nbsp; 13 And they lifted up <I>their</I> voices, and said, Jesus, Master,
 have mercy on us.
 &nbsp; 14 And when he saw <I>them,</I> he said unto them, Go show
 yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they
 went, they were cleansed.
 &nbsp; 15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned
 back, and with a loud voice glorified God,
 &nbsp; 16 And fell down on <I>his</I> face at his feet, giving him thanks:
 and he was a Samaritan.
 &nbsp; 17 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but
 where <I>are</I> the nine?
 &nbsp; 18 There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save
 this stranger.
 &nbsp; 19 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made
 thee whole.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the cure of ten lepers, which we had not in 
 any other of the evangelists. The leprosy was a disease which the Jews 
 supposed to be inflicted for the punishment of some particular sin, and 
 to be, more than other diseases, a mark of God's displeasure; and 
 therefore Christ, who came to take away sin, and turn away wrath, took 
 particular care to cleanse the lepers that fell in his way. Christ was 
 now in his way to Jerusalem, about the mid-way, where he had little 
 acquaintance in comparison with what he had either at Jerusalem or in 
 Galilee. He was now in the frontier-country, the marches that lay 
 between Samaria and Galilee. He went that road to find out these 
 lepers, and to cure them; for he is <I>found of them that sought him 
 not.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The address of these lepers to Christ. They were ten in a company; 
 for, though they were shut out from society with others, yet those that 
 were infected were at liberty to converse with one another, which would 
 be some comfort to them, as giving them an opportunity to compare 
 notes, and to condole with one another. Now observe, 

 1. They <I>met</I> Christ <I>as he entered into a certain village.</I>
 They did not stay till he had refreshed himself for some time after the
 fatigue of his journey, but met him as he <I>entered</I> the town,
 weary as he was; and yet he did not put them off, nor adjourn their
 cause. 

 2. They <I>stood afar off,</I> knowing that by the law their disease
 obliged them to <I>keep their distance.</I> A sense of our spiritual 
 leprosy should make us very humble in all our approaches to Christ. Who 
 are we, that we should draw near to him that is infinitely pure? We are 
 impure.

 3. Their request was unanimous, and very importunate

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>They lifted up their voices,</I> being at a distance, and cried, 
 <I>Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</I> those that expect help from 
 Christ must take him for their Master, and be at his command. If he be 
 <I>Master,</I> he will be <I>Jesus, a Saviour,</I> and not otherwise.
 They ask not in particular to be cured of their leprosy, but, <I>Have 
 mercy on us;</I> and it is enough to refer ourselves to the compassions 
 of Christ, for they <I>fail not.</I> They heard the fame of this Jesus 
 (though he had not been much conversant in that country), and that was 
 such as encouraged them to make application to him; and, if but one of 
 them began in so cheap and easy an address, they would all join.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ sent them to <I>the priest,</I> to be <I>inspected</I> by 
 him, who was the judge of the leprosy. He did not tell them positively 
 that they should be <I>cured,</I> but bade them <I>go show themselves 
 to the priests,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This was a trial of their obedience, and it was fit that it should be
 so tried, as Naaman's in a like case: <I>Go wash in Jordan.</I> Note, 
 Those that expect Christ's favours must take them in his way and 
 method. Some of these lepers perhaps would be ready to quarrel with the 
 prescription: "Let him either cure or say that he will not, and not 
 send us to the priests on a fool's errand;" but, over-ruled by the 
 rest, they all <I>went to the priest.</I> As the ceremonial law was yet 
 in force, Christ took care that it should be observed, and the 
 reputation of it kept up, and due honour paid to the priests in things 
 pertaining to their function; but, probably, he had here a further 
 design, which was to have the priest's <I>judgment of,</I> and 
 <I>testimony to,</I> the perfectness of the cure; and that the priest 
 might be awakened, and others by him, to enquire after one that had 
 such a commanding power over bodily diseases.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. <I>As they went, they were cleansed,</I> and so became fit to be 
 looked upon by the priest, and to have a certificate from him that they 
 were clean. Observe, <I>Then</I> we may expect God to meet us with 
 mercy when we are found in the way of duty. If we do what we can, God
 will not be wanting to do that for us which we cannot. Go, attend upon 
 instituted ordinances; go and pray, and read the scriptures: <I>Go show 
 thyself to the priests;</I> go and open thy case to a faithful 
 minister, and, though the means will not heal thee of themselves, God 
 will heal thee in the diligent use of those means.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. One of them, and but one, <I>returned, to give thanks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 When he <I>saw that he was healed,</I> instead of going forward to the
 priest, to be by him declared clean, and so discharged from his 
 confinement, which was all that the rest aimed at, he <I>turned 
 back</I> towards him who was the Author of his cure, whom he wished to 
 have the glory of it, before he received the benefit of it. He appears 
 to have been very hearty and affectionate in his thanksgivings: <I>With 
 a loud voice he glorified God,</I> acknowledging it to come originally 
 from <I>him;</I> and he <I>lifted up his voice</I> in his praises, as 
 he had done in his prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Those that have received mercy from God should publish it to others,
 that they may praise God too, and may be encouraged by their 
 experiences to trust in him. But he also made a particular address of 
 thanks to Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>He fell down at his feet,</I> put himself into the most humble 
 reverent posture he could, and <I>gave him thanks.</I> Note, We ought 
 to give thanks for the favours Christ bestows upon us, and particularly 
 for recoveries from sickness; and we ought to be <I>speedy</I> in our 
 returns of praise, and not defer them, lest time wear out the sense of 
 the mercy. It becomes us also to be very humble in our thanksgivings, 
 as well as in our prayers. It becomes the seed of Jacob, like him, to 
 own themselves <I>less than the least of God's mercies,</I> when they 
 have received them, as well as when they are in pursuit of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Christ took notice of this one that had thus distinguished himself; 
 for, it seems, he was a Samaritan, whereas the rest were Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 The Samaritans were separatists from the Jewish church, and had not the
 pure knowledge and worship of God among them that the Jews had, and yet 
 it was one of them that <I>glorified God,</I> when the Jews forgot, or, 
 when it was moved to them, <I>refused,</I> to do it. Now observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The particular notice Christ took of him, of the grateful return he 
 made, and the ingratitude of those that were sharers with him in the 
 mercy--that he who was a <I>stranger</I> to the commonwealth of Israel
 was the only one that <I>returned to give glory to God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.
 
 See here,

 (1.) How <I>rich</I> Christ is in <I>doing good: Were there not ten 
 cleansed?</I> Here was a cure by <I>wholesale,</I> a whole 
 <I>hospital</I> healed with <I>one</I> word's speaking. Note, There is 
 an abundance of healing cleansing virtue in the blood of Christ, 
 sufficient for all his patients, though ever so many. Here are <I>ten 
 at a time</I> cleansed; we shall have never the less grace for others 
 sharing it. 

 (2.) How <I>poor</I> we are in our returns: "<I>Where are the nine?</I> 
 Why did not they return to give thanks?" This intimates that 
 ingratitude is a very common sin. Of the many that receive mercy from 
 God, there are but few, very few, that <I>return to give thanks</I> in 
 a right manner (scarcely <I>one in ten</I>), that render according to 
 the benefit done to them. 

 (3.) How those often prove most grateful from whom it was least 
 expected. A Samaritan gives thanks, and a Jew does not. Thus many who 
 profess revealed religion are out-done, and quite shamed, by some that 
 are governed only by natural religion, not only in moral value, but in 
 piety and devotion. This serves here to aggravate the ingratitude of 
 those Jews of whom Christ speaks, as <I>taking it very ill</I> that his 
 kindness was so slighted. And it intimates how justly he resents the 
 ingratitude of the world of mankind, for whom he had <I>done so 
 much,</I> and from whom he has <I>received so little.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The great encouragement Christ gave him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The rest had their <I>cure,</I> and had it not <I>revoked,</I> as
 justly it might have been, for their ingratitude, though they had such 
 a good example of gratitude set before them; but he had his cure 
 confirmed particularly with an encomium: <I>Thy faith hath made thee 
 whole.</I> The rest were <I>made whole</I> by the power of Christ, in 
 compassion to their distress, and in answer to their prayer; but he was 
 made whole <I>by his faith,</I> by which Christ saw him distinguished 
 from the rest. Note, Temporal mercies are <I>then</I> doubled and
 sweetened to us when they are <I>fetched</I> in by the prayers of 
 faith, and <I>returned</I> by the praises of faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom
 of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God
 cometh not with observation:
 &nbsp; 21 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold,
 the kingdom of God is within you.
 &nbsp; 22 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye
 shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye
 shall not see <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 23 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not
 after <I>them,</I> nor follow <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 24 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one <I>part</I>
 under heaven, shineth unto the other <I>part</I> under heaven; so
 shall also the Son of man be in his day.
 &nbsp; 25 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of
 this generation.
 &nbsp; 26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
 days of the Son of man.
 &nbsp; 27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were
 given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,
 and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
 &nbsp; 28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat,
 they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
 &nbsp; 29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire
 and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed <I>them</I> all.
 &nbsp; 30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is
 revealed.
 &nbsp; 31 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his
 stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he
 that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.
 &nbsp; 32 Remember Lot's wife.
 &nbsp; 33 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and
 whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.
 &nbsp; 34 I tell you, in that night there shall be two <I>men</I> in one
 bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
 &nbsp; 35 Two <I>women</I> shall be grinding together; the one shall be
 taken, and the other left.
 &nbsp; 36 Two <I>men</I> shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and
 the other left.
 &nbsp; 37 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he
 said unto them, Wheresoever the body <I>is,</I> thither will the
 eagles be gathered together.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a discourse of Christ's concerning the <I>kingdom of 
 God,</I> that is, the kingdom of the Messiah, which was now shortly to 
 be <I>set up,</I> and of which there was great expectation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the demand of the Pharisees concerning it, which occasioned 
 this discourse. They asked <I>when the kingdom of God should come,</I> 
 forming a notion of it as a <I>temporal kingdom,</I> which should 
 advance the Jewish nation above the nations of the earth. They were 
 impatient to hear some tidings of its approach; they understood, 
 perhaps, that Christ had taught his disciples to pray for the coming of 
 it, and they had long preached that it was <I>at hand.</I> "Now," say 
 the Pharisees, "when will that glorious view open? When shall we see 
 this <I>long-looked-for</I> kingdom?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's reply to this demand, directed to the Pharisees first, and 
 afterwards to his own disciples, who knew better how to understand it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);
 
 what he said to both, he saith to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the kingdom of the Messiah was to be a <I>spiritual 
 kingdom,</I> and not temporal and external. They asked <I>when</I> it 
 would come. "You know not what you ask," saith Christ; "it may come, 
 and you not be aware of it." For it has not an <I>external show,</I> as 
 other kingdoms have, the advancements and revolutions of which are 
 taken notice of by the nations of the earth, and fill the newspapers; 
 so they expected this kingdom of God would do. "No," saith Christ, 

 (1.) "It will have a silent entrance, without pomp, without noise; it 
 <I>cometh not with observation,</I>" <B><I>meta 
 paratereseos</I></B>--<I>with outward show.</I> They desired to have 
 their curiosity satisfied concerning the <I>time</I> of it, to which 
 Christ does not give them any answer, but will have their mistakes 
 rectified concerning the nature of it: "<I>It is not for you to know 
 the times</I> of this kingdom, these are <I>secret things,</I> which 
 belong not to you; but the great intentions of this kingdom, these are 
 <I>things revealed.</I>" When Messiah the Prince comes to set up his 
 kingdom, they shall not say, <I>Lo here,</I> or <I>Lo there,</I> as 
 when a prince goes in progress to visit his territories it is in every 
 body's mouth, he is here, or he is there; for <I>where the king is 
 there is the court.</I> Christ will not come with all this talk; it 
 will not be set up in this or that particular place; nor will the court 
 of that kingdom be <I>here</I> or <I>there;</I> nor will it be 
 <I>here</I> or <I>there</I> as it respects the country men are of, or 
 the place they dwell in, as if that would place them nearer to, or 
 further from, that kingdom. Those who confine Christianity and the 
 church to this place or that party, cry, <I>Lo here,</I> or <I>Lo 
 there,</I> than which nothing is more contrary to the designs of 
 catholic Christianity; so do they who make prosperity and external pomp 
 a mark of the true church. 

 (2.) "It has a <I>spiritual</I> influence: <I>The kingdom of God is
 within you.</I>" It is not of this world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:36">John xviii. 36</A>.

 Its glory does not strike men's fancies, but affects their spirits, and 
 its power is over their souls and consciences; from them it receives 
 homage, and not from their bodies only. The <I>kingdom of God</I> will 
 not change men's outward condition, but their hearts and lives. Then it 
 <I>comes</I> when it makes those humble, and serious, and heavenly, 
 that were proud, and vain, and carnal,--when it <I>weans</I> those from 
 the world that were <I>wedded</I> to the world; and therefore look for 
 the kingdom of God in the revolutions of the heart, not of the civil 
 government. The kingdom of God is <I>among you;</I> so some read it. 
 "You enquire when it will come, and are not aware that it is already 
 begun to be set up <I>in the midst of you.</I> The gospel is preached, 
 it is <I>confirmed</I> by miracles, it is <I>embraced</I> by 
 multitudes, so that it is <I>in your</I> nation, though not in your 
 hearts." Note, It is the folly of many curious enquirers concerning the 
 times to come that they look for that <I>before them</I> which is 
 already <I>among them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That the setting up of this kingdom was a work that would meet with 
 a great deal of <I>opposition</I> and <I>interruption,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The <I>disciples</I> thought they should carry all before them, and
 expected a constant series of success in their work; but Christ tells 
 them it would be otherwise: "<I>The days will come,</I> before you have 
 finished your testimony and done your work, <I>when you shall desire to 
 see one of the days of the Son of man</I>" (one such a day as we 
 <I>now</I> have), "of the prosperity and progress of the gospel, and 
 <I>shall not see it.</I> At first, indeed, you will have wonderful 
 success" (so they had, when <I>thousands</I> were added to the church 
 <I>in a day</I>); "but do not think it will be always so; no, you will 
 be persecuted and scattered, silenced and imprisoned, so that you will 
 not have opportunities of preaching the gospel without fear, as you now 
 have; people will grow cool to it, when they have enjoyed it awhile, so 
 that you will not see such harvests of souls gathered in to Christ 
 afterwards as at first, nor such multitudes flocking to him <I>as doves 
 to their windows.</I>" This looks forward to his disciples in 
 after-ages; they must expect much disappointment; the gospel will not 
 be always preached with equal liberty and success. Ministers and 
 churches will sometimes be under <I>outward restraints.</I> Teachers 
 will be removed into corners, and solemn assemblies scattered. Then 
 they will wish to see such days of opportunity as they have formerly 
 enjoyed, sabbath days, sacrament days, preaching days, praying days; 
 these are <I>days of the Son of man,</I> in which we hear from him, and 
 converse with him. The time may come when we may in vain wish for such 
 days. God teaches us to know the worth of such mercies by the want of 
 them. It concerns us, while they are continued, to <I>improve</I> them, 
 and in the years of plenty to lay up in store for the years of famine.
 Sometimes they will be under <I>inward restraints,</I> will not have 
 such tokens of the <I>presence of the Son of man</I> with them as they 
 have had. The Spirit is withdrawn from them; they <I>see not their 
 signs;</I> the angel comes not down to stir the waters; there is a 
 great stupidity among the children of men, and a great lukewarmness 
 among the children of God; then they shall wish to see such 
 <I>victorious triumphant</I> days of the <I>Son of man</I> as they have 
 sometimes seen, when he has ridden forth with his bow and his crown, 
 conquering and to conquer, but they will not see them. Note, We must
 not think that Christ's church and cause are lost because not always 
 alike visible and prevailing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That Christ and his kingdom are not to be looked for in this or that 
 particular place, but his appearance will be general in all places at 
 once 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>):

 "<I>They will say to you, See here, or, See there;</I> here is one that 
 will deliver the Jews out of the hands of the oppressing Romans, or 
 there is one that will deliver the Christians out of the hands of the 
 oppressing Jews; here is the Messiah, and there is his prophet; 
 <I>here</I> in <I>this</I> mountain, or <I>there</I> at Jerusalem, you 
 will find the true church. <I>Go not after them, nor follow them;</I> 
 do not heed such suggestions. The kingdom of God was not designed to be 
 the glory of one people only, but to <I>give light to the Gentiles;</I> 
 for <I>as the lightning that lightens out of one part under heaven, and 
 shines</I> all on a sudden irresistibly <I>to the other part under 
 heaven, so shall also the Son of man be in his day.</I>" 

 (1.) "The <I>judgments</I> that are to destroy the Jewish nation, to 
 lay them waste, and to deliver the Christians from them, shall <I>fly 
 like lightning</I> through the land, shall lay all waste from one end 
 of it to another; and those that are marked for this destruction can no 
 more avoid it, nor oppose it, than they can a <I>flash of 
 lightning.</I>" 

 (2.) "The gospel that is to set up Christ's kingdom in the world shall 
 <I>fly like lightning</I> through the nations. The kingdom of the 
 Messiah is not to be a <I>local</I> thing, but is to be dispersed far 
 and wide over the face of the whole earth; it shall <I>shine</I> from 
 Jerusalem to all parts about, and that <I>in a moment.</I> The kingdoms 
 of the earth shall be leavened by the gospel ere they are aware of it." 
 The trophies of Christ's victories shall be erected on the ruins of the 
 devil's kingdom, even in those countries that could never be subdued to 
 the Roman yoke. The design of the setting up of Christ's kingdom was 
 not to make one <I>nation great,</I> but to make <I>all nations 
 good</I>--some, at least, of all nations; and this point shall be 
 gained, though the <I>nations rage,</I> and the <I>kings of the earth 
 set themselves</I> with all their might against it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That the Messiah must <I>suffer</I> before he must reign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):
 
 "<I>First must he suffer many things,</I> many hard things, and <I>be 
 rejected of this generation;</I> and, if he be thus treated, his 
 disciples must expect no other than to <I>suffer</I> and be 
 <I>rejected</I> too for his sake." They thought of having the kingdom 
 of the Messiah set up in external splendour: "No," saith Christ, "we 
 must go by the cross to the crown. The <I>Son of man must suffer many 
 things.</I> Pain, and shame, and death, are those <I>many things.</I> 
 He must be <I>rejected by this generation</I> of unbelieving Jews, 
 before he be embraced by another generation of believing Gentiles, that 
 his gospel may have the honour of triumphing over the greatest 
 opposition from those who ought to have given it the greatest 
 assistance; and thus the excellency of the power will appear to be 
 <I>of God, and not of man;</I> for, though Israel be not 
 <I>gathered,</I> yet he will be <I>glorious</I> to the ends of the 
 earth."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That the setting up of the kingdom of the Messiah would introduce 
 the destruction of the Jewish nation, whom it would find in a deep 
 sleep of <I>security,</I> and drowned in <I>sensuality,</I> as the old 
 world was in the days of Noah, and Sodom in the days of Lot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>,

 &c. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How it had been with sinners formerly, and in what posture the 
 judgments of God, of which they had been fairly warned, did at length 
 find them. Look as far back as the <I>old world,</I> when all flesh had 
 <I>corrupted their way,</I> and the <I>earth was filled with 
 violence.</I> Come a little lower, and think how it was with the men of 
 Sodom, who were <I>wicked, and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.</I> 
 Now observe concerning both these, 

 [1.] That they had <I>fair warning given them</I> of the ruin that was 
 coming upon them for their sins. Noah was a <I>preacher of
 righteousness</I> to the old world; so was Lot to the Sodomites. They 
 gave them timely notice of what would be in the end of their wicked 
 ways, and that it was not far off.

 [2.] That they did not regard the warning given them, and gave no 
 credit, no heed to it. They were very secure, went on in their business 
 as unconcerned as you could imagine; <I>they did eat, they drank,</I> 
 indulged themselves in their pleasures, and took no care of any thing 
 else, but to <I>make provision for the flesh,</I> counted upon the 
 perpetuity of their present flourishing state, and therefore married 
 wives, and <I>were given in marriage,</I> that their families might be 
 built up. They were all very merry; so were the men of Sodom, and yet
 very busy too: <I>they bought, they sold, they planted, they 
 builded.</I> These were lawful things, but the fault was that they 
 minded these inordinately, and their hearts were entirely set upon 
 them, as that they had no heart at all to prepare against the 
 threatened judgments. When they should have been, as the men of
 Nineveh, <I>fasting and praying, repenting</I> and <I>reforming,</I> 
 upon warning given them of an approaching judgment, they were going on 
 securely, <I>eating flesh,</I> and <I>drinking wine,</I> when God 
 called <I>to weeping and to mourning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:12,13">Isa. xxii. 12, 13</A>.

 [3.] That they continued in their security and sensuality, till the
 threatened judgment came. Until the day <I>that Noah entered into the 
 ark,</I> and <I>Lot went out of Sodom,</I> nothing said or done to them 
 served to alarm or awaken them. Note, Though the stupidity of sinners
 in a sinful way is as strange as it is <I>without excuse,</I> yet we 
 are not to think it strange, for it is not without example. It is the 
 <I>old way that wicked men have trodden,</I> that have gone slumbering 
 to hell, as if their damnation slumbered while they did.

 [4.] That God took care for the preservation of those that were his, 
 who believed and feared, and took the warning themselves which they 
 gave to others. Noah entered <I>into the ark,</I> and there he was 
 safe; Lot went out of Sodom, and so went out of harm's way. If some run 
 on <I>heedless</I> and <I>headlong</I> into destruction, that shall be 
 no prejudice to the salvation of those that believe.

 [5.] That they were surprised with the ruin which they would not fear, 
 and were swallowed up in it, to their unspeakable horror and amazement. 
 The <I>flood came,</I> and destroyed all the sinners of the old world; 
 <I>fire and brimstone</I> came, and <I>destroyed</I> all the sinners of 
 Sodom. God has many arrows in his quiver, and uses which he will in 
 making war upon his rebellious subjects, for he can make which he will 
 effectual. But that which is especially intended here is to show what a 
 dreadful surprise destruction will be to those who are secure and 
 sensual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How it will be with sinners still 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</I> 
 When Christ comes to destroy the Jewish nation, by the Roman armies, 
 the generality of that nation will be found under such a reigning 
 security and stupidity as this. They have warning given by Christ now, 
 and will have it repeated to them by the apostles after him, as they 
 had by Noah and Lot; but it will be all <I>in vain.</I> They will 
 continue secure, will go on in their neglect and opposition of Christ 
 and his gospel, till all the Christians are withdrawn from among them 
 and gone to the place of refuge. God will provide for them on the other 
 side Jordan, and then a deluge of judgments shall flow in upon them, 
 which will destroy all the unbelieving Jews. One would have thought 
 that this discourse of our Saviour's, which was public, and not long 
 after <I>published</I> to the world, should have awakened them; but it 
 did not, for the hearts of that people were hardened, to their 
 destruction. In like manner, when Jesus Christ shall come to judge the 
 world, at the end of time, sinners will be found in the same secure and 
 careless posture, altogether regardless of the judgment approaching, 
 which will therefore come upon them as a snare; and in like manner the 
 sinners of every age go on securely in their evil ways, and <I>remember 
 not their latter end,</I> nor the account that they must give. <I>Woe 
 to them that are thus at ease in Zion.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That it ought to be the care of his disciples and followers to 
 distinguish themselves from the unbelieving Jews in that day, and, 
 leaving them, their city and country, to themselves, to flee at the 
 signal given, according to the direction that should be given. Let them 
 retire, as Noah to his ark, and Lot to his Zoar. You <I>would have 
 healed Jerusalem,</I> as of old Babylon, <I>but she is not healed,</I> 
 and therefore <I>forsake her, flee out of the midst of her,</I> and 
 <I>deliver every man his soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:6,9">Jer. li. 6, 9</A>.

 This flight of theirs from Jerusalem must be <I>expeditious,</I> and 
 must not be retarded by any concern about their worldly affairs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "<I>He that shall be on the house-top,</I> when the alarm is given,
 <I>let him not come down, to take his stuff away,</I> both because he 
 cannot spare so much time, and because the carrying away of his effects 
 will but encumber him and retard his flight." Let him not <I>regard</I> 
 his <I>stuff</I> at such a time, when it will be next to a miracle of 
 mercy if he have his <I>life given him for a prey.</I> It will be 
 better to leave his stuff behind him than to stay to look after it, and 
 <I>perish with them that believe</I> not. It will be their concern to 
 do as Lot and his family were charged to do: <I>Escape for thy life. 
 Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</I> 

 (2.) When they have made their escape, they must not think of returning 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 "<I>Remember Lot's wife;</I> and take warning by her not only to flee 
 from this Sodom (for so Jerusalem is become, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:10">Isa. i. 10</A>),

 but to persevere in your flight, and do not <I>look back,</I> as she 
 did; be not loth to leave a place marked for destruction, whomsoever or 
 whatsoever you leave behind you, that is ever so dear to you." Those 
 who have left the Sodom of a natural state, let them go forward, and 
 not so much as look a kind look towards it again. Let them not <I>look 
 back,</I> lest they should be tempted to <I>go back;</I> nay, lest that 
 be construed a <I>going back in heart,</I> or an evidence that the 
 heart was left behind. Lot's wife was <I>turned into a pillar of 
 salt,</I> that she might remain a lasting monument of God's displeasure 
 against apostates, who <I>begin in the spirit and end in the flesh.</I> 
 
 (3.) There would be no other way of saving their lives than by quitting 
 the Jews, and, if they thought to save themselves by a coalition with 
 them, they would find themselves mistaken 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 "<I>Whosoever shall seek to save his life,</I> by declining from his 
 Christianity and complying with the Jews, he shall <I>lose it</I> with 
 them and perish in the common calamity; but whosoever is willing to 
 venture his life with the Christians, upon the same bottom on which 
 they venture, to take his lot with them in life and in death, he shall 
 <I>preserve</I> his life, for he shall make sure of <I>eternal 
 life,</I> and is in a likelier way at that time to save his life than 
 those who embark in a Jewish bottom, or <I>ensure</I> upon their 
 securities." Note, Those do best themselves that trust God in the way 
 of duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. That all good Christians should certainly escape, but many of them 
 very <I>narrowly,</I> from that destruction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:34-36"><I>v.</I> 34-36</A>.

 When God's judgments are laying all waste, he will take an effectual
 course to preserve those that are his, by remarkable providences 
 distinguishing between them and others that were nearest to them: 
 <I>two in a bed, one taken and the other left;</I> one snatched out of 
 the burning and taken into a place of safety, while the other is left 
 to perish in the common ruin. Note, Though the sword devours one as 
 well as another, and <I>all things</I> seem to <I>come alike to 
 all,</I> yet sooner or later it shall be made to appear that the Lord 
 knows them that are his and them that are not, and how to <I>take out 
 the precious from the vile.</I> We are sure that <I>the Judge of all 
 the earth will do right;</I> and therefore, when he sends a judgment on 
 purpose to avenge the death of his Son upon those that crucified him, 
 he will take care that none of those who glorified him, and gloried in 
 his cross, shall be <I>taken away</I> by that judgment.</P>

 8. That this distinguishing, dividing, discriminating work shall be 
 done in all places, as far as the kingdom of God shall extend,

 <I>Where, Lord?</I> They had enquired concerning the time, and he would
 not gratify their curiosity with any information concerning that; they 
 therefore tried him with another question: "<I>Where, Lord?</I> Where 
 shall those be <I>safe</I> that are <I>taken?</I> Where shall those 
 <I>perish</I> that are left?" The answer is proverbial, and may be 
 explained so as to answer each side of the question: <I>Wheresoever the 
 body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.</I> 

 (1.) Wherever the wicked are, who are marked for perdition, they shall 
 <I>be found out</I> by the judgments of God; as wherever a dead carcase 
 is, the birds of prey will smell it out, and make a prey of it. The 
 Jews having made themselves a dead and putrefied carcase, <I>odious</I> 
 to God's holiness and <I>obnoxious</I> to his justice, wherever any of 
 that unbelieving generation is, the judgments of God shall fasten upon 
 them, as the eagles do upon the prey: <I>Thine hand shall find out all 
 thine enemies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:8">Ps. xxi. 8</A>),

 though they <I>set their nests among the stars,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:4">Obad. 4</A>.

 The Roman soldiers will hunt the Jews out of all their recesses and
 fastnesses, and none shall escape. 

 (2.) Wherever the godly are, who are marked for preservation, they 
 <I>shall be found</I> happy in the enjoyment of Christ. As the 
 dissolution of the Jewish church shall be extended to all parts, so 
 shall the constitution of the Christian church. Wherever Christ is, 
 believers will flock to him, and meet in him, as eagles about the prey, 
 without being directed or shown the way, by the instinct of the new 
 nature. Now Christ is where his gospel, and his ordinances, and his 
 church are: <I>For where two or three are gathered in his name there is 
 he in the midst of them,</I> and thither therefore others will be 
 gathered to him. The kingdom of the Messiah is not to have one 
 particular place for its <I>metropolis,</I> such as Jerusalem was to 
 the Jewish church, to which all Jews were to resort; but, <I>wherever 
 the body is,</I> wherever the gospel is preached and ordinances are 
 ministered, thither will pious souls resort, there they will find 
 Christ, and by faith feast upon him. Wherever Christ records his name
 he will meet his people, and bless them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:21,1Ti+2:8">John iv. 21, &c.; 1 Tim. ii. 8</A>.

 Many good interpreters understand it of the gathering of the saints
 together to Christ in the kingdom of glory: "Ask not where the carcase 
 will be, and how they shall find the way to it, for they shall be under 
 infallible direction; to him who is their living, quickening Head, and 
 the centre of their unity, to him shall the gathering of the people 
 be."</P>
