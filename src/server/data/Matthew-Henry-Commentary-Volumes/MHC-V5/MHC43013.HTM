 Our Saviour having finished his public discourses, in which he "endured 
 the contradiction of sinners," now applies himself to a private 
 conversation with his friends, in which he designed the consolation of 
 saints. Henceforward we have an account of what passed between him and 
 his disciples, who were to be entrusted with the affairs of his 
 household, when he was gone into a far country; the necessary 
 instructions and comforts he furnished them with. His hour being at 
 hand, he applies himself to set his house in order. In this chapter 

 I. He washes his disciples' feet,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:1-17">ver. 1-17</A>.

 II. He foretels who should betray him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:18-30">ver. 18-30</A>.

 III. He instructs them in the great doctrine of his own death, and the
 great duty of brotherly love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:31-35">ver. 31-35</A>.

 IV. He foretels Peter's denying him,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that
 his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto
 the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he
 loved them unto the end.
 &nbsp; 2  And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the
 heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's <I>son,</I> to betray him;
 &nbsp; 3  Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his
 hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
 &nbsp; 4  He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took
 a towel, and girded himself.
 &nbsp; 5  After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash
 the disciples' feet, and to wipe <I>them</I> with the towel wherewith
 he was girded.
 &nbsp; 6  Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him,
 Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
 &nbsp; 7  Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not
 now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
 &nbsp; 8  Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus
 answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
 &nbsp; 9  Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also
 <I>my</I> hands and <I>my</I> head.
 &nbsp; 10  Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to
 wash <I>his</I> feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but
 not all.
 &nbsp; 11  For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are
 not all clean.
 &nbsp; 12  So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his
 garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what
 I have done to you?
 &nbsp; 13  Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for <I>so</I> I am.
 &nbsp; 14  If I then, <I>your</I> Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye
 also ought to wash one another's feet.
 &nbsp; 15  For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
 done to you.
 &nbsp; 16  Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater
 than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent
 him.
 &nbsp; 17  If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It has generally been taken for granted by commentators that Christ's 
 washing his disciples' feet, and the discourse that followed it, were 
 the same night in which he was betrayed, and at the same sitting 
 wherein he ate the passover and instituted the Lord's supper; but 
 whether before the solemnity began, or after it was all over, or 
 between the eating of the passover and the institution of the Lord's 
 supper, they are not agreed. This evangelist, making it his business to 
 gather up those passages which the others had omitted, industriously
 omits those which the others had recorded, which occasions some
 difficulty in putting them together. If it was then, we suppose that
 <I>Judas went out</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 to get his men ready that were to apprehend the Lord Jesus in the 
 garden. But Dr. Lightfoot is clearly of opinion that this was done and 
 said, even all that is recorded to the end of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:31-14:33"><I>ch.</I> xiv.</A>,

 not at the passover supper, for it is here said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 to be <I>before the feast of the passover,</I> but at the supper in 
 Bethany, two days before the passover (of which we read

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:2-6">Matt. xxvi. 2-6</A>),

 at which Mary the second time anointed Christ's head with the remainder
 of her box of ointment. Or, it might be at some other supper the night 
 before the passover, not as that was in the house of Simon the leper, 
 but in his own lodgings, where he had none but his disciples about him, 
 and could be more free with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:1-17">these verses</A>

 we have the story of Christ's washing his disciples' feet; it was an
 action of a singular nature; no miracle, unless we call it a miracle of 
 humility. Mary had just anointed his head; now, lest his acceptance of 
 this should look like taking state, he presently balances it with this 
 act of abasement. But why would Christ do this? If the disciples' feet
 needed washing, they could wash them themselves; a wise man will not do 
 a thing that looks odd and unusual, but for very good causes and 
 considerations. We are sure that it was not in a humour or a frolic 
 that this was done; no, the transaction was very solemn, and carried on 
 with a great deal of seriousness; and four reasons are here intimated 
 why Christ did this:--

 1. That he might testify his love to his disciples,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 2. That he might give an instance of his own voluntary humility and
 condescension, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.

 3. That he might signify to them spiritual washing, which is referred 
 to in his discourse with Peter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:6-11"><I>v.</I> 6-11</A>.

 4. That he might set them an example,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:12-17"><I>v.</I> 12-17</A>.

 And the opening of these four reasons will take in the exposition of 
 the whole story.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ washed his disciples' feet that he might give a proof of that 
 great love wherewith he loved them; loved them to the end, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is here laid down as an undoubted truth that our Lord Jesus, 
 <I>having loved his own that were in the world, loved them to the 
 end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This is true of the disciples that were his immediate followers, 
 in particular the twelve. These were his own in the world, his family, 
 his school, his bosom-friends. Children he had none to call his own, 
 but he adopted them, and took them as his own. He had those that were 
 his own in the other world, but he left them for a time, to look after 
 his own in this world. These he loved, he called them into fellowship 
 with himself, conversed familiarly with them, was always tender of 
 them, and of their comfort and reputation. He allowed them to be very 
 free with him, and bore with their infirmities. He loved them to the 
 end, continued his love to them as long as he lived, and after his 
 resurrection; he never took away his loving kindness. Though there were 
 some persons of quality that espoused his cause, he did not lay aside 
 his old friends, to make room for new ones, but still stuck to his poor 
 fishermen. They were weak and defective in knowledge and grace, dull 
 and forgetful; and yet, though he reproved them often, he never ceased 
 to love them and take care of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is true of all believers, for these twelve patriarchs were the 
 representatives of all the tribes of God's spiritual Israel. Note, 

 [1.] Our Lord Jesus has a people in the world that are his own,--his 
 own, for they were given him by the Father, he has purchased them, and 
 paid dearly for them, and he has set them apart for himself,--his own, 
 for they have devoted themselves to him as a peculiar people. <I>His 
 own;</I> where <I>his own</I> were spoken of that <I>received him 
 not,</I> it is <B><I>tous idious</I></B>--<I>his own persons,</I> as a 
 man's wife and children are his own, to whom he stands in a constant 
 relation. 

 [2.] Christ has a cordial love for his own that are in the world. He 
 <I>did</I> love them with a love of goodwill when he gave himself for 
 their redemption. He <I>does</I> love them with a love of complacency 
 when he admits them into communion with himself. Though they are <I>in 
 this world,</I> a world of darkness and distance, of sin and 
 corruption, yet he loves them. He was now going to his own in heaven, 
 the spirits of just men made perfect there; but he seems most concerned 
 for his own on earth, because they most needed his care: the sickly 
 child is most indulged. 

 [3.] Those whom Christ loves <I>he loves to the end;</I> he is constant 
 in his love to his people; he <I>rests in his love.</I> He loves with 
 an everlasting love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:3">Jer. xxxi. 3</A>),

 from everlasting in the counsels of it to everlasting in the 
 consequences of it. Nothing can separate a believer <I>from the love of 
 Christ;</I> he loves his own, <B><I>eis telos</I></B>--<I>unto 
 perfection,</I> for he will perfect what concerns them, will bring them 
 to that world where love is perfect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ manifested his love to them by washing their feet, as that 
 good woman 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:38">Luke vii. 38</A>)

 showed her love to Christ by washing his feet and wiping them. Thus he 
 would show that as his love to them was constant so it was 
 condescending,-- that in prosecution of the designs of it he was 
 willing to humble himself,--and that the glories of his exalted state, 
 which he was now entering upon, should be no obstruction at all to the 
 favour he bore to his chosen; and thus he would confirm the promise he 
 had made to all the saints that he would <I>make them sit down to meat, 
 and would come forth and serve them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:37">Luke xii. 37</A>),

 would put honour upon them as great and surprising as for a lord to 
 serve his servants. The disciples had just now betrayed the weakness
 of their love to him, in grudging the ointment that was poured upon his 
 head 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:8">Matt. xxvi. 8</A>),

 yet he presently gives this proof of his love to them. Our infirmities
 are foils to Christ's kindnesses, and set them off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He chose this time to do it, a little before his last passover, for 
 two reasons:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Because now <I>he knew that his hour was come,</I> which he had 
 long expected, <I>when he should depart out of this world to the 
 Father.</I> Observe here, 

 [1.] The change that was to pass over our Lord Jesus; he must 
 <I>depart.</I> This began at his death, but was completed at his 
 ascension. As Christ himself, so all believers, by virtue of their 
 union with him, when they depart out of the world, are absent from the 
 body, <I>go to the Father,</I> are present with the Lord. It is a 
 departure <I>out of the world,</I> this unkind, injurious world, this 
 faithless, treacherous world--this world of labour, toil, and 
 temptation--this vale of tears; and it is a going <I>to the Father,</I> 
 to the vision of the Father of spirits, and the fruition of him as 
 ours. 

 [2.] The time of this change: <I>His hour was come.</I> It is sometimes 
 called his enemies' hour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:53">Luke xxii. 53</A>),

 the hour of their triumph; sometimes his hour, the hour of his triumph, 
 the hour he had had in his eye all along. The time of his sufferings 
 was fixed to an hour, and the continuance of them but for an hour.

 [3.] His foresight of it: He <I>knew that his hour was come;</I> he 
 knew from the beginning that it would come, and when, but now he knew 
 that it <I>was come.</I> We know not when our hour will come, and 
 therefore what we have to do in habitual preparation for it ought never 
 to be undone; but, when we know by the harbingers that our hour is 
 come, we must vigorously apply ourselves to an actual preparation, as 
 our Master did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:14">2 Pet. iii. 14</A>.

 Now it was in the immediate foresight of his departure that he
 <I>washed his disciples' feet;</I> that, as his own head was anointed 
 just now <I>against the day of his burial,</I> so their feet might be 
 washed against the day of their consecration by the descent of the Holy 
 Ghost fifty days after, as the priests were washed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+8:6">Lev. viii. 6</A>.

 When we see our day approaching, we should do what good we can to those 
 we leave behind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Because the <I>devil had now put it into the heart of Judas to 
 betray him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 These words in a parenthesis may be considered,

 [1.] As tracing Judas's treason to its origin; it was a sin of such a 
 nature that it evidently bore the devil's image and superscription. 
 What way of access the devil has to men's hearts, and by what methods 
 he darts in his suggestions, and mingles them undiscerned with those 
 thoughts which are the natives of the heart, we cannot tell. But there 
 are some sins in their own nature so exceedingly sinful, and to which 
 there is so little temptation from the world and the flesh, that it is 
 plain Satan lays the egg of them in a heart disposed to be the nest to 
 hatch them in. For Judas to betray such a master, to betray him so 
 cheaply and upon no provocation, was such downright enmity to God as 
 could not be forged but by Satan himself, who thereby thought to ruin 
 the Redeemer's kingdom, but did in fact ruin his own. 

 [2.] As intimating a reason why Christ now washed his disciples' feet.
 <I>First,</I> Judas being now resolved to betray him, the time of his 
 departure could not be far off; if this matter be determined, it is 
 easy to infer with St. Paul, <I>I am now ready to be offered.</I> Note, 
 The more malicious we perceive our enemies to be against us, the more 
 industrious we should be to prepare for the worst that may come.
 <I>Secondly,</I> Judas being now got into the snare, and the devil 
 aiming at Peter and the rest of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:31">Luke xxii. 31</A>),

 Christ would fortify his own against him. If the wolf has seized one of 
 the flock, it is time for the shepherd to look well to the rest. 
 Antidotes must be stirring, when the infection is begun. Dr. Lightfoot 
 observes that the disciples had learned of Judas to murmur at the 
 anointing of Christ; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:4,Mt+26:8"><I>ch.</I> xii. 4, &c. with Matt. xxvi. 8</A>.

 Now, lest those that had learned that of him should learn worse, he
 fortifies them by a lesson of humility against his most dangerous 
 assaults. <I>Thirdly,</I> Judas, who was now plotting to betray him, 
 was <I>one of the twelve.</I> Now Christ would hereby show that he did 
 not design to cast them all off for the faults of one. Though one of 
 their college had a devil, and was a traitor, yet they should fare 
 never the worse for that. Christ loves his church though there are 
 hypocrites in it, and had still a kindness for his disciples though 
 there was a Judas among them and he knew it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ washed his disciples' feet that he might give an instance of 
 his own wonderful humility, and show how lowly and condescending he 
 was, and let all the world know how low he could stoop in love to his 
 own. This is intimated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.

 <I>Jesus knowing,</I> and now actually considering, and perhaps 
 discoursing of, his honours as Mediator, and telling his friends that 
 <I>the Father had given all things into his hand, rises from 
 supper,</I> and, to the great surprise of the company, who wondered 
 what he was going to do, <I>washed his disciples' feet.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is the rightful advancement of the Lord Jesus. Glorious things 
 are here said of Christ as Mediator.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>The Father had given all things into his hands;</I> had given 
 him a propriety in all, and a power over all, as possessor of heaven 
 and earth, in pursuance of the great designs of his undertaking; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Matt. xi. 27</A>.

 The accommodation and arbitration of all matters in variance between
 God and man were committed into his hands as the great umpire and 
 referee; and the administration of the kingdom of God among men, in all 
 the branches of it, was committed to him; so that all acts, both of 
 government and judgment, were to pass through his hands; he is <I>heir 
 of all things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He <I>came from God.</I> This implies that he was in the beginning 
 with God, and had a being and glory, not only before he was born into 
 this world, but before the world itself was born; and that when he came 
 into the world he came as God's ambassador, with a commission from him. 
 He came from God as the son of God, and the sent of God. The 
 Old-Testament prophets were raised up and employed for God, but Christ 
 came directly from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He <I>went to God,</I> to be glorified with him with the same
 glory which he had with God from eternity. That which comes from God 
 shall go to God; those that are born from heaven are bound for heaven. 
 As Christ came from God to be an agent for him on earth, so he went to 
 God to be an agent for us in heaven; and it is a comfort to us to think 
 how welcome he was there: he was brought near to the <I>Ancient of 
 days,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13">Dan. vii. 13</A>.

 And it was said to him, <I>Sit thou at my right hand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He <I>knew</I> all this; was not like a prince in the cradle, that 
 knows nothing of the honour he is born to, or like Moses, who <I>wist 
 not that his face shone;</I> no, he had a full view of all the honours 
 of his exalted state, and yet stooped thus low. But how does this come 
 in here? 

 [1.] As an inducement to him now quickly to leave what lessons and
 legacies he had to leave to his disciples, because his hour was now 
 come when he must take his leave of them, and be exalted above that 
 familiar converse which he now had with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 [2.] It may come in as that which supported him under his sufferings, 
 and carried him cheerfully through this sharp encounter. Judas was now 
 betraying him, and he knew it, and knew what would be the consequence 
 of it; yet, knowing also <I>that he came from God and went to God,</I> 
 he did not draw back, but went on cheerfully. 

 [3.] It seems to come in as a foil to his condescension, to make it the 
 more admirable. The reasons of divine grace are sometimes represented 
 in scripture as strange and surprising (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:17,18,Ho+2:13,14">Isa. lvii. 17, 18; 
 Hos. ii. 13, 14</A>);

 so here, that is given as an inducement to Christ to stoop which should 
 rather have been a reason for his taking state; for God's thoughts are 
 not as ours. Compare with this those passages which preface the most
 signal instances of condescending grace with the displays of divine 
 glory, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:4,5,Isa+57:15,66:1,2">Ps. lxviii. 4, 5; 
 Isa. lvii. 15; lxvi. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is the voluntary abasement of our Lord Jesus notwithstanding 
 this. <I>Jesus knowing</I> his own glory as God, and his own authority 
 and power as Mediator, one would think it should follow, <I>He rises 
 from supper,</I> lays aside his ordinary garments, calls for robes, 
 bids them keep their distance, and do him homage; but no, quite the 
 contrary, when he considered this he gave the greatest instance of 
 humility. Note, A well-grounded assurance of heaven and happiness, 
 instead of puffing a man up with pride, will make and keep him very 
 humble. Those that would be found conformable to Christ, and partakers 
 of his Spirit, must study to keep their minds low in the midst of the 
 greatest advancements. Now that which Christ humbled himself to was to 
 <I>wash his disciples' feet.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The action itself was mean and servile, and that which servants of 
 the lowest rank were employed in. <I>Let thine handmaid</I> (saith 
 Abigail) <I>be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my 
 lord;</I> let me be in the meanest employment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:41">1 Sam. xxv. 41</A>.

 If he had washed their hands or faces, it had been great condescension 
 (Elisha poured water on the hands of Elijah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:11">2 Kings iii. 11</A>);

 but for Christ to stoop to such a piece of drudgery as this may well 
 excite our admiration. Thus he would teach us to think nothing below us 
 wherein we may be serviceable to God's glory and the good of our 
 brethren.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The condescension was so much the greater that he did this for his 
 own disciples, who in themselves were of a low and despicable 
 condition, not curious about their bodies; their feet, it is likely, 
 were seldom washed, and therefore very dirty. In relation to him, they 
 were his scholars, his servants, and such as should have washed his 
 feet, whose dependence was upon him, and their expectations from him. 
 Many of great spirits otherwise will do a mean thing to curry favour 
 with their superiors; they rise by stooping, and climb by cringing; but 
 for Christ to do this to <I>his disciples</I> could be no act of policy 
 nor complaisance, but pure humility.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He <I>rose from supper</I> to do it. Though we translate it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)
 
 <I>supper being ended,</I> it might be better read, <I>there being a 
 supper made,</I> or <I>he being at supper,</I> for he sat down again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 and we find him dipping a sop 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 so that he did it in the midst of his meal, and thereby taught us,

 [1.] Not to reckon it a disturbance, nor any just cause of uneasiness, 
 to be called from our meal to do God or our brother any real service, 
 esteeming the discharge of our duty <I>more than our necessary 
 food,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:34"><I>ch.</I> iv. 34</A>.

 Christ would not leave his preaching to oblige his nearest relations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:33">Mark iii. 33</A>),

 but would leave his supper to show his love to his disciples.

 [2.] Not to be over nice about our meat. It would have turned many a
 squeamish stomach to wash dirty feet at supper-time; but Christ did it, 
 not that we might learn to be rude and slovenly (cleanliness and 
 godliness will do well together), but to teach us not to be curious, 
 not to indulge, but mortify, the delicacy of the appetite, giving good 
 manners their due place, and no more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He put himself into the garb of a servant, to do it: he <I>laid 
 aside</I> his loose and upper <I>garments,</I> that he might apply 
 himself to this service the more expeditely. We must address ourselves 
 to duty as those that are resolved not to take state, but to take 
 pains; we must divest ourselves of every thing that would either feed 
 our pride or hang in our way and hinder us in what we have to do, must 
 <I>gird up the loins of our mind,</I> as those that in earnest buckle 
 to business.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) He did it with all the humble ceremony that could be, went through 
 all the parts of the service distinctly, and passed by none of them; he 
 did it as if he had been used thus to serve; did it himself alone, and 
 had none to minister to him in it. He <I>girded himself with the
 towel,</I> as servants throw a napkin on their arm, or put an apron 
 before them; he <I>poured water into the basin</I> out of the 
 water-pots that stood by 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:6"><I>ch.</I> ii. 6</A>),

 and then <I>washed their feet;</I> and, to complete the service,
 <I>wiped them.</I> Some think that he did not wash the feet of them 
 all, but only four or five of them, that being thought sufficient to 
 answer the end; but I see nothing to countenance this conjecture, for 
 in other places where he did make a difference it is taken notice of; 
 and his washing the feet of them <I>all,</I> without exception, teaches 
 us a catholic and extensive charity to all Christ's disciples, even the 
 least.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Nothing appears to the contrary but that he washed the feet of 
 Judas among the rest, for he was present, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 It is the character of a <I>widow indeed</I> that she had washed the 
 saints' feet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:10">1 Tim. v. 10</A>),

 and there is some comfort in this; but the blessed Jesus here washed 
 the feet of a sinner, the worst of sinners, the worst to him, who was 
 at this time contriving to betray him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Many interpreters consider Christ's washing his disciples' feet as a 
 representation of <I>his whole undertaking.</I> He knew that he was 
 equal with God, and all things were his; and yet he rose from his table 
 in glory, laid aside his robes of light, girded himself with our 
 nature, took upon him the form of a servant, <I>came not to be 
 ministered to, but to minister,</I> poured out his blood, poured out 
 his soul unto death, and thereby prepared a laver to wash us from our 
 sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5">Rev. i. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ washed his disciples' feet that he might signify to them 
 spiritual washing, and the cleansing of the soul from the pollutions of 
 sin. This is plainly intimated in his discourse with Peter upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:6-11"><I>v.</I> 6-11</A>,
 
 in which we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The surprise Peter was in when he saw his Master go about this mean 
 service 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Then cometh he to Simon Peter,</I> with his towel and basin, and 
 bids him put out his feet to be washed. Chrysostom conjectures that he 
 first washed the feet of Judas, who readily admitted the honour, and 
 was pleased to see his Master so disparage himself. It is most probable 
 that when he <I>went about</I> this service (which is all that is meant
 by his <I>beginning</I> to wash, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 he took Peter first, and that the rest would not have suffered it, if 
 they had not first heard it explained in what passed between Christ and 
 Peter. Whether Christ came first to Peter or no, when he did come to 
 him, Peter was startled at the proposal: <I>Lord</I> (saith he) <I>dost 
 thou wash my feet?</I> Here is an emphasis to be laid upon the persons, 
 <I>thou</I> and <I>me;</I> and the placing of the words is observable, 
 <B><I>sy mou</I></B>--<I>what, thou mine? Tu mihi lavas pedes? Quid est 
 tu? Quid est mihi? Cogitanda sunt potius quam dicenda--Dost thou wash 
 my feet? What is it thou? What to me? These things are rather to be
 contemplated than uttered.</I>--Aug. in loc. What <I>thou,</I> our
 Lord and Master, whom we know and believe to be the Son of God, and 
 Saviour and ruler of the world, do this for <I>me,</I> a worthless worm 
 of the earth, <I>a sinful man, O Lord?</I> Shall those hands wash my 
 feet which with a touch have cleansed lepers, given sight to the blind, 
 and raised the dead? So Theophylact, and from him Dr. Taylor. Very 
 willingly would Peter have taken the basin and towel, and washed his 
 Master's feet, and been proud of the honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:7,8">Luke xvii. 7, 8</A>.

 "This had been natural and regular; for <I>my Master</I> to wash my
 feet is such a solecism as never was; such a paradox as I cannot 
 understand. <I>Is this the manner of men?</I>" Note, Christ's 
 condescensions, especially his condescensions to <I>us,</I> wherein we 
 find ourselves taken notice of by his grace, are justly the matter of 
 our admiration,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:22"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 22</A>.

 <I>Who am I, Lord God? And what is my father's house?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The immediate satisfaction Christ gave to this question of surprise. 
 This was at least sufficient to silence his objections 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.</I> 
 Here are two reasons why Peter must submit to what Christ was 
 doing:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Because he was at present in the dark concerning it, and ought not 
 to oppose what he did not understand, but acquiesce in the will and 
 wisdom of one who could give a good reason for all he said and did. 
 Christ would teach Peter an <I>implicit obedience: "What I do thou 
 knowest not now,</I> and therefore art no competent judge of it, but 
 must believe it is well done because I do it." Note, Consciousness to 
 ourselves of the darkness we labour under, and our inability to judge 
 of what God does, should make us sparing and modest in our censures of 
 his proceedings; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:8">Heb. xi. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Because there was something considerable in it, of which he should 
 hereafter know the meaning: "<I>Thou shalt know hereafter</I> what need 
 thou hast of being washed, when thou shalt be guilty of the heinous sin 
 of denying me;" so some. "Thou shalt know, when, in the discharge of 
 the office of an apostle, thou wilt be employed in washing off from 
 those under thy charge the sins and defilements of their earthly 
 affections;" so Dr. Hammond. Note, 

 [1.] Our Lord Jesus does many things the meaning of which even his own 
 disciples do not for the present know, but they <I>shall know 
 afterwards.</I> What he did when he became man for us and what he did 
 when he became a worm and no man for us, what he did when he lived our 
 life and what he did when he laid it down, could not be understood till 
 afterwards, and then it appeared that <I>it behoved him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:17">Heb. ii. 17</A>.
 
 Subsequent providences explain preceding ones; and we see afterwards
 what was the kind tendency of events that seemed most cross; and the 
 way which we thought was <I>about</I> proved the <I>right way.</I> 

 [2.] Christ's washing his disciples' feet had a significancy in it, 
 which they themselves did not understand till afterwards, when Christ 
 explained it to be a specimen of the laver of regeneration, and till 
 the Spirit was poured out upon them from on high. We must let Christ 
 take his own way, both in ordinances and providences, and we shall find 
 in the issue it was the best way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Peter's peremptory refusal, notwithstanding this, to let Christ wash 
 his feet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt by no means wash my feet; no, never.</I> So it is in the 
 original. It is the language of a fixed resolution. Now,

 (1.) Here was a show of humility and modesty. Peter herein seemed to 
 have, and no doubt he really had, a great respect for his Master, as he 
 had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:8">Luke v. 8</A>.

 Thus many are beguiled of their reward in a <I>voluntary humility</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:18,23">Col. ii. 18, 23</A>),

 such a self-denial as Christ neither appoints nor accepts; for, 

 (2.) Under this show of humility there was a real contradiction to the 
 will of the Lord Jesus: "I <I>will wash thy feet,</I>" saith Christ; 
 "But thou never shalt," saith Peter, "it is not a fitting thing;" so 
 making himself wiser than Christ. It is not humility, but infidelity, 
 to put away the offers of the gospel, as if too rich to be made to us 
 or too good news to be true.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Christ's insisting upon his offer, and a good reason given to Peter 
 why he should accept it: <I>If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with 
 me.</I> This may be taken, 

 (1.) As a severe caution against disobedience: "<I>If I wash thee 
 not,</I> if thou continue refractory, and wilt not comply with thy 
 Master's will in so small a matter, thou shalt not be owned as one of 
 my disciples, but be justly discarded and cashiered for not observing 
 orders." Thus several of the ancients understand it; if Peter will make 
 himself wiser than his Master, and dispute the commands he ought to 
 obey, he does in effect renounce his allegiance, and say, as they did, 
 <I>What portion have we in David,</I> in the Son of David? And so shall 
 his doom be, he shall have no part in him. Let him use no more manners 
 than will do him good, for <I>to obey is better than sacrifice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:22">1 Sam. xv. 22</A>.
 
 Or,

 (2.) As a declaration of the necessity of spiritual washing; and so I
 think it is to be understood: "<I>If I wash not</I> thy soul from the 
 pollution of sin, <I>thou hast no part with me,</I> no interest in me, 
 no communion with me, no benefit by me." Note, All those, and those 
 only, that are spiritually washed by Christ, have a part in Christ.

 [1.] To have a part in Christ, or with Christ, has all the happiness of 
 a Christian bound up in it, to be <I>partakers of Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:14">Heb. iii. 14</A>),

 to share in those inestimable privileges which result from a union with 
 him and relation to him. It is that <I>good part</I> the having of 
 which is the <I>one thing needful.</I>

 [2.] It is necessary to our having a part in Christ that he wash us. 
 All those whom Christ owns and saves he justifies and sanctifies, and 
 both are included in his washing them. We cannot partake of his glory 
 if we partake not of his merit and righteousness, and of his Spirit and 
 grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Peter's more than submission, his earnest request, to be washed by 
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 If this be the meaning of it, <I>Lord, wash not my feet only, but also 
 my hands and my head.</I> How soon is Peter's mind changed! When the 
 mistake of his understanding was rectified, the corrupt resolution of 
 his will was soon altered. Let us therefore not be peremptory in any 
 resolve (except in our resolve to follow Christ), because we may soon 
 see cause to retract it, but cautious in taking up a purpose we will be 
 tenacious of. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How ready Peter is to recede from what he had said: "Lord, what a 
 fool was I to speak such a hasty word!" Now that the washing of him 
 appeared to be an act of Christ's authority and grace he admits it; but 
 disliked when it seemed only an act of humiliation. Note, 

 [1.] Good men, when they see their error, will not be loth to recant 
 it. 
 
 [2.] Sooner or later, Christ will bring all to be of his mind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How importunate he is for the purifying grace of the Lord Jesus, 
 and the universal influence of it, even upon his hands and head. Note, 
 A divorce from Christ, and an exclusion from having a part in him, is 
 the most formidable evil in the eyes of all that are enlightened, for 
 the fear of which they will be persuaded to any thing. And for fear of 
 this we should be earnest with God in prayer, that he will wash us, 
 will justify and sanctify us. "Lord, that I may not be cut off from 
 thee, make me fit for thee, by the washing of regeneration. <I>Lord, 
 wash not my feet only</I> from the gross pollutions that cleave to 
 them, <I>but also my hands and my head</I> from the spots which they 
 have contracted, and the undiscerned filth which proceeds by 
 perspiration from the body itself." Note, Those who truly desire to be 
 sanctified desire to be sanctified throughout, and to have the whole 
 man, with all its parts and powers, purified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:23">1 Thess. v. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Christ's further explication of this sign, as it represented 
 spiritual washing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) With reference to his disciples that were faithful to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 <I>He that is washed</I> all over in the bath (as was frequently
 practised in those countries), when he returns to his house, <I>needeth 
 not save to wash his feet,</I> his hands and head having been washed, 
 and he having only dirtied his feet in walking home. Peter had gone 
 from one extreme to the other. At first he would not let Christ wash 
 his feet; and now he overlooks what Christ had done for him in his 
 baptism, and what was signified thereby, and cries out to have his 
 hands and head washed. Now Christ directs him into the meaning; he must 
 have his feet washed, but not his hands and head. 

 [1.] See here what is the comfort and privilege of such as are in a 
 justified state; they are washed by Christ, and are <I>clean every 
 whit,</I> that is, they are graciously accepted of God, as if they were 
 so; and, though they offend, yet they need not, upon their repentance, 
 be again put into a justified state, for then should they often be 
 baptized. The evidence of a justified state may be clouded, and the 
 comfort of it suspended, when yet the charter of it is not vacated or 
 taken away. Though we have occasion to repent daily, God's gifts and 
 callings are without repentance. The heart may be swept and garnished, 
 and yet still remain the devil's palace; but, if it be washed, it 
 belongs to Christ, and he will not lose it. 

 [2.] See what ought to be the daily care of those who through grace are 
 in a justified state, and that is to wash their feet; to cleanse 
 themselves from the guilt they contract daily through infirmity and 
 inadvertence, by the renewed exercise of repentance, with a believing 
 application of the virtue of Christ's blood. We must also wash our feet 
 by constant watchfulness against every thing that is defiling, for we 
 must cleanse our way, and cleanse our feet <I>by taking heed 
 thereto,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:9">Ps. cxix. 9</A>.

 The priests, when they were consecrated, were washed with water; and,
 though they did not need afterwards to be so washed all over, yet, 
 whenever they went in to minister, they must wash their feet and hands 
 at the laver, on pain of death,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:19,20">Exod. xxx. 19, 20</A>.

 The provision made for our cleansing should not make us presumptuous,
 but the more cautious. <I>I have washed my feet, how shall I defile 
 them?</I> From yesterday's pardon, we should fetch an argument against 
 this day's temptation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) With reflection upon Judas: <I>And you are clean, but not all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 He pronounces his disciples clean, clean <I>through the word he had 
 spoken to them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:3"><I>ch.</I> xv. 3</A>.

 He washed them himself, and then said, <I>You are clean;</I> but he
 excepts Judas: <I>not all;</I> they were all baptized, even Judas, yet
 not all clean; many have the sign that have not the thing signified.
 Note, 

 [1.] Even among those who are called disciples of Christ, and profess 
 relation to him, there are some who are not clean,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:12">Prov. xxx. 12</A>.
 
 [2.] The Lord knows those that are his, and those that are not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:19">2 Tim. ii. 19</A>.

 The eye of Christ can separate between the precious and the vile, the
 clean and the unclean. 

 [3.] When those that have called themselves disciples afterwards prove 
 traitors, their apostasy at last is a certain evidence of their 
 hypocrisy all along. 

 [4.] Christ sees it necessary to let his disciples know that they are 
 not all clean; that we may all be jealous over ourselves (<I>Is it I? 
 Lord, is it I</I> that am among the clean, yet not clean?) and that, 
 when hypocrites are discovered, it may be no surprise nor stumbling to 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ washed his disciples' feet to set before us an example. This 
 explication he gave of what he had done, when he had done it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:12-17"><I>v.</I> 12-17</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. With what solemnity he gave an account of the meaning of what he had 
 done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>After he had washed their feet,</I> he said, <I>Know you what I have 
 done?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He adjourned the explication till he had finished the transaction, 
 
 [1.] To try their submission and implicit obedience. What he did they 
 should not know till afterwards, that they might learn to acquiesce in 
 his will when they could not give a reason for it. 

 [2.] Because it was proper to finish the riddle before he unriddled it. 
 Thus, as to his whole undertaking, when his sufferings were finished, 
 when he had resumed the garments of his exalted state and was ready to 
 sit down again, then he <I>opened the understandings of his 
 disciples,</I> and poured out his Spirit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:45,46">Luke xxiv. 45, 46</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Before he explained it, he asked them if they could construe it: 
 <I>Know you what I have done to you?</I> He put this question to them, 
 not only to make them sensible of their ignorance, and the need they 
 had to be instructed (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:5,13">Zech. iv. 5, 13</A>,

 <I>Knowest thou not what these be? and I said, No, my Lord</I>), but to 
 raise their desires and expectations of instruction: "I <I>would have 
 you know,</I> and, if you will give attention, I will tell you." Note, 
 It is the will of Christ that sacramental signs should be explained, 
 and that his people should be acquainted with the meaning of them; 
 otherwise, though ever so significant, to those who know not the thing 
 signified they are insignificant. Hence they are directed to ask, 
 <I>What mean you by this service?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:26">Exod. xii. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Upon what he grounds that which he had to say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>You call me Master and Lord,</I> you give me those titles, in 
 speaking of me, in speaking to me, and <I>you say well,</I> for <I>so I 
 am;</I> you are in the relation of scholars to me, and I do the part of 
 a master to you." Note, 

 (1.) Jesus Christ is our Master and Lord; he that is our Redeemer and 
 Saviour is, in order to that, our Lord and Master. He is our Master, 
 <B><I>didaskalos</I></B>--our teacher and instructor in all necessary 
 truths and rules, as a prophet revealing to us the will of God. He is 
 our Lord, <B><I>kyrios</I></B>--our ruler and owner, that has authority 
 over us and propriety in us. 

 (2.) It becomes the disciples of Christ to call him Master and Lord, 
 not in compliment, but in reality; not by constraint, but with delight. 
 Devout Mr. Herbert, when he mentioned the name of Christ, used to add,
 my Master; and thus expresses himself concerning it in one of his 
 poems:</P>

 <CENTER>
 <TABLE BORDER=0>
 <TR><TD> &nbsp; &nbsp; How sweetly doth my Master sound, my Master!
 <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; As ambergris leaves a rich scent unto the taster,
 <BR>So do these words a sweet content, an oriental fragrancy, my Master.</TD></TR>
 </TABLE>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Our calling Christ Master and Lord is an obligation upon us to 
 receive and observe the instruction he gives us. Christ would thus 
 pre-engage their obedience to a command that was displeasing to flesh 
 and blood. If Christ be our Master and Lord, be so by our own consent, 
 and we have often called him so, we are bound in honour and honesty to 
 be observant of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The lesson which he hereby taught: <I>You also ought to wash one 
 another's feet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Some have understood this literally, and have thought these words 
 amount to the institution of a standing ordinance in the church; that 
 Christians should, in a solemn religious manner, <I>wash one another's 
 feet,</I> in token of their condescending love to one another. St. 
 Ambrose took it so, and practised it in the church of Milan. St. Austin 
 saith that those Christians who did not do it with their hands, yet (he 
 hoped) did it with their hearts in humility; but he saith, It is much 
 better to do it with the hands also, when there is occasion, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:10">1 Tim. v. 10</A>.

 What Christ has done Christians should not disdain to do. Calvin saith
 that the pope, in the annual observance of this ceremony on Thursday in 
 the passion week, is rather Christ's ape than his follower, for the 
 duty enjoined, in conformity to Christ, was <I>mutual: Wash one 
 another's feet.</I> And Jansenius saith, It is done, <I>Frigid&egrave; 
 et dissimiliter--Frigidly, and unlike the primitive model.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) But doubtless it is to be understood figuratively; it is an 
 instructive sign, but not sacramental, as the eucharist. This was a 
 parable to the eye; and three things our Master hereby designed to 
 teach us:--

 [1.] A humble condescension. We must learn of our Master to be <I>lowly 
 in heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:29">Matt. xi. 29</A>),

 and walk with all lowliness; we must think meanly of ourselves and 
 respectfully of our brethren, and deem nothing below us but sin; we 
 must say of that which seems mean, but has a tendency to the glory of 
 God and our brethren's good, as David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:22">2 Sam. vi. 22</A>),

 <I>If this be to be vile, I will be yet more vile.</I> Christ had often 
 taught his disciples humility, and they had forgotten the lesson; but 
 now he teaches them in such a way as surely they could never forget.

 [2.] A condescension to be serviceable. To wash one another's feet is 
 to stoop to the meanest offices of love, for the real good and benefit 
 one of another, as blessed Paul, who, though free from all, made 
 himself <I>servant of all;</I> and the blessed Jesus, who <I>came not 
 to be ministered unto, but to minister.</I> We must not grudge to take 
 care and pains, and to spend time, and to diminish ourselves for the 
 good of those to whom we are not under any particular obligations, even 
 of our inferiors, and such as are not in a capacity of making us any 
 requital. Washing the feet after travelling contributes both to the 
 decency of the person and to his ease, so that to wash one another's 
 feet is to consult both the credit and the comfort one of another, to 
 do what we can both to advance our brethren's reputation and to make 
 their minds easy. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:24,Heb+6:10">1 Cor. x. 24; Heb. vi. 10</A>.

 The duty is <I>mutual;</I> we must both accept help from our brethren 
 and afford help to our brethren.

 [3.] A serviceableness to the sanctification one of another: <I>You
 ought to wash one another's feet,</I> from the pollutions of sin. 
 Austin takes it in this sense, and many others. We cannot satisfy for 
 one another's sins, this is peculiar to Christ, but we may help to 
 purify one another from sin. We must in the first place wash ourselves; 
 this charity must begin at home 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:5">Matt. vii. 5</A>),

 but it must not end there; we must sorrow for the failings and follies 
 of our brethren, much more for their gross pollutions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:2">1 Cor. v. 2</A>),

 must wash our brethren's polluted feet in tears. We must faithfully 
 reprove them, and do what we can to bring them to repentance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:1">Gal. vi. 1</A>),

 and we must admonish them, to prevent their falling into the mire; this 
 is washing their feet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Here is the ratifying and enforcing of this command from the example 
 of what Christ had now done: <I>If I your Lord and Master have</I> done 
 it to you, you ought to do it <I>to one another.</I> He shows the 
 cogency of this argument in two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) I am <I>your Master,</I> and you are my disciples, and therefore 
 you ought to <I>learn of me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 for in this, as in other things, <I>I have given you an example,</I> 
 that <I>you should do</I> to others <I>as I have done</I> to you. 
 Observe,

 [1.] What a good teacher Christ is. He teaches by example as well as 
 doctrine, and for this end came into this world, and dwelt among us, 
 that he might set us a copy of all those graces and duties which his 
 holy religion teaches; and it is a copy without one false stroke. 
 Hereby he made his own laws more intelligible and honourable. Christ is 
 a commander like Gideon, who said to his soldiers, <I>Look on me, and 
 do likewise</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:17">Judg. vii. 17</A>);

 like Abimelech, who said, <I>What you have seen me do, make haste and 
 do as I have done</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:48">Judg. ix. 48</A>);

 and like C&aelig;sar, who called his soldiers, not 
 <I>milites--soldiers,</I> but, <I>commilitones--fellow-soldiers,</I> 
 and whose usual word was, not <I>Ite illue,</I> but <I>Venite huc;</I> 
 not <I>Go,</I> but <I>Come.</I>

 [2.] What good scholars we must be. We must <I>do as he hath done;</I> 
 for therefore he gave us a copy, that we should write after it, that we 
 might be as he was in this world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:17">1 John iv. 17</A>),

 and walk <I>as he walked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:6">1 John ii. 6</A>.

 Christ's example here in is to be followed by ministers in particular, 
 in whom the graces of humility and holy love should especially appear, 
 and by the exercise thereof they effectually serve the interests of 
 their Master and the ends of their ministry. When Christ sent his
 apostles abroad as his agents, it was with this charge, that they 
 should not take state upon them, nor carry things with a high hand, but 
 <I>become all things to all men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:22">1 Cor. ix. 22</A>.

 What I have done to your dirty feet that do you to the polluted souls
 of sinners; <I>wash them.</I> Some who suppose this to have been done 
 at the passover supper think it intimates a rule in admitting 
 communicants to the Lord's-supper, to see that they be first washed and 
 cleansed by reformation and a blameless conversation, and then take 
 them in to <I>compass God's altar.</I> But all Christians likewise are 
 here taught to condescend to each other in love, and to do it as Christ 
 did it, unasked, unpaid; we must not be mercenary in the services of 
 love, nor do them with reluctancy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) I am <I>your Master,</I> and you are my disciples, and therefore 
 you cannot think it below you to do that, how mean soever it may seem, 
 which you have seen me do, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 <I>the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is 
 sent,</I> though sent with all the pomp and power of an ambassador, 
 <I>greater than he that sent him.</I> Christ had urged this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:24,25">Matt. x. 24, 25</A>)

 as a reason why they should not think it strange if they suffered as he 
 did; here he urges it as a reason why they should not think it much to 
 humble themselves as he did. What he did not think a disparagement to 
 him, they must not think a disparagement to them. Perhaps the
 disciples were inwardly disgusted at this precept of washing one 
 another's feet, as inconsistent with the dignity they expected shortly 
 to be preferred to. To obviate such thoughts, Christ reminds them of 
 their place as his servants; they were not better men than their 
 Master, and what was consistent with his dignity was much more 
 consistent with theirs. If he was humble and condescending, it ill 
 became them to be proud and assuming. Note,

 [1.] We must take good heed to ourselves, lest Christ's gracious 
 condescensions to us, and advancements of us, through the corruption of 
 nature occasion us to entertain high thoughts of ourselves or low 
 thoughts of him. We need to be put in mind of this, that we are not 
 <I>greater than our Lord.</I> 

 [2.] Whatever our Master was pleased to condescend to in favour to us, 
 we should much more condescend to in conformity to him. Christ, by 
 humbling himself, has dignified humility, and put an honour upon it, 
 and obliged his followers to think nothing below them but sin. We 
 commonly say to those who disdain to do such or such a thing, As good 
 as you have done it, and been never the worse thought of; and true 
 indeed it is, if our Master has done it. When we see our Master 
 serving, we cannot but see how ill it becomes us to be domineering.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that
 the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath
 lifted up his heel against me.
 &nbsp; 19  Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to
 pass, ye may believe that I am <I>he.</I>
 &nbsp; 20  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever
 I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that
 sent me.
 &nbsp; 21  When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and
 testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of
 you shall betray me.
 &nbsp; 22  Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom
 he spake.
 &nbsp; 23  Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples,
 whom Jesus loved.
 &nbsp; 24  Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask
 who it should be of whom he spake.
 &nbsp; 25  He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is
 it?
 &nbsp; 26  Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I
 have dipped <I>it.</I> And when he had dipped the sop, he gave <I>it</I> to
 Judas Iscariot, <I>the son</I> of Simon.
 &nbsp; 27  And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus
 unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.
 &nbsp; 28  Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this
 unto him.
 &nbsp; 29  For some <I>of them</I> thought, because Judas had the bag, that
 Jesus had said unto him, Buy <I>those things</I> that we have need of
 against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.
 &nbsp; 30  He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it
 was night.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the discovery of Judas's plot to betray his Master. Christ 
 knew it from the beginning; but now first he discovered it to his 
 disciples, who did not expect Christ should be betrayed, though he had 
 often told them so, much less did they suspect that one of them should 
 do it. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ gives them a general intimation of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>I speak not of you all,</I> I cannot expect you will all do these 
 things, for <I>I know whom I have chosen,</I> and whom I have passed 
 by; but the scripture will be fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:9">Ps. xli. 9</A>),

 <I>He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.</I> 
 He does not yet speak out, either of the crime or the criminal, but 
 raises their expectations of a further discovery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He intimates to them that they were not all right. He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 <I>You are clean, but not all.</I> So here, <I>I speak not of you 
 all.</I> Note, What is said of the excellencies of Christ's disciples 
 cannot be said of all that are called so. The word of Christ is a 
 distinguishing word, which separates <I>between cattle and cattle,</I> 
 and will distinguish thousands into hell who flattered themselves with 
 hopes that they were going to heaven. <I>I speak not of you all;</I> 
 you my disciples and followers. Note, There is a mixture of bad with 
 good in the best societies, a Judas among the apostles; it will be so 
 till we come to the blessed society into which shall enter nothing 
 unclean or disguised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he himself knew who were right, and who were not: <I>I know 
 whom I have chosen,</I> who the few are that are chosen among the many 
 that are called with the common call. Note, 

 (1.) Those that are chosen, Christ himself had the choosing of them; he 
 nominated the persons he undertook for. 

 (2.) Those that are chosen are known to Christ, for he never forgets
 any whom he has once had in his thoughts of love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:19">2 Tim. ii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That in the treachery of him that proved false to him the scripture 
 was fulfilled, which takes off very much both the surprise and offence 
 of the thing. Christ took one into his family whom he foresaw to be a 
 traitor, and did not by effectual grace prevent his being so, <I>that 
 the scripture might be fulfilled.</I> Let it not therefore be a 
 stumbling-block to any; for, though it do not at all lessen Judas's 
 offence, it may lessen our offence at it. The scripture referred to is 
 David's complaint of the treachery of some of his enemies; the Jewish 
 expositors, and ours from them generally understand it of Ahithophel: 
 Grotius thinks it intimates that the death of Judas would be like that 
 of Ahithophel. But because that psalm speaks of David's sickness, of 
 which we read nothing at the time of Ahithophel's deserting him, it may 
 better be understood of some other friend of his, that proved false to 
 him. This our Saviour applies to Judas. 

 (1.) Judas, as an apostle, was admitted to the highest privilege: he 
 did <I>eat bread with Christ.</I> He was familiar with him, and 
 favoured by him, was one of his family, one of those with whom he was 
 intimately conversant. David saith of his treacherous friend, He did 
 eat <I>of my bread;</I> but Christ, being poor, had no bread he could 
 properly call his own. He saith, He did <I>eat bread with me;</I> such 
 as he had by the kindness of his friends, that ministered to him, his 
 disciples had their share of, Judas among the rest. Wherever he went, 
 Judas was welcome with him, did not dine among servants, but sat at 
 table with his Master, ate of the same dish, drank of the same cup, and 
 in all respects fared as he fared. He ate miraculous bread with him, 
 when the loaves were multiplied, ate the passover with him. Note, All 
 that eat bread with Christ are not his disciples indeed. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:3-5">1 Cor. x. 3-5</A>.

 (2.) Judas, as an apostate, was guilty of the basest treachery: he 
 <I>lifted up the heel</I> against Christ.

 [1.] He forsook him, turned his back upon him, went out from the
 society of his disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 [2.] He despised him, shook off the dust of his feet against him, in 
 contempt of him and his gospel. Nay, 

 [3.] He became an enemy to him; spurned at him, as wrestlers do at 
 their adversaries, whom they would overthrow. Note, It is no new thing 
 for those that were Christ's seeming friends to prove his real enemies.
 Those who pretended to magnify him magnify themselves against him, and 
 thereby prove themselves guilty, not only of the basest ingratitude, 
 but the basest treachery and perfidiousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives them a reason why he told them beforehand of the treachery 
 of Judas 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>Now I tell you before it come,</I> before Judas has begun to put 
 his wicked plot in execution, <I>that when it is come to pass you 
 may,</I> instead of stumbling at it, be confirmed in your <I>belief 
 that I am he,</I> he that should come." 

 1. By his clear and certain foresight of things to come, of which in 
 this, as in other instances, he gave incontestable proof, he proved 
 himself to be the true God, before whom all things are naked and open. 
 Christ foretold that Judas would betray him when there was no ground to 
 suspect such a thing, and so proved himself the eternal Word, which is 
 a <I>discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</I> The 
 prophecies of the New Testament concerning the apostasy of the latter 
 times (which we have,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1-17,1Ti+4:1-16">2 Thess. ii.; 1 Tim. iv.</A>,

 and in the Apocalypse) being evidently accomplished is a proof that
 those writings were divinely inspired, and confirms our faith in the 
 whole canon of scripture. 

 2. By this application of the types and prophecies of the Old Testament 
 to himself, he proved himself to be the true Messiah, to whom <I>all 
 the prophets bore witness.</I> Thus <I>it was written, and thus it 
 behoved Christ to suffer,</I> and he suffered just as it was written,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:25,26,Joh+8:28">Luke xxiv. 25, 26; 
 <I>ch.</I> viii. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives a word of encouragement to his apostles, and all his 
 ministers whom he employs in his service 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me.</I> The purport of 
 these words is the same with what we have in other scriptures, but it 
 is not easy to make out their coherence here. Christ had told his 
 disciples that they must humble and abase themselves. "Now," saith he, 
 "though there may be those that will despise you for your 
 condescension, yet there will be those that will do you honour, and 
 shall be honoured for so doing." Those who know themselves dignified by 
 Christ's commission may be content to be vilified in the world's 
 opinion. Or, he intended to silence the scruples of those who, because 
 there was a traitor among the apostles, would be shy of receiving any 
 of them; for, if one of them was false to his Master, to whom would any 
 of them be true? <I>Ex uno disce omnes--They are all alike.</I> No, as 
 Christ will think never the worse of them for Judas's crime, so he will 
 stand by them, and own them, and will raise up such as shall receive 
 them. Those that had received Judas when he was a preacher, and perhaps 
 were converted and edified by his preaching, were never the worse, nor 
 should reflect upon it with any regret, though he afterwards proved a 
 traitor; for he was one whom Christ sent. We cannot know what men are, 
 much less what they will be, but those who appear to be sent of Christ 
 we must receive, till the contrary appear. Though some, by entertaining 
 strangers, have entertained robbers unawares, yet we must still be 
 hospitable, for thereby some have entertained angels. The abuses put 
 upon our charity, though ordered with ever so much discretion, will 
 neither justify our uncharitableness, nor lose us the reward of our 
 charity. 

 1. We are here encouraged to receive ministers as <I>sent of Christ: 
 "He that receiveth whomsoever I send,</I> though weak and poor, and 
 subject to like passions as others (for as the law, so the gospel, 
 <I>makes men priests that have infirmity</I>), yet if he deliver my 
 message, and be regularly called and appointed to do so, and as an 
 officer give himself to the word and prayer, he that entertains him 
 shall be owned as a friend of mine." Christ was now leaving the world, 
 but he would leave an order of men to be his agents, to deliver his 
 word, and those who receive <I>this,</I> in the light and love of it, 
 receive <I>him.</I> To believe the doctrine of Christ, and obey his 
 law, and accept the salvation offered upon the terms proposed; this is 
 receiving those whom Christ sends, and it is <I>receiving Christ Jesus 
 the Lord</I> himself.

 2. We are here encouraged to receive Christ as sent of God: <I>He 
 that</I> thus <I>receiveth me,</I> that receiveth Christ in his 
 ministers, receiveth the Father also, for they come upon his errand 
 likewise, baptizing in the name of the Father, as well as of the Son.
 Or, in general, <I>He that receiveth me</I> as his prince and Saviour 
 receiveth <I>him that sent me</I> as his portion and felicity. Christ
 was sent of God, and in embracing his religion we embrace the <I>only 
 true</I> religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ more particularly notifies to them the plot which one of 
 their number was now hatching against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>When Jesus had thus said</I> in general, to prepare them for a more 
 particular discovery, he was <I>troubled in spirit,</I> and showed it 
 by some gesture or sign, and <I>he testified,</I> he solemnly declared 
 it (<I>cum animo testandi--with the solemnity of a witness on oath), 
 "One of you shall betray me;</I> one of you my apostles and constant 
 followers." None indeed could be said to <I>betray</I> him but those in 
 whom he reposed a confidence, and who were the witnesses of his 
 retirements. This did not determine Judas to the sin by any fatal 
 necessity; for, though the event did follow according to the 
 prediction, yet not from the prediction. Christ is not the author of 
 sin; yet as to this heinous sin of Judas, 

 1. Christ foresaw it; for even that which is secret and future, and
 hidden from the eyes of all living, naked and open before the eyes of 
 Christ. He <I>knows what is in men</I> better than they do themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:12">2 Kings viii. 12</A>),

 and therefore sees what will be done by them. <I>I knew that thou 
 wouldest deal very treacherously,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:8">Isa. xlviii. 8</A>.

 2. He foretold it, not only for the sake of the rest of the disciples, 
 but for the sake of Judas himself, that he might take warning, and 
 recover himself out of the snare of the devil. Traitors proceed not in 
 their plots when they find they are discovered; surely Judas, when he 
 finds that his Master knows his design, will retreat in time; if not, 
 it will aggravate his condemnation. 

 3. He spoke of it with a manifest concern; he was <I>troubled in
 spirit</I> when he mentioned it. He had often spoken of his own 
 sufferings and death, without any such trouble of spirit as he here 
 manifested when he spoke of the ingratitude and treachery of Judas. 
 This touched him in a tender part. Note, The falls and miscarriages of 
 the disciples of Christ are a great trouble of spirit to their Master; 
 the sins of Christians are the grief of Christ. "What! <I>One of you
 betray me?</I> You that have received from me such distinguishing 
 favours; you that I had reason to think would be firm to me, that have 
 professed such a respect for me; what iniquity have you found in me 
 that one of you should betray me?" This went to his heart, as the 
 undutifulness of children grieves those who have <I>nourished and 
 brought them up,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:2">Isa. i. 2</A>.
 
 See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:10,Isa+63:10">
 Ps. xcv. 10; Isa. liii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The disciples quickly take the alarm. They knew their Master would 
 neither deceive them nor jest with them; and therefore <I>looked one 
 upon another,</I> with a manifest concern, <I>doubting of whom he 
 spake.</I> 

 1. By looking one upon another they evinced the trouble they were in
 upon this notice given them; it struck such a horror upon them that 
 they knew not well which way to look, nor what to say. They saw their 
 Master troubled, and therefore they were troubled. This was at a feast 
 where they were cheerfully entertained; but hence we must be taught to 
 rejoice with trembling, and as though we rejoiced not. When David wept 
 for his son's rebellion, all his followers wept with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:30">2 Sam. xv. 30</A>);

 so Christ's disciples here. Note, That which grieves Christ is, and 
 should be, a grief to all that are his, particularly the scandalous 
 miscarriages of those that are called by his name: <I>Who is offended, 
 and I burn not?</I> 

 2. Hereby they endeavoured to <I>discover</I> the traitor. They looked
 wistfully in one another's face, to see who blushed, or, by some 
 disorder in the countenance, manifested guilt in the heart, upon this 
 notice; but, while those who were faithful had their consciences so 
 clear that they could <I>lift up their faces without spot,</I> he that 
 was false had his conscience so seared that he was not ashamed, neither 
 could he blush, and so no discovery could be made in this way. Christ 
 thus perplexed his disciples for a time, and put them into confusion, 
 that he might <I>humble them, and prove them,</I> might excite in them 
 a jealousy of themselves, and an indignation at the baseness of Judas. 
 It is good for us sometimes to be put to a gaze, to be put to a 
 pause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The disciples were solicitous to get their Master to explain 
 himself, and to tell them particularly whom he meant; for nothing but 
 this can put them out of their present pain, for each of them thought 
 he had as much reason to suspect himself as any of his brethren; 
 now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Of all the disciples John was most fit to ask, because he was the 
 favourite, and sat next his Master 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>There was leaning on Jesus's bosom one of the disciples whom Jesus 
 loved.</I> It appears that this was John, by comparing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:20,24"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 20, 24</A>.

 Observe, 

 (1.) The particular kindness which Jesus had for him; he was known by 
 this periphrasis, that he was <I>the disciple whom Jesus loved.</I> He 
 loved them all 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 but John was particularly dear to him. His name signifies 
 <I>gracious.</I> Daniel, who was honoured with the revelations of the 
 Old Testament, as John of the New, was <I>a man greatly beloved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:23">Dan. ix. 23</A>.

 Note, Among the disciples of Christ some are dearer to him than others.
 
 (2.) His place and posture at this time: He was <I>leaning on Jesus's 
 bosom.</I> Some say that it was the fashion in those countries to sit 
 at meat in a leaning posture, so that the second lay in the bosom of 
 the first, and so on, which does not seem probable to me, for in such a 
 posture as this they could neither eat nor drink conveniently; but, 
 whether this was the case or not, John now <I>leaned on Christ's 
 bosom,</I> and it seems to be an extraordinary expression of endearment 
 used at this time. Note, There are some of Christ's disciples whom he 
 lays in his bosom, who have more free and intimate communion with him 
 than others. The Father loved the Son, and laid him <I>in his bosom</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18"><I>ch.</I> i. 18</A>),

 and believers are in like manner one with Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 21</A>.

 This honour all the saints shall have shortly in the bosom of Abraham.
 Those who lay themselves at Christ's feet, he will lay in his bosom. 
 
 (3.) Yet he conceals his name, because he himself was the penman of the 
 story. He put this instead of his name, to show that he was pleased 
 with it; it is his title of honour, that he was <I>the disciple whom 
 Jesus loved,</I> as in David's and Solomon's court there was one that 
 was the <I>king's friend;</I> yet he does not put his name down, to 
 show that he was not proud of it, nor would seem to boast of it. Paul 
 in a like case saith, <I>I knew a man in Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Of all the disciples Peter was most forward to know, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Peter, sitting at some distance, beckoned to John, by some sign or 
 other, to ask. Peter was generally the leading man, most apt to put 
 himself forth; and, where men's natural tempers lead them to be thus 
 bold in answering and asking, if kept under the laws of humility and 
 wisdom, they make men very serviceable. God gives his gifts variously; 
 but that the forward men in the church may not think too well of 
 themselves, nor the modest be discouraged, it must be noted that it was 
 not Peter, but John, that was the beloved disciple. Peter was desirous 
 to know, not only that he might be sure it was not he, but that, 
 knowing who it was, they might withdraw from him, and guard against 
 him, and, if possible, prevent his design. It were a desirable thing, 
 we should think, to know who in the church will deceive us; yet let 
 this suffice--Christ knows, though we do not. The reason why Peter did 
 not himself ask was because John had a much fairer opportunity, by the 
 advantage of his seat at table, to whisper the question into the ear of 
 Christ, and to receive a like private answer. It is good to improve our 
 interest in those that are near to Christ, and to engage their prayers 
 for us. Do we know any that we have reason to think lie in Christ's 
 bosom? Let us beg of them to speak a good word for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The question was asked accordingly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>He then, lying at the breast of Jesus,</I> and so having the 
 convenience of whispering with him,<I> saith unto him, Lord, who is 
 it?</I> Now here John shows, 

 (1.) A regard to his fellow-disciple, and to the motion he made. Though 
 Peter had not the honour he had at this time, yet he did not therefore 
 disdain to take the hint and intimation he gave him. Note, Those who 
 lie in Christ's bosom may often learn from those who lie at his feet 
 something that will be profitable for them, and be reminded of that 
 which they did not of themselves think of. John was willing to gratify 
 Peter herein, having so fair an opportunity for it. As every one hath 
 received the gift, so let him minister the same for a common good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:6">Rom. xii. 6</A>.

 (2.) A reverence of his Master. Though he whispered this in Christ's
 ear, yet he called him Lord; the familiarity he was admitted to did not 
 at all lessen his respect for his Master. It becomes us to use a 
 reverence in expression, and to observe a decorum even in our secret 
 devotions, which no eye is a witness to, as well as in public 
 assemblies. The more intimate communion gracious souls have with 
 Christ, the more sensible they are of his worthiness and their own 
 unworthiness, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:27">Gen. xviii. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Christ gave a speedy answer to this question, but whispered it in 
 John's ear; for it appears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>)

 that the rest were still ignorant of the matter. <I>He it is to whom I 
 shall give a sop,</I> <B><I>psomion</I></B>--<I>a morsel, a crust, when 
 I have dipped it</I> in the sauce. And <I>when he had dipped the 
 sop,</I> John strictly observing his motion, <I>he gave it to 
 Judas;</I> and Judas took it readily enough, not suspecting the design 
 of it, but glad of a savoury bit, to make up his mouth with. 

 (1.) Christ notified the traitor by a sign. He could have told John by 
 name who he was (The adversary and enemy is that wicked Judas, he is 
 the traitor, and none but he); but thus he would exercise the 
 observation of John, and intimate what need his ministers have of a 
 spirit of discerning; for the false brethren we are to stand upon our 
 guard against are not made known to us by words, but by signs; they are 
 to be known to us by <I>their fruits,</I> by <I>their spirits;</I> it 
 requires great diligence and care to form a right judgment upon them.
 
 (2.) That sign was a sop which Christ gave him, a very proper sign, 
 because it was the fulfilling of the scripture 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 that the traitor should be one that <I>ate bread with him,</I> that was 
 at this time a fellow-commoner with him. It had likewise a significancy 
 in it, and teaches us,

 [1.] That Christ sometimes gives sops to traitors; worldly riches, 
 honours, and pleasures are sops (if I may so speak), which Providence 
 sometimes gives into the hands of wicked men. Judas perhaps thought 
 himself a favourite because he had the sop, like Benjamin at Joseph's 
 table, a mess by himself; thus the prosperity of fools, like a 
 stupifying sop, helps to <I>destroy them.</I> 

 [2.] That we must not be outrageous against those whom we know to be 
 very malicious against us. Christ carved to Judas as kindly as to any
 at the table, though he knew he was then plotting his death. <I>If
 thine enemy hunger, feed him;</I> this is to do as Christ does.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Judas himself, instead of being convinced hereby of his 
 wickedness, was the more confirmed in it, and the warning given him was 
 to him a <I>savour of death unto death;</I> for it follows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The devil hereupon took possession of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>After the sop, Satan entered into him:</I> not to make him 
 melancholy, nor drive him distracted, which was the effect of his 
 possessing some; not to hurry him into the fire, nor into the water; 
 happy had it been for him if that had been the worst of it, or if with 
 the swine he had been choked in the sea; but Satan entered into him to 
 possess him with a prevailing prejudice against Christ and his 
 doctrine, and a contempt of him, as one whose life was of small value, 
 to excite in him a covetous desire of the wages of unrighteousness and 
 a resolution to stick at nothing for the obtaining of them. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Was not Satan in him before? How then is it said that now <I>Satan 
 entered into him?</I> Judas was all along a devil 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:70"><I>ch.</I> vi. 70</A>),

 a son of perdition, but now Satan gained a more full possession of him,
 had a <I>more abundant entrance</I> into him. His purpose to betray his
 Master was now ripened into a fixed resolution; now he returned with
 seven other spirits more wicked than himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:26">Luke xi. 26</A>.
 
 Note, 

 [1.] Though the devil is in every wicked man that does his works 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:2">Eph. ii. 2</A>),

 yet sometimes he enters more manifestly and more powerfully than at 
 other times, when he puts them upon some enormous wickedness, which 
 humanity and natural conscience startle at.

 [2.] Betrayers of Christ have much of the devil in them. Christ speaks 
 of the sin of Judas as greater than that of any of his persecutors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How came Satan to enter into him <I>after the sop?</I> Perhaps he 
 was presently aware that it was the discovery of him, and it made him 
 desperate in his resolutions. Many are made worse by the gifts of 
 Christ's bounty, and are confirmed in their impenitency by that which 
 should have led them to repentance. The <I>coals of fire heaped upon 
 their heads,</I> instead of melting them, harden them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ hereupon dismissed him, and delivered him up to his own 
 heart's lusts: <I>Then said Jesus unto him, What thou doest, do 
 quickly.</I> This is not to be understood as either advising him to his 
 wickedness or warranting him in it; but either, 

 (1.) As abandoning him to the conduct and power of Satan. Christ knew 
 that Satan had entered into him, and had peaceable possession; and now 
 he gives him up as hopeless. The various methods Christ had used for 
 his conviction were ineffectual; and therefore, "What thou doest thou 
 wilt do quickly; if thou art resolved to ruin thyself, go on, and take 
 what comes." Note, When the evil spirit is willingly admitted, the good 
 Spirit justly withdraws. Or, 

 (2.) As challenging him to do his worst: "Thou art plotting against me, 
 put thy plot in execution and welcome, the sooner the better, I do not 
 fear thee, I am ready for thee." Note, our Lord Jesus was very forward 
 to suffer and die for us, and was impatient of delay in the perfecting 
 of his undertaking. Christ speaks of Judas's betraying him as a thing 
 he was now doing, though he was only purposing it. Those who are 
 contriving and designing mischief are, in God's account, doing 
 mischief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Those that were at table understood not what he meant, because they 
 did not hear what he whispered to John 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>):

 <I>No man at table,</I> neither the disciples nor any other of the 
 guests, except John, <I>knew for what intent</I> he spoke this to him. 
 
 (1.) They did not suspect that Christ said it to Judas as a traitor, 
 because it did not enter into their heads that Judas was such a one, or 
 would prove so. Note, It is an excusable dulness in the disciples of 
 Christ not to be quick-sighted in their censures. Most are ready enough 
 to say, when they hear harsh things spoken in general, Now such a one 
 is meant, and now such a one; but Christ's disciples were so well 
 taught to love one another that they could not easily learn to suspect 
 one another; <I>charity thinks no evil.</I> 

 (2.) They therefore took it for granted that he said it to him as a 
 trustee, or treasurer of the household, giving him order for the laying 
 out of some money. Their surmises in this case discover to us for what 
 uses and purposes our Lord Jesus commonly directed payments out of that 
 little stock he had, and so teach us how to honour the Lord with our 
 substance. They concluded something was to be laid out, either,

 [1.] In works of piety: <I>Buy those things that we have need of 
 against the feast.</I> Though he borrowed a room to eat the passover 
 in, yet he bought in provision for it. That is to be reckoned well 
 bestowed which is laid out upon <I>those things we have need of</I> for 
 the maintenance of God's ordinances among us; and we have the less 
 reason to grudge that expense now because our gospel-worship is far 
 from being so chargeable as the legal worship was. 

 [2.] Or in works of charity: <I>That he should give something to the 
 poor.</I> By this it appears, <I>First,</I> That our Lord Jesus, though 
 he lived upon alms himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:3">Luke viii. 3</A>),

 yet gave alms to the poor, a little out of a little. Though he might
 very well be excused, not only because he was poor himself, but because 
 he did so much good in other ways, curing so many <I>gratis;</I> yet, 
 to set us an example, he gave, for the relief of the poor, out of that 
 which he had for the subsistence of his family; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:28">Eph. iv. 28</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> That the time of a religious feast was thought a
 proper time for works of charity. When he celebrated the passover he 
 ordered something for the poor. When we experience God's bounty to us, 
 this should make us bountiful to the poor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Judas hereupon sets himself vigorously to pursue his design against 
 him: He <I>went away.</I> Notice is taken,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Of his speedy departure: <I>He went out presently,</I> and quitted 
 the house, 

 [1.] For fear of being more plainly discovered to the company, for, if 
 he were, he expected they would all fall upon him, and be the death of 
 him, or at least of his project. 

 [2.] He went out as one weary of Christ's company and the society of 
 his apostles. Christ needed not to expel him, he expelled himself. 
 Note, Withdrawing from the communion of the faithful is commonly the 
 first overt-act of a backslider, and the beginning of an apostasy. 

 [3.] <I>He went out</I> to prosecute his design, to look for those with 
 whom he was to make his bargain, and to settle the agreement with them. 
 Now that Satan had got into him he hurried him on with precipitation, 
 lest he should see his error and repent of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Of the time of his departure: <I>It was night.</I> 

 [1.] Though it was night, an unseasonable time for business, yet, Satan 
 having entered into him, he made no difficulty of the coldness and 
 darkness of the night. This should shame us out of our slothfulness and 
 cowardice in the service of Christ, that the devil's servants are so 
 earnest and venturous in his service. 

 [2.] Because it was night, and this gave him advantage of privacy and 
 concealment. He was not willing to be <I>seen</I> treating with the 
 chief priests, and therefore chose the dark night as the fittest time 
 for such works of darkness. Those whose deeds are evil love darkness 
 rather than light. See

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son
 of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
 &nbsp; 32  If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in
 himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
 &nbsp; 33  Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall
 seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot
 come; so now I say to you.
 &nbsp; 34  A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another;
 as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This and what follows, to the end of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:31-14:33"><I>ch.</I> xiv.</A>,

 was Christ's table-talk with his disciples. When supper was done, Judas
 went out; but what did the Master and his disciples do, whom he left 
 sitting at table? They applied themselves to profitable discourse, to 
 teach us as much as we can to make conversation with our friends at 
 table serviceable to religion. Christ begins this discourse. The more 
 forward we are humbly to promote that communication which is good, and 
 to the use of edifying, the more like we are to Jesus Christ. Those 
 especially that by their place, reputation, and gifts, <I>command the 
 company,</I> to whom <I>men give ear,</I> ought to use the interest 
 they have in other respects as an opportunity of doing them good. Now 
 our Lord Jesus discourses with them (and probably discourses much more 
 largely than is here recorded),</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning the great mystery of his own death and sufferings, about 
 which they were as yet so much in the dark that they could not persuade 
 themselves to expect the thing itself, much less did they understand 
 the meaning of it; and therefore Christ gives them such instructions 
 concerning it as made the offence of the cross to cease. Christ did not 
 begin this discourse till Judas was gone out, for he was a false 
 brother. The presence of wicked people is often a hindrance to good 
 discourse. When Judas <I>was gone out,</I> Christ said, <I>now is the 
 Son of man glorified;</I> now that Judas is discovered and discarded, 
 who was a spot in their love-feast and a scandal to their family, 
 <I>now is the Son of man glorified.</I> Note, Christ is glorified by 
 the purifying of Christian societies: corruptions in his church are a 
 reproach to him; the purging out of those corruptions rolls away the 
 reproach. Or, rather, now Judas was gone to set the wheels a-going, in 
 order to his being put to death, and the thing was likely to be 
 effected shortly: <I>Now is the Son of man glorified,</I> meaning, 
 <I>Now he is crucified.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is something which Christ instructs them in, concerning his 
 sufferings, that was very <I>comforting.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he should himself be glorified in them. Now the Son of man is 
 to be exposed to the greatest ignominy and disgrace, to be despitefully 
 used to the last degree, and dishonoured both by the cowardice of his 
 friends and the insolence of his enemies; yet <I>now he is 
 glorified;</I> For, 

 [1.] Now he is to obtain a glorious victory over Satan and all the 
 powers of darkness, to spoil them, and triumph over them. He is now 
 <I>girding on the harness,</I> to take the field against these 
 adversaries of God and man, with as great an assurance as if he had 
 <I>put it off.</I> 

 [2.] Now he is to work out a glorious deliverance for his people, by 
 his death to reconcile them to God, and bring in an everlasting 
 righteousness and happiness for them; to shed that blood which is to be 
 an inexhaustible fountain of joys and blessings to all believers. 

 [3.] Now he is to give a glorious example of self-denial and patience 
 under the cross, courage and contempt of the world, zeal for the glory 
 of God, and love to the souls of men, such as will make him to be for 
 ever admired and had in honour. Christ had been glorified in many 
 miracles he had wrought, and yet he speaks of his being glorified 
 <I>now</I> in his sufferings, as if that were more than all his other 
 glories in his humble state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That God the Father should be glorified in them. The sufferings of 
 Christ were, 

 [1.] The satisfaction of God's justice, and so God was glorified in 
 them. Reparation was thereby made with great advantage for the wrong 
 done him in his honour by the sin of man. The ends of the law were 
 abundantly answered, and the glory of his government effectually 
 asserted and maintained. 

 [2.] They were the manifestation of his holiness and mercy. The 
 attributes of God shine brightly in creation and providence, but much 
 more in the work of redemption; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:24,2Co+4:6">1 Cor. i. 24; 2 Cor. iv. 6</A>.

 God is love, and herein he hath commended his love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That he should himself be greatly glorified after them, in 
 consideration of God's being greatly glorified by them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Observe how he enlarges upon it.

 [1.] He is sure that God will glorify him; and those whom God glorifies 
 are glorious indeed. Hell and earth set themselves to vilify Christ, 
 but God resolved to glorify him, and he did it. He glorified him in his 
 sufferings by the amazing signs and wonders, both in heaven and earth, 
 which attended them, and extorted even from his crucifiers an 
 acknowledgment that he was the Son of God. But especially after his
 sufferings he glorified him, when he set him <I>at his own right 
 hand,</I> gave him a <I>name above every name.</I> 

 [2.] That he will glorify him <I>in himself</I>--<B><I>en 
 heauto</I></B>. Either, <I>First,</I> In Christ himself. He will 
 glorify him in his own person, and not only in his kingdom among men.
 This supposes his speedy resurrection. A common person may be honoured 
 after his death, in his memory or posterity, but Christ was honoured in 
 <I>himself.</I> Or, <I>secondly,</I> in God himself. God will glorify 
 him <I>with himself,</I> as it is explained,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:5"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 5</A>.

 <I>He shall sit down with the Father upon his throne,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:21">Rev. iii. 21</A>.
 
 This is true glory. 

 [3.] That he will glorify him straightway. He looked upon the joy and 
 glory set before him, not only as great, but as near; and his sorrows 
 and sufferings short and soon over. Good services done to earthly 
 princes often remain long unrewarded; but Christ had his preferments 
 presently. It was but forty hours (or not so much) from his death to 
 his resurrection, and forty days thence to his ascension, so that it 
 might well be said that he was <I>straightway glorified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:10">Ps. xvi. 10</A>.

 [4.] All this in consideration of God's being glorified in and by his
 sufferings: <I>Seeing God is glorified in him,</I> and receives honour 
 from his sufferings, God shall in like manner glorify him in himself, 
 and give honour to him. Note, <I>first,</I> In the exaltation of Christ 
 there was a regard had to his humiliation, and a reward given for it. 
 <I>Because he humbled himself, therefore God highly exalted him.</I> If 
 the Father be so great a gainer in his glory by the death of Christ, we 
 may be sure that the Son shall be no loser in his. See the covenant 
 between them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:12">Isa. liii. 12</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Those who mind the business of glorifying God no doubt
 shall have the happiness of being glorified with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is something that Christ instructs them in, concerning his 
 sufferings, which was <I>awakening,</I> for as yet they were slow of 
 heart to understand it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>Little children, yet a little while I am with you,</I> &c. Two 
 things Christ here suggests, to quicken his disciples to improve their 
 present opportunities; two serious words:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That his stay in this world, to be with them here, they would find 
 to be very short. <I>Little children.</I> This compellation does not 
 bespeak so much their weakness as his tenderness and compassion; he 
 speaks to them with the affection of a father, now that he is about to 
 leaven them, and to leave blessings with them. Know this, then, that 
 <I>yet a little while I am with you.</I> Whether we understand this as 
 referring to his death or his ascension it comes much to one; he had 
 but a little time to spend with them, and therefore, 

 [1.] Let them improve the advantage they now had. If they had any good 
 question to ask, if they would have any advice, instruction, or 
 comfort, let them speak quickly; for <I>yet a little while I am with 
 you.</I> We must make the best of the helps we have for our souls while 
 we have them, because we shall not have them long; they will be taken 
 from us, or we from them. 

 [2.] Let them not doat upon his bodily presence, as if their happiness 
 and comfort were bound up in that; no, they must think of living 
 without it; not be always little children, but go alone, without their 
 nurses. Ways and means are appointed but for a <I>little while,</I> and 
 are not to be rested in, but pressed through to our rest, to which they 
 have a reference.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That their following him to the other world, to be with him there,
 they would find to be very difficult. What he had said to the Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:34"><I>ch.</I> vii. 34</A>)

 he saith to his disciples; for they have need to be quickened by the
 same considerations that are propounded for the convincing and 
 awakening of sinners. Christ tells them here, 

 [1.] That when he was gone they would feel the want of him; <I>You 
 shall seek me,</I> that is "you shall wish you had me again with you." 
 We are often taught the worth of mercies by the want of them. Though 
 the presence of the Comforter yielded them real and effectual relief in 
 straits and difficulties, yet it was not such a <I>sensible</I> 
 satisfaction as his bodily presence would have been to those who had 
 been used to it. But observe, Christ said to the Jews, You shall seek 
 me and <I>not find me;</I> but to the disciples he only saith, <I>You 
 shall seek me,</I> intimating that though they should not find his 
 bodily presence any more than the Jews, yet they should find that which 
 was tantamount, and should not seek in vain. When they sought his body 
 in the sepulchre, though they did not find it, yet they sought to good 
 purpose. 

 [2.] That whither he went they <I>could not come,</I> which suggests to 
 them high thoughts of him, who was going to an invisible inaccessible 
 world, to dwell in that <I>light which none can approach unto;</I> and 
 also low thoughts of themselves, and serious thoughts of their future 
 state. Christ tells them that they could not follow him (as Joshua
 told the people that they could not serve the Lord) only to quicken 
 them to so much the more diligence and care. They could not follow him 
 to his cross, for they had not courage and resolution; it appeared that 
 they could not when they all forsook him and fled. Nor could they 
 follow him to his crown, for they had not a sufficiency of their own, 
 nor were their work and warfare yet finished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He discourses with them concerning the great duty of brotherly love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>):

 <I>You shall love one another.</I> Judas was now gone out, and had 
 proved himself a false brother; but they must not therefore harbour 
 such jealousies and suspicions one of another as would be the bane of 
 love: though there was one Judas among them, yet they were not all 
 Judases. Now that the enmity of the Jews against Christ and his 
 followers was swelling to the height, and they must expect such 
 treatment as their Master had, it concerned them by brotherly love to 
 strengthen one another's hands. Three arguments for mutual love are 
 here urged:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The command of their Master 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>A new commandment I give unto you.</I> He not only commends it as 
 amiable and pleasant, not only counsels it as excellent and profitable, 
 but commands it, and makes it one of the fundamental laws of his 
 kingdom; it goes a-breast with the command of believing in Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:23,1Pe+1:22">1 John iii. 23; 1 Pet. i. 22</A>.

 It is the command of our ruler, who has a right to give law to us; it
 is the command of our Redeemer, who gives us this law in order to the 
 curing of our spiritual diseases and the preparing of us for our 
 eternal bliss. It is <I>a new commandment;</I> that is,

 (1.) It is a renewed commandment; it was a commandment <I>from the 
 beginning</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:7">1 John ii. 7</A>),

 as old as the law of nature, it was the second great commandment of the 
 law of Moses; yet, because it is also one of the great commandments of 
 the New Testament, of Christ the new Lawgiver, it is called a new 
 commandment; it is like an old book in a new edition corrected and 
 enlarged. This commandment has been so corrupted by the traditions of 
 the Jewish church that when Christ revived it, and set it in a true 
 light, it might well be called a <I>new commandment.</I> Laws of 
 revenge and retaliation were so much in vogue, and self-love had so 
 much the ascendant, that the law of brotherly love was forgotten as 
 obsolete and out of date; so that as it came from Christ new, it was 
 new to the people. 

 (2.) It is an excellent command, as a <I>new song</I> is an excellent 
 song, that has an uncommon gratefulness in it.

 (3.) It is an everlasting command; so strangely new as to be always so; 
 as the <I>new covenant,</I> which shall never decay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:13">Heb. viii. 13</A>);

 it shall be new to eternity, when faith and hope are antiquated. 

 (4.) As Christ gives it, it is <I>new.</I> Before it was, <I>Thou shalt 
 love thy neighbour;</I> now it is, You shall love <I>one another;</I> 
 it is pressed in a more winning way when it is thus pressed as mutual 
 duty owing to one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The example of their Saviour is another argument for brotherly love: 
 <I>As I have loved you.</I> It is this that makes it a <I>new 
 commandment</I>--that this rule and reason of <I>love (as I have loved
 you</I>) is perfectly new, and such as had been hidden from ages and 
 generations. Understand this, 

 (1.) Of all the instances of Christ's love to his disciples, which they 
 had already experienced during the time he went in and out among them. 
 He spoke kindly to them, concerned himself heartily for them, and for 
 their welfare, instructed, counselled, and comforted them, prayed with 
 them and for them, vindicated them when they were accused, took their 
 part when they were run down, and publicly owned them to be dearer to 
 him that his <I>mother, or sister, or brother.</I> He reproved them for 
 what was amiss, and yet compassionately bore with their failings, 
 excused them, made the best of them, and passed by many an oversight. 
 Thus he <I>had</I> loved them, and just now washed their feet; and thus 
 they <I>must</I> love one another, and love <I>to the end.</I> Or, 

 (2.) It may be understood of the special instance of love to all his 
 disciples which he was now about to give, in laying down his life for 
 them. <I>Greater love hath no man than this,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:13"><I>ch.</I> xv. 13</A>.

 Has he thus loved us all? Justly may he expect that we should be loving
 to one another. Not that we are capable of doing any thing of the
 <I>same nature</I> for each other 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:7">Ps. xlix. 7</A>),

 but we must love one another in some respects after the <I>same
 manner;</I> we must set this before us as our copy, and take directions
 from it. Our love to one another must be free and ready, laborious and
 expensive, constant and persevering; it must be love <I>to the
 souls</I> one of another. We must also love one another from <I>this
 motive,</I> and upon this consideration--because Christ has loved us.
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:1,3,Eph+5:2,25,Php+2:1-5">Rom. xv. 1, 3;
 Eph. v. 2, 25; Phil. ii. 1-5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The reputation of their profession 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have 
 love one to another.</I> Observe, We must have love, not only show 
 love, but have it in the root and habit of it, and have it when there 
 is not any present occasion to show it; have it <I>ready.</I> "Hereby 
 it will appear that you are indeed my followers by following me in 
 this." Note, Brotherly love is the badge of Christ's disciples. By this 
 he knows them, by this they may know themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:14">1 John ii. 14</A>),

 and by this others may know them. This is the livery of his family,
 the distinguishing character of his disciples; this he would have them 
 <I>noted for,</I> as that wherein they excelled all others--their 
 loving one another. This was what their Master was famous for; all that 
 ever heard of him have heard of his love, his great love; and 
 therefore, if you see any people more affectionate one to another than 
 what is common, say, "Certainly these are the followers of Christ, they 
 have been with Jesus." Now by this it appears, 

 (1.) That the heart of Christ was very much upon it, that his disciples 
 <I>should love one another.</I> In this they must be <I>singular;</I> 
 whereas the way of the world is to be <I>every one for himself,</I> 
 they should be hearty for one another. He does not say, <I>By this 
 shall men know</I> that you are my disciples--if you <I>work 
 miracles,</I> for a worker of miracles is but a cypher without charity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:1,2">1 Cor. xiii. 1, 2</A>);

 but <I>if you love one another</I> from a principle of self-denial and 
 gratitude to Christ. This Christ would have to be the <I>proprium</I> 
 of his religion, the principal note of the true church.

 (2.) That it is the true honour of Christ's disciples to excel in 
 brotherly love. Nothing will be more effectual than this to recommend
 them to the esteem and respect of others. See what a powerful 
 attractive it was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:46,47">Acts ii. 46, 47</A>.

 Tertullian speaks of it as the glory of the primitive church that the
 Christians were known by their affection to one another. Their 
 adversaries took notice of it, and said, <I>See how these Christians 
 love one another,</I> Apol. cap. 39.

 (3.) That, if the followers of Christ do not love one another, they not 
 only cast an unjust reproach upon their profession, but give just cause 
 to suspect their own sincerity. <I>O Jesus! are these thy 
 Christians,</I> these passionate, malicious, spiteful, ill-natured 
 people? <I>Is this thy son's coat?</I> When our brethren stand in need 
 of help from us, and we have an opportunity of being service able to 
 them, when they differ in opinion and practice from us, or are any ways 
 rivals with or provoking to us, and so we have an occasion to 
 condescend and forgive, in such cases as this it will be known whether 
 we have this badge of Christ's disciples.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Peter's curiosity, and the check given to that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Peter's question was bold and blunt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>Lord, whither goest thou?</I> referring to what Christ had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 <I>Whither I go, you cannot come.</I> The practical instructions Christ 
 had given them concerning brotherly love he overlooks, and asks no 
 questions upon them, but fastens upon that concerning which Christ 
 purposely kept them in the dark. Note, It is a common fault among us to 
 be more inquisitive concerning things secret, which belong to God only, 
 than concerning things <I>revealed, which belong to us and our 
 children,</I> more desirous to have our curiosity gratified than our 
 consciences directed, to know what is done in heaven than what we may 
 do to get thither. It is easy to observe it in the converse of 
 Christians, how soon a discourse of that which is plain and edifying is 
 dropped, and no more said to it, the subject is exhausted; which in a 
 matter of doubtful disputation runs into an endless strife of 
 words.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ's answer was instructive. He did not gratify him with any 
 particular account of the world he was going to, nor ever foretold his 
 glories and joys so distinctly as he did his sufferings, but said what 
 he had said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 Let this suffice, <I>thou canst not follow me now, but shalt follow me 
 hereafter,</I> 

 (1.) We may understand it of his following him to the cross: "Thou hast 
 not yet strength enough of faith and resolution to drink of my cup;" 
 and it appeared so by his cowardice when Christ was suffering. For this 
 reason, when Christ was seized, he provided for the safety of his 
 disciples. <I>Let these go their way,</I> because they could not 
 <I>follow him now.</I> Christ considers the frame of his disciples, and 
 will not cut out for them that work and hardship which they are not as 
 yet fit for; the day shall be as the strength is. Peter, though
 designed for martyrdom, cannot follow Christ now, not being come to his 
 full growth, but he <I>shall follow</I> him <I>hereafter;</I> he shall 
 be crucified at last, like his Master. Let him not think that because 
 he escapes suffering now he shall never suffer. From our missing the 
 cross once, we must not infer that we shall never meet it; we may be 
 reserved for greater trials than we have yet known. 

 (2.) We may understand it of his following him to the crown. Christ
 was now going to his glory, and Peter was very desirous to go with him: 
 "No," saith Christ, "<I>thou canst not follow me now,</I> thou art not 
 yet ripe for heaven, nor hast thou finished thy work on earth. The 
 forerunner must <I>first enter to prepare a place</I> for thee, but 
 <I>thou shalt follow me afterwards,</I> after thou hast fought the good 
 fight, and at the time appointed." Note, Believers must not expect to 
 be glorified as soon as they are effectually called, for there is a 
 wilderness between the Red Sea and Canaan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Peter's confidence, and the check given to that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Peter makes a daring protestation of his constancy. He is not 
 content to be left behind, but asks, "<I>Lord why cannot I follow thee 
 now?</I> Dost thou question my sincerity and resolution? I promise 
 thee, if there be occasion, <I>I will lay down my life for thy 
 sake.</I>" Some think Peter had a conceit, as the Jews had in a like 
 case 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:35"><I>ch.</I> vii. 35</A>),

 that Christ was designing a journey or voyage into some remote country,
 and that he declared his resolution to go along with him wherever he
 went; but, having heard his Master so often speak of his own
 sufferings, surely he could not understand him any otherwise than of
 his going away by death; and he resolves as Thomas did that he will
 <I>go and die with him;</I> and better die with him than live without
 him. See here, 

 (1.) What an affectionate love Peter had to our Lord Jesus: "<I>I will
 lay down my life for thy sake,</I> and I can do no more." I believe 
 Peter spoke as he thought, and though he was inconsiderate he was not 
 insincere, in his resolution. Note, Christ should be dearer to us than 
 our own lives, which therefore, when we are called to it, we should be 
 willing to lay down for his sake,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:24">Acts xx. 24</A>.

 (2.) How ill he took it to have it questioned, intimated in that
 expostulation, "<I>Lord, why cannot I follow thee now?</I> Dost thou 
 suspect my fidelity to thee?"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+29:8">1 Sam. xxix. 8</A>.

 Note, It is with regret that true love hears its own sincerity
 arraigned, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:17"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 17</A>.

 Christ had indeed said that one of them was a devil, but he was
 discovered, and gone out, and therefore Peter thinks he may speak with 
 the more assurance of his own sincerity; "Lord, I am resolved I will 
 never leave thee, and therefore <I>why cannot I follow thee?</I>" We 
 are apt to think that we can do any thing, and take it amiss to be told 
 that this and the other we cannot do, whereas without Christ we can do 
 nothing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ gives him a surprising prediction of his inconstancy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.
 
 Jesus Christ knows us better than we know ourselves, and has many ways 
 of discovering those to themselves whom he loves, and will hide pride 
 from. 

 (1.) He upbraids Peter with his confidence: <I>Wilt thou lay down thy 
 life for my sake?</I> Me thinks, he seems to have said this with a 
 smile: "Peter, thy promises are too large, too lavish to be relied on; 
 thou dost not consider with what reluctancy and struggle a life is laid 
 down, and what a hard task it is to die; not so soon done as said." 
 Christ hereby puts Peter upon second thoughts, not that he might 
 retract his resolution, or recede from it, but that he might insert 
 into it that necessary proviso, "Lord, <I>thy grace enabling me,</I> I 
 will lay down my life for thy sake." "Wilt thou undertake to die for 
 me? What! thou that trembledst to walk upon the water to me? What! thou 
 that, when sufferings were spoken of, criedst out, <I>Be it far from 
 thee, Lord?</I> It was an easy thing to leave thy boats and nets to 
 follow me, but not so easy to lay down thy life." His Master himself 
 struggled when it came to his, and <I>the disciple is not greater than 
 his Lord.</I> Note, It is good for us to shame ourselves out of our 
 presumptuous confidence in ourselves. Shall a bruised reed set up for a 
 pillar, or a sickly child undertake to be a champion? What a fool am I 
 to talk so big. 

 (2.) He plainly foretels his cowardice in the critical hour. To stop 
 the mouth of his boasting, lest Peter should say it again, Yea Master, 
 that I will, Christ solemnly asserts it with, <I>Verily, verily, I say 
 unto thee, the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.</I> 
 He does not say as afterwards, <I>This night,</I> for it seems to have 
 been two nights before the passover; but, "Shortly thou wilt have 
 denied me thrice within the space of one night; nay, within so short a 
 space as between the first and last crowing of the cock: <I>The cock 
 shall not crow,</I> shall not have crowed his crowing out, till thou 
 has again and again denied me, and that for fear of suffering." The 
 crowing of the cock is mentioned,

 [1.] To intimate that the trial in which he would miscarry thus should 
 be in the night, which was an improbable circumstance, but Christ's 
 foretelling it was an instance of his infallible foresight. 

 [2.] Because the crowing of the cock was to be the occasion of his 
 repentance, which of itself would not have been if Christ had not put 
 this into the prediction. Christ not only foresaw that Judas would 
 betray him though he only in heart designed it, but he foresaw that 
 Peter would deny him though he did not design it, but the contrary. He 
 knows not only the wickedness of sinners, but the weakness of saints.
 Christ told Peter, <I>First,</I> That he would deny him, would renounce 
 and abjure him: "Thou wilt not only not follow me still, but wilt be 
 ashamed to own that ever thou didst follow me." <I>Secondly,</I> That 
 he would do this not once only by a hasty slip of the tongue, but after 
 he had paused would repeat it a second and third time; and it proved 
 too true. We commonly give it as a reason why the prophecies of 
 scripture are expressed darkly and figuratively, because, if they did 
 <I>plainly</I> describe the event, the accomplishment would thereby 
 either be defeated or necessitated by a fatality inconsistent with 
 human liberty; and yet this plain and express prophecy of Peter's 
 denying Christ did neither, nor did in the least make Christ accessary 
 to Peter's sin. But we may well imagine what a mortification it was to 
 Peter's confidence of his own courage to be told this, and to be told 
 it in such a manner that he durst not contradict it, else he would have 
 said as Hazael, <I>What! is thy servant a dog?</I> This could not but 
 fill him with confusion. Note, The most secure are commonly the least 
 safe; and those most shamefully betray their own weakness that most 
 confidently presume upon their own strength,
