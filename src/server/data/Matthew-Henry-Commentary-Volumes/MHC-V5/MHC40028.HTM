 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the foregoing chapters, we saw the Captain of our salvation engaged
 with the powers of darkness, attacked by them, and vigorously attacking
 them; victory seemed to hover between the combatants; nay, at length,
 it inclined to the enemies' side, and our Champion fell before them;
 behold, God has delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory
 into the enemies' hand. Christ in the grave is like the ark in Dagon's
 temple; the powers of darkness seemed to ride masters, but then the
 Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by
 reason of wine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:61,65">Ps. lxxviii. 61, 65</A>.

 The prince of our peace is in this chapter rallying again, coming out
 of the grave, a Conqueror, yea, more than a conqueror, leading
 captivity captive; though the ark be a prisoner, Dagon falls before it,
 and it proves that none is able to stand before the holy Lord God. Now
 the resurrection of Christ being one of the main foundations of our
 religion, it is requisite that we should have infallible proofs of it;
 four of which proofs we have in this chapter, which are but a few of 
 many, for Luke and John give a larger account of the proofs of Christ's 
 resurrection than Matthew and Mark do. Here is,

 I. The testimony of the angel to Christ's resurrection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. His appearance himself to the women,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 III. The confession of the adversaries that were upon the guard, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:11-15">ver. 11-15</A>.

 IV. Christ's appearance to the disciples in Galilee, and the
 commission he gave them,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the
 first <I>day</I> of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
 to see the sepulchre.
 &nbsp; 2  And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of
 the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the
 stone from the door, and sat upon it.
 &nbsp; 3  His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as
 snow:
 &nbsp; 4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead
 <I>men.</I>
 &nbsp; 5  And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye:
 for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
 &nbsp; 6  He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the
 place where the Lord lay.
 &nbsp; 7  And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from
 the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there
 shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
 &nbsp; 8  And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and
 great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.
 &nbsp; 9  And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met
 them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet,
 and worshipped him.
 &nbsp; 10  Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my
 brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 For the proof of Christ's resurrection, we have here the testimony of 
 <I>the angel,</I> and of <I>Christ</I> himself, concerning his 
 resurrection. Now we may think that it would have been better, if the 
 matter had been so ordered, that a competent number of witnesses should 
 have been present, and have seen the stone rolled away by the angel, 
 and the dead body reviving, as people saw Lazarus come out of the 
 grave, and then the matter had been past dispute; but let us not 
 prescribe to Infinite Wisdom, which ordered that the witnesses of his 
 resurrection should see him <I>risen,</I> but not see him <I>rise.</I> 
 His incarnation was a mystery; so was this <I>second incarnation</I> 
 (if we may so call it), this <I>new making</I> of the body of Christ, 
 for his exalted state; it was therefore <I>made in secret. Blessed are 
 they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</I> Christ gave such 
 proofs of his resurrection as were <I>corroborated</I> by the 
 scriptures, and by the <I>word</I> which he had <I>spoken</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:6,7-44,Mk+16:7">Luke xxiv. 6, 7-44; Mark xvi. 7</A>);

 for here we must <I>walk by faith, not by sight.</I> We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>coming</I> of the <I>good women</I> to the 
 <I>sepulchre.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. <I>When</I> they came; <I>in the end of the sabbath, as it began to
 dawn toward the first day of the week,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This fixes the time of Christ's resurrection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He arose the <I>third day</I> after his death; that was the time 
 which he had often prefixed, and he kept within it. He was buried in 
 the evening of the sixth day of the week, and arose in the morning of 
 the first day of the following week, so that he lay in the grave about 
 thirty-six or thirty-eight hours. He lay so long, to show that he was 
 really and truly dead; and no longer, that he might not <I>see 
 corruption.</I> He arose the third day, to answer the type of the 
 prophet Jonas 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:40"><I>ch.</I> xii. 40</A>),

 and to accomplish that prediction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:2">Hos. vi. 2</A>),

 <I>The third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his
 sight.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He arose <I>after the Jewish sabbath,</I> and it was the 
 passover-sabbath; all that day he lay in the grave, to signify the 
 abolishing of the Jewish feasts and the other parts of the ceremonial 
 law, and that his people must be dead to such observances, and take no 
 more notice of them than he did when he <I>lay in the grave.</I> Christ 
 on <I>the sixth day finished</I> his work; he said, <I>It is 
 finished;</I> on the seventh day he rested, and then on the first day 
 of the next week did as it were begin a new world, and enter upon new 
 work. Let no man therefore judge us now in respect of <I>the new 
 moons,</I> or of the <I>Jewish sabbaths,</I> which were indeed a shadow 
 of good things to come, but the <I>substance</I> if <I>of Christ.</I> 
 We may further observe, that the time of the saints' lying in the 
 grave, is a sabbath to them (such as the Jewish sabbath was, which 
 consisted chiefly in bodily rest), for there they <I>rest from their 
 labours</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:17">Job iii. 17</A>);
 
 and it is owing to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He arose upon the <I>first day of the week;</I> on the first day 
 of the first week God <I>commanded the light to shine out of 
 darkness;</I> on this day therefore did he who was to be the Light of 
 the world, shine out of the darkness of the grave; and the seventh-day 
 sabbath being buried with Christ, it arose again in the first-day 
 sabbath, called the <I>Lord's day</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:10">Rev. i. 10</A>),

 and no other day of the week is from henceforward mentioned in all the 
 New Testament than this, and this often, as the day which Christians 
 religiously observed in solemn assemblies, to the honour of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:19,26,Ac+20:7,1Co+16:2">John xx. 19, 26; 
 Acts xx. 7; 1 Cor. xvi. 2</A>.

 If the deliverance of Israel out of the land of the north superseded
 the remembrance of that out of Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:7,8">Jer. xxiii. 7, 8</A>),

 much more doth our redemption by Christ eclipse the glory of God's 
 former works. The sabbath was instituted in remembrance of the 
 <I>perfecting</I> of the work of creation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:1">Gen. ii. 1</A>.

 Man by his revolt made a breach upon that <I>perfect</I> work, which
 was never perfectly repaired till Christ arose from the dead, and the 
 <I>heavens and the earth were</I> again <I>finished,</I> and the 
 disordered <I>hosts of them</I> modelled anew, and the day on which 
 this was done was justly <I>blessed and sanctified,</I> and the seventh 
 day from that. He who on that day arose from the dead, is the same by 
 whom, and for whom, all things were at first created, and now anew 
 created.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He arose <I>as it began to dawn</I> toward that day; as soon as it 
 could be said that the <I>third day</I> was come, the time prefixed for 
 his resurrection, he <I>arose;</I> after his withdrawings from his 
 people, he returns with all convenient <I>speed,</I> and <I>cuts the 
 work</I> as <I>short in righteousness</I> as may be. He had said to his 
 disciples, that though within a little while they <I>should not see 
 him,</I> yet again <I>a little while,</I> and they <I>should see 
 him,</I> and accordingly he made it as little a while as possible, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:7,8">Isa. liv. 7, 8</A>.

 Christ arose <I>when the day began</I> to <I>dawn,</I> because then the
 day-spring from on high did again visit us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:78">Luke i. 78</A>.

 His passion began in the night; when he hung on the cross the sun was
 darkened; he was laid in the grave in the dusk of the evening; but he 
 arose from the grave when the sun was near rising, for he is the 
 <I>bright and morning Star</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:16">Rev. xxii. 16</A>),

 the <I>true Light.</I> Those who address themselves early in the 
 morning to the religious services of the Christian sabbath, that they 
 may take the day before them, therein follow this example of Christ, 
 and that of David, <I>Early will I seek thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Who they were, that came to the sepulchre; <I>Mary Magdalene and the 
 other Mary,</I> the same that attended the funeral, and <I>sat over 
 against the sepulchre,</I> as before they <I>sat over against the 
 cross;</I> still they studied to express their love to Christ; still 
 they were inquiring after him. Then shall we <I>know,</I> if we thus 
 <I>follow on to know.</I> No mention is made of the Virgin Mary being 
 with them; it is probable that the <I>beloved disciple,</I> who had 
 taken her to his own home, hindered her from <I>going to the grave to 
 weep there.</I> Their attendance on Christ not only <I>to</I> the 
 grave, but <I>in</I> the grave, represents his like care for those that 
 are his, when they have <I>made their bed in the darkness.</I> As 
 Christ in the grave was beloved of the <I>saints,</I> so the saints in 
 the grave are beloved of Christ; for death and the grave cannot slacken 
 that bond of love which is between them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What they <I>came to do:</I> the other evangelists say that they 
 came to anoint the body; Matthew saith that they came to <I>see the 
 sepulchre,</I> whether it was as they left it; hearing perhaps, but not 
 being sure, that the chief priests had set a guard upon it. They went, 
 to show their good-will in another visit to the dear remains of their 
 beloved Master, and perhaps not without some thoughts of his 
 resurrection, for they could not have quite forgotten all he had said 
 of it. Note, Visits to the grave are of great use to Christians, and 
 will help to make it familiar to them, and to take off the terror of 
 it, especially visits to the grave of our Lord Jesus, where we may see 
 sin buried out of sight, the pattern of our sanctification, and the 
 great proof of redeeming love shining illustriously even in that 
 <I>land of darkness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The appearance of an angel of the Lord to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.

 We have here an account of the manner of the resurrection of Christ, as
 far as it was fit that we should know.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There was a <I>great earthquake.</I> When he died, the earth that 
 <I>received him,</I> shook for fear; now that he arose, the earth that 
 <I>resigned him,</I> leaped for joy in his exaltation. This earthquake 
 did as it were <I>loose</I> the bond of death, and <I>shake off</I> the 
 fetters of the grave, and introduce the <I>Desire of all nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:6,7">Hag. ii. 6, 7</A>.

 It was the <I>signal</I> of Christ's victory; notice was hereby given
 of it, that, when the <I>heavens rejoiced,</I> the <I>earth</I> also 
 might be <I>glad.</I> It was a <I>specimen</I> of the <I>shake</I> that 
 will be given to the earth at the general resurrection, when mountains 
 and islands shall be removed, that the earth may no longer <I>cover her 
 slain.</I> There was a <I>noise and a shaking</I> in the valley, when 
 the <I>bones were to come together, bone to his bone,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:7">Ezek. xxxvii. 7</A>.

 The kingdom of Christ, which was now to be set up, made the earth to
 quake, and <I>terribly shook it.</I> Those who are sanctified, and 
 thereby raised to a spiritual life, while it is in the doing find an 
 earthquake in their own bosoms, as Paul, who <I>trembled</I> and was 
 <I>astonished.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The <I>angel of the Lord descended from heaven.</I> The angels 
 frequently attended our Lord Jesus, at his birth, in his temptation, in 
 his agony; but upon the cross we find no angel attending him: when his 
 Father <I>forsook him,</I> the angels withdrew from him; but now that 
 he is resuming the glory he had before the foundation of the world, 
 now, behold, the <I>angels of God worship him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He came, and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. 
 Our Lord Jesus could have <I>rolled back the stone</I> himself by his 
 own power, but he chose to have it done by an angel, to signify that 
 having undertaken to make satisfaction for our sin, imputed to him, and 
 being under arrest pursuant to that imputation, he did not <I>break 
 prison,</I> but had a fair and <I>legal discharge,</I> obtained from 
 heaven; he did not break prison, but an officer was sent on purpose to 
 <I>roll away the stone,</I> and so to open the prison door, which would 
 never have been done, if he had not made a <I>full satisfaction.</I> 
 But being delivered for our offences, to complete the deliverance, he 
 was <I>raised again for our justification;</I> he died to pay our debt, 
 and rose again to take out our acquittance. The <I>stone</I> of our 
 sins was <I>rolled</I> to the door of the grave of our Lord Jesus (and 
 we find the rolling of a great stone to signify the <I>contracting of 
 guilt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:33">1 Sam. xiv. 33</A>);

 but to demonstrate that divine justice was satisfied, an angel was
 commissioned to roll back the stone; not that the angel <I>raised him 
 from the dead,</I> any more than those that <I>took away the stone</I> 
 from Lazarus's grave raised him, but thus he intimated the consent of 
 Heaven to his release, and the joy of Heaven in it. The enemies of 
 Christ had sealed the stone, resolving, like Babylon, not to <I>open 
 the house of his prisoners; shall the prey be taken from the 
 mighty?</I> For this was <I>their hour;</I> but all the powers of death 
 and darkness are under the control of the God of light and life. An 
 angel from heaven has power to <I>break the seal,</I> though it were 
 the <I>great seal of Israel,</I> and is able to <I>roll away the 
 stone,</I> though ever so great. Thus the <I>captives of the mighty are 
 taken away.</I> The angel's <I>sitting</I> upon the <I>stone,</I> when 
 he had <I>rolled it away,</I> is very observable, and bespeaks a secure 
 triumph over all the obstructions of Christ's resurrection. There he 
 sat, defying all the powers of hell to roll the stone to the grave 
 again. Christ erects his seat of rest and seat of judgment upon the 
 opposition of his enemies; <I>the Lord sitteth upon the floods.</I> The 
 angel sat as a guard to the grave, having frightened away the enemies' 
 <I>black</I> guard; he sat, expecting the women, and ready to give them 
 an account of his resurrection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That his <I>countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as 
 snow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This was a visible representation, by that which we call
 <I>splendid</I> and <I>illustrious,</I> of the <I>glories</I> of the
 invisible world, which know no <I>difference of colours.</I> His look
 upon the keepers was like <I>flashes of lightning; he cast forth
 lightning, and scattered them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:6">Ps. cxliv. 6</A>.

 The <I>whiteness</I> of his raiment was an emblem not only of purity,
 but of joy and triumph. When Christ died, the court of heaven <I>went
 into keep mourning,</I> signified by the <I>darkening of the sun;</I> 
 but when he arose, they again put on the <I>garments of praise.</I> The 
 glory of this angel represented the glory of Christ, to which he was 
 now risen, for it is the same description that was given of him in his 
 transfiguration

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:2"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 2</A>);

 but when he conversed with his disciples after his resurrection, he
 drew a veil over it, and it bespoke the glory of the saints in their 
 resurrection, when they shall be <I>as the angels of God in 
 heaven.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That <I>for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead 
 men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They were <I>soldiers,</I> that thought themselves hardened against
 fear, yet the very sight of an angel struck them with terror. Thus
 <I>when</I> the Son of <I>God arose to judgment, the stout-hearted were
 spoiled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:5,9">Ps. lxxvi. 5, 9</A>.

 Note, The resurrection of Christ, as it is the joy of his friends, so
 it is the terror and confusion of his enemies. <I>They did shake;</I> 
 the word <B><I>eseisthesan</I></B> is the same with that which was used 
 for the earthquake,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>,

 <B><I>seismos</I></B>. When the <I>earth</I> shook, these <I>children
 of the earth,</I> that had their portion in it, <I>shook too;</I>
 whereas, those that have their happiness in things above, <I>though the
 earth be removed, yet are without fear.</I> The keepers became <I>as
 dead men,</I> when he whom they kept guard upon became alive, and they
 whom they kept guard against revived with him. It struck a terror upon
 them, to see themselves baffled in that which was their business here.
 They were posted here, to <I>keep a dead man in his grave</I>--as easy
 a piece of service surely as was ever assigned them, and yet it proves
 too hard for them. They were told that they must expect to be assaulted
 by a company of feeble faint-hearted disciples, who for fear of them
 would soon <I>shake</I> and become as <I>dead men,</I> but are amazed
 when they find themselves attacked by a <I>mighty angel,</I> whom they
 dare not look in the face. Thus doth God <I>frustrate</I> his enemies
 by <I>frightening them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:20">Ps. ix. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The message which this angel delivered to the women, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He <I>encourages them against their fears,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 To come near to graves and tombs, especially in silence and solitude,
 has something in it <I>frightful,</I> much more was it so to those
 women, to find an angel at the sepulchre; but he soon makes them easy
 with the word, <I>Fear not ye.</I> The keepers shook, and became as
 dead men, but, <I>Fear not ye.</I> Let the sinners in Zion be afraid,
 for there is cause for it; but, <I>Fear not, Abraham,</I> nor any of
 the faithful seed of Abraham; why should the daughters of Sarah, that
 <I>do well,</I> be afraid <I>with any amazement?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:6">1 Pet. iii. 6</A>.
 
 "<I>Fear not ye.</I> Let not the news I have to tell you, be any
 surprise to you, for you were told before that your Master would rise; 
 let it be no terror to you, for his resurrection will be your 
 consolation; fear not any hurt, that I will do you, nor nay evil 
 tidings I have to tell you. <I>Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek
 Jesus.</I> I know you are friends to the cause. I do not come to 
 frighten you, but to encourage you." Note, Those that <I>seek 
 Jesus,</I> have no reason to be <I>afraid;</I> for, if they seek him 
 diligently they shall <I>find him,</I> and shall find him their 
 <I>bountiful Rewarder.</I> All our believing enquiries after the Lord 
 Jesus are observed, and taken notice of, in heaven; <I>I know that ye 
 seek Jesus;</I> and shall certainly be answered, as these were,<I> with 
 good words, and comfortable words. Ye seek Jesus that was 
 crucified.</I> He mentions his being crucified, the more to commend 
 their love to him; "You seek him still, though <I>he was crucified;</I> 
 you retain your kindness for him notwithstanding." Note, True believers 
 love and seek Christ, not only <I>though</I> he was crucified, but 
 <I>because</I> he was so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He <I>assures them of the resurrection of Christ;</I> and there was 
 enough in that to silence their fears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 He <I>is not here, for he is risen.</I> To be told <I>He is not 
 here,</I> would have been no welcome news to those who sought him, if 
 it had not been added, <I>He is risen.</I> Note, It is matter of 
 comfort to those who seek Christ, and miss of finding him where they 
 expected, that <I>he is risen:</I> if we find him not in sensible 
 comfort, yet <I>he is risen.</I> We must not hearken to those who say, 
 <I>Lo, here is Christ, or, Lo, he is there,</I> for he is not 
 <I>here,</I> he is not <I>there,</I> he is <I>risen.</I> In all our 
 enquiries after Christ, we must remember that he is <I>risen;</I> and 
 we must seek him as one <I>risen.</I> 

 (1.) Not with any <I>gross carnal</I> thoughts of him. There were those 
 that <I>knew Christ after the flesh;</I> but now henceforth know we him 
 so no more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:16">2 Cor. v. 16</A>.

 It is true, he had a body; but it is now a <I>glorified body.</I> They 
 that make pictures and images of Christ, forget that <I>he is not here, 
 he is risen;</I> our communion with him must be spiritual, by faith in 
 his word,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:6-9">Rom. x. 6-9</A>.

 (2.) We must seek him with great <I>reverence</I> and <I>humility,</I>
 and an awful regard to his glory, for <I>he is risen.</I> God has 
 <I>highly exalted him,</I> and <I>given him a name above every 
 name,</I> and therefore every knee and every soul must <I>bow before 
 him.</I> 

 (3.) We must seek him with a <I>heavenly mind;</I> when we are ready to 
 make this world our home, and to say, <I>It is good to be here,</I> let 
 us remember our Lord Jesus <I>is not here, he is risen,</I> and 
 therefore let not our <I>hearts</I> be <I>here,</I> but let them 
 <I>rise too,</I> and <I>seek the things that are above,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:1-3,Php+3:20">Col. iii. 1-3; Phil. iii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things the angel refers these women to, for the confirmation of 
 their faith, touching Christ's resurrection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] To his <I>word</I> now <I>fulfilled,</I> which they might 
 <I>remember; He is risen, as he said.</I> This he vouches as the proper 
 object of faith; "He said that he <I>would rise,</I> and you know that 
 he is the <I>Truth</I> itself, and therefore have reason to expect that 
 he <I>should rise;</I> why should you be backward to <I>believe</I> 
 that which he told you would be?" Let us never think that strange, of 
 which the word of Christ has raised our expectations, whether the 
 <I>sufferings of this present time,</I> or the <I>glory</I> that is 
 <I>to be revealed.</I> If we remember what Christ hath said <I>to 
 us,</I> we shall be the less surprised at what he does <I>with us.</I> 
 This angel, when he said. <I>He is not here, he is risen,</I> makes it 
 to appear that he preaches no other gospel than what they had already 
 received, for he refers himself to the word of Christ as sufficient to 
 bear him out; <I>He is risen, as he said.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] To his <I>grave</I> now <I>empty,</I> which they might <I>look 
 into; "Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</I> Compare what you 
 have <I>heard,</I> with what you <I>see,</I> and, putting both 
 together, you will <I>believe.</I> You see that <I>he is not here,</I> 
 and, remembering what he said, you may be satisfied that <I>he is 
 risen;</I> come, <I>see the place,</I> and you will see that he is not 
 there, you will see that he could not be stolen thence, and therefore 
 must conclude that he is risen." Note, It may be of use to affect us, 
 and may have a good influence upon us, to come, and with an eye of 
 faith <I>see the place where the Lord lay.</I> See the marks he has 
 there left of his love in condescending so low for us; see how 
 <I>easy</I> he has made that <I>bed,</I> and how <I>lightsome,</I> for 
 us, by lying in it himself; when we look into the grave, where we 
 expect we must lie, to take off the terror of it, let us look into the 
 grave where the Lord lay; the place where <I>our Lord</I> lay, so the 
 Syriac. The angels own him for <I>their</I> Lord, as well as <I>we;</I> 
 for the <I>whole family,</I> both in heaven and earth, is <I>named from 
 him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He <I>directs them</I> to go <I>carry the tidings</I> of it to his 
 disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 Go <I>quickly, and tell his disciples.</I> It is probable that they 
 were for entertaining themselves with the sight of the sepulchre and 
 discourse with the angels. It was good to be here, but they have other
 work appointed them; <I>this is a day of good tidings,</I> and though 
 they have the <I>premier seisin</I> of the comfort, the <I>first 
 taste</I> of it, yet they must not have the <I>monopoly</I> of it, must 
 not hold their peace, any more than those lepers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:9">2 Kings vii. 9</A>.

 They must go <I>tell the disciples.</I> Note, Public usefulness to
 others must be preferred before the pleasure of secret communion with 
 God ourselves; for <I>it is more blessed to give than to receive.</I> 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>disciples</I> of Christ must first be <I>told the news;</I> 
 not, Go, tell the <I>chief priests</I> and the <I>Pharisees,</I> that 
 they may be <I>confounded;</I> but, Tell the disciples, that they may 
 be <I>comforted.</I> God anticipates the joy of his friends more than 
 the <I>shame</I> of his enemies, though the perfection of both is 
 reserved for hereafter. <I>Tell his disciples;</I> it may be they will 
 believe your report, however tell them, 

 [1.] That they may encourage themselves under their present sorrows and 
 dispersions. It was a dismal time with them, between grief and fear; 
 what a cordial would this be to them now, to hear, <I>their Master is 
 risen!</I>

 [2.] That they may enquire further into it themselves. This alarm was 
 sent them, to awaken them from that strange stupidity which had seized 
 them, and to raise their expectations. This was to set them on seeking 
 him, and to prepare them for his appearance to them. General hints 
 excite to closer searches. They shall now hear of him, but shall very 
 shortly see him. Christ discovers himself <I>gradually.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>women</I> are sent to tell it to them, and so are made, as 
 it were, the <I>apostles of the apostles.</I> This was an honour put 
 upon them, and a recompence for their constant affectionate adherence 
 to him, at the cross, and in the grave, and a rebuke to the disciples 
 who forsook him. Still God chooses the weak things of the world, to 
 confound the mighty, and puts the treasure, not only into 
 <I>earthen</I> vessels, but here into the <I>weaker</I> vessels; as 
 <I>the woman, being deceived</I> by the suggestions of an evil angel, 
 <I>was first in the transgression</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:14">1 Tim. ii. 14</A>),

 so these women, being duly informed by the instructions of a good 
 angel, were first in the belief of the redemption from transgression by 
 Christ's resurrection, that that reproach of their sex might be rolled 
 away, by putting this in the balance against it, which is their 
 perpetual praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They were bid to <I>go quickly</I> upon this errand. Why, what 
 haste was there? Would not the news keep cold, and be welcome to them 
 at any time? Yes, but they were now overwhelmed with grief, and Christ 
 would have this cordial hastened to them; when Daniel was humbling 
 himself before God for sin, the angel Gabriel was caused to fly 
 <I>swiftly</I> with a message of comfort, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:21">Dan. ix. 21</A>.

 We must always be ready and forward;

 [1.] To obey the commands of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:60">Ps. cxix. 60</A>.

 [2.] To do good to our brethren, and to carry comfort to them, as those
 that felt from their afflictions; <I>Say not, Go, and come again, and 
 to-morrow I will give;</I> but now quickly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) They were directed to appoint the disciples to <I>meet him in 
 Galilee.</I> There were other appearances of Christ to them before that 
 in <I>Galilee,</I> which were sudden and surprising; but he would have 
 one to be solemn and public, and gave them notice of it before. Now 
 this general rendezvous was appointed in Galilee, eighty or a hundred 
 miles from Jerusalem; 

 [1.] <I>In kindness</I> to those of his disciples that remained in 
 Galilee, and <I>did not</I> (perhaps they <I>could not</I>) come up to 
 Jerusalem; into that country therefore he would go, to manifest himself 
 to his friends there. <I>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest.</I> 
 Christ knows where his disciples dwell, and will visit there. Note, The 
 exaltation of Christ doth not make him forget the meaner and poorer 
 sort of his disciples, but even to them that are at a distance from the 
 plenty of the means of grave he will graciously <I>manifest 
 himself.</I>

 [2.] In consideration of the weakness of his disciples that were now at 
 Jerusalem, who as yet were <I>afraid of the Jews,</I> and durst not 
 appear publicly, and therefore this meeting was adjourned to Galilee. 
 Christ knows our fears, and considers our frame, and made his 
 appointment where there was least danger of disturbance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The angel solemnly affirms upon his word the truth of 
 what he had related to them; "<I>Lo, I have told you,</I> you may be 
 assured of it, and depend upon it; <I>I</I> have told you, who dare not 
 tell a lie." <I>The word spoken by angels was stedfast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:2">Heb. ii. 2</A>.
 
 God had been wont formerly to make known his mind to his people by the
 ministration of angels, as at the giving of the law; but as he intended 
 in gospel times to lay aside that way of communication (for <I>unto the
 angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come,</I> nor
 appointed them to be the preachers of the gospel), this angel was
 <I>now</I> sent to certify the resurrection of Christ to the disciples,
 and so leave it in their hands to be published to the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:7">2 Cor. iv. 7</A>.
 
 In saying, <I>Lo, I have told you,</I> he doth, as it were, discharge
 himself from the blame of their unbelief, if they should not receive
 this record, and throw it upon them; "<I>I have done my errand,</I> I
 have faithfully delivered my message, now look you to it, believe it at
 your peril; whether you will hear or whether you will forbear, <I>I
 have told you.</I>" Note, Those messengers from God, that discharge
 their trust faithfully, may take the comfort of that, whatever the
 success be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:26,27">Acts xx. 26, 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The women's <I>departure</I> from the <I>sepulchre,</I> to bring
 notice to the disciples, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 And observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What frame and temper of spirit they were in; They <I>departed with 
 fear and great joy;</I> a strange mixture, fear and joy at the same 
 time, in the same soul. To hear that Christ was risen, was matter of 
 joy; but to be led into his grave, and to see an angel, and talk with 
 him about it, could not but cause fear. It was good news, but they were 
 <I>afraid</I> that it was too <I>good</I> to be true. But observe, it 
 is said of their <I>joy,</I> I was <I>great</I> joy; it is not said so 
 of their fear. Note,

 (1.) Holy fear has joy attending it. They that serve the Lord with 
 <I>reverence,</I> serve him with <I>gladness.</I>

 (2.) Spiritual joy is mixed with trembling, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:11">Ps. ii. 11</A>.

 It is only perfect love and joy that will cast out all fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What haste they made; <I>They did run.</I> The fear and joy together 
 quickened their pace, and added wings to their motion; the angel bid 
 them <I>go quickly,</I> and they <I>ran.</I> Those that are sent on 
 God's errand must not loiter, or lose time; where the <I>heart</I> is 
 <I>enlarged</I> with the glad tidings of the gospel, the feet will 
 <I>run the way of God's commandments.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What errand they went upon; They ran, to <I>bring his disciples 
 word.</I> Not doubting but it would be joyful news to them, they ran, 
 to comfort them with the same comforts wherewith they themselves were 
 comforted of God. Note, The disciples of Christ should be forward to 
 communicate to each other their experiences of sweet communion with 
 heaven; should tell others what God has <I>done for their souls,</I> 
 and spoken to them. Joy in Christ Jesus, like the ointment of the right 
 hand, will betray itself, and fill all places within the lines of its 
 communication with its odours. When Samson found honey, he brought it 
 to his parents.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Christ's appearing to the women, to confirm the testimony of the 
 angel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 These zealous good women not only heard the first tidings of him, but
 had the first sight of him, after his resurrection. The angel directed
 those that would see him, to go to Galilee, but before that time came, 
 even <I>here also,</I> they <I>looked after him</I> that lives, and 
 sees them. Note, Jesus Christ is often better than his word, but never 
 worse; often anticipates, but never frustrates, the believing 
 expectations of his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. Christ's surprising appearance to the women; <I>As they went to tell 
 his disciples, behold, Jesus met them.</I> Note, God's gracious visits 
 usually meet us in the way of duty, and to those who use what they have 
 for others' benefit, more shall be given. This interview with Christ 
 was unexpected, <I>or ever they were aware,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:12">Cant. vi. 12</A>.

 Note, Christ is nearer to his people than they imagine. They needed not
 <I>descend into the deep,</I> to fetch Christ thence; he <I>was not 
 there, he was risen;</I> nor <I>go up to heaven,</I> for he <I>was not 
 yet ascended:</I> but Christ was <I>high them,</I> and still in <I>the 
 word is nigh us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The salutation wherewith he accosted them; <I>All 
 hail</I>--<B><I>chairete</I></B>. We use the old <I>English form of
 salutation,</I> wishing <I>all health</I> to those we meet; for so 
 <I>All hail</I> signifies, and is expressive of the Greek form of 
 salutation here used, answering to that of the Hebrew, <I>Peace be unto 
 you.</I> And it bespeaks,

 (1.) The good-will of Christ to us and our happiness, even since he 
 entered upon his state of exaltation. Though he is advanced, he wishes 
 us as well as ever, and is as much concerned for our comfort. 

 (2.) The freedom and holy familiarity which he used in his fellowship 
 with his disciples; for he called them <I>friends.</I> But the Greek 
 word signifies, <I>Rejoice ye.</I> They were affected both with 
 <I>fear</I> and <I>joy;</I> what he said to them tended to encourage 
 their joy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>Rejoice ye,</I> and to silence their fear 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 <I>Be not afraid.</I> Note, It is the will of Christ that his people 
 should be a cheerful joyful people, and his resurrection furnishes them 
 with abundant matter for joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The affectionate respect they paid him; <I>They came, and held him 
 by the feet, and worshipped him.</I> Thus they expressed, 

 (1.) The <I>reverence</I> and <I>honour</I> they had <I>for</I> him; 
 they threw themselves at his feet, put themselves into a posture of 
 adoration, and <I>worshipped him</I> with humility and godly fear, as 
 the Son of God, and now exalted. 

 (2.) The <I>love</I> and <I>affection</I> they had <I>to</I> him; they 
 <I>held him, and would not let him go,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:4">Cant. iii. 4</A>.

 How <I>beautiful</I> were the <I>feet of the Lord Jesus</I> to them! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:7">Isa. lii. 7</A>.

 (3.) The <I>transport of joy</I> they were in, now that they had this
 further assurance of his resurrection; they welcomed it with both arms. 
 Thus we must embrace Jesus Christ offered us in the gospel, with 
 <I>reverence</I> cast ourselves at his feet, by faith <I>take hold</I> 
 of him, and with love and joy lay him near our hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The encouraging words Christ said to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 We do not find that they said any thing to him, their affectionate
 embraces and adorations spoke plainly enough; and what he said to them 
 was no more than what the angel had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 7</A>);

 for he will <I>confirm the word of his messengers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xliv. 26</A>);

 and his way of <I>comforting</I> his people, is, by his Spirit to speak 
 over again to their hearts the same that they had heard before from 
 <I>his angels,</I> the ministers. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How he rebukes their fear; <I>Be not afraid.</I> They must not 
 fear being imposed upon by these repeated notices of his resurrection, 
 nor fear any hurt from the appearance of one from the dead; for the 
 news, though strange, was both <I>true</I> and <I>good.</I> Note, 
 Christ arose from the dead, to silence his people's fears, and there is 
 enough in that to silence them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How he repeats their message; "<I>Go, tell my brethren,</I> that 
 they must prepare for a journey into Galilee, and there <I>they shall 
 see me.</I>" If there be any communion between our souls and Christ, it 
 is he that <I>appoints the meeting,</I> and he will observe the 
 appointment. Jerusalem had forfeited the honour of Christ's presence, 
 it was a <I>tumultuous</I> city, therefore he adjourns the meeting to 
 Galilee. <I>Come, my beloved, let us go forth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:11">Cant. vii. 11</A>.

 But that which is especially observable here, is, that he calls his
 disciples <I>his brethren.</I> Go, tell <I>my brethren,</I> not only 
 those of them that were akin to him, but all the rest, for they are all 
 his brethren

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:50"><I>ch.</I> xii. 50</A>),

 but he never called them so till after his resurrection, here and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17">John xx. 17</A>.

 Being by the resurrection himself declared to be the <I>Son of God with
 power,</I> all the children of God were thereby declared to be <I>his
 brethren.</I> Being the <I>First-begotten from the dead,</I> he is
 become the <I>First-born among many brethren,</I> even of all that are
 planted together in the likeness of his resurrection. Christ did not
 now converse so constantly and familiarly with his disciples as he had
 done before his death; but, lest they should think him grown strange to
 them, he gives them this endearing title, <I>Go to my brethren,</I>
 that the scripture might be fulfilled, which, speaking of his entrance
 upon his exalted state, saith, <I>I will declare thy name unto my
 brethren.</I> They had shamefully <I>deserted</I> him in his 
 sufferings; but, to show that he could forgive and forget, and to teach 
 us to do so, he not only continues his purpose to <I>meet</I> them, but 
 calls them <I>brethren.</I> Being all <I>his brethren,</I> they were 
 <I>brethren</I> one to another, and must love as brethren. His owning 
 them for his brethren put a great honour upon them, but withal gave 
 them an example of humility in the midst of that honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came
 into the city, and showed unto the chief priests all the things
 that were done.
 &nbsp; 12  And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
 counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,
 &nbsp; 13  Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him
 <I>away</I> while we slept.
 &nbsp; 14  And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade
 him, and secure you.
 &nbsp; 15  So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and
 this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 For the further proof of the resurrection of Christ, we have here the 
 confession of the adversaries that were upon the guard; and there are 
 two things which strengthen this testimony--that they were
 <I>eye-witnesses,</I> and did themselves see the glory of the 
 resurrection, which none else did--and that they were <I>enemies,</I>
 set there to oppose and obstruct his resurrection. Now observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How this testimony was <I>given in</I> to the chief priests 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);
 
 <I>when</I> the women <I>were going</I> to bring that news to the 
 disciples, which would <I>fill their hearts with joy,</I> the soldiers 
 went to bring the same news to the chief priests, which would <I>fill 
 their faces with shame. Some of the watch,</I> probably those of them 
 that commanded in chief, <I>came into the city,</I> and brought to 
 those who employed them, the report of their disappointment. <I>They 
 showed to the chief priests all the things that were done;</I> told 
 them of the earthquake, the descent of the angel, the rolling of the 
 stone away, and the coming of the body of Jesus alive out of the grave. 
 Thus the <I>sign</I> of the prophet Jonas was brought to the chief 
 priests with the most clear and incontestable evidence that could be; 
 and so the utmost means of conviction were afforded them; we may well 
 imagine what a mortification it was to them, and that, like the enemies 
 of the Jews, they were <I>much cast down in their own eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:16">Neh. vi. 16</A>.

 It might justly have been expected that they should now have believed
 in Christ, and repented their putting him to death; but they were 
 obstinate in their infidelity, and therefore sealed up under it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How it was baffled and stifled by them. They called an assembly, 
 and considered what was to be done. For their own parts, they were 
 resolved not to believe that Jesus was risen; but their care was, to 
 keep others from believing, and themselves from being quite ashamed 
 from their disbelief of it. They had put him to death, and there was no 
 way of standing to what they had done, but by confronting the evidence 
 of his resurrection. Thus they who have sold themselves to work 
 wickedness, find that one sin draws on another, and that they have 
 plunged themselves into a wretched necessity of <I>adding iniquity to 
 iniquity,</I> which is part of the curse of Christ's persecutors, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:27">Ps. lxix. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The result of their debate was, that those soldiers must by all means 
 be bribed off, and hired not to tell tales.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They <I>put money into their hands;</I> and what wickedness is it 
 which men will not be brought to by the love of money? They <I>gave 
 large money,</I> probably a great deal more than they gave to Judas, 
 unto <I>the soldiers.</I> These chief priests loved their money as well 
 as most people did, and were as loth to part with it; and yet, to carry 
 on a malicious design against the gospel of Christ, they were very 
 prodigal of it; they gave the soldiers, it is likely, as much as they 
 asked, and they knew how to improve their advantages. Here was <I>large 
 money</I> given for the advancing of that which they knew to be a lie, 
 yet many grudge a little money for the advancement of that which they 
 know to be the truth, though they have a promise of being reimbursed in 
 the resurrection of the just. Let us never starve a good cause, when we 
 see a bad one so liberally supported.</P>

 2. They <I>put a lie into their mouths</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 <I>Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we 
 slept;</I> a sorry shift is better than none, but this is a sorry one 
 indeed. 

 (1.) The sham was <I>ridiculous,</I> and carried along with it its own 
 confutation. If <I>they slept,</I> how could they know any thing of the 
 matter, or say who came? If <I>any one</I> of them was awake to 
 <I>observe it,</I> no doubt, he would awake them all to <I>oppose 
 it;</I> for that was the only thing they had in charge. It was 
 altogether improbable that a company of poor, weak, cowardly, 
 dispirited men should expose themselves for so inconsiderable an 
 achievement as the rescue of the dead body. Why were not the houses 
 where they lodged diligently searched, and other means used to discover 
 the dead body; but this was so thin a lie as one might easily see 
 through. But had it been ever so plausible, 

 (2.) It was a wicked thing for these priests and elders to hire those 
 soldiers to tell a deliberate lie (if it had been in a matter of ever 
 so small importance), against their consciences. Those know not what 
 they do, who draw others to commit one wilful sin; for that may debauch 
 conscience, and be an inlet to many. But, 

 (3.) Considering this as intended to overthrow the great doctrine of 
 Christ's resurrection, this was a sin against the last remedy, and was, 
 in effect, a blasphemy <I>against the Holy Ghost,</I> imputing 
 <I>that</I> to the roguery of the disciples, which was done by <I>the 
 power of the Holy Ghost.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But lest the soldiers should object the penalty they incurred by the 
 Roman law for <I>sleeping upon the guard,</I> which was very severe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:19">Acts xii. 19</A>),

 they promised to interpose with the governor; "<I>We will persuade him, 
 and secure you.</I> We will use our own interest in him, to get him not 
 to take notice of it;" and they had lately found how easily they could 
 manage him. If really these soldiers had slept, and so suffered the 
 disciples to steal him away, as they would have the world believe, the 
 priests and elders would certainly have been the forwardest to solicit 
 the governor to punish them for their treachery; so that <I>their</I> 
 care for the soldiers' safety plainly gives the lie to the story. They 
 undertook to <I>secure</I> them from the sword of Pilate's justice, but 
 could not secure them from the sword of God's justice, which hangs over 
 the head of those that love and make a lie. <I>They</I> promise more
 than they can perform who undertake to save a man harmless in the 
 commission of a wilful sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Well, thus was the plot laid; now what success had it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Those that were <I>willing to deceive,</I> took the money, and did 
 as they were taught. They cared as little for Christ and his religion 
 as the chief priests and elders did; and men that have no religion at 
 all, can be very well pleased to see Christianity run down, and lend a 
 hand to it, if need be, to serve a turn. They <I>took the money;</I> 
 that was it they aimed at, and nothing else. Note, Money is a bait for 
 the blackest temptation; mercenary tongues will sell the truth for 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The great argument to prove Christ to be the Son of God, is, his 
 resurrection, and none could have more convincing proofs of the truth 
 of that than these soldiers had; they saw the angel descend from 
 heaven, saw the stone rolled away, saw the body of Christ come out of 
 the grave, unless the consternation they felt hindered them; and yet 
 they were so far from being convinced by it themselves, that they were 
 hired to belie him, and to hinder others from believing in him. Note, 
 The most sensible evidence will not convince men, without the 
 concurring operation of the Holy Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Those that were willing to be deceived, not only credited, but 
 propagated, the story; This <I>saying is commonly reported among the 
 Jews until this day.</I> The sham took well enough, and answered the 
 end. The Jews, who persisted in their infidelity, when they were 
 pressed with the argument of Christ's resurrection, had this still 
 ready to reply, <I>His disciples came, and stole him away.</I> To this 
 purport was the solemn narrative, which (as Justin Martyr relates in 
 his dialogue with Typho the Jew) the great sanhedrim sent to all the 
 Jews of the dispersion concerning this affair, exciting them to a 
 vigorous resistance of Christianity--that, <I>when they had crucified,
 and buried him, the disciples came by night, and stole him out of the 
 sepulchre,</I> designing thereby not only to overthrow the truth of 
 Christ's resurrection, but to render his disciples odious to the world, 
 as the greatest villains in nature. When once a lie is raised, none 
 knows how far it will spread, nor how long it will last, nor what 
 mischief it will do. Some give another sense of this passage, <I>This 
 saying is commonly reported,</I> that is, "Notwithstanding the artifice 
 of the chief priests, thus to impose upon the people, the collusion 
 that was between them and the soldiers, and the money that was given to 
 support the cheat, were commonly <I>reported</I> and whispered among 
 the Jews;" for one way or other <I>truth will out.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a
 mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
 &nbsp; 17  And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some
 doubted.
 &nbsp; 18  And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is
 given unto me in heaven and in earth.
 &nbsp; 19  Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
 the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
 &nbsp; 20  Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
 commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, <I>even</I> unto the end
 of the world. Amen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This evangelist passes over several other appearances of Christ, 
 recorded by Luke and John, and hastens to this, which was of all other 
 the most solemn, as being promised and appointed again and again before 
 his death, and after his resurrection. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the disciples attended his appearance, according to the 
 appointment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 <I>They went into Galilee,</I> a long journey to go for one sight of 
 Christ, but it was worth while. They had seen him several times at 
 Jerusalem, and yet they went into Galilee, to see him there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Because he appointed them to do so. Though it seemed a needless 
 thing to go into Galilee, to see him whom they might see at Jerusalem, 
 especially when they must so soon come back again to Jerusalem, before 
 his ascension, yet they had learned to obey Christ's commands and not 
 object against them. Note, Those who would maintain communion with 
 Christ, must attend him there where he has appointed. Those who have 
 met him in one ordinance, must attend him in another; those who have 
 seen him at Jerusalem, must go to Galilee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Because that was to be a public and general meeting. They had seen 
 him themselves, and conversed with him in private, but that should not 
 excuse their attendance in a solemn assembly, where many were to be 
 gathered together to see him. Note, Our communion with God in secret 
 must not supersede our attendance on public worship, as we have 
 opportunity; for <I>God loves the gates of Zion,</I> and so must we. 
 The place was a <I>mountain in Galilee,</I> probably the same mountain 
 on which he was transfigured. There they met, for privacy, and perhaps 
 to signify the exalted state into which he was entered, and his 
 advances toward the upper world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they were affected with the appearance of Christ to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Now was the time that he was <I>seen of above five hundred brethren at 
 once,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:6">1 Cor. xv. 6</A>.

 Some think that they saw him, at first, at some distance, above in the 
 air, <B><I>ephthe epano</I></B>--<I>He was seen above, of five hundred 
 brethren</I> (so they read it); which gave occasion to some to doubt, 
 till he <I>came nearer</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and then they were satisfied. We are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they <I>worshipped him;</I> many of them did so, nay, it should 
 seem, they all did that, they gave divine honour to him, which was 
 signified by some outward expressions of adoration. Note, All that see 
 the Lord Jesus with an eye of faith are obliged to <I>worship 
 him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But <I>some doubted,</I> some of those that were then present. Note, 
 Even among those that <I>worship</I> there are some that <I>doubt.</I> 
 The faith of those that are sincere, may yet be very weak and wavering. 
 They <I>doubted,</I> <B><I>edistasan</I></B>--<I>they hung in
 suspense,</I> as the scales of the balance, when it is hard to say 
 which preponderates. These doubts were afterward removed, and their 
 faith grew up to a full assurance, and it tended much to the honour of 
 Christ, that the disciples <I>doubted</I> before they <I>believed;</I> 
 so that they cannot be said to be credulous, and willing to be imposed 
 upon; for they first <I>questioned,</I> and <I>proved all things,</I> 
 and then <I>held fast</I> that which was <I>true,</I> and which they 
 found to be so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What Jesus Christ said to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>);

 <I>Jesus came, and spoke unto them.</I> Though there were those that 
 doubted, yet, he did not therefore reject them; for he will not 
 <I>break the bruised reed.</I> He did not stand at a distance, but 
 <I>came near,</I> and gave them such convincing proofs of his 
 resurrection, as turned the wavering scale, and made their faith to 
 triumph over their doubts. <I>He came, and spoke</I> familiarly <I>to
 them,</I> as one friend speaks to another, that they might be fully 
 satisfied in the commission he was about to give them. He that <I>drew 
 near</I> to God, to speak for us to him, <I>draws near</I> to us, to 
 speak from him to us. Christ now delivered to his apostles the great 
 charter of his kingdom in the world, was sending them out as his 
 ambassadors, and here gives them their credentials.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In opening this great charter, we may observe two things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The commission which our Lord Jesus received himself from the 
 Father. Being about to <I>authorize</I> his apostles, if any ask by 
 what authority he doeth it, and who gave him that authority, here he 
 tells us, <I>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;</I> a 
 very great word, and which none but he could say. Hereby he asserts his 
 universal dominion as Mediator, which is the great foundation of the 
 Christian religion. He has <I>all power.</I> Observe, 

 (1.) <I>Whence</I> he hath this power. He did not assume it, or usurp
 it, but it was <I>given</I> him, he was legally entitled to it, and 
 invested in it, by a grant from him who is the Fountain of all being, 
 and consequently of all power. God <I>set him King</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">Ps. ii. 6</A>),
 
 inaugurated and enthroned him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32">Luke i. 32</A>.

 As God, equal with the Father, all power was originally and essentially 
 <I>his;</I> but as Mediator, as God-man, <I>all power</I> was <I>given 
 him;</I> partly in <I>recompence</I> of his work (because he humbled 
 himself, therefore God thus <I>exalted him</I>), and partly in 
 <I>pursuance</I> of his design; he had this <I>power</I> given him 
 <I>over all flesh,</I> that he might <I>give eternal life to as many as 
 were given him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:2">John xvii. 2</A>),

 for the more effectual carrying on and completing our salvation. This
 power he was now more signally invested in, upon his resurrection, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:3">Acts xiii. 3</A>.

 He had power before, <I>power to forgive sins</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:6"><I>ch.</I> ix. 6</A>);

 but now <I>all power</I> is given him. He is now going to <I>receive
 for himself a kingdom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:12">Luke xix. 12</A>),

 to sit down <I>at the right hand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>.

 Having purchased it, nothing remains but to take possession; it is
 <I>his own</I> for ever. 

 (2.) <I>Where</I> he has this power; in <I>heaven and earth,</I> 
 comprehending the universe. Christ is the sole universal Monarch, he
 is <I>Lord of all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:36">Acts x. 36</A>.

 He has all <I>power in heaven.</I> He has power of dominion over the 
 angels, they are all his humble servants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:20,21">Eph. i. 20, 21</A>.

 He has power of intercession with his Father, in the virtue of his 
 satisfaction and atonement; he intercedes, not as a suppliant, but as a 
 demandant; <I>Father, I will.</I> He has <I>all power on earth</I> too; 
 having prevailed with God, by the sacrifice of atonement, he prevails 
 with men, and deals with them as one having authority, by the ministry 
 of reconciliation. He is indeed, in all causes and over all persons, 
 supreme Moderator and Governor. <I>By him kings reign.</I> All souls 
 are his, and to him <I>every</I> heart and <I>knee must bow,</I> and 
 <I>every tongue confess</I> him to be the <I>Lord.</I> This our Lord 
 Jesus tells them, not only to satisfy them of the authority he had to 
 commission them, and to bring them out in the execution of their 
 commission, but to take off the offence of the cross; they had no 
 reason to be ashamed of <I>Christ crucified,</I> when they saw him 
 <I>thus glorified.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The commission he gives to those whom he sent forth; <I>Go ye 
 therefore.</I> This commission is given, 

 (1.) To the <I>apostles</I> primarily, the chief ministers of state in 
 Christ's kingdom, the architects that laid the foundation of the 
 church. Now those that had followed Christ in the regeneration, were
 <I>set on thrones</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:30">Luke xxii. 30</A>);

 <I>Go ye.</I> It is not only a word of command, like that, <I>Son, go 
 work,</I> but a word of encouragement, <I>Go,</I> and <I>fear not, have 
 I not sent you?</I> Go, and make a business of this work. They must not 
 <I>take state,</I> and issue out summons to the nations to attend upon 
 them; but they must go, and bring the gospel to their doors, <I>Go 
 ye.</I> They had doted on Christ's <I>bodily presence,</I> and hung 
 upon <I>that,</I> and built all their joys and hopes upon <I>that;</I> 
 but now Christ discharges them from further attendance on his person, 
 and sends them abroad about other work. <I>As an eagle stirs up her 
 nest, flutters over her young,</I> to excite them to fly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:11">Deut. xxxii. 11</A>),
 
 so Christ stirs up his disciples, to disperse themselves over all the 
 world. 

 (2.) It is given to their successors, the ministers of the gospel, 
 whose business it is to transmit the gospel from age to age, to the end 
 of the world in time, as it was theirs to transmit it from nation to 
 nation, to the end of the world in place, and no less necessary. The 
 Old-Testament promise of a gospel ministry is made to a succession 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:21">Isa. lix. 21</A>);

 and this must be so understood, otherwise how could Christ be with them 
 always to the <I>consummation of the world?</I> Christ, at his 
 ascension, gave not only apostles and prophets, but <I>pastors and 
 teachers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:11">Eph. iv. 11</A>.
 
 Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] How far his commission is extended; to <I>all nations.</I> Go, and 
 disciples <I>all nations.</I> Not that they must go all together into 
 every place, but by consent disperse themselves in such manner as might 
 best <I>diffuse</I> the light of the gospel. Now this plainly signifies 
 it to be the will of Christ, <I>First,</I> That the covenant of 
 peculiarity, made with the Jews, should now be cancelled and 
 disannulled. This word broke down the middle wall of partition, which 
 had so long excluded the Gentiles from a visible church-state; and 
 whereas the apostles, when first sent out, were forbidden to go into 
 the way of the Gentiles, now they were sent to <I>all nations. 
 Secondly,</I> That salvation by Christ should be offered to all, and 
 none excluded that did not by their unbelief and impenitence exclude 
 themselves. The salvation they were to preach is a <I>common 
 salvation;</I> whoever will, let him come, and take the benefit of the 
 <I>act of indemnity;</I> for there is no difference of Jew or Greek in 
 Christ Jesus. <I>Thirdly,</I> That Christianity should be twisted in 
 with national constitutions, that the kingdoms of the world should 
 become Christ's kingdoms, and their kings the church's 
 nursing-fathers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What is the principal intention of this commission; to 
 <I>disciple</I> all nations. <B><I>Matheteusate</I></B>--"<I>Admit them
 disciples;</I> do your utmost to make the nations Christian nations;" 
 not, "Go to the nations, and denounce the judgments of God against 
 them, as Jonah against Nineveh, and as the other Old-Testament 
 prophets" (though they had reason enough to expect it for their 
 wickedness), "but go, and <I>disciple them.</I>" Christ the Mediator is 
 setting up a kingdom in the world, bring the nations to be his 
 subjects; setting up a school, bring the nations to be his scholars; 
 raising an army for the carrying on of the war against the powers of 
 darkness, enlist the nations of the earth under his banner. The work 
 which the apostles had to do, was, to set up the Christian religion in 
 all places, and it was honourable work; the achievements of the mighty 
 heroes of the world were nothing to it. They conquered the nations for 
 themselves, and made them miserable; the apostles conquered them for 
 Christ, and made them happy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] Their instructions for executing this commission.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> They must <I>admit disciples</I> by the <I>sacred rite of 
 baptism;</I> "Go into all nations, preach the gospel to them, work 
 miracles among them, and persuade them to come in themselves, and bring 
 their children with them, into the church of Christ, and then admit 
 them and theirs into the church, by washing them with water;" either 
 dipping them in the water, or pouring or sprinkling water upon them, 
 which seems the more proper, because the thing is most frequently 
 expressed so, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:3">Isa. xliv. 3</A>,

 <I>I will pour my Spirit on thy seed.</I> And, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:5,6">Tit. iii. 5, 6</A>,

 <I>Which he shed on us abundantly.</I> And, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:25">Ezek. xxxvi. 25</A>,

 <I>I will sprinkle clean water upon you.</I> And, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:15">Isa. lii. 15</A>,

 <I>So shall he sprinkle many nations;</I> which seems a prophecy of
 this commission to <I>baptize the nations.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> This baptism must be administered <I>in the name of
 the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</I> That is,

 1. <I>By authority from heaven,</I> and not <I>of man;</I> for his 
 ministers act by authority from the three persons in the Godhead, who 
 all concur, as to our <I>creation,</I> so to our <I>redemption;</I> 
 they have their commission under the great seal of heaven, which puts 
 an honour upon the ordinance, though to a carnal eye, like him that 
 instituted it, it has <I>no form or comeliness.</I> 

 2. <I>Calling upon the name</I> of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
 Every thing is sanctified by prayer, and particularly the waters of 
 baptism. The prayer of faith obtains the presence of God with the 
 ordinance, which is its lustre and beauty, its life and efficacy. But, 
 
 3. It is <I>into the name</I> (<B><I>eis to onoma</I></B>) of
 <I>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;</I> this was intended as the 
 <I>summary</I> of the first principles of the Christian religion, and 
 of the new covenant, and according to it the ancient creeds were drawn 
 up. By our being baptized, we solemnly profess,

 (1.) Our <I>assent</I> to the scripture-revelation concerning <I>God, 
 the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</I> We confess our belief that there 
 is a God, that there is but <I>one God,</I> that in the Godhead there 
 is a <I>Father</I> that <I>begets,</I> a <I>Son</I> that is 
 <I>begotten,</I> and a Holy <I>Spirit</I> of both. We are baptized, not 
 into the <I>names,</I> but into the <I>name,</I> of Father, Son, and 
 Spirit, which plainly intimates that <I>these three are one,</I> and 
 <I>their name one.</I> The distinct mentioning of the <I>three 
 persons</I> in the Trinity, both in the <I>Christian baptism</I> here, 
 and in the <I>Christian blessing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:14">2 Cor. xiii. 14</A>),

 as it is a full proof of the doctrine of the Trinity, so it has done 
 much towards preserving it pure and entire through all ages of the 
 church; for nothing is more great and awful in <I>Christian 
 assemblies</I> than these two. 

 (2.) Our <I>consent</I> to a covenant-relation to God, <I>the Father, 
 Son, and Holy Ghost.</I> Baptism is a <I>sacrament,</I> that is, it is 
 <I>an oath; super sacramentum dicere,</I> is <I>to say upon oath.</I> 
 It is an oath of <I>abjuration,</I> by which we renounce the world and 
 the flesh, as rivals with God for the throne in our hearts; and an oath 
 of <I>allegiance,</I> by which we resign and give up <I>ourselves</I> 
 to God, to be <I>his,</I> our own selves, our whole selves, <I>body, 
 soul, and spirit,</I> to be governed by his will, and made happy in his 
 favour; <I>we become his men,</I> so the form of homage in our law 
 runs. Therefore <I>baptism</I> is applied to <I>the person,</I> as 
 <I>livery</I> and <I>seisin</I> is given of the premises, because it is 
 the person that is <I>dedicated</I> to God.

 [1.] It is into the name of <I>the Father,</I> believing him to be the 
 <I>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</I> (for that is principally 
 intended here), by <I>eternal generation,</I> and <I>our Father,</I> as 
 our Creator, Preserver, and Benefactor, to whom therefore we resign 
 ourselves, as our absolute <I>owner</I> and <I>proprietor,</I> to 
 actuate us, and dispose of us; as our supreme <I>rector</I> and 
 <I>governor,</I> to rule us, as free agents, by his law; and as our 
 <I>chief good,</I> and <I>highest</I> end. 

 [2.] It is into the name of <I>the Son,</I> the <I>Lord Jesus 
 Christ,</I> the <I>Son of God,</I> and <I>correlate</I> to the Father.
 Baptism was in a particular manner administered <I>in the name of the 
 Lord Jesus,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:16,19:5">Acts viii. 16; xix. 5</A>.

 In baptism we <I>assent,</I> as Peter did, <I>Thou art Christ, the Son
 of the living God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:16"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 16</A>),

 and <I>consent,</I> as Thomas did, <I>My Lord, and my God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:28">John xx. 28</A>.

 We take Christ to be our Prophet, Priest, and King, and give up
 ourselves to be taught, and saved, and ruled, by him. 

 [3.] It is into the name of <I>the Holy Ghost.</I> Believing the 
 Godhead of the Holy Spirit, and his agency in carrying on our 
 redemption, we give up ourselves to his conduct and operation, as our 
 sanctifier, teacher, guide, and comforter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> Those that are thus baptized, and enrolled among the 
 disciples of Christ, must be taught 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 <I>Teaching them to observe all thing, whatsoever I have commanded 
 you.</I> This denotes two things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The duty of <I>disciples,</I> of all <I>baptized Christians;</I> 
 they must observe all things whatsoever Christ has commanded, and, in 
 order to that, must submit to the teaching of those whom he sends. Our 
 admission into the visible church is in order to something further; 
 when Christ hath <I>discipled</I> us, he hath not <I>done with us;</I> 
 he <I>enlist</I> soldiers that he may <I>train them</I> up for his 
 service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All that are baptized, are thereby obliged, 

 (1.) To make the command of Christ their rule. There is a <I>law of 
 faith,</I> and we are said to be <I>under the law to Christ;</I> we are 
 by baptism <I>bound,</I> and must <I>obey.</I> 

 (2.) To <I>observe</I> what Christ has commanded. Due <I>obedience</I> 
 to the commands of Christ requires a diligent observation; we are in 
 danger of missing, if we take not <I>good heed:</I> and in all our 
 obedience, we must have an eye to the command, and do what we do as 
 unto the Lord. 

 (3.) To observe <I>all things,</I> that he has commanded, without 
 exception; all the <I>moral</I> duties, and all the <I>instituted</I> 
 ordinances. Our obedience to the laws of Christ is not <I>sincere,</I> 
 if it be not universal; we must <I>stand complete in his whole 
 will.</I> 

 (4.) To confine themselves to the commands of Christ, and as not to 
 <I>diminish</I> from them, so not to <I>add</I> to them. 

 (5.) To learn their duty according to the law of Christ, from those 
 whom he has appointed to be teachers in his school, for 
 <I>therefore</I> we were entered into his school.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The duty of the apostles of Christ, and his ministers; and that is, 
 to <I>beach</I> the commands of Christ, to expound them to his 
 disciples, to press upon them the necessity of obedience, and to assist 
 them in applying the general commands of Christ to particular cases. 
 They must teach <I>them,</I> not their own inventions, but the 
 institutions of Christ; to them they must religiously adhere, and in 
 the knowledge of <I>them</I> Christians must be <I>trained up.</I> A 
 <I>standing</I> ministry is hereby <I>settled</I> in the church, for 
 the <I>edifying</I> of the body of Christ, <I>till we all come to the 
 perfect man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:11-13">Eph. iv. 11-13</A>.

 The heirs of heaven, till they come to age, must be <I>under tutors and
 governors.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here is the assurance he gives them of his spiritual presence with 
 them in the execution of this commission; <I>And lo, I am with you 
 always, even unto the end of the world.</I> This exceeding great and 
 precious promise is ushered in with a <I>behold,</I> to strengthen 
 their faith, and engage their observation of it. "Take notice of this; 
 it is what you may assure yourselves of and venture upon." Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The favour promised them; <I>I am with you.</I> Not, <I>I will 
 be</I> with you, but <I>I am</I>--<B><I>ego eimi</I></B>. As God sent
 Moses, so Christ sent his apostles, by this name, <I>I am;</I> for he 
 is God, to whom past, present, and to come, are the same. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:8">Rev. i. 8</A>.

 He was now about to leave them; his bodily presence was now to be
 removed from them, and this grieved them; but he assures them of his 
 <I>spiritual</I> presence, which was more expedient for them than his 
 bodily presence could be; <I>I am with you;</I> that is, "My Spirit is 
 with you, the Comforter shall <I>abide with you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:7">John xvi. 7</A>.

 I am <I>with you,</I> and not <I>against you:</I> with you to take your
 part, to be on your side, and to <I>hold</I> with you, as Michael our 
 prince is said to do,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+10:21">Dan. x. 21</A>.

 I am <I>with you,</I> and not <I>absent from you,</I> not at a
 distance; I am a very <I>present help,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:1">Ps. xlvi. 1</A>.

 Christ was now sending them to set up his kingdom in the world, which
 was a great undertaking. And then doth he seasonably promise them his 
 presence with them,

 [1.] To <I>carry them</I> on through the difficulties they were likely 
 to meet with. "I am with you, to <I>bear you up,</I> to plead your 
 cause; with you in all your services, in all your sufferings, to bring 
 you through them with comfort and honour. <I>When you go through the 
 fire or water, I will be with you.</I> In the pulpit, in the prison, 
 <I>lo, I am with you.</I>" 

 [2.] To <I>succeed</I> this great undertaking; "Lo, <I>I am with 
 you,</I> to make your ministry effectual for the discipling of the 
 nations, for the <I>pulling down</I> of the strong holds of Satan, and 
 the setting up of stronger for the Lord Jesus." It was an unlikely 
 thing that they should unhinge national constitutions in religion, and 
 turn the stream of so long a usage; that they should <I>establish</I> a 
 doctrine so directly contrary to the genius of the age, and persuade 
 people to become the disciples of a <I>crucified</I> Jesus; but <I>lo, 
 I am with you,</I> and therefore you shall <I>gain your point.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The continuance of the favour, <I>always, even unto the end of the 
 world.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They shall have his <I>constant</I> presence; <I>Always,</I> 
 <B><I>pasas tas hemeras</I></B>--<I>all days,</I> every day. "I will be
 with you on sabbath days and week days, fair days and foul days, winter 
 days and summer days." There is no day, no hour of the day, in which 
 our Lord Jesus is not present with his churches and with his ministers; 
 if there were, that day, that hour, they were undone. Since his 
 resurrection he had appeared to them <I>now and then,</I> once a week 
 it may be, and scarcely that. But he assures them that they shall have 
 his spiritual presence continued to them without intermission. Wherever 
 we are the word of Christ is nigh us, even <I>in our mouth,</I> and the 
 Spirit of Christ nigh us, even <I>in our hearts.</I> The <I>God of 
 Israel,</I> the <I>Saviour,</I> is sometimes <I>a God that hideth 
 himself</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:15">Isa. xlv. 15</A>),

 but never a God that absenteth himself; sometimes <I>in the dark,</I> 
 but never <I>at a distance.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] They shall have his perpetual presence, even to <I>the end of the 
 world.</I> There is a world before us, that will never have an end, but 
 this is hastening towards its period; and even till then the Christian 
 religion shall, in one part of the world or other, be <I>kept up,</I> 
 and the presence of Christ continued with his ministers. I am with you 
 <I>to the end of the world,</I> not with your persons, they died 
 quickly, but, <I>First,</I> With <I>you and your writings.</I> There is 
 a divine power going along with the scripture of the New Testament, not 
 only preserving them in being, but producing strange effects by them, 
 which will continue to the end of time. <I>Secondly,</I> With you and 
 <I>your successors;</I> with you and all the ministers of the gospel in 
 the several ages of the church; with all to whom this commission 
 extends, with all who, being duly called and sent, thus <I>baptize</I> 
 and thus <I>teach.</I> When the <I>end of the world</I> is come, and 
 the kingdom delivered up to God, even the Father, there will then be no 
 further need of ministers and their ministration; but till then they 
 shall continue, and the great intentions of the institution shall be 
 answered. This is an encouraging word to all the faithful ministers of 
 Christ, that what was said to the apostles, was said to them all, <I>I 
 will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two solemn farewells we find our Lord Jesus giving to his church, and 
 his parting word at both of them is very encouraging; one was here, 
 when he closed up his personal converse with them, and then his parting 
 word was, "<I>Lo, I am with you always;</I> I leave you, and yet still
 I am with you;" the other was, when he closed up the canon of the 
 scripture by the pen of his beloved disciple, and then his parting word 
 was, "<I>Surely, I come quickly.</I> I leave you for awhile, but I will 
 be with you again shortly," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:20">Rev. xxii. 20</A>.

 By this it appears that he did not part in anger, but in love, and that
 it is his will we should keep up both our communion with him and our 
 expectation of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There is one word more remaining, which must not be overlooked, and 
 that is <I>Amen;</I> which is not a cipher, intended only for a 
 concluding word, like <I>finis</I> at the end of a book, but it has its 
 significancy. 

 1. It bespeaks Christ's confirmation of this promise, <I>Lo, I am with 
 you.</I> It is his <I>Amen,</I> in whom all the promises are <I>Yea and 
 Amen, "Verily</I> I am, and will be, with you; I the Amen, the faithful 
 Witness, do assure you of it." Or, 

 2. It bespeaks the church's concurrence with it, in their desire, and 
 prayer, and expectation. It is the evangelist's <I>Amen--So be it,</I> 
 blessed Lord. Our <I>Amen</I> to Christ's promises turns them into 
 prayers. Hath Christ promised to be present with his ministers,
 present in his word, present in the assemblies of his people, though 
 but two or three are gathered together in his name, and this <I>always, 
 even to the end of the world?</I> Let us heartily say <I>Amen</I> to 
 it; believe that it <I>shall be so,</I> and pray that it <I>may be 
 so:</I> Lord, <I>Remember this word unto thy servants, upon which thou 
 hast caused us to hope.</I></P>
