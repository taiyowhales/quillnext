 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of Christ's discourse in this chapter is to awaken and
 quicken us all so to use this world as not to abuse it, so to manage
 all our possessions and enjoyments here as that they may make for us,
 and may not make against us in the other world; for they will do either
 the one or the other, according as we use them now.

 I. If we do good with them, and lay out what we have in works of piety
 and charity, we shall reap the benefit of it in the world to come; and
 this he shows in the parable of the unjust steward, who made so good a
 hand of his lord's goods that, when he was turned out of his
 stewardship, he had a comfortable subsistence to betake himself to. The
 parable itself we have

 the explanation and application of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>);

 and the contempt which the Pharisees put upon the doctrine Christ 
 preached to them, for which he sharply reproved them, adding some other
 weighty sayings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:14-18">ver. 14-18</A>.

 II. It, instead of doing good with our worldly enjoyments, we make them
 the food and fuel of our lusts, of our luxury and sensuality, and deny 
 relief to the poor, we shall certainly perish eternally, and the things 
 of this world, which were thus abused, will but add to our misery and 
 torment. This he shows in the other parable of the rich man and 
 Lazarus, which has likewise a further intention, and that is, to awaken 
 us all to take the warning given us by the written word, and not to 
 expect immediate messages from the other world,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich
 man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that
 he had wasted his goods.
 &nbsp; 2 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear
 this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest
 be no longer steward.
 &nbsp; 3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my
 lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I
 am ashamed.
 &nbsp; 4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the
 stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
 &nbsp; 5 So he called every one of his lord's debtors <I>unto him,</I> and
 said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?
 &nbsp; 6 And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto
 him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
 &nbsp; 7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he
 said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take
 thy bill, and write fourscore.
 &nbsp; 8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had
 done wisely: for the children of this world are in their
 generation wiser than the children of light.
 &nbsp; 9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon
 of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into
 everlasting habitations.
 &nbsp; 10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also
 in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in
 much.
 &nbsp; 11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
 mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <I>riches?</I>
 &nbsp; 12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another
 man's, who shall give you that which is your own?
 &nbsp; 13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate
 the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
 despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
 &nbsp; 14 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these
 things: and they derided him.
 &nbsp; 15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves
 before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly
 esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.
 &nbsp; 16 The law and the prophets <I>were</I> until John: since that time
 the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.
 &nbsp; 17 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one
 tittle of the law to fail.
 &nbsp; 18 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,
 committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away
 from <I>her</I> husband committeth adultery.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We mistake if we imagine that the design of Christ's doctrine and holy 
 religion was either to amuse us with notions of divine mysteries or to 
 entertain us with notions of divine mercies. No, the divine revelation 
 of both these in the gospel is intended to engage and quicken us to the 
 practice of Christian duties, and, as much as any one thing, to the 
 duty of beneficence and doing good to those who stand in need of any 
 thing that either we have or can do for them. This our Saviour is here 
 pressing us to, by reminding us that we are but <I>stewards of the 
 manifold grace of God;</I> and since we have in divers instances been 
 unfaithful, and have forfeited the favour of our Lord, it is our wisdom 
 to think how we may, some other way, make what we have in the world 
 turn to a good account. Parables must not be forced beyond their 
 primary intention, and therefore we must not hence infer that any one 
 can befriend us if we lie under the displeasure of our Lord, but that, 
 in the general, we must so lay out what we have in works of piety and 
 charity as that we may meet it again with comfort on the other side 
 death and the grave. If we would act wisely, we must be diligent and 
 industrious to employ our riches in the acts of piety and charity, in 
 order to promote our future and eternal welfare, as worldly men are in 
 laying them out to the greatest temporal profit, in making to 
 themselves friends with them, and securing other secular interests. So 
 <I>Dr. Clarke.</I> Now let us consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The parable itself, in which all the children of men are represented 
 as <I>stewards</I> of what they have in this world, and we are but 
 stewards. Whatever we have, the property of it is God's; we have only 
 the use of it, and that according to the direction of our great Lord, 
 and for his honour. Rabbi Kimchi, quoted by Dr. Lightfoot, says, "This 
 world is a house; heaven the roof; the stars the lights; the earth, 
 with its fruits, a table spread; the Master of the house is the holy 
 and blessed God; man is the steward, into whose hands the goods of this 
 house are delivered; if he behave himself well, he shall find favour in 
 the eyes of his Lord; if not, he shall be turned out of his 
 stewardship." Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is the <I>dishonesty</I> of this <I>steward.</I> He <I>wasted 
 his lord's goods,</I> embezzled them, misapplied them, or through 
 carelessness suffered them to be lost and damaged; and for this he was 
 <I>accused to his lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 We are all <I>liable</I> to the same charge. We have not made a due
 improvement of what God has entrusted us with in this world, but have 
 perverted his purpose; and, that we may not be for this <I>judged of 
 our Lord,</I> it concerns us to <I>judge ourselves.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His <I>discharge</I> out of his place. His lord <I>called for 
 him,</I> and said, "<I>How is it that I hear this of thee?</I> I 
 expected better things from thee." He speaks as one sorry to find 
 himself disappointed in him, and under a necessity of dismissing him 
 from his service: it troubles him to hear it; but the steward cannot 
 deny it, and therefore there is no remedy, he must make up his 
 accounts; and be gone in a little time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Now this is designed to teach us,

 (1.) That we must all of us shortly be discharged from <I>our 
 stewardship</I> in this world; we must not always enjoy those things 
 which we now enjoy. Death will come, and <I>dismiss</I> us from our 
 stewardship, will <I>deprive</I> us of the abilities and opportunities 
 we now have of doing good, and others will come in our places and have 
 the same. 

 (2.) That our discharge from our stewardship at death is <I>just,</I> 
 and what we have deserved, for we have wasted our Lord's goods, and 
 thereby forfeited our trust, so that we cannot complain of any wrong 
 done us. 

 (3.) That when our stewardship is taken from us we must <I>give an 
 account</I> of it to our Lord: <I>After death the judgment.</I> We are 
 fairly warned both of our discharge and our account, and ought to be 
 frequently thinking of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His <I>after-wisdom.</I> Now he began to consider, <I>What shall I 
 do?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He would have done well to have considered this before he had so
 foolishly thrown himself out of a good place by his unfaithfulness; but 
 it is better to <I>consider</I> late than never. Note, Since we have
 all received notice that we must shortly be turned out of our 
 stewardship, we are concerned to consider what we shall do then. He 
 must live; which way shall he have a livelihood?

 (1.) He knows that he has not such a degree of industry in him as to 
 get his living by work: "<I>I cannot dig;</I> I cannot earn by bread by 
 my labour." But why can he not dig? It does not appear that he is 
 either old or lame; but the truth is, he is <I>lazy.</I> His 
 <I>cannot</I> is a <I>will not;</I> it is not a natural but a moral 
 disability that he labours under; if his master, when he turned him out 
 of the stewardship, had continued him in his service as a labourer, and 
 set a task-master over him, he would have made him dig. He <I>cannot 
 dig,</I> for he was never used to it. Now this intimates that we cannot 
 get a livelihood for our souls by any labour for this world, nor indeed 
 do any thing to purpose for our souls by any ability of our own. 

 (2.) He knows that he has not such a degree of <I>humility</I> as to 
 get his bread by begging: To <I>beg I am ashamed.</I> This was the 
 language of his pride, as the former of his slothfulness. Those whom 
 God, in his providence, has disabled to help themselves, should not be 
 <I>ashamed</I> to ask relief of others. This steward had more reason to 
 be ashamed of cheating his master than of begging his bread. 

 (3.) He therefore determines to make friends of his lord's debtors, or 
 his tenants that were behind with their rent, and had given notes under 
 their hands for it: "<I>I am resolved what to do,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 My lord turns me out of his house. I have none of my own to go to. I am
 acquainted with my lord's tenants, have done them many a good turn, and 
 now I will do them one more, which will so oblige them that they will 
 bid me welcome to their houses, and the best entertainment they afford; 
 and so long as I live, at least till I can better dispose of myself, I 
 will quarter upon them, and go from one good house to another." Now the 
 way he would take to make them his friends was by striking off a 
 considerable part of their debt to his lord, and giving it in his 
 accounts so much less than it was. Accordingly, he sent for one, who 
 owed his lord <I>a hundred measures of oil</I> (in that commodity he 
 paid his rent): <I>Take thy bill,</I> said he, here it is, and <I>sit 
 down quickly, and write fifty</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 so he reduced his debt to the one half. Observe, he was in haste to 
 have it done: "<I>Sit down quickly,</I> and do it, lest we be taken 
 treating, and suspected." He took another, who owed his lord <I>a 
 hundred measures of wheat,</I> and from his bill he cut off a fifth 
 part, and bade him write <I>fourscore</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 probably he did the like by others, abating more or less according as 
 he expected kindness from them. See here what uncertain things our 
 worldly possessions are; they are most so to those who have most of 
 them, who devolve upon others all the care concerning them, and so put 
 it into their power to <I>cheat them,</I> because they will not trouble 
 themselves to see with their own eyes. See also what treachery is to be 
 found even among those in whom trust is reposed. How hard is it to find 
 one that confidence can be reposed in! <I>Let God be true, but every 
 man a liar.</I> Though this steward is turned out for dealing 
 dishonestly, yet still he does so. So rare is it for men to mend of a 
 fault, though they smart for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The approbation of this: <I>The lord commended the unjust steward, 
 because he had done wisely,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It may be meant of <I>his lord,</I> the lord of that servant, who,
 though he could not but be angry at his knavery, yet was pleased with 
 his ingenuity and policy for himself; but, taking it so, the latter 
 part of the verse must be the words of <I>our Lord,</I> and therefore I 
 think the whole is meant of him. Christ did, as it were, say, "Now 
 commend me to such a man as this, that knows how to do well for 
 himself, how to improve a present opportunity, and how to provide for a 
 future necessity." He does not commend him because he had done 
 <I>falsely</I> to his master, but because he had done <I>wisely</I> for 
 himself. Yet perhaps herein he did well for his master too, and but 
 justly with the tenants. He knew what <I>hard bargains</I> he had 
 <I>set them,</I> so that they could not <I>pay their rent,</I> but, 
 having been screwed up by his rigour, were thrown <I>behindhand,</I> 
 and they and their families were likely to go to ruin; in consideration 
 of this, he now, at going off, did as he ought to do both in justice 
 and charity, not only easing them of part of their arrears, but abating 
 their rent for the future. <I>How much owest thou?</I> may mean, "What 
 rent dost thou sit upon? Come, I will set thee an easier bargain, and 
 yet no easier than what thou oughtest to have." He had been <I>all for 
 his lord,</I> but now he begins to consider the tenants, that he might 
 have <I>their favour</I> when he had lost <I>his lord's.</I> The 
 abating of their rent would be a lasting kindness, and more likely to 
 engage them than abating their arrears only. Now this forecast of his, 
 for a comfortable subsistence in this world, shames our improvidence 
 for another world: <I>The children of this world,</I> who choose and 
 have their portions in it, <I>are wiser for their generation,</I> act 
 more considerately, and better consult their worldly interest and 
 advantage, than the <I>children of light,</I> who enjoy the gospel, in 
 <I>their generation,</I> that is, in the concerns of their souls and 
 eternity. Note,

 (1.) The wisdom of worldly people in the concerns of this world is to 
 be <I>imitated</I> by us in the concerns of our souls: it is their 
 principle to improve their opportunities, to do that first which is 
 most needful, in summer and harvest to lay up for winter, to take a 
 good bargain when it is offered them, to trust the <I>faithful</I> and 
 not the <I>false.</I> O that we were thus wise in our spiritual 
 affairs!

 (2.) The children of light are commonly <I>outdone</I> by the children 
 of this world. Not that the children of this world are <I>truly 
 wise;</I> it is only <I>in their generation.</I> But in that they are 
 <I>wiser than the children of light in theirs;</I> for, though we are 
 told that we must shortly be <I>turned out of our stewardship,</I> yet 
 we do not provide as we were to be <I>here always</I> and as if there 
 were not <I>another life after this,</I> and are not so solicitous as 
 this steward was to provide for <I>hereafter.</I> Though as <I>children 
 of the light,</I> that light to which life and immortality are brought 
 by the gospel, we cannot but see <I>another world</I> before us, yet we 
 do not prepare for it, do not send our best effects and best affections 
 thither, as we should.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The application of this parable, and the inferences drawn from it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>I say unto you,</I> you my disciples" (for to them this parable is 
 directed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 "though you have but little in this world, consider how you may do good 
 with that little." Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What it is that our Lord Jesus here exhorts us to; to provide for 
 our comfortable reception to the happiness of another world, by making 
 good use of our possessions and enjoyments in this world: "<I>Make to 
 yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,</I> as the steward 
 with his lord's goods made his lord's tenants his friends." It is the 
 wisdom of the men of this world so to manage their money as that they 
 may have the benefit of it hereafter, and not for the present only; 
 therefore they put it out to interest, buy land with it, put it into 
 this or the other fund. Now we should learn of them to make use of our 
 money so as that we may be the better for it hereafter in another 
 world, as they do in hopes to be the better for it hereafter in this 
 world; so <I>cast it upon the waters</I> as that we may <I>find it 
 again after many days,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:1">Eccl. xi. 1</A>.

 And in our case, though whatever we have <I>are our Lord's goods,</I>
 yet, as long as we dispose of them among <I>our Lord's tenants</I> and 
 for their advantage, it is so far from being reckoned a wrong to our 
 Lord, that it is a duty to him as well as policy for ourselves. Note,

 (1.) The things of this world are the <I>mammon of unrighteousness,</I> 
 or the false <I>mammon,</I> not only because often got by fraud and 
 unrighteousness, but because those who trust to it for satisfaction and 
 happiness will certainly be deceived; for riches are perishing things, 
 and will disappoint those that raise their expectations from them. 

 (2.) Though this <I>mammon of unrighteousness</I> is not to be 
 <I>trusted to</I> for a happiness, yet it may and must be <I>made use 
 of</I> in subserviency to our pursuit of that which is our happiness. 
 Though we cannot find true satisfaction in it, yet we may <I>make to 
 ourselves friends</I> with it, not by way of <I>purchase or merit,</I> 
 but <I>recommendation;</I> so we may make God and Christ our friends, 
 the good angels and saints our friends, and the poor our friends; and 
 it is a desirable thing to be <I>befriended</I> in the account and 
 state to come. 

 (3.) At death we must all <I>fail,</I> <B><I>hotan 
 eklipete</I></B>--<I>when ye suffer an eclipse.</I> Death eclipses us.
 A tradesman is said to <I>fail</I> when he becomes a <I>bankrupt.</I> 
 We must all thus fail shortly; death shuts up the shop, seals up the 
 hand. Our comforts and enjoyments on earth will <I>all fail</I> us; 
 flesh and heart fail. 

 (4.) It ought to be our great concern to make it sure to ourselves, 
 that <I>when</I> we <I>fail</I> at death we may be <I>received into 
 everlasting habitations</I> in heaven. The <I>habitations</I> in heaven 
 are <I>everlasting,</I> not <I>made with hands,</I> but <I>eternal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:1">2 Cor. v. 1</A>.

 Christ is gone before, to prepare a place for those that are his, and
 is there ready to <I>receive them;</I> the bosom of Abraham is ready to 
 receive them, and, when a <I>guard of angels</I> carries them thither, 
 a <I>choir of angels</I> is ready to receive them there. The poor 
 saints that are gone before to glory will receive those that in this 
 world distributed to their necessities.

 (5.) This is a good reason why we should use what we have in the world 
 for the honour of God and the good of our brethren, that thus we may 
 with them <I>lay up in store a good bond,</I> a good security, a good 
 foundation <I>for the time to come,</I> for an eternity to come. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:17-19">1 Tim. vi. 17-19</A>,

 which explains this here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. With what arguments he presses this exhortation to abound in works 
 of piety and charity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) If we do not make a right use of the <I>gifts of God's 
 providence,</I> how can we expect from him those present and future 
 comforts which are the <I>gifts of his spiritual grace?</I> Our Saviour 
 here compares these, and shows that though our faithful use of the 
 things of this world cannot be thought to merit any favour at the hand 
 of God, yet our unfaithfulness in the use of them may be justly 
 reckoned a <I>forfeiture</I> of that grace which is necessary to bring 
 us to glory, and that is it which our Saviour here shows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:10-14"><I>v.</I> 10-14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The riches of this world are the <I>less;</I> grace and glory are
 the <I>greater.</I> Now if we be unfaithful in the less, if we use the 
 things of this world to other purposes than those for which they were 
 given us, it may justly be feared that we should be so in the gifts of 
 God's grace, that we should receive them also in vain, and therefore 
 they will be denied us: <I>He that is faithful in that which is least 
 is faithful also in much.</I> He that serves God, and does good, with 
 his money, will serve God, and do good, with the more noble and 
 valuable talents of wisdom and grace, and spiritual gifts, and the 
 earnests of heaven; but he that buries the <I>one talent</I> of this 
 world's wealth will never improve the <I>five talents</I> of spiritual 
 riches. God withholds his grace from covetous worldly people more than 
 we are aware of. 

 [2.] The riches of this world are <I>deceitful</I> and 
 <I>uncertain;</I> they are the <I>unrighteous mammon,</I> which is 
 hastening from us apace, and, if we would make any advantage of it, we 
 must bestir ourselves quickly; if we do not, how can we expect to be 
 entrusted with spiritual riches, which are the only <I>true riches?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Let us be convinced of this, that those are <I>truly</I> rich, and
 <I>very</I> rich, who are rich in <I>faith,</I> and rich <I>towards 
 God,</I> rich in Christ, in the promises, and in the earnests of 
 heaven; and therefore let us lay up our treasure in them, expect our 
 portion from them, and mind them in the first place, the <I>kingdom of 
 God and the righteousness thereof,</I> and then, if other things be 
 added to us, use them <I>in ordine ad spiritualia--with a spiritual 
 reference,</I> so that by using them well we may take the faster hold 
 of the <I>true riches,</I> and may be qualified to receive yet <I>more 
 grace</I> from God; <I>for God giveth to a man that is good in his 
 sight,</I> that is, to a free-hearted charitable man, <I>wisdom, and 
 knowledge, and joy</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:26">Eccl. ii. 26</A>);

 that is, to a man that is <I>faithful in the unrighteous mammon,</I> he 
 gives the <I>true riches.</I>

 [3.] The riches of this world are <I>another man's.</I> They are 
 <B><I>ta allotria</I></B>, not <I>our own;</I> for they are foreign to 
 the soul and its nature and interest. They are not <I>our own;</I> for 
 they are God's; his title to them is prior and superior to ours; the 
 property remains in him, we are but usufructuaries. They are <I>another 
 man's;</I> we have them from others; we use them for others, and 
 <I>what good has the owner</I> from his <I>goods</I> that 
 <I>increase,</I> save <I>the beholding of them with his eyes,</I> while 
 still <I>they are increased that eat them;</I> and we must shortly 
 leave them to others, and we know not to whom? But spiritual and 
 eternal riches are <I>our own</I> (they enter into the soul that 
 becomes <I>possessed</I> of them) and <I>inseparably;</I> they are a 
 good part that will never be taken away from us. If we make Christ our 
 own, and the promises our own, and heaven our own, we have that which 
 we may truly call <I>our own.</I> But how can we expect God should 
 <I>enrich us</I> with these if we do not serve him with our worldly 
 possessions, of which we are but stewards?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We have no other way to prove ourselves the servants of God than 
 by giving up ourselves so entirely to his service as to make 
 <I>mammon,</I> that is, all our worldly gain, serviceable to us in his 
 service 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>No servant can serve two masters,</I> whose commands are so 
 inconsistent as those of God and <I>mammon</I> are. If a man will 
 <I>love</I> the world, and <I>hold to that,</I> it cannot be but he 
 will <I>hate God</I> and <I>despise</I> him. He will make all his 
 pretensions of religion truckle to his secular interests and designs, 
 and the things of God shall be made to help him in serving and seeking 
 the world. But, on the other hand, if a man will <I>love God,</I> and 
 <I>adhere</I> to him, he will comparatively <I>hate</I> the world 
 (whenever God and the world come in competition) and will 
 <I>despise</I> it, and make all his business and success in the world 
 some way or other conducive to his furtherance in the business of 
 religion; and the things of the world shall be made to help him in 
 serving God and working out his salvation. The matter is here laid 
 plainly before us: <I>Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</I> So divided 
 are their interests that their services can never be <I>compounded.</I> 
 If therefore we be determined to <I>serve God,</I> we must disclaim and 
 abjure the service of the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We are here told what entertainment this doctrine of Christ met with 
 among the Pharisees, and what rebuke he gave them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They wickedly <I>ridiculed</I> him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 <I>The Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things,</I> and
 could not contradict him, but <I>they derided him.</I> Let us consider 
 this,

 [1.] As their <I>sin,</I> and the fruit of their <I>covetousness,</I> 
 which was their reigning sin, their own iniquity. Note, Many that make 
 a great profession of religion, have much knowledge, and abound in the 
 exercise of devotion, are yet ruined by the love of the world; nor does 
 any thing harden the heart more against the word of Christ. These 
 covetous Pharisees could not bear to have that <I>touched,</I> which 
 was their <I>Delilah,</I> their darling lust; for this they derided 
 him, <B><I>exemykterizon auton</I></B>--<I>they snuffled up their noses 
 at him,</I> or blew their noses on him. It is an expression of the 
 utmost scorn and disdain imaginable; <I>the word of the Lord was to 
 them a reproach,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:10">Jer. vi. 10</A>.

 They laughed at him for going so contrary to the opinion and way of the
 world, for endeavouring to recover them from a sin which they were 
 resolved to hold fast. Note, It is common for those to <I>make a 
 jest</I> of the word of God who are resolved that they will not be 
 ruled by it; but they will find at last that it cannot be turned off 
 so.

 [2.] As <I>his suffering.</I> Our Lord Jesus endured not only the 
 <I>contradiction</I> of sinners, but their <I>contempt;</I> they <I>had 
 him in derision</I> all the day. He that spoke as never man spoke was 
 bantered and ridiculed, that his faithful ministers, whose preaching is 
 unjustly <I>derided,</I> may not be disheartened at it. It is no 
 disgrace to a man to be laughed at, but to deserve to be laughed at. 
 Christ's apostles were <I>mocked,</I> and no wonder; the <I>disciple is 
 not greater than his Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He justly reproved them; not for <I>deriding</I> him (he knew how 
 to <I>despise the shame</I>), but for <I>deceiving</I> themselves with 
 the shows and colours of piety, when they were strangers to the power 
 of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Their <I>specious outside;</I> nay, it was a <I>splendid one. 
 First,</I> They <I>justified themselves before men;</I> they denied 
 whatever ill was laid to their charge, even by Christ himself. They 
 claimed to be looked upon as men of singular sanctity and devotion, and 
 justified themselves in that claim: "<I>You are they that</I> do that, 
 so as none ever did, that make it your business to court the opinion of 
 men, and, right or wrong, will justify yourselves before the world; you 
 are <I>notorious</I> for this." <I>Secondly,</I> They were <I>highly 
 esteemed among men.</I> Men did not only <I>acquit</I> them from any 
 blame they were under, but <I>applauded</I> them, and had them in 
 veneration, not only as <I>good men,</I> but as the <I>best of men.</I> 
 Their sentiments were esteemed as oracles, their directions as laws, 
 and their practices as inviolable prescriptions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Their <I>odious inside,</I> which was under the eye of God: "He 
 <I>knows your heart,</I> and it is in his sight an <I>abomination;</I> 
 for it is full of all manner of wickedness." Note, <I>First,</I> It is 
 folly to <I>justify ourselves before men,</I> and to think this enough 
 to bear us out, and bring us off, in the judgment of the great day, 
 that men <I>know no ill</I> of us; for God, who knows our hearts, knows 
 that ill of us which no one else can know. This ought to check our 
 value for ourselves, and our confidence in ourselves, that <I>God knows 
 our hearts,</I> and how much deceit is there, for we have reason to 
 abase and distrust ourselves. <I>Secondly,</I> It is folly to judge of 
 persons and things by the opinion of men concerning them, and to go 
 down with the stream of vulgar estimate; for that which is <I>highly 
 esteemed among men,</I> who judge according to outward appearance, is 
 perhaps <I>an abomination in the sight of God,</I> who sees things as 
 they are, and whose judgment, we are sure, is according to truth. On 
 the contrary, there are those whom men despise and condemn who yet are 
 accepted and approved of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:18">2 Cor. x. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He turned from them to the publicans and sinners, as more likely 
 to be wrought upon by his gospel than those covetous conceited 
 Pharisees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "The <I>law and the prophets were</I> indeed <I>until John;</I> the 
 Old-Testament dispensation, which was <I>confined</I> to you Jews, 
 continued till John Baptist appeared, and you seemed to have the 
 monopoly of righteousness and salvation; and you are puffed up with 
 this, and this gains you esteem among men, that you are students in the 
 law and the prophets; but since John Baptist appeared <I>the kingdom of 
 God is preached,</I> a New-Testament dispensation, which does not value 
 men at all for their being doctors of the law, but <I>every man 
 presses</I> into the gospel kingdom, Gentiles as well as Jews, and no 
 man thinks himself bound in good manners to let his betters go before 
 him into it, or to stay till the <I>rulers</I> and the Pharisees have 
 led him that way. It is not so much a political national constitution 
 as the Jewish economy was, when <I>salvation was of the Jews;</I> but 
 it is made a particular personal concern, and therefore <I>every 
 man</I> that is convinced he has a soul to save, and an eternity to 
 provide for, thrusts to get in, lest he should come short by trifling 
 and complimenting." Some give this sense of it; they derided Christ or 
 speaking in contempt of riches, for, thought they, were there not many 
 promises of riches and other temporal good things in the <I>law and the 
 prophets?</I> And were not many of the best of God's servants very 
 rich, as Abraham and David? "It is true," saith Christ, "so it was, but 
 now that the kingdom of God is begun to be preached things take a new 
 turn; now blessed are the poor, and the mourners, and the persecuted." 
 The Pharisees, to requite the people for their high opinion of them, 
 allowed them in a cheap, easy, formal religion. "But," saith Christ, 
 "now that the <I>gospel is preached</I> the eyes of the people are 
 opened, and as they cannot now have a veneration for the Pharisees, as 
 they have had, so they cannot content themselves with such an 
 indifferency in religion as they have been trained up in, but they 
 <I>press</I> with a holy violence into the kingdom of God." Note, Those 
 that would go to heaven must take pains, must strive against the 
 stream, must press against the crowd that are going the contrary 
 way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Yet still he protests against any design to invalidate the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>It is easier for heaven and earth to pass,</I> 
 <B><I>parelthein</I></B>--<I>to pass by,</I> to pass away, though the 
 foundations of the earth and the pillars of heaven are so firmly 
 established, <I>than for one tittle of the law to fail.</I> The moral 
 law is confirmed and ratified, and not one tittle of that fails; the 
 duties enjoined by it are duties still; the sins forbidden by it are 
 sins still. Nay, the precepts of it are explained and enforced by the
 gospel, and made to appear more spiritual. The ceremonial law is 
 perfected in the gospel colours; not <I>one tittle</I> of that 
 <I>fails,</I> for it is found printed off in the gospel, where, though 
 the force of it is as a law taken off, yet the figure of it as a type 
 shines very brightly, witness the epistle to the Hebrews. There were 
 some things which were connived at by the law, for the preventing of 
 greater mischiefs, the permission of which the gospel has indeed taken 
 away, but without any detriment or disparagement to the law, for it has 
 thereby reduced them to the primitive intention of the law, as in the 
 case of divorce 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 which we had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:32,19:9">Matt. v. 32; xix. 9</A>.

 Christ will not allow divorces, for his gospel is intended to strike at 
 the bitter root of men's corrupt appetites and passions, to kill them, 
 and pluck them up; and therefore they must not be so far 
 <I>indulged</I> as that permission <I>did</I> indulge them, for the 
 more they are indulged the more impetuous and headstrong they grow.</P>

 </TABLE>
 
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple
 and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
 &nbsp; 20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid
 at his gate, full of sores,
 &nbsp; 21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the
 rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
 &nbsp; 22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried
 by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and
 was buried;
 &nbsp; 23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and
 seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
 &nbsp; 24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
 send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and
 cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
 &nbsp; 25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
 receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but
 now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
 &nbsp; 26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great
 gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you
 cannot; neither can they pass to us, that <I>would come</I> from
 thence.
 &nbsp; 27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou
 wouldest send him to my father's house:
 &nbsp; 28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them,
 lest they also come into this place of torment.
 &nbsp; 29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets;
 let them hear them.
 &nbsp; 30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them
 from the dead, they will repent.
 &nbsp; 31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the
 prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from
 the dead.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As the parable of the prodigal son set before us the grace of the
 gospel, which is encouraging to us all, so this sets before us the
 <I>wrath to come,</I> and is designed for our awakening; and very fast
 asleep those are in sin that will not be awakened by it. The Pharisees
 made a jest of Christ's sermon against worldliness; now this parable 
 was intended to make those mockers serious. The tendency of the gospel 
 of Christ is both to reconcile us to poverty and affliction and to arm 
 us against temptations to worldliness and sensuality. Now this parable, 
 by drawing the curtain, and letting us see what will be the end of both 
 in the other world, goes very far in prosecuting those two great 
 intentions. This parable is not like Christ's other parables, in which 
 spiritual things are represented by similitudes borrowed from worldly 
 things, as those of the sower and the seed (except that of the sheep 
 and goats), the prodigal son, and indeed all the rest but this. But 
 here the <I>spiritual things themselves</I> are represented in a 
 narrative or description of the different state of good and bad in this 
 world and the other. Yet we need not call it a history of a particular 
 occurrence, but it is <I>matter of fact</I> that is true every day, 
 that poor godly people, whom men neglect and trample upon, die away out 
 of their miseries, and go to heavenly bliss and joy, which is made the 
 more pleasant to them by their preceding sorrows; and that rich 
 epicures, who live in luxury, and are unmerciful to the poor, die, and 
 go into a state of insupportable torment, which is the more grievous 
 and terrible to them because of the sensual lives they lived: and that 
 there is no gaining any relief from their torments. Is this a parable? 
 What similitude is there in this? The discourse indeed between Abraham 
 and the rich man is only an illustration of the description, to make it 
 the more affecting, like that between God and Satan in the story of 
 Job. Our Saviour came to bring us acquainted with another world, and to 
 show us the reference which <I>this</I> world has to <I>that;</I> and 
 here is does it. In this description (for so I shall choose to call it) 
 we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The different condition of a <I>wicked rich man,</I> and a <I>godly 
 poor man,</I> in this world. We know that as some of late, so the Jews 
 of old, were ready to make prosperity one of the marks of a true 
 church, of a good man and a favourite of heaven, so that they could 
 hardly have any favourable thoughts of a <I>poor man.</I> This mistake 
 Christ, upon all occasions, set himself to correct, and here very 
 fully, where we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A wicked man, and one that will be for ever miserable, in the height 
 of prosperity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>There was a certain rich man.</I> From the Latin we commonly call 
 him <I>Dives--a rich man;</I> but, as Bishop Tillotson observes, he has 
 no name given him, as the poor man has, because it had been invidious 
 to have named any particular rich man in such a description as this, 
 and apt to provoke and gain ill-will. But others observe that Christ 
 would not do the rich man so much honour as to name him, though when 
 perhaps he called his lands by his own name he thought it should long 
 survive that of the beggar at his gate, which yet is here preserved, 
 when that of the rich man is buried in oblivion. Now we are told
 concerning this rich man,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he was <I>clothed in purple and fine linen,</I> and that was 
 his <I>adorning.</I> He had <I>fine linen</I> for <I>pleasure,</I> and 
 clean, no doubt, every day; night-linen, and day-linen. He had 
 <I>purple</I> for <I>state,</I> for that was the wear of princes, which 
 has made some conjecture that Christ had an eye to Herod in it. He 
 never appeared abroad but in great magnificence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He <I>fared</I> deliciously and <I>sumptuously every day.</I> His 
 table was furnished with all the varieties and dainties that nature and 
 art could supply; his side-table richly adorned with plate; his 
 servants, who waited at table, in rich liveries; and the guests at his 
 table, no doubt, such as he thought <I>graced</I> it. Well, and what 
 harm was there in all this? It is no sin to be rich, no sin to wear 
 purple and fine linen, nor to keep a plentiful table, if a man's estate 
 will afford it. Not are we told that he got his estate by fraud, 
 oppression, or extortion, no, nor that he was drunk, or made others 
 drunk; but, 

 [1.] Christ would hereby show that a man may have a great deal of the 
 wealth, and pomp, and pleasure of this world, and yet lie and perish 
 for ever under God's wrath and curse. We cannot infer from men's living 
 great either that God loves them <I>in</I> giving them so much, or that 
 they love God <I>for</I> giving them so much; happiness consists not in 
 these things. 
 
 [2.] That plenty and pleasure are a very <I>dangerous</I>
 and to many a <I>fatal</I> temptation to luxury, and sensuality, and 
 forgetfulness of God and another world. This man might have been happy 
 if he had not had great possessions and enjoyments.

 [3.] That the indulgence of the body, and the ease and pleasure of 
 that, are the ruin of many a soul, and the interests of it. It is true, 
 eating good meat and wearing good clothes are lawful; but it is true 
 that they often become the food and fuel of pride and luxury, and so 
 turn into sin to us. 

 [4.] That feasting ourselves and our friends, and, at the same time, 
 forgetting the distresses of the poor and afflicted, are very provoking 
 to God and damning to the soul. The sin of this rich man was not so 
 much his dress or his diet, but his providing only for himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is a godly man, and one that will be for ever happy, in the 
 depth of adversity and distress 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>There was a certain beggar,</I> named <I>Lazarus.</I> A beggar of 
 that name, eminently devout, and in great distress, was probably well 
 known among good people at that time: a beggar, suppose such a one as 
 Eleazar, or Lazarus. Some think Eleazar a proper name for any poor man, 
 for it signifies the <I>help of God,</I> which they must fly to that 
 are destitute of <I>other helps.</I> This poor man was reduced to the 
 last extremity, as miserable, as to outward things, as you can lightly 
 suppose a man to be in this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His body was <I>full of sores,</I> like Job. To be sick and weak 
 in body is a great affliction; but sores are more <I>painful</I> to the 
 patient, and more <I>loathsome</I> to those about him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He was forced to beg his bread, and to take up with such scraps as 
 he could get at rich people's doors. He was so sore and lame that he 
 could not go himself, but was carried by some compassionate hand or 
 other, and <I>laid at the rich man's gate.</I> Note, Those that are not 
 able to help the poor with their <I>purses</I> should help them with 
 their <I>pains;</I> those that cannot lend them <I>a penny</I> should 
 lend them <I>a hand;</I> those that have not themselves wherewithal to 
 give to them should either bring them, or go for them, to those that 
 have. Lazarus, in his distress, had nothing of his own to subsist on, 
 no relation to go to, nor did the parish take care of him. It is an 
 instance of the degeneracy of the Jewish church at this time that such 
 a godly man as Lazarus was should be suffered to perish for want of 
 necessary food. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] His expectations from the rich man's table: <I>He desired to be 
 fed with the crumbs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 He did not look for a mess from off his table, though he ought to have
 had one, one of the best; but would be thankful for the crumbs from 
 under the table, the broken meat which was the rich man's leavings; 
 nay, the leavings of his dogs. <I>The poor use entreaties,</I> and must 
 be content with such as they can get. Now this is taken notice of to 
 show, <I>First,</I> What was the distress, and what the disposition, of 
 the poor man. He was <I>poor,</I> but he was <I>poor in spirit,</I> 
 contentedly poor. He did not lie at the rich man's gate complaining, 
 and bawling, and making a noise, but silently and modestly desiring to 
 be <I>fed with the crumbs.</I> This miserable man was a good man, and 
 in favour with God. Note, It is often the lot of some of the dearest of 
 God's saints and servants to be greatly afflicted in this world, while 
 wicked people prosper, and have abundance; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:7,10,14">Ps. lxxiii. 7, 10, 14</A>.

 Here is a child of wrath and an heir of hell sitting in the house,
 faring sumptuously; and a child of love and an heir of heaven lying at 
 the gate, perishing for hunger. And is men's spiritual state to be 
 judged of then by their outward condition? <I>Secondly,</I> What was
 the temper of the rich man towards him. We are not told that he abused 
 him, or forbade him his gate, or did him any harm, but it is intimated 
 that he slighted him; he had no concern for him, took no care about 
 him. Here was a <I>real</I> object of charity, and a very
 <I>moving</I> one, which spoke for itself; it was presented to him at 
 <I>his own gate.</I> The poor man had a good character and good 
 conduct, and every thing that could recommend him. A <I>little</I> 
 thing would be a <I>great</I> kindness to him, and yet he took no 
 cognizance of his case, did not order him to be taken in and lodged in 
 the barn, or some of the out-buildings, but let him lie there. Note, It 
 is not enough not to oppress and trample upon the poor; we shall be 
 found unfaithful stewards of our Lord's goods, in the great day, if we 
 do not succour and relieve them. The reason given for the most fearful 
 doom is, <I>I was hungry, and you gave me no meat.</I> I wonder how 
 those rich people who have read the gospel of Christ, and way that they 
 believe it, can be so unconcerned as they often are in the necessities 
 and miseries of the poor and afflicted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The usage he had from the dogs; <I>The dogs came and licked his 
 sores.</I> The rich man kept a kennel of hounds, it may be, or other 
 dogs, for his diversion, and to please his fancy, and these were fed to 
 the full, when poor Lazarus could not get enough to keep him alive. 
 Note, Those will have a great deal to answer for hereafter that feed 
 their dogs, but neglect the poor. And it is a great aggravation of the 
 uncharitableness of many rich people that they bestow that upon their 
 fancies and follies which would supply the necessity, and rejoice the 
 heart, of many a good Christian in distress. Those offend God, nay, and 
 they put a contempt upon human nature, that pamper their dogs and 
 horses, and let the families of their poor neighbours starve. Now those 
 dogs <I>came and licked the</I> sores of poor Lazarus, which may be 
 taken, <I>First,</I> As an aggravation of his misery. His sores were 
 <I>bloody,</I> which tempted the dogs to come, and lick them, as they 
 did the blood of Naboth and Ahab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:19">1 Kings xxi. 19</A>.

 And we read of the <I>tongue of the dogs dipped</I> in the <I>blood of
 enemies,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:23">Ps. lxviii. 23</A>.

 They attacked him while he was yet alive, as if he had been already
 dead, and he had not strength himself to keep them off, nor would any 
 of the servants be so civil as to check them. The dogs were like their 
 master, and thought they fared sumptuously when they regaled themselves 
 with human gore. Or, it may be taken, <I>Secondly,</I> as some relief 
 to him in his misery; <B><I>alla kai</I></B>, the master was 
 <I>hard-hearted</I> towards him, <I>but</I> the dogs <I>came and licked 
 his sores,</I> which mollified and eased them. It is not said, They 
 <I>sucked</I> them, but <I>licked</I> them, which was good for them. 
 The dogs were more kind to him than their master was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the <I>different condition</I> of this <I>godly poor 
 man,</I> and this <I>wicked rich man, at</I> and <I>after death.</I> 
 Hitherto the wicked man seems to have the advantage, but <I>Exitus acta 
 probat</I>--<I>Let us wait awhile, to see the end hereof.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They both died 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 The <I>beggar died;</I> the <I>rich man also died.</I> Death is the 
 common lot of rich and poor, godly and ungodly; there they meet 
 together. One dieth <I>in his full strength,</I> and another in <I>the 
 bitterness of his soul;</I> but they shall <I>lie down alike in the 
 dust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:26">Job xxi. 26</A>.

 Death favours not either the rich man for his riches or the poor man
 for his poverty. Saints die, that they may bring their sorrows to an 
 end, and may enter upon their joys. Sinners die, that they may go to 
 give up their account. It concerns both rich and poor to prepare for 
 death, for it waits for them both. <I>Mors sceptra ligonibus 
 &aelig;quat--Death blends the sceptre with the spade.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The beggar <I>died first.</I> God often takes godly people out of 
 the world, when he leaves the wicked to flourish still. It was an 
 advantage to the beggar that such a speedy end was put to his miseries; 
 and, since he could find no other shelter or resting-place, he was 
 <I>hid in the grave,</I> where the <I>weary are at rest.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The rich man <I>died and was buried.</I> Nothing is said of the 
 interment of the poor man. They dug a hole any where, and tumbled his 
 body in, without any solemnity; he was <I>buried with the burial of an 
 ass:</I> nay, it is well if they that let the dogs lick his sores did 
 not let them gnaw his bones. But the rich man had a pompous funeral, 
 lay in state, had a train of mourners to attend him to his grave, and a 
 stately monument set up over it; probably he had a funeral oration in 
 praise of him, and his generous way of living, and the good table he 
 kept, which those would commend that had been feasted at it. It is said 
 of the wicked man that he is <I>brought to the grave</I> with no small 
 ado, and <I>laid in the tomb,</I> and <I>the clods of the valley,</I> 
 were it possible, are made <I>sweet to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:32,33">Job xxi. 32, 33</A>.

 How foreign is the ceremony of a funeral to the happiness of the
 man!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The beggar died and was <I>carried by angels into Abraham's 
 bosom.</I> How much did the honour done to his soul, by this convoy of 
 it to its rest, exceed the honour done to the rich man, by the carrying 
 of his body with so much magnificence to its grave! Observe, 

 (1.) His soul <I>existed</I> in a state of separation from the body. It 
 did not <I>die,</I> or <I>fall asleep,</I> with the body; his candle 
 was not put out with him; but lives, and acted, and knew what it did, 
 and what was done to it.

 (2.) His soul <I>removed</I> to another world, to the world of spirits; 
 it returned to God who gave it, to its native country; this is implied 
 in its being <I>carried.</I> The spirit of a man goes upward. 

 (3.) Angels took care of it; it was <I>carried by angels.</I> They are 
 ministering spirits to the heirs of salvation, not only while they 
 live, but when they die, and have a charge concerning them, to <I>bear 
 them up in their hands,</I> not only in their journeys to and fro on 
 earth, but in their great journey to their long home in heaven, to be 
 both their guide and their guard through regions unknown and unsafe.
 The soul of man, if not chained to this earth and clogged by it as 
 unsanctified souls are, has in itself an elastic virtue, by which it 
 <I>springs upward</I> as soon as it gets clear of the body; but Christ 
 will not trust those that are his to that, and therefore will send 
 special messengers to fetch them to himself. One angel one would think 
 sufficient, but here are more, as many were sent for Elijah. Amasis 
 king of Egypt had his chariot drawn by kings; but what was that honour 
 to this? Saints ascend in the virtue of Christ's ascension; but this 
 convoy of angels is added for state and decorum. Saints shall be
 brought home, not only safely, but honourably. What were the bearers at 
 the rich man's funeral, though, probably, those of the first rank, 
 compared with Lazarus's bearers? The angels were not shy of touching 
 him, for his sores were on his <I>body,</I> not on his <I>soul; 
 that</I> was presented to God <I>without spot, or wrinkle, or any such 
 thing.</I> "Now, blessed angels," said a good man just expiring, "now 
 come and do your office." 

 (4.) It was carried <I>into Abraham's bosom.</I> The Jews expressed the 
 happiness of the righteous at death three ways:--they to go <I>to the 
 garden of Eden:</I> they go <I>to be under the throne of glory;</I> and 
 they go <I>to the bosom of Abraham,</I> and it is this which our 
 Saviour here makes use of. Abraham was the <I>father of the
 faithful;</I> and whither should the souls of the faithful be gathered 
 but to him, who, as a tender father, lays them <I>in his bosom,</I> 
 especially at their first coming, to bid them welcome, and to refresh 
 them when newly come from the sorrows and fatigues of this world? He 
 was carried <I>to his bosom,</I> that is, to feast with him, for at 
 feasts the guests are said to lean on one another's breasts; and the 
 saints in heaven <I>sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob.</I> 
 Abraham was a great and rich man, yet in heaven he does not disdain to 
 lay poor Lazarus in his bosom. Rich saints and poor meet in heaven. 
 This poor Lazarus, who might not be admitted within the rich man's 
 gate, is conducted into the dining-room, into the bed-chamber, of the 
 heavenly palace; and <I>he</I> is laid in the bosom of Abraham, whom 
 the rich glutton scorned to <I>set with the dogs of his flock.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The next news you hear of the <I>rich man,</I> after the account of 
 his <I>death</I> and <I>burial,</I> is, that <I>in hell he lifted up 
 his eyes, being in torment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His state is very miserable. <I>He is in hell,</I> in 
 <I>hades,</I> in the state of separate souls, and there he is in <I>the 
 utmost misery</I> and <I>anguish</I> possible. As the souls of the 
 faithful, immediately <I>after they are delivered from the burden of 
 the flesh, are in joy and felicity,</I> so wicked and unsanctified 
 souls, immediately after they are fetched from the pleasures of the 
 flesh by death, are in misery and torment endless, useless, and 
 remediless, and which will be much increased and completed at the 
 resurrection. This <I>rich man</I> had entirely devoted himself to the 
 pleasures of the <I>world of sense,</I> was wholly <I>taken up</I> with 
 them, and <I>took up with them</I> for his portion, and therefore was 
 wholly unfit for the pleasures of the <I>world of spirits;</I> to such 
 a carnal mind as his they would indeed be no pleasure, nor could he 
 have any relish of them, and therefore he is of course excluded from 
 them. Yet this is not all; he was hard-hearted to God's poor, and 
 therefore he is not only cut off from mercy, but he has <I>judgment 
 without mercy,</I> and falls under a punishment of <I>sense</I> as well 
 as a punishment of <I>loss.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The misery of his state is aggravated by his knowledge of the 
 happiness of Lazarus: He <I>lifts up his eyes,</I> and <I>sees Abraham 
 afar off,</I> and <I>Lazarus in his bosom.</I> It is the soul that is 
 <I>in torment,</I> and they are the eyes of the mind that are lifted 
 up. He now began to consider what was become of Lazarus. He does not 
 find him where he himself is, nay, he plainly sees him, and with as 
 much assurance as if he had seen him with his bodily eyes, afar off in 
 the bosom of Abraham. This same aggravation of the miseries of the
 damned we had before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:28"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 28</A>):

 <I>Ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in
 the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out.</I> 

 [1.] He saw <I>Abraham afar off.</I> To see Abraham we should think a 
 pleasing sight; but to see him afar off was a tormenting sight. Near 
 himself he saw devils and damned companions, frightful sights, and 
 painful ones; afar off he saw Abraham. Note, Every sight in hell is 
 aggravating. 

 [2.] He saw <I>Lazarus in him bosom.</I> That same Lazarus whom he had 
 looked upon with so much scorn and contempt, as not worthy his notice, 
 he now sees preferred, and to be envied. The sight of him brought to 
 his mind his own cruel and barbarous conduct towards him; and the sight 
 of him in that happiness made his own misery the more grievous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is an account of what passed between the rich man and Abraham 
 in the separate state--a state of separation one from another, and of
 both from this world. Though it is probable that there will not be, nor 
 are, any such dialogues or discourses between glorified saints and 
 damned sinners, yet it is very proper, and what is usually done in 
 descriptions, especially such as are designed to be pathetic and 
 moving, by such dialogues to represent what will be the mind and 
 sentiments both of the one and of the other. And since we find damned 
 sinners tormented <I>in the presence of the Lamb</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:10">Rev. xiv. 10</A>),

 and the faithful servants of God looking upon them that have 
 <I>transgressed the covenant,</I> there where their <I>worm dies not, 
 and their fire is not quenched</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:23,24">Isa. lxvi. 23, 24</A>),

 such a discourse as this is not incongruous to be supposed. Now in this 
 discourse we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The request which the rich man made to Abraham for some mitigation 
 of his present misery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Seeing Abraham afar off, <I>he cried to him,</I> cried aloud, as one in
 earnest, and as one in pain and misery, mixing shrieks with his 
 petitions, to enforce them by moving compassion. He that used to 
 <I>command</I> aloud now <I>begs</I> aloud, louder than ever Lazarus 
 did at his gate. The songs of his riot and revels are all turned into 
 lamentations. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The title he gives to Abraham: <I>Father Abraham.</I> Note, There 
 are many in hell that can call Abraham <I>father,</I> that were 
 Abraham's seed after the flesh, nay, and many that were, in name and 
 profession, the children of the covenant made with Abraham. Perhaps 
 this rich man, in his carnal mirth, had ridiculed Abraham and the story 
 of Abraham, as the scoffers of the latter days do; but now he gives him 
 a title of respect, <I>Father Abraham.</I> Note, The day is coming when 
 wicked men will be glad to scrape acquaintance with the righteous, and 
 to claim kindred to them, though now they slight them. Abraham in this 
 description represents Christ, for to him all judgment is committed, 
 and it is his mind that Abraham here speaks. Those that now slight 
 Christ will shortly make their court to him, <I>Lord, Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The representation he makes to him of his present deplorable 
 condition: <I>I am tormented in this flame.</I> It is the torment of 
 his soul that he complains of, and therefore such a fire as will 
 operate upon souls; and such a fire the <I>wrath of God</I> is, 
 fastening upon a guilty conscience; such a fire horror of mind is, and 
 the reproaches of a self-accusing self-condemning heart. Nothing is 
 more painful and terrible to the body than to be tormented with fire; 
 by this therefore the miseries and agonies of damned souls are 
 represented.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) His request to Abraham, in consideration of this misery: <I>Have 
 mercy on me.</I> Note, The day is coming when those that make light of 
 divine mercy will beg hard for it. O for <I>mercy, mercy,</I> when the 
 day of mercy is over, and offers of mercy are no more made. He that had 
 no mercy on Lazarus, yet expects Lazarus should have mercy on him; 
 "for," thinks he, "Lazarus is better natured than ever I was." The 
 particular favour he begs is, <I>Send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip 
 of his finger in water, and cool my tongue.</I> 

 [1.] Here he complains of the torment of his <I>tongue</I> 
 particularly, as if he were more tormented there than in any other 
 part, the punishment answering the sin. The <I>tongue</I> is one of the 
 organs of speech, and by the torment of that he is put in mind of all 
 the wicked words that he had spoken against God and man, his cursing, 
 and swearing, and blasphemy, all his <I>hard speeches,</I> and 
 <I>filthy speeches;</I> by his words <I>he is condemned,</I> and 
 therefore in his tongue he is tormented. The tongue is also one of the
 organs of <I>tasting,</I> and therefore the torments of that will 
 remind him of his inordinate relish of the delights of sense, which he 
 had <I>rolled under his tongue.</I> 

 [2.] He desires a <I>drop of water to cool his tongue.</I> He does not 
 say, "Father Abraham, order me a release from this misery, help me out 
 of this pit," for he utterly <I>despaired</I> of this; but he asks as 
 small a thing as could be asked, <I>a drop of water</I> to cool his 
 tongue for one moment. 

 [3.] He sometimes suspected that he had herein an ill design upon 
 Lazarus, and hoped, if he could get him within his reach, he should 
 keep him from returning to the bosom of Abraham. The heart that is 
 filled with rage against God is filled with rage against the people of 
 God. But we will think more charitably even of a damned sinner, and 
 suppose he intended here to show respect to Lazarus, as one to whom he 
 would now gladly be beholden. He <I>names</I> him, because he 
 <I>knows</I> him, and thinks Lazarus will not be unwilling to do him 
 this good office for old acquaintance' sake. Grotius here quotes Plato 
 describing the torments of wicked souls, and among other things he 
 says, They are <I>continually raving</I> on those whom they have 
 <I>murdered,</I> or been any way <I>injurious to,</I> calling upon them 
 to <I>forgive them</I> the wrongs they did them. Note, There is a day 
 coming when those that now hate and despise the people of God would 
 gladly receive kindness from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reply which Abraham gave to this request. In general, he did not 
 grant it. He would not allow him one <I>drop of water, to cool</I> his 
 tongue. Note, The damned in hell shall not have any the least abatement 
 or mitigation of their torment. If we now improve the day of our 
 opportunities, we may have a full and lasting satisfaction in the 
 streams of mercy; but, if we now slight the offer, it will be in vain 
 in hell to expect the least drop of mercy. See how justly this rich man 
 is paid in his own coin. He that denied a crumb is denied a drop. Now 
 it is said to us, <I>Ask, and it shall be given you;</I> but, if we let 
 slip this accepted time, we may ask, and it shall not be given us. But 
 this is not all; had Abraham only said, "You shall have nothing to 
 abate your torment," it had been sad; but he says a great deal which 
 would add to his torment, and make the flame the hotter, for every 
 thing in hell will be tormenting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He calls him <I>son,</I> a kind and civil title, but here it 
 serves only to aggravate the denial of his request, which shut up the 
 bowels of the compassion of a father from him. He had been a son, but a 
 rebellious one, and now an abandoned disinherited one. See the folly of 
 those who rely on that <I>plea, We have Abraham to our father,</I> when 
 we find one in hell, and likely to be there for ever, whom Abraham 
 calls <I>son.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He puts him in mind of what had been both his own condition and 
 the condition of Lazarus, in their <I>life-time: Son, remember;</I> 
 this is a cutting word. The memories of damned souls will be their 
 tormentors, and conscience will then be awakened and stirred up to do 
 its office, which here they would not suffer it to do. Nothing will 
 bring more oil to the flames of hell than <I>Son, remember.</I> Now 
 sinners are called upon to <I>remember,</I> but they do not, they will 
 not, they find ways to avoid it. "<I>Son, remember</I> thy Creator, thy 
 Redeemer, remember thy latter end;" but they can turn a deaf ear to 
 these <I>mementos,</I> and forget that for which they have their 
 memories; justly therefore will their everlasting misery arise from a 
 <I>Son, remember,</I> to which they will not be able to turn a deaf 
 ear. What a dreadful peal will this ring in our ears, "<I>Son, 
 remember</I> the many warnings that were given thee not to come to this 
 place of torment, which thou wouldest not regard; remember the fair 
 offers made thee of eternal life and glory, which thou wouldest not 
 accept!" But that which he is here put in mind of is, 

 [1.] That <I>thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things.</I> He 
 does not tell him that he had <I>abused</I> them, but that he had 
 <I>received</I> them: "Remember what a bountiful benefactor God has 
 been to thee, how ready he was to do thee good; thou canst not 
 therefore say he owes thee any thing, no, not a <I>drop of water.</I> 
 What he gave thee <I>thou receivedst,</I> and that was all; thou never 
 gavest him a receipt for them, in a thankful acknowledgment of them, 
 much less didst thou ever make any grateful return for them or 
 improvement of them; thou hast been the grave of God's blessings, in 
 which they were buried, not the field of them, in which they were sown. 
 Thou receivedst <I>thy good things;</I> thou receivedst them, and 
 usedst them, as if they had been <I>thine own,</I> and thou hadst not 
 been at all accountable for them. Or, rather, they were the things
 which thou didst choose for <I>thy good things,</I> which were in thine 
 eye the <I>best things,</I> which thou didst content thyself with, and 
 portion thyself in. Thou hadst meat, and drink, and clothes of the 
 richest and finest, and these were the things thou didst place thy 
 happiness in; they were <I>thy reward, thy consolation,</I> the 
 <I>penny</I> thou didst <I>agree for,</I> and thou hast had it. Thou 
 wast for the <I>good things of thy life-time,</I> and hadst no thought 
 of better things in another life, and therefore hast no reason to 
 expect them. The day of thy <I>good things</I> is past and gone, and 
 now is the day of thy <I>evil things,</I> of recompence for all thy 
 evil deeds. Thou hast already had the last drop of the <I>vials of 
 mercy</I> that thou couldest expect to fall to thy share; and there 
 remains nothing but <I>vials of wrath</I> without mixture." 

 [2.] "Remember too what <I>evil things Lazarus received.</I> Thou 
 enviest him his happiness here; but think what a large share of 
 miseries he had <I>in his life-time.</I> Thou hast <I>as much good</I> 
 as could be thought to fall to the lot of so <I>bad a man,</I> and he 
 <I>as much evil</I> as could be thought to fall to the lot of <I>so 
 good a man.</I> He <I>received</I> his evil things; he bore them 
 patiently, received them from the hand of God, as Job did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:10"><I>ch.</I> ii. 10</A>,

 <I>Shall we receive good at the hand of the Lord, and shall we not
 receive evil also?</I>)--he <I>received</I> them as physic appointed 
 for the cure of his spiritual distempers, and the cure was effected." 
 As wicked people have <I>good things</I> in this life only, and at 
 death they are for ever separated from all good, so godly people have 
 evil things only <I>in this life,</I> and at death they are for ever 
 put out of the reach of them. Now Abraham, by putting him in mind of 
 both these together, awakens his conscience to remind him how he had 
 behaved towards Lazarus, when he was reveling in his <I>good things</I> 
 and Lazarus groaning under his <I>evil things;</I> he cannot forget 
 that then he would not help Lazarus, and how then could he expect that 
 Lazarus should now help him? Had Lazarus in his life-time afterwards 
 grown rich, and he poor, Lazarus would have thought it his duty to 
 relieve him, and not to have upbraided him with his former unkindness; 
 but, in the future state of recompence and retribution, those that are 
 now dealt with, both by God and man, better than they deserve, must 
 expect to be rewarded <I>every man according to his works.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He puts him in mind of Lazarus's present bliss, and his own 
 misery: <I>But now</I> the tables are turned, and so they must abide 
 for ever; <I>now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</I> He did 
 not need to be told that he was <I>tormented;</I> he felt it to his 
 cost. He knew likewise that one who lay in the bosom of Abraham could 
 not but be comforted there; yet Abraham puts him in mind of it, that he 
 might, by comparing one thing with another, observe the 
 <I>righteousness of God,</I> in recompensing <I>tribulation to them who 
 trouble his people,</I> and <I>to those who are troubled rest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:6,7">2 Thess. i. 6, 7</A>.
 
 Observe,

 [1.] Heaven is <I>comfort,</I> and hell is <I>torment:</I> heaven is 
 <I>joy,</I> hell is <I>weeping, and wailing,</I> and pain in 
 perfection. 

 [2.] The soul, as soon as it leaves the body, goes either to heaven or 
 hell, to comfort or torment, immediately, and does not sleep, or go 
 into purgatory. 

 [3.] Heaven will be heaven indeed to those that go thither through many 
 and great calamities in this world; of those that had grace, but had 
 little of the comfort of it here (perhaps their souls refused to be 
 comforted), yet, when they are fallen asleep in Christ, you may truly 
 say, "Now <I>they are comforted:</I> now <I>all their tears are wiped 
 away,</I> and all their fears are vanished." In heaven there is 
 everlasting consolation. And, on the other hand, hell will be hell 
 indeed to those that go thither from the midst of the enjoyment of all 
 the delights and pleasures of sense. To them the torture is the 
 greater, as temporal calamities are described to be to the <I>tender 
 and delicate woman, that would not set so much as the sole of her foot 
 to the ground, for tenderness and delicacy.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:56">Deut. xxviii. 56</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He assures him that it was to no purpose to think of having any 
 relief by the ministry of Lazarus; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 <I>Besides all this,</I> worse yet, <I>between us and you there is a 
 great gulf fixed,</I> an impassable one, <I>a great chasm,</I> that so 
 there can be no communication between glorified saints and damned 
 sinners.

 [1.] The kindest saint in heaven cannot make a visit to the 
 congregation of the dead and damned, to comfort or relieve any there 
 who once were their friends. "<I>They that would pass hence to you 
 cannot;</I> they cannot leave beholding the face of their Father, nor 
 the work about his throne, to fetch water for you; that is no part of 
 their business." 

 [2.] The most daring sinner in hell cannot force his way out of that 
 prison, cannot get over that great gulf. <I>They cannot pass to us that 
 would come thence.</I> It is not to be expected, for the door of mercy 
 is shut, the bridge is drawn; there is no coming out upon parole or 
 bail, no, not for one hour. In this world, blessed be God, there is no 
 gulf fixed between a state of nature and grace, but we may pass from 
 the one to thee other, from sin to God; but if we die in our sins, if 
 we throw ourselves into the pit of destruction, there is no coming out.
 It is a pit <I>in which there is no water,</I> and <I>out of which 
 there is no redemption.</I> The decree and counsel of God have fixed 
 this gulf, which all the world cannot unfix. This abandons this 
 miserable creature to despair; it is now too late for any change of his 
 condition, or any the least relief: it might have been prevented <I>in 
 time,</I> but it cannot now be remedied <I>to eternity.</I> The state 
 of damned sinners is fixed by an irreversible and unalterable sentence.
 A stone is rolled to the door of the pit, which cannot be rolled 
 back.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The further request he had to make to his father Abraham, not for 
 himself, his mouth is stopped, and he has not a word to say in answer 
 to Abraham's denial of a drop of water. Damned sinners are made to know 
 that the sentence they are under is just, and they cannot alleviate 
 their own misery by making any objection against it. And, since he 
 cannot obtain a drop of water to <I>cool his tongue,</I> we may suppose 
 he <I>gnawed his tongue for pain,</I> as those are said to do on whom 
 one of the <I>vials</I> of God's wrath is <I>poured out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:10">Rev. xvi. 10</A>.

 The shrieks and outcries which we may suppose to be now uttered by him
 were hideous; but, having an opportunity of speaking to Abraham, he 
 will improve it for his relations whom he has left behind, since he 
 cannot improve it for his own advantage. Now as to this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He begs that Lazarus might be <I>sent to his father's house,</I> 
 upon an errand thither: <I>I pray thee therefore, father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 
 Again he calls upon Abraham, and in this request he is importunate:
 "<I>I pray thee.</I> O deny me not this." When he was on earth he might 
 have prayed and been heard, but now he prays in vain. 
 "<I>Therefore,</I> because thou hast denied me the former request, 
 surely thou wilt be so compassionate as not to deny this:" or, 
 "<I>Therefore,</I> because <I>there is a great gulf fixed,</I> seeing 
 there is no getting out hence when they are once here, O send to 
 prevent their coming hither:" or, "Though there is a <I>great gulf 
 fixed</I> between you and me, yet, since there is no such gulf fixed 
 between you and them, send them hither. Send him back <I>to my father's 
 house;</I> he knows well enough where it is, has been there many a 
 time, having been denied the crumbs that fell from the table. He knows 
 I have <I>five brethren</I> there; if he appear to them, they will 
 <I>know him,</I> and will regard what he saith, for they knew him to be 
 an honest man. Let him <I>testify to them;</I> let him tell them what 
 condition I am in, and that I brought myself to it by my luxury and 
 sensuality, and my unmercifulness to the poor. Let him warn them not
 to tread in my steps, nor to go on in the way wherein I led them, and 
 left them, <I>lest they also come into this place of torment,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Some observe that he speaks only of <I>five brethren,</I> whence they
 infer that he had <I>no children,</I> else he would have mentioned 
 them, and then it was an aggravation of his uncharitableness that he 
 had no children to provide for. Now he would have them stopped in their 
 sinful course. He does not say, "Give me leave to go to them, that I 
 may testify to them;" for he knew that there was a <I>gulf fixed,</I> 
 and despaired of a permission so favourable to himself: his going would 
 frighten them out of their <I>wits;</I> but, "Send Lazarus, whose 
 address will be less terrible, and yet his testimony sufficient to 
 frighten them out of their <I>sins.</I>" Now he desired the preventing 
 of their ruin, partly in tenderness to <I>them,</I> for whom he could 
 not but retain a <I>natural affection;</I> he knew their temper, their 
 temptations, their ignorance, their infidelity, their inconsideration, 
 and wished to prevent the destruction they were running into: but it 
 was partly in tenderness <I>to himself,</I> for their coming to him, to 
 that <I>place of torment,</I> would but aggravate the misery to him, 
 who had helped to show them the way thither, as the sight of Lazarus 
 helped to aggravate his misery. When partners in sin come to be sharers 
 in woe, as tares bound in bundles for the fire, they will be a terror 
 to one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Abraham denies him this favour too. There is no request granted in 
 hell. Those who make the rich man's praying to Abraham a justification 
 of their praying to saints departed, as they have far to seek for 
 proofs, when the practice of a damned sinner must be valued for an 
 example, so they have little encouragement to follow the example, when 
 all his prayers were made <I>in vain.</I> Abraham leaves them to the 
 testimony of Moses and the prophets, the ordinary means of conviction 
 and conversion; they have the written word, which they may read and 
 hear read. "<I>Let them</I> attend to that <I>sure word of 
 prophecy,</I> for God will not go out of the common method of his grace 
 for them." Here is their privilege: <I>They have Moses and the 
 prophets;</I> and their duty: "<I>Let them hear them,</I> and mix faith 
 with them, and that will be sufficient to keep them from this place of 
 torment." By this it appears that there is sufficient evidence in the 
 Old Testament, in Moses and <I>the prophets,</I> to convince those that 
 will hear them impartially that there is another life after this, and a 
 state of rewards and punishments for good and bad men; for that was the 
 thing which the rich man would have his brethren assured of, and for 
 that they are turned over to Moses and the prophets.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He urges his request yet further 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "<I>Nay, father Abraham,</I> give me leave to press this. It is true, 
 they have Moses and the prophets, and, if they would but give a due 
 regard to them, it would be sufficient; but they do not, they will not; 
 yet it may be hoped, <I>if one went to them from the dead, they would 
 repent,</I> that would be a more sensible conviction to them. They are 
 used to Moses and the prophets, and therefore regard them the less; but 
 this would be a <I>new thing,</I> and more startling; surely this would 
 bring them to <I>repent,</I> and to change their wicked habit and 
 course of life." Note, Foolish men are apt to think any method of 
 conviction better than that which God has chosen and appointed.</P>
