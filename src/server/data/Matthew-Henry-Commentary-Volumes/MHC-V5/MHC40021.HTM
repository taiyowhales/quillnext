 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ are the two main hinges upon 
 which the door of salvation turns. He came into the world on purpose to 
 give his life a ransom; so he had lately said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:28"><I>ch.</I> xx. 28</A>.

 And therefore the history of his sufferings, even unto death, and his
 rising again, is more particularly recorded by all the evangelists than 
 any other part of his story; and to that this evangelist now hastens 
 apace. For at this chapter begins that which is called the 
 passion-week. He had said to his disciples more than once, Behold, we 
 go up to Jerusalem, and there the Son of man must be betrayed. A great 
 deal of good work he did by the way, and now at length he is come up to 
 Jerusalem; and here we have, 

 I. The public entry which he made into Jerusalem, upon the first day of
 the passion-week, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. The authority he exercised there, in cleansing the temple, and
 driving out of it the buyers and sellers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:12-16">ver. 12-16</A>.

 III. The barren fig-tree, and his discourse with his disciples
 thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:17-22">ver. 17-22</A>.

 IV. His justifying his own authority, by appealing to the baptism of
 John, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:23-27">ver. 23-27</A>.

 V. His shaming the infidelity and obstinacy of the chief priests and 
 elders, with the repentance of the publicans, illustrated by the 
 parable of the two sons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:29-32">ver. 29-32</A>.

 VI. His reading the doom of the Jewish church for its unfruitfulness, 
 in the parable of the vineyard let out to unthankful husbandmen, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:33-46">ver. 33-46</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to
 Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two
 disciples,
 &nbsp; 2  Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
 straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose
 <I>them,</I> and bring <I>them</I> unto me.
 &nbsp; 3  And if any <I>man</I> say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord
 hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
 &nbsp; 4  All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
 spoken by the prophet, saying,
 &nbsp; 5  Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto
 thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an
 ass.
 &nbsp; 6  And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,
 &nbsp; 7  And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their
 clothes, and they set <I>him</I> thereon.
 &nbsp; 8  And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;
 others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed <I>them</I> in
 the way.
 &nbsp; 9  And the multitudes that went before, and that followed,
 cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed <I>is</I> he that
 cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
 &nbsp; 10  And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
 saying, Who is this?
 &nbsp; 11  And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of
 Nazareth of Galilee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All the four evangelists take notice of this passage of Christ's 
 <I>riding in triumph into Jerusalem,</I> five days before his death. 
 The passover was on the fourteenth day of the month, and this was the 
 tenth; on which day the law appointed that the paschal lamb should be 
 taken up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:3">Exod. xii. 3</A>),

 and set apart for that service; on that day therefore Christ our
 Passover, who was to be sacrificed for us, was publicly showed. So that 
 this was the prelude to his passion. He had lodged at Bethany, a 
 village not far from Jerusalem, for some time; at a supper there the 
 night before Mary had <I>anointed his feet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:3">John xii. 3</A>.

 But, as usual with ambassadors, he deferred his public entry till some
 time after his arrival. Our Lord Jesus travelled much, and his custom 
 was to travel on foot from Galilee to Jerusalem, some scores of miles, 
 which was both humbling and toilsome; many a dirty weary step he had 
 when <I>he went about doing good.</I> How ill does it become Christians 
 to be inordinately solicitous about their own ease and state, when 
 their Master had so little of either! Yet once in his life he rode in 
 triumph; and it was now when he went into Jerusalem, to suffer and die, 
 as if that were the pleasure and preferment he courted; and then he 
 thought himself begin to look great.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The provision that was made for this solemnity; and it was very poor 
 and ordinary, and such as bespoke his <I>kingdom</I> to be <I>not of 
 this world.</I> Here were no heralds at arms provided, no trumpet 
 sounded before him, no chariots of state, no liveries; such things as 
 these were not agreeable to his present state of humiliation, but will 
 be far outdone at his second coming, to which his magnificent 
 appearance is reserved, when the last trumpet shall sound, the glorious 
 angels shall be his heralds and attendants, and the clouds his 
 chariots. But in this public appearance,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The preparation was sudden and offhand. For his glory in the other
 world, and ours with him, preparation was made before the foundation of 
 the world, for that was the glory his heart was upon; his glory in this 
 world he was dead to, and therefore, though he had it in prospect, did 
 not forecast for it, but took what came next. They were come to 
 Bethphage, which was the suburb of Jerusalem, and was accounted (say 
 the Jewish doctors) in all things, as Jerusalem, a long scattering 
 street that lay toward the mount of Olives; when he entered upon that, 
 <I>he sent two of his disciples,</I> some think Peter and John, to 
 fetch him an ass, for he had none ready for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was very mean. He sent only for an ass and her colt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Asses were much used in that country for travel; horses were kept only 
 by great men, and for war. Christ could have summoned a cherub to carry 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:10">Ps. xviii. 10</A>);

 but though <I>by his name Jah,</I> which speaks him God, <I>he rides
 upon the heavens,</I> yet now by his name Jesus, <I>Immanuel, God with 
 us,</I> in his state of humiliation, he <I>rides upon an ass.</I> Yet 
 some think that he had herein an eye to the custom in Israel for the 
 judges to ride upon white asses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:10">Judg. v. 10</A>),

 and their sons on ass-colts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+12:14">Judg. xii. 14</A>.

 And Christ would thus enter, not as a Conqueror, but as the Judge of
 Israel, <I>who for judgment came into this world.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It was not his own, but borrowed. Though he had not a house of his 
 own, yet, one would think, like some wayfaring men that live upon their 
 friends, he might have had an ass of his own, to carry him about; but 
 for our sakes he became in all respects poor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:9">2 Cor. viii. 9</A>.

 It is commonly said, "They that live on borrowing, live on sorrowing;"
 in this therefore, as in other things, Christ <I>was a man of 
 sorrows</I>--that he had nothing of this world's goods but what was 
 given him or lent him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The disciples who were sent to borrow this ass are directed to say, 
 <I>The Lord has need of him.</I> Those that are in need, must not be 
 ashamed to own their need, nor say, as the unjust steward, <I>To beg I 
 am ashamed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:3">Luke xvi. 3</A>.

 On the other hand, none ought to impose upon the kindness of their
 friends, by going to beg or borrow when they have not need. In the 
 borrowing of this ass,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) We have an instance of Christ's knowledge. Though the thing was 
 altogether contingent, yet Christ could tell his disciples where they 
 should find an ass tied, and a colt with her. His omniscience extends 
 itself to the meanest of his creatures; asses and their colts, and 
 their being bound or loosed. <I>Doth God take care for oxen?</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:9">1 Cor. ix. 9.</A>)

 No doubt he doth, and would not see Balaam's ass abused. He knows all
 the creatures, so as to make them serve his own purpose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We have an instance of his power over the spirits of men. The 
 hearts of the meanest subjects, as well as of kings, <I>are in the hand 
 of the Lord.</I> Christ asserts his right to use the ass, in bidding 
 them bring it to him; the fulness of the earth is the Lord Christ's; 
 but he foresees some hindrance which disciples might meet with in this 
 service; they must not take them <I>clam et secreto--privily,</I> but in
 the sight of the owner, much less <I>vi et armis--with force and
 arms,</I> but with the consent of the owner, which he undertakes they 
 shall have; <I>If any man say aught to you, ye shall say, The Lord hath 
 need of him.</I> Note, What Christ sets us to do, he will bear us out 
 in the doing of, and furnish us with answers tot he objections we may 
 be assaulted with, and make them prevalent; as here, <I>Straightway he 
 will send them.</I> Christ, in commanding the ass into his service, 
 showed that he is Lord of hosts; and, in inclining the owner to send 
 him without further security, showed that he is the <I>God of the 
 spirits of all flesh,</I> and can bow men's hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) We have an example of justice and honesty, in not using the ass, 
 though for so small a piece of service as riding the length of a street 
 or two, without the owner's consent. As some read the latter clause, it 
 gives us a further rule of justice; <I>"You shall say the Lord hath 
 need of them, and he</I>" (that is, <I>the Lord) "will presently send 
 them back,</I> and take care that they be safely delivered to the 
 owner, as soon as he has done with them." Note, What we borrow we must 
 restore in due time and in good order; for <I>the wicked borrows and 
 pays not again.</I> Care must be taken of borrowed goods, that they be 
 not damaged. <I>Alas, Master, for it was borrowed!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prediction that was fulfilled in this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Our Lord Jesus, in all that he did and suffered, had very much his eye 
 upon this, <I>That the scriptures might be fulfilled.</I> As the 
 prophets looked forward to him (to him they all bare witness), so he 
 looked upon them, that all things which were written of the Messiah, 
 might be punctually accomplished in him. This particularly which was 
 written of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:9">Zech. ix. 9</A>,

 where it ushers in a large prediction of the kingdom of the Messiah, 
 <I>Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh,</I> must be 
 accomplished. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How the coming of Christ is foretold; <I>Tell ye the daughter of 
 Sion,</I> the church, the holy mountain, <I>Behold, thy King cometh 
 unto thee.</I> Note, 

 (1.) Jesus Christ is the church's King, one of our brethren like unto
 us, according to the law of the kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:15">Deut. xvii. 15</A>.

 He is appointed King over the church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">Ps. ii. 6</A>.

 He is accepted King by the church; the daughter of Sion swears
 allegiance to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:11">Hos. i. 11</A>.

 (2.) Christ, the King of his church, came to his church, even in this
 lower world; he comes to thee, to rule thee, to rule in thee, to rule 
 for thee; he is <I>Head over all things to the church. He came to 
 Sion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:26">Rom. xi. 26</A>),

 that out of Sion the law might go forth; for the church and its
 interests were all in all with the Redeemer.

 (3.) Notice was given to the church beforehand of the coming of her 
 King; <I>Tell the daughter of Sion.</I> Note, Christ will have his 
 coming looked for, and waited for, and his subjects big with 
 expectation of it; <I>Tell the daughters of Sion,</I> that they may 
 <I>go forth, and behold King Solomon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:11">Cant. iii. 11</A>.

 Notices of Christ's coming are usually ushered in with a <I>Behold!</I>
 A note commanding both attention and admiration; <I>Behold thy King 
 cometh;</I> behold, and wonder at him, behold, and welcome him. Here is 
 a royal progress truly admirable. Pilate, like Caiaphas, said he knew 
 not what, in that great word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:14">John xix. 14</A>),
 
 <I>Behold your King.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How his coming is described. When a king comes, something great and 
 magnificent is expected, especially when he comes to take possession of 
 his kingdom. The King, the Lord of hosts, was seen <I>upon a throne, 
 high and lifted up</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1">Isa. vi. 1</A>);

 but there is nothing of that here; <I>Behold, he cometh to thee, meek,
 and sitting upon an ass.</I> When Christ would appear in his glory, it 
 is in his meekness, not in his majesty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His temper is very mild. He comes not in wrath to take vengeance, 
 but in mercy to work salvation. He is meek to suffer the greatest 
 injuries and indignities for Sion's cause, meek to bear with the 
 follies and unkindness of Sion's own children. He is easy of access, 
 easy to be entreated. He is meek not only as a Teacher, but as a Ruler; 
 he rules by love. His government is mild and gentle, and his laws not 
 written in the blood of his subjects, but in his own. His yoke is 
 easy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) As an evidence of this, his appearance is very mean, sitting upon 
 an ass, as creature made not for state, but service, not for battles, 
 but for burthens; slow in its motions, but sure, and safe, and 
 constant. The foretelling of this so long before, and the care taken 
 that it should be exactly fulfilled, intimate it to have a peculiar 
 significancy, for the encouragement of poor souls to apply themselves 
 to Christ. Sion's King comes riding, not on a prancing horse, which the 
 timorous petitioner dares not come near, or a running horse, which the 
 slow-footed petitioner cannot keep pace with, but on a quiet ass, that 
 the poorest of his subjects may not be discouraged in their access to 
 him. Mention is made in the prophecy of <I>a colt, the foal of an 
 ass;</I> and <I>therefore</I> Christ sent for the colt with the ass, 
 that the scripture might be fulfilled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The procession itself, which was answerable to the preparation, 
 both being destitute of worldly pomp, and yet both accompanied with a 
 spiritual power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. His equipage; <I>The disciples did as Jesus commanded them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 they went to fetch the ass and the colt, not doubting but to find them, 
 and to find the owner willing to lend them. Note, Christ's commands 
 must not be disputed, but obeyed; and those that sincerely obey them, 
 shall not be balked or baffled in it; <I>They brought the ass and the 
 colt.</I> The meanness and contemptibleness of the beast Christ rode 
 on, might have been made up with the richness of the trappings; but 
 those were, like all the rest, such as came next to hand; they had not 
 so much as a saddle for the ass, but the disciples threw some of their 
 clothes upon it, and that must serve for want of better accommodations. 
 Note, We ought not to be nice or curious, or to affect exactness, in 
 outward conveniences. A holy indifference or neglect well becomes us in 
 these things: it will evidence that our heart is not upon them, and 
 that we have learned the apostle's rule 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:16">Rom. xii. 16</A>,

 margin), <I>to be content with mean things.</I> Any thing will serve
 travellers; and there is a beauty in some sort of carelessness, a noble 
 negligence; yet the disciples furnished him with the best they had, and 
 did not object the spoiling of their clothes when <I>the Lord had need 
 of them.</I> Note, We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear 
 to part with for the service of Christ, for the clothing of his poor 
 destitute and afflicted members. <I>I was naked, and you clothed 
 me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:36"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 36</A>.

 Christ stripped himself for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His retinue; there was nothing in this stately or magnificent. 
 Sion's King comes to Sion, and the daughter of Sion was told of his 
 coming long before; yet he is not attended by the gentlemen of the 
 country, nor met by the magistrates of the city in their formalities as 
 one might have expected; he should have had the keys of the city 
 presented to him, and should have been conducted with all possible 
 convenience to <I>the thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of 
 David;</I> but here is nothing of all this; yet he has his attendants, 
 <I>a very great multitude;</I> they were only the common people, the 
 mob (the <I>rabble</I> we should have been apt to call them), that 
 graced the solemnity of Christ's triumph, and none but such. The chief 
 priests and the elders afterward herded themselves with the multitude 
 that abused him upon the cross; but we find none of them here joining 
 with the multitude that did him honour. Ye see here your calling, 
 brethren, <I>not many mighty, or noble,</I> attend on Christ, but 
 <I>the foolish things of this world and base things, which are 
 despised,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:26,28">1 Cor. i. 26, 28</A>.

 Note, Christ is honoured by the multitude, more than by the
 magnificence, of his followers; for he values men by their souls, not 
 by their preferments, names, or titles of honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, concerning this great multitude, we are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What they did; according to the best of their capacity, they 
 studied to do honour to Christ. 

 [1.] <I>They spread their garments in the way,</I> that he might ride 
 upon them. When Jehu was proclaimed king, the captains put their 
 garments under him, in token of their subjection to him. Note, Those 
 that take Christ for their King must lay their all under his feet; the 
 clothes, in token of the heart; for when Christ comes, though not when 
 any one else comes, it must be <I>said to the soul, Bow down, that he 
 may go over.</I> Some think that these garments were spread, not upon 
 the ground, but on the hedges or walls, to adorn the roads; as, to 
 beautify a cavalcade, the balconies are hung with tapestry. This was 
 but a poor piece of state, yet Christ accepted their good-will; and we 
 are hereby taught to contrive how to make Christ welcome, Christ and 
 his grace, Christ and his gospel, into our hearts and houses. How shall 
 we express our respects to Christ? What honour and what dignity shall 
 be done to him?

 [2.] <I>Others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in 
 the way,</I> as they used to do at the feast of tabernacles, in token 
 of liberty, victory, and joy; for the mystery of that feast is 
 particularly spoken of as belonging to gospel times, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:16">Zech. xiv. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What they said; <I>They that went before, and they that 
 followed,</I> were in the same tune; both those that gave notice of his 
 coming, and those that attended him with their applauses, <I>cried, 
 saying, Hosanna to the Son of David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 When they carried branches about at the feast of tabernacles, they were 
 wont to cry <I>Hosanna,</I> and from thence to call their bundles of 
 branches their <I>hosannas. Hosanna</I> signifies, <I>Save now, we 
 beseech thee;</I> referring to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:25,26">Ps. cxviii. 25, 26</A>,

 where the Messiah is prophesied of as the <I>Head-stone of the
 corner,</I> though <I>the builders refused him;</I> and all his loyal 
 subjects are brought in triumphing with him, and attending him with 
 hearty good wishes to the prosperity of all his enterprises. <I>Hosanna 
 to the Son of David</I> is, "This we do in honour of the Son of 
 David."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The hosannas with which Christ was attended bespeak two things:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Their welcoming his kingdom. <I>Hosanna</I> bespeaks the same 
 with, <I>Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</I> It was 
 foretold concerning this Son of David, that <I>all nations shall call 
 him blessed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:17">Ps. lxxii. 17</A>);

 these here began, and all true believers in all ages concur in it, and
 call him blessed; it is the genuine language of faith. Note, 
 <I>First,</I> Jesus Christ <I>comes in the name of the Lord;</I> he is 
 sanctified, and sent into the world, as Mediator; <I>him hath God the 
 Father sealed. Secondly,</I> The coming of Christ in the name of the 
 Lord, is <I>worthy of all acceptation;</I> and we all ought to say, 
 <I>Blessed is he that cometh;</I> to praise him, and be pleased in him. 
 Let his coming in the name of the Lord be mentioned with strong 
 affections, to our comfort, and joyful acclamations, to his glory. Well 
 may we say, <I>Blessed is he;</I> for it is in him that we are blessed. 
 Well may we follow <I>him</I> with our blessings, who meets us with 
 his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Their wishing well to his kingdom; intimated in their 
 <I>Hosanna;</I> earnestly desiring that prosperity and success may 
 attend it, and that it may be a victorious kingdom; "<I>Send now 
 prosperity</I> to that kingdom." If they understood it of a temporal 
 kingdom, and had their hearts carried out thus toward that, it was 
 their mistake, which a little time would rectify; however, their 
 good-will was accepted. Note, It is our duty earnestly to desire and 
 pray for the prosperity and success of Christ's kingdom in the world. 
 Thus <I>prayer must be made for him continually</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:15">Ps. lxxii. 15</A>),

 that all happiness may attend his interest in the world, and that,
 though he may ride on an ass, yet in his majesty he may <I>ride 
 prosperously, because of</I> that <I>meekness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:4">Ps. xlv. 4</A>.

 This we mean when we pray, <I>Thy kingdom come.</I> They add,
 <I>Hosanna in the highest:</I> Let prosperity in the highest degree 
 attend him, let him have a name above every name, a throne above every 
 throne; or, Let us praise him in the best manner for his church ascend 
 to heaven, to the highest heavens, and fetch in peace and salvation 
 from thence. See

 3. We have here his entertainment in Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 <I>When he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved;</I> every 
 one took notice of him, some were moved with wonder at the novelty of 
 the thing, others with laughter at the meanness of it; some perhaps 
 were moved with joy, <I>who waited for the Consolation of Israel;</I> 
 others, of the Pharisaical class, were moved with envy and indignation. 
 So various are the motions in the minds of men upon the approach of 
 Christ's kingdom!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Upon this commotion we are further told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What the citizens said; <I>Who is this?</I> 

 [1.] They were, it seems, ignorant concerning Christ. Though he was 
 <I>the Glory of his people Israel,</I> yet <I>Israel knew him not;</I> 
 though he had distinguished himself by the many miracles he wrought 
 among them, yet <I>the daughters of Jerusalem</I> knew him not <I>from 
 another beloved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:9">Cant. v. 9</A>.

 The Holy One unknown in the holy city! In places where the clearest
 light shines, and the greatest profession of religion is made, there is 
 more ignorance than we are.

 [2.] Yet they were inquisitive concerning him. Who is this that is thus
 cried, and comes with so much observation? <I>Who is this King of
 glory,</I> that demands admission into our hearts? 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:8,Isa+63:1">Ps. xxiv. 8; Isa. lxiii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How the multitude answered them; <I>This is Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The multitude were better acquainted with Christ than the great ones.
 <I>Vox populi--The voice of the people,</I> is sometimes <I>Vox 
 Dei--the voice of God.</I> Now, in the account they give of him, 

 [1.] They were right in calling him <I>the Prophet, that great 
 Prophet.</I> Hitherto he had been known as a Prophet, teaching and 
 working miracles; now they attend him as a King; Christ's priestly 
 office was, of all the three, last discovered.

 [2.] Yet they missed it, in saying he was <I>of Nazareth;</I> and it 
 helped to confirm some in their prejudices against him. Note, Some that 
 are willing to honour Christ, and bear their testimony to him, yet 
 labour under mistakes concerning him, which would be rectified if they 
 would take pains to inform themselves.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
 that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of
 the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
 &nbsp; 13  And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called
 the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
 &nbsp; 14  And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he
 healed them.
 &nbsp; 15  And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful
 things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and
 saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,
 &nbsp; 16  And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus
 saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of
 babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When Christ came into Jerusalem, he did not go up to the court or the 
 palace, though he came in as a King, but <I>into the temple;</I> for 
 his kingdom is spiritual, and <I>not of this world;</I> it is in holy 
 things that he rules, in the temple of God that he exercises authority. 
 Now, what did he do there?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Thence he drove the buyers and sellers. Abuses must first be purged 
 out, and the plants not of God's planting be plucked up, before that 
 which is right can be established. The great Redeemer appear as a great 
 Reformer, that turns away ungodliness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:26">Rom. xi. 26</A>.

 Here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 <I>He cast out all them that sold and bought;</I> he had done this once 
 before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:14,15">John ii. 14, 15</A>),

 but there was occasion to do it again. Note, Buyers and sellers driven
 out of the temple, will return and nestle there again, if there be not 
 a continual care and oversight to prevent it, and if the blow be not 
 followed, and often repeated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The abuse was, buying and selling, and changing money, in the
 temple. Note, Lawful things, ill timed and ill placed, may become 
 sinful things. That which was decent enough in another place, and not 
 only lawful, but laudable, on another day, <I>defiles the 
 sanctuary,</I> and <I>profanes the sabbath.</I> This buying and 
 selling, and changing money, though secular employments, yet had the 
 pretence of being <I>in ordine ad spiritualia--for spiritual
 purposes.</I> They sold beasts for sacrifice, for the convenience of 
 those that could more easily bring their money with them than their 
 beast; and they changed money for those that wanted the half shekel, 
 which was their yearly poll, or redemption-money; or, upon the bills of 
 return; so that this might pass for the outward business of the house 
 of God; and yet Christ will not allow of it. Note, Great corruptions 
 and abuses come into the church by the practices of those whose <I>gain 
 is godliness,</I> that is, who make worldly gain the end of their 
 godliness, and counterfeit godliness their way to worldly gain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:5">1 Tim. vi. 5</A>);
 
 <I>from such withdraw thyself.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The purging out of this abuse. Christ <I>cast them out that
 sold.</I> He did it before <I>with a scourge of small cords</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:15">John ii. 15</A>);

 now he did it with a look, with a frown, with a word of command. Some
 reckon this none of the least of Christ's miracles, that he should
 himself thus clear the temple, and not be opposed in it by them who by
 this craft got their living, and were backed in it by the priests and
 elders. It is an instance of his power over the spirits of men, and the
 hold he has of them by their own consciences. This was the only act of
 regal authority and coercive power that Christ did in the days of his
 flesh; he began with it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:12-25">John ii.</A>

 and here ended with it. Tradition says, that his face shone, and beams
 of light darted from his blessed eyes, which astonished these 
 market-people, and compelled them to yield to his command; if so, the 
 scripture was fulfilled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:8">Prov. xx. 8</A>,

 <I>A King that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all 
 evil with his eyes. He overthrew the tables of the money-changers;</I> 
 he did not take the money to himself, but scattered it, threw it to the 
 ground, the fittest place for it. The Jews, in Esther's time, <I>on the 
 spoil laid not their hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:10">Esther ix. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What he said, to justify himself, and to convict them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 <I>It is written.</I> Note, In the reformation of the church, the eye 
 must be upon the scripture, and that must be adhered to as the rule, 
 the pattern in the mount; and we must go no further than we can justify 
 ourselves with, <I>It is written.</I> Reformation is <I>then</I> right, 
 when corrupted ordinances are reduced to their primitive 
 institution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He shows, from a scripture prophecy, what the temple should be, 
 and was designed to be; <I>My house shall be called the house of 
 prayer;</I> which is quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:7">Isa. lvi. 7</A>.

 Note, All the ceremonial institutions were intended to be subservient
 to moral duties; the house of sacrifices was to be a house of prayer, 
 for that was the substance and soul of all those services; the temple 
 was in a special manner sanctified to be a house of prayer, for it was 
 not only the place of that worship, but the medium of it, so that the 
 prayers made in or toward that house had a particular promise of 
 acceptance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+6:21">2 Chron. vi. 21</A>),
 
 as it was a type of Christ; therefore Daniel looked that way in prayer;
 and in this sense no house or place is now, or can be, a house of 
 prayer, for Christ is our Temple; yet in some sense the appointed 
 places of our religious assemblies may be so called, as <I>places where 
 prayer is wont to be made,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+16:13">Acts xvi. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He shows, from a scripture reproof, how they had abused the 
 temple, and perverted the intention of it; <I>Ye have made it a den of 
 thieves.</I> This is quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:11">Jer. vii. 11</A>,

 <I>Is this house become a den of robbers in your eyes?</I> When
 dissembled piety is made the cloak and cover of iniquity, it may be 
 said that <I>the house of prayer</I> is become <I>a den of thieves,</I> 
 in which they lurk, and shelter themselves. Markets are too often dens 
 of thieves, so many are the corrupt and cheating practices in buying 
 and selling; but markets in the temple are certainly so, for they rob 
 God of his honour, the worst of thieves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:8">Mal. iii. 8</A>.

 The priests lived, and lived plentifully, upon the altar; but, not
 content with that, they found other ways and means to squeeze money out 
 of the people; and therefore Christ here calls them <I>thieves,</I> for 
 they exacted that which did not belong to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. There, in the temple, <I>he healed the blind and the lame,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 When he had driven the buyers and sellers out of the temple, he invited 
 the blind and lame into it; for <I>he fills the hungry with good 
 things, but the rich he sends empty away.</I> Christ, in the temple, by 
 his word there preached, and in answer to the prayers there made, heals 
 those that are spiritually blind and lame. It is good coming to the 
 temple, when Christ is there, who, as he shows himself jealous for the 
 honour of his temple, in expelling those who profane it, so he shows 
 himself gracious to those who humbly seek him. <I>The blind and the 
 lame</I> were debarred David's palace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:8">2 Sam. v. 8</A>),

 but were admitted into God's house; for the state and honour of his
 temple lie not in those things wherein the magnificence of princes' 
 palaces is supposed to consist; from them blind and lame must keep 
 their distance, but from God's temple only the wicked and profane. The 
 temple was profane and abused when it was made a market-place, but it 
 was graced and honoured when it was made an hospital; to be doing good 
 in God's, is more honourable, and better becomes it, than to be getting 
 money there. Christ's healing was a real answer to that question,
 <I>Who is this</I>? His works testified of him more than the 
 <I>hosannas;</I> and his healing in the temple was the fulfilling of 
 the promise, that <I>the glory of the latter house should be greater 
 than the glory of the former.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There also he silenced the offence which the chief priests and scribes 
 took at the acclamations with which he was attended, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 They that should have been most forward to give him honour, were his 
 worst enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were inwardly vexed at the wonderful things that he did; they 
 could not deny them to be true miracles, and therefore were cut to the 
 heart with indignation at them, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:16,5:33">Acts iv. 16; v. 33</A>.

 The works that Christ did, recommended themselves to every man's
 conscience. If they had any sense, they could not but own the miracle 
 of them; and if any good nature, could not but be in love with the 
 mercy of them: yet, because they were resolved to oppose him, for these 
 they envied him, and bore him a grudge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They openly quarrelled at the children's hosannas; they thought that 
 hereby an honour was given him, which did not belong to him, and that 
 it looked like ostentation. Proud men cannot bear that honour should be 
 done to any but to themselves, and are uneasy at nothing more than at 
 the just praises of deserving men. Thus Saul envied David the women's 
 songs; and "Who can stand before envy?" When Christ is most honoured, 
 his enemies are most displeased.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Just now we had Christ preferring the blind and the lame before the 
 buyers and sellers; now here we have him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 taking part with the children against priests and scribes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 (1.) The children were in the temple, perhaps playing there; no wonder, 
 when the rulers make it a <I>market-place,</I> that the children make 
 it a place of pastime; but we are willing to hope that many of them 
 were worshipping there. Note, It is good to bring children betimes to 
 the house of prayer, <I>for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</I> Let 
 children be taught to keep up the form of godliness, it will help to 
 lead them to the power of it. Christ has a tenderness for the lambs of 
 his flock.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They were there <I>crying Hosanna to the Son of David.</I> This 
 they learned from those that were grown up. Little children say and do 
 as they hear others say, and see others do; so easily do they imitate; 
 and therefore great care must be taken to set them good examples, and 
 no bad ones. <I>Maxima debetur puero reverentia--Our intercourse with
 the young should be conducted with the most scrupulous care.</I> 
 Children will learn of those that are with them, either to curse and 
 swear, or to pray and praise. The Jews did betimes teach their children 
 to carry branches at the feast of tabernacles, and to cry 
 <I>Hosanna;</I> but God taught them here to apply it to Christ. Note, 
 <I>Hosanna to the Son of David</I> well becomes the mouths of little 
 children, who should learn young the language of Canaan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Our Lord Jesus not only allowed it, but was very well pleased with 
 it, and quoted a scripture which was fulfilled in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:2">Ps. viii. 2</A>),

 or, at least, may be accommodated to it; <I>Out of the mouth of babes
 and sucklings thou hast perfected praise;</I> which, some think, refers 
 to the children's joining in the acclamations of the people, and the 
 women's songs with which David was honoured when he returned from the 
 slaughter of the Philistine, and therefore is very fitly applied here 
 to the hosannas with which the Son of David was saluted, now that he 
 was entering upon his conflict with Satan, that Goliath. Note,

 [1.] Christ is so far from being ashamed of the services of little 
 children, that he takes particular notice of them (and children love to
 be taken notice of), and is well pleased with them. If God may be 
 honoured by babes and sucklings, who are made to hope at the best, much 
 more by children who are grown up to maturity and some capacity.

 [2.] Praise is perfected out of the mouth of such; it has a peculiar 
 tendency to the honour and glory of God for little children to join in 
 his praises; the praise would be accounted defective and imperfect, if 
 they had not their share in it; which is an encouragement for children 
 to be good betimes, and to parents to teach them to be so; the labour 
 neither of the one nor of the other shall be in vain. In the psalm it 
 is, <I>Thou hast ordained strength.</I> Note, God <I>perfecteth 
 praise,</I> by <I>ordaining strength out of the mouths of babes and 
 sucklings.</I> When great things are brought about by weak and unlikely 
 instruments, God is thereby much honoured, for his <I>strength is 
 perfected in weakness,</I> and the infirmities of the babes and 
 sucklings serve for a foil to the divine power. That which follows in 
 the psalm, <I>That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger,</I> 
 was very applicable to the priests and scribes; but Christ did not 
 apply it to them, but left it to them to apply it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Christ, having thus silenced them, forsook them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 <I>He left them,</I> in prudence, lest they should now have seized him 
 before his hour was come; in justice, because they had forfeited the 
 favour of his presence. By repining at Christ's praises we drive him 
 from us. <I>He left them</I> as incorrigible, and he <I>went out of the 
 city to Bethany,</I> which was a more quiet retired place; not so much 
 that he might <I>sleep</I> undisturbed as that he might <I>pray</I> 
 undisturbed. <I>Bethany was but two little miles from Jerusalem;</I>
 thither he went on foot, to show that, when he rode, it was only to 
 <I>fulfil the scripture.</I> He was not lifted up with the hosannas of 
 the people; but, as having forgot them, soon returned to his mean and 
 toilsome way of travelling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he
 hungered.
 &nbsp; 19  And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and
 found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no
 fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig
 tree withered away.
 &nbsp; 20  And when the disciples saw <I>it,</I> they marvelled, saying, How
 soon is the fig tree withered away!
 &nbsp; 21  Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If
 ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this <I>which is
 done</I> to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this
 mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ <I>returned in the morning to Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Some think that he went out of the city over-night, because none of his 
 friends there durst entertain him, for fear of the great men; yet, 
 having work to do there, he returned. Note, We must never be driven off 
 from our duty either by the malice of our foes, or the unkindness of 
 our friends. Though he knew that in this city <I>bonds and afflictions 
 did abide him, yet none of these things moved</I> him. Paul followed 
 him when he <I>went bound in the spirit to Jerusalem,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:22">Acts xx. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. <I>As he went, he hungered.</I> He was a Man, and submitted to the 
 infirmities of nature; he was an active Man, and was so intent upon his 
 work, that he neglected his food, and came out, fasting; for <I>the 
 zeal of God's house</I> did even <I>eat him up,</I> and his <I>meat and 
 drink was to do his Father's will.</I> He was a poor Man, and had no 
 present supply; he was a Man that pleased not himself, for he would 
 willingly have taken up with green raw figs for his breakfast, when it 
 was fit that he should have had something warm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ <I>therefore</I> hungered, that he might have occasion to work 
 this miracle, in cursing and so withering the barren fig-tree, and 
 therein might give us an instance of his justice and his power, and 
 both instructive.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See his <I>justice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He went to it, expecting fruit, because it had leaves; but, finding 
 none, he sentenced it to a perpetual barrenness. The miracle had its 
 significance, as well as others of his miracles. All Christ's miracles 
 hitherto were wrought for the good of men, and proved the power of his 
 grace and blessing (the sending the devils into the herd of swine was 
 but a permission); all he did was for the benefit and comfort of his 
 friends, none for the terror or punishment of his enemies; but now, at 
 last, to show that <I>all judgment is committed to him,</I> and that 
 <I>he is able</I> not only <I>to save, but to destroy,</I> he would 
 give a specimen of the power of his wrath and curse; yet this not on 
 any man, woman, or child, because <I>the great day of his wrath is not 
 yet come,</I> but on an inanimate tree; that is set forth for an 
 example; <I>Come, learn a parable of the fig-tree,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:32"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 32</A>.

 The scope of it is the same with <I>the parable of the fig-tree,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:6">Luke xiii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This cursing of the barren fig-tree, represents the state of 
 hypocrites in general; and so it teaches us, 

 [1.] That the fruit of fig-trees may justly be expected from those that 
 have the leaves. Christ looks for the power of religion from those
 that make profession of it; the favour of it from those that have the 
 show of it; grapes from the vineyard that is planted in a fruitful 
 hill: he hungers after it, his soul <I>desires the first ripe 
 fruits.</I>

 [2.] Christ's just expectations from flourishing professors are often 
 frustrated and disappointed; he comes to many, seeking fruit, and finds 
 leaves only, and he discovers it. Many have a name to live, and are not 
 alive indeed; dote on the form of godliness, and yet deny the power of 
 it.

 [3.] The sin of barrenness is justly punished with the curse and plague 
 of barrenness; <I>Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.</I> 
 As one of the chiefest blessings, and which was the first, is, <I>Be 
 fruitful;</I> so one of the saddest curses is, <I>Be no more 
 fruitful.</I> Thus the sin of hypocrites is made their punishment; they 
 <I>would</I> not do good, and therefore they <I>shall</I> do none; he 
 that is fruitless, let him be fruitless still, and lose his honour and 
 comfort. 

 [4.] A false and hypocritical profession commonly withers in this 
 world, and it is the effect of Christ's curse; the fig-tree that had no 
 fruit, soon lost its leaves. Hypocrites may look plausible for a time, 
 but, having no principle, <I>no root in themselves,</I> their 
 profession will soon come to nothing; the gifts wither, common graces 
 decay, the credit of the profession declines and sinks, and the 
 falseness and folly of the pretender are manifested to all men.</P>

 (2.) It represents the state of the nation and people of the Jews in 
 particular; they were a fig-tree planted in Christ's way, as a church. 
 Now observe, 

 [1.] The disappointment they gave to our Lord Jesus. He came among 
 them, expecting to find some fruit, something that would be pleasing to 
 him; he hungered after it; not that he <I>desired a gift,</I> he needed 
 it not, <I>but fruit that might abound to a good account.</I> But his 
 expectations were frustrated; he found nothing but leaves; they called 
 <I>Abraham their father, but did not do the works of Abraham;</I> they 
 professed themselves expectants of the promised Messiah, but, when he 
 came, they did not receive and entertain him.

 [2.] The doom he passed upon them, <I>that never any fruit should grow 
 upon them</I> or be gathered from them, as a church or as a people, 
 <I>from henceforward for ever.</I> Never any good came from them 
 (except the particular persons among them that believe), after they 
 rejected Christ; they became worse and worse; blindness and hardness 
 happened to them, and grew upon them, till they were unchurched, 
 unpeopled, and undone, and their place and nation rooted up; their 
 beauty was defaced, their privileges and ornaments, their temple, and 
 priesthood, and sacrifices, and festivals, and all the glories of their 
 church and state, fell like leaves in autumn. How soon did their 
 fig-tree wither away, after they said, <I>His blood be on us, and our 
 children!</I> And the Lord was righteous in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See the <I>power</I> of Christ; the former is wrapped up in the 
 figure, but this more fully discoursed of; Christ intending thereby to 
 direct his disciples in the use of their powers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The disciples admired the effect of Christ's curse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);
 
 <I>They marvelled;</I> no power could do it but his, <I>who spake, and 
 it was done.</I> They marvelled at the suddenness of the thing; <I>How 
 soon is the fig-tree withered away!</I> There was no visible cause of 
 the fig-tree's withering, but it was a secret blast, a worm at the 
 root; it was not only the leaves of it that withered, but the body of 
 the tree; it withered away in an instant and became like a dry stick. 
 Gospel curses are, upon this account, the most dreadful--that they work
 insensibly and silently, by a fire not blown, but effectually.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ empowered them by faith to do the like 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>);

 as he said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:12">John xiv. 12</A>),

 <I>Greater works than these shall ye do.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 [1.] The description of this wonder-working faith; <I>If ye have faith, 
 and doubt not.</I> Note, Doubting of the power and promise of God is 
 the great thing that spoils the efficacy and success of faith. "If you 
 have faith, and dispute not" (so some read it), "dispute not with 
 yourselves, dispute not with the promise of God; if you <I>stagger not 
 at the promise</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:20">Rom. iv. 20</A>);

 for, as far as we do so, our faith is deficient; as certain as the
 promise is, so confident our faith should be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The power and prevalence of it expressed figuratively; <I>If ye 
 shall say to this mountain,</I> meaning the mount of Olives, <I>Be thou 
 removed, it shall be done.</I> There might be a particular reason for 
 his saying so of this mountain, for there was a prophecy, that <I>the 
 mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem, should cleave in the midst, 
 and then remove,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:4">Zech. xiv. 4</A>.

 Whatever was the intent of that word, the same must be the expectation
 of faith, how impossible soever it might appear to sense. But this is a 
 proverbial expression; intimating that we are to believe that nothing 
 is impossible with God, and therefore that what he has promised shall 
 certainly be performed, though to us it seem impossible. It was among 
 the Jews a usual commendation of their learned Rabbin, that they were 
 removers of mountains, that is, could solve the greatest difficulties; 
 now this may be done by faith acted on the word of God, which will 
 bring great and strange things to pass.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The way and means of exercising this faith, and of doing that 
 which is to be done by it; <I>All things whatsoever ye shall ask in 
 prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</I> Faith is the soul, prayer is 
 the body; both together make a complete man for any service. Faith, if 
 it be right, will excite prayer; and prayer is not right, if it do not 
 spring from faith. This is the condition of our receiving--we must
 <I>ask in prayer, believing.</I> The requests of prayer shall not be 
 denied; the expectations of faith shall not be frustrated. We have many 
 promises to this purport from the mouth of our Lord Jesus, and all to 
 encourage faith, the principal grace, and prayer, the principal duty, 
 of a Christian. It is but ask and have, believe and receive; and what 
 would we more? Observe, How comprehensive the promise is--<I>all things
 whatsoever ye shall ask;</I> this is like all and every the premises in 
 a conveyance. <I>All things,</I> in general; <I>whatsoever,</I> brings 
 it to particulars; though generals include particulars, yet such is the 
 folly of our unbelief, that, though we think we assent to promises in 
 the general, yet we fly off when it comes to particulars, and 
 therefore, <I>that we might have strong consolation,</I> it is thus 
 copiously expressed, <I>All things whatsoever.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and
 the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and
 said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave
 thee this authority?
 &nbsp; 24  And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you
 one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by
 what authority I do these things.
 &nbsp; 25  The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?
 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
 heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?
 &nbsp; 26  But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all
 hold John as a prophet.
 &nbsp; 27  And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he
 said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
 things.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our Lord Jesus (like St. Paul after him) preached his gospel <I>with 
 much contention;</I> his first appearance was in a dispute with <I>the 
 doctors in the temple, when he was twelve years old;</I> and here, just 
 before he died, we have him engaged in controversy. In this sense, he 
 was like Jeremiah, <I>a man of contention; not striving, but striven 
 with.</I> The great contenders with him, were, <I>the chief priests and 
 the elders,</I> the judges of two distinct courts: the chief priests 
 presided in the ecclesiastical court, in all matters of the Lord, as 
 they are called; the elders of the people were judges of the civil 
 courts, in temporal matters. See an idea of both, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:5,8,11">2 Chron. xix. 5, 8, 11</A>.
 
 These joined to attack Christ thinking they should find or make him
 obnoxious either to the one or to the other. See how woefully 
 degenerate that generation was, when the governors both in church and 
 state, who should have been the great promoters of the Messiah's 
 kingdom, were the great opposers of it! Here we have them disturbing 
 him when he was preaching, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 They would neither receive his instructions themselves, nor let others 
 receive them. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As soon as he came into Jerusalem, he went to the temple, though he 
 had been affronted there the day before, was there in the midst of 
 enemies and in the mouth of danger; yet thither he went, for there he 
 had a fairer opportunity of doing good to souls than any where else in 
 Jerusalem. Though he came hungry to the city, and was disappointed of a 
 breakfast at the barren fig-tree, yet, for aught that appears, he went 
 straight to the temple, as one that <I>esteemed the words of God's 
 mouth,</I> the preaching of them, <I>more than his necessary 
 food.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In the temple he was teaching; he had called it <I>a house of 
 prayer</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and here we have him preaching there. Note, In the solemn assemblies of 
 Christians, praying and preaching must go together, and neither must 
 encroach upon, or jostle out, the other. To make up communion with God, 
 we must not only speak to him in prayer, but hear what he has to say to 
 us by his word; ministers must <I>give themselves both to the word and 
 to prayer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:4">Acts vi. 4</A>.

 Now that Christ <I>taught in the temple,</I> that scripture was 
 fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3">Isa. ii. 3</A>),

 <I>Let us go up to the house of the Lord, and he will teach us his
 ways.</I> The priests of old often taught there <I>the good knowledge 
 of the Lord;</I> but they never had such a teacher as this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. When Christ was teaching the people, the priests and elders came 
 upon him, and challenged him to produce his orders; the hand of Satan 
 was in this, to hinder him in his work. Note, It cannot but be a 
 trouble to a faithful minister, to be taken off, or diverted from, 
 plain and practical preaching, by an unavoidable necessity of engaging 
 in controversies, yet good was brought out of this evil, for hereby 
 occasion was given to Christ to dispel the objections that were 
 advanced against him, to the greater satisfaction of his followers; 
 and, while his adversaries thought by their power to have silenced him, 
 he by his wisdom silenced them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, in this dispute with them, we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he was assaulted by their insolent demand; <I>By what authority 
 doest thou these things, and who gave thee this authority?</I> Had they 
 duly considered his miracles, and the power by which he wrought them, 
 they needed not to have asked this question; but they must have 
 something to say for the shelter of an obstinate infidelity. "Thou 
 ridest in triumph into Jerusalem, receivest the hosannas of the people, 
 controllest in the temple, drivest out such as had license to be there, 
 from the rulers of the temple, and paid them rent; thou are here 
 preaching a new doctrine; whence hadst thou a commission to do all 
 this? Was it from C&aelig;sar, or from the high priest, or from God? Produce
 thy warrant, thy credentials. Dost not thou take too much upon thee?" 
 Note, It is good for all that take upon them to act with authority, to 
 put this question to themselves, "Who gave us that authority?" For, 
 unless a man be clear in his own conscience concerning that, he cannot 
 act with any comfort or hope of success. They who run before their
 warrant, run without their blessing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:21,22">Jer. xxiii. 21, 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ had often said it, and proved it beyond contradiction, and 
 Nicodemus, a master in Israel, had owned it, that he was <I>a teacher 
 sent of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:2">John iii. 2</A>);

 yet, at this time of day, when that point had been so fully cleared and
 settled, they come to him with this question.

 (1.) In the ostentation of their own power, as chief priests and 
 elders, which they thought authorized them to call him to an account in 
 this manner. How haughtily do they ask, <I>Who gave thee this 
 authority?</I> Intimating that he could have no authority, because he 
 had none from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:24,Jer+20:1">1 Kings xxii. 24; Jer. xx. 1</A>.

 Note, It is common for the greatest abusers of their power to be the
 most rigorous assertors of it, and to take a pride and pleasure in any 
 thing that looks like the exercise of it.

 (2.) It was to ensnare and entangle him. Should he refuse to answer 
 this question, they would enter judgment against him upon <I>Nihil 
 dicit--He says nothing;</I> would condemn him as standing mute; and 
 would insinuate to the people, that his silence was a tacit confessing 
 of himself to be a usurper: should he plead an authority from God, they 
 would, as formerly, demand a sign from heaven, or make his 
 <I>de</I>fence his <I>of</I>fence, and accuse him of blasphemy for 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he answered this demand with another, which would help them to 
 answer it themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>);

 <I>I also will ask you one thing.</I> He declined giving them a direct 
 answer, lest they should take advantage against him; but answers them 
 with a question. Those that are <I>as sheep in the midst of wolves,</I> 
 have need to <I>be wise as serpents: the heart of the wise studieth to 
 answer.</I> We must <I>give a reason of the hope that is in us,</I> not 
 only <I>with meekness, but with fear</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:15">1 Pet. iii. 15</A>),

 with prudent caution, lest truth be damaged, or ourselves
 endangered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this question is concerning John's baptism, here put for his whole 
 ministry, preaching as well as baptizing; "Was this <I>from heaven, or 
 of men?</I> One of the two it must be; either what he did was of his 
 own head, or he was sent of God to do it." Gamaliel's argument turned 
 upon this hinge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:38,39">Acts v. 38, 39</A>);

 either <I>this counsel is of men or of God.</I> Though that which is
 manifestly bad cannot be of God, yet that which is seemingly good may 
 be of men, nay of Satan, when <I>he transforms himself into an angel of 
 light.</I> This question was not at all shuffling, to evade theirs; 
 but,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) If they answered this question, it would answer theirs: should
 they say, against their consciences, that John's baptism was of men, 
 yet it would be easy to answer, <I>John did no miracle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:41">John x. 41</A>),
 
 Christ did many; but should they say, as they could not but own, that
 John's baptism was from heaven (which was supposed in the questions
 sent him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:21">John i. 21</A>,

 <I>Art thou Elias, or that prophet?</I>) then their demand was
 answered, for he bare testimony to Christ. Note, Truths appear in the 
 clearest light when they are taken in their due order; the resolving of 
 the <I>previous</I> questions will be a key to the <I>main</I> 
 question.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) If they refused to answer it, that would be a good reason why he 
 should not offer proofs of his authority to men that were obstinately 
 prejudiced against the strongest conviction; it was but to cast pearls 
 before swine. Thus <I>he taketh the wise in their own craftiness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:19">1 Cor. iii. 19</A>);

 and those that would not be convinced of the plainest truths, shall be
 convicted of the vilest malice, against John first, then against 
 Christ, and in both against God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How they were hereby baffled and run aground; they knew the truth, 
 but would not own it, and so were taken in the snare they laid for our 
 Lord Jesus. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How <I>they reasoned with themselves,</I> not concerning the 
 merits of the cause, what proofs there were of the divine original of 
 John's baptism; no, their care was, how to make their part good against 
 Christ. Two things they considered and consulted, in this reasoning 
 with themselves--their credit, and their safety; the same things which
 <I>they</I> principally aim at, who <I>seek their own things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] They consider their own credit, which they would endanger if they 
 should own John's baptism to be of God; for then Christ would ask them, 
 before all the people. <I>Why did ye not believe him?</I> And to 
 acknowledge that a doctrine is from God, and yet not to receive and 
 entertain it, is the greatest absurdity and iniquity that a man can be 
 charged with. Many that will not be kept by the fear of sin from 
 neglecting and opposing that which they know to be true and good are 
 kept by the fear of shame from owning that to be true and good which 
 they neglect and oppose. Thus they <I>reject the counsel of God against 
 themselves,</I> in not submitting to John's baptism, and are left 
 without excuse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] They consider their own safety, that they would expose themselves 
 to the resentments of the people, if they should say that John's 
 baptism was of men; <I>We fear the people, for all hold John as a 
 prophet.</I> It seems, then, <I>First,</I> That the people had truer 
 sentiments of John than the chief priests and the elders had, or, at 
 least, were more free and faithful in declaring their sentiments. This 
 people, of whom they said in their pride that they <I>knew not the law, 
 and were cursed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:49">John vii. 49</A>),

 it seems, knew the gospel, and were blessed. <I>Secondly,</I> That the
 chief priests and elders stood in awe of the common people, which is an
 evidence that things were in disorder among them, and that mutual
 jealousies were at a great height; that the government was become
 obnoxious to the hatred and scorn of the people, and the scripture was
 fulfilled, <I>I have made you contemptible and base,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:8,9">Mal. ii. 8, 9</A>.
 
 If they had kept their integrity, and done their duty, they had kept up
 their authority, and needed not to fear the people. We find sometimes
 that the people feared them, and it served them for a reason why they
 did not confess Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:22,12:42">John ix. 22, xii. 42</A>.

 Note, Those could not but fear the people, who studied only how to make
 the people fear them. <I>Thirdly,</I> That it is usually the temper
 even of common people to be zealous for the honour of that which they 
 account sacred and divine. If they <I>account John as a prophet,</I>
 they will not endure that it should be said, <I>His baptism was of 
 men;</I> hence the hottest contests have been about holy things. 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> That the chief priests and elders were kept from an 
 open denial of the truth, even against the conviction of their own 
 minds, not by the fear of God, but purely by the fear of the people; as 
 the <I>fear of man</I> may <I>bring</I> good people into <I>a snare</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:25">Prov. xxix. 25</A>),

 so sometimes it may keep bad people from being <I>overmuch wicked, lest
 they should die before their time,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:17">Eccl. vii. 17</A>.

 Many bad people would be much worse than they are, if they durst.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How they replied to our Saviour, and so dropped the question. They 
 fairly confessed <I>We cannot tell;</I> that is, "We will not;" 
 <B><I>ouk oi damen</I></B>--<I>We never knew.</I> The more shame for
 them, while they pretended to be leaders of the people, and by their 
 office were obliged to take cognizance of such things; when they would 
 not confess their knowledge, they were constrained to confess their 
 ignorance. And observe, by the way, when they said, <I>We cannot 
 tell,</I> they told a lie, for they knew that John's baptism was of 
 God. Note, There are many who are more afraid of the <I>shame</I> of 
 lying than of the <I>sin,</I> and therefore scruple not to speak that 
 which they know to be false concerning their own thoughts and 
 apprehensions, their affections and intentions, or their remembering or 
 forgetting of things, because in those things they know nobody can 
 disprove them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus Christ avoided the snare they laid for him, and justified himself 
 in refusing to gratify them; <I>Neither tell I you by what authority I 
 do these things.</I> If they be so wicked and base as either not to 
 believe, or not to confess, that the baptism of John was from heaven 
 (though it obliged to repentance, that great duty, and sealed the 
 kingdom of God at hand, that great promise), they were not fit to be 
 discoursed with concerning Christ's authority; for men of such a 
 disposition could not be convinced of the truth, nay, they could not 
 but be provoked by it, and therefore <I>he that is thus ignorant, let 
 him be ignorant still.</I> Note, Those that imprison the truths they 
 know, in unrighteousness (either by not professing them, or by not 
 practising according to them), are justly denied the further truths
 they enquire after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:18,19">Rom. i. 18, 19</A>.

 Take away the talent from him that buried it; those that <I>will
 not</I> see, <I>shall not</I> see.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  But what think ye? A <I>certain</I> man had two sons; and he came
 to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.
 &nbsp; 29  He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented,
 and went.
 &nbsp; 30  And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he
 answered and said, I <I>go,</I> sir: and went not.
 &nbsp; 31  Whether of them twain did the will of <I>his</I> father? They say
 unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto
 you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of
 God before you.
 &nbsp; 32  For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
 believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him:
 and ye, when ye had seen <I>it,</I> repented not afterward, that ye
 might believe him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As Christ instructed his disciples by parables, which made the 
 instructions the more easy, so sometimes he convinced his adversaries 
 by parables, which bring reproofs more close, and make men, or ever 
 they are aware, to reprove themselves. Thus Nathan convinced David by a 
 parable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:1">2 Sam. xxii. 1</A>),

 and the woman of Tekoa surprised him in like manner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:2">2 Sam. xiv. 2</A>:

 Reproving parables are appeals to the offenders themselves, and judge 
 them out of their own mouths. This Christ designs here, as appears by 
 the first words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 <I>But what think you?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have the parable of the <I>two sons</I> sent to work 
 in the vineyard, the scope of which is to show that they who knew not 
 John's baptism to be of God, were shamed even by the publicans and 
 harlots, who knew it, and owned it. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The parable itself, which represents two sorts of persons; some that 
 prove better than they promise, represented by the first of those sons; 
 others that promise better than they prove represented by the 
 second.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They had both one and the same father, which signifies that God is a 
 common Father to all mankind. There are favours which all alike receive
 from him, and obligations which all alike lie under to him; <I>Have we
 not all one Father?</I> Yes, and yet there is a vast difference between
 men's characters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They had both the same command given them; <I>Son, go work to-day in
 my vineyard.</I> Parents should not breed up their children in
 idleness; nothing is more pleasing, and yet nothing more pernicious, to 
 youth than that. 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:27">Lam. iii. 27</A>.

 God sets his children to work, though they are all heirs. This command
 is given to every one of us. Note,

 (1.) The work of religion, which we are called to engage in, is 
 vineyard work, creditable, profitable, and pleasant. By the sin of Adam 
 we were turned out to work upon the common, and to eat the herb of the 
 field; but by the grace of our Lord Jesus we are called to work again 
 in the vineyard. 

 (2.) The gospel call to work in the vineyard, requires present 
 obedience; <I>Son, go work</I> to-day, while it is called to-day, 
 because <I>the night comes when no man can work.</I> We were not sent 
 into the world to be idle, nor had we daylight given us to play by; and 
 therefore, if ever we mean to do any thing for God and our souls, why 
 not now? Why not to-day? 

 (3.) The exhortation to go <I>work to-day in the vineyard,</I> speaketh 
 unto us <I>as unto children</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:5">Heb. xii. 5</A>);

 <I>Son, go work.</I> It is the command of a Father, which carries with
 it both authority and affection, a Father that pities his children, and 
 considers their frame, and will not overtask them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:13,14">Ps. ciii. 13, 14</A>),

 a Father that is very tender of <I>his Son that serves him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:17">Mal. iii. 17</A>.

 If we work in our Father's vineyard, we work for ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their conduct was very different.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) One of the sons did better than he said, proved better than he 
 promised. His answer was bad, but his actions were good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Here is the untoward answer that he gave to his father; he said, 
 flat and plain <I>I will not.</I> See to what a degree of impudence the 
 corrupt nature of man rises, to say, <I>I will not,</I> to the command 
 of a Father; such a command of such a Father; they are impudent 
 children, and stiff-hearted. Those that will not bend, surely they 
 cannot blush; if they had any degree of modesty left them, they could 
 not say, <I>We will not.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:25">Jer. ii. 25</A>.

 Excuses are bad, but downright denials are worse; yet such peremptory
 refusals do the calls of the gospel often meet with. <I>First,</I> Some 
 love their ease, and will not work; they would live in the world as 
 leviathan in the waters, to play therein

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:26">Ps. civ. 26</A>);

 they do not love working. <I>Secondly,</I> Their hearts are so much
 upon their own fields, that they are not for working in God's vineyard. 
 They love the business of the world better than the business of their 
 religion. Thus some by the delights of sense, and others by the 
 employments of the world, are kept from doing that great work which 
 they were sent into the world about, and so <I>stand all the day 
 idle.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Here is the happy change of his mind, and of his way, upon second 
 thought; <I>Afterward he repented, and went.</I> Note, There are many 
 who in the beginning are wicked and wilful, and very unpromising, who 
 afterward repent and mend, and come to something. Some that God hath 
 chosen, are suffered for a great while to run to a great excess of 
 riot; <I>Such were some of you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:11">1 Cor. vi. 11</A>.

 These are set forth for <I>patterns of long-suffering,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:16">1 Tim. i. 16</A>.

 <I>Afterward he repented.</I> Repentance is
 <B><I>metanoia</I></B>--<I>an after-wit:</I> and 
 <B><I>metameleia</I></B>--<I>an after-care.</I> Better late than never.
 Observe, When he repented he went; that was the <I>fruit meet for 
 repentance.</I> The only evidence of our repentance for our former 
 resistance, is, immediately to comply, and set to work; and then what 
 is past, shall be pardoned, and all shall be well. See what a kind 
 Father God is; he resents not the affront of our refusals, as justly he 
 might. He that told his father to his face, that he <I>would not</I> do 
 as he bid him, deserved to be turned out of doors, and disinherited; 
 but our God <I>waits to be gracious,</I> and, not withstanding our 
 former follies, if we repent and mend, will favourably accept of us; 
 blessed be God, we are under a covenant that leaves room for such a 
 repentance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The other son said better than he did, promised better than he 
 proved; his answer was good but his actions bad. To him the father 
 <I>said likewise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 The gospel call, though very different, is, in effect, the same to all, 
 and is carried on with an even tenour. We have all the same commands,
 engagements, encouragements, though to some they are a savour of life 
 unto life, to others of death unto death. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] How fairly this other son promised; <I>He said, I go, sir.</I> He 
 gives his father a title of respect, <I>sir.</I> Note, It becomes 
 children to speak respectfully to their parents. It is one branch of 
 that honour which the fifth commandment requires. He professes a ready 
 obedience, <I>I go;</I> not, "I will go by and by," but, "Ready, sir, 
 you may depend upon it, I go just now." This answer we should give from 
 the heart heartily to all the calls and commands of the word of God. 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:22,Ps+27:8">Jer. iii. 22; Ps. xxvii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] How he failed in the performance; <I>He went not.</I> Note, There 
 are many that give good words, and make fair promises, in religion, and 
 those from some good motions for the present, that rest there, and go 
 no further, and so come to nothing. Saying and doing are two things;
 and many there are that say, and do not; it is particularly charged 
 upon the Pharisees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:3"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 3</A>.

 Many with their mouth show much love, but their heart goes another way.
 They had a good mind to be religious, but they met with something to be 
 done, that was too hard, or something to be parted with, that was too 
 dear, and so their purposes are to no purpose. Buds and blossoms are 
 not fruit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A general appeal upon the parable; <I>Whether of them twain did the 
 will of his father?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 They both had their faults, one was rude and the other was false, such 
 variety of exercises parents sometimes have in the different humours of 
 their children, and they have need of a great deal of wisdom and grace 
 to know what is the best way of managing them. But the question is, 
 Which was the better of the two, and the less faulty? And it was soon 
 resolved; the first, because his actions were better than his words, 
 and his latter end than his beginning. This they had learned from the 
 common sense of mankind, who would much rather deal with one that will 
 be better than his word, than with one that will be false to his word. 
 And, in the intention of it, they had learned from the account God 
 gives of the rule of his judgment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:21-24">Ezek. xviii. 21-24</A>),

 that if <I>the sinner turn from his wickedness,</I> he shall be
 pardoned; and<I>if the righteous man turn from his righteousness,</I> 
 he shall be rejected. The tenour of the whole scripture gives us to
 understand that those are accepted as doing their Father's will, who, 
 wherein they have missed it, are sorry for it, and do better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A particular application of it to the matter in hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.
 
 The primary scope of the parable is, to show how the publicans and 
 harlots, who never talked of the Messiah and his kingdom, yet 
 entertained the doctrine, and submitted to the discipline, of John the 
 Baptist, his forerunner, when the priests and elders, who were big with 
 expectations of the Messiah, and seemed very ready to go into his 
 measures, slighted John the Baptist, and ran counter to the designs of 
 his mission. But it has a further reach; the Gentiles were <I>sometimes 
 disobedient,</I> had been long so, children of disobedience, like the 
 elder son 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+3:3,4">Tit. iii. 3, 4</A>);

 yet, when the gospel was preached to them, they became obedient to the
 faith; whereas the Jews who said, <I>I go, sir,</I> promised fair

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:7,Jos+24:24">Exod. xxiv. 7; Josh. xxiv. 24</A>);

 yet went not; they did but flatter God with their mouth. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:36">Ps. lxxviii. 36</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In Christ's application of this parable, observe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he proves that John's baptism was <I>from heaven, and not of 
 men.</I> "If you <I>cannot</I> tell," saith Christ, "you <I>might</I> 
 tell,"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) By the scope of his ministry; <I>John came unto you in the way of 
 righteousness.</I> Would you know whether John had his commission from 
 heaven, remember the rule of trial, <I>By their fruits ye shall know 
 them;</I> the fruits of their doctrines, the fruits of their doings. 
 Observe but their way, and you may trace out both their rise and their 
 tendency. Now it was evident that John came <I>in the way of 
 righteousness.</I> In his ministry, he taught people to repent, and to 
 work the works of righteousness. In his conversation, he was a great 
 example of strictness, and seriousness, and contempt of the world, 
 denying himself, and doing good to every body else. Christ 
 <I>therefore</I> submitted to the baptism of John, because it <I>became 
 him to fulfil all righteousness.</I> Now, if John thus came in the way 
 of righteousness, could they be ignorant that his baptism was from 
 heaven, or make any doubt of it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) By the success of his ministry; <I>The publicans and the harlots 
 believed him;</I> he did abundance of good among the worst sort of 
 people. St. Paul proves his apostleship by the seals of his ministry, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:2">1 Cor. ix. 2</A>.

 If God had not sent John the Baptist, he would not have crowned his
 labours with such wonderful success, nor have made him so instrumental 
 as he was for the conversion f souls. If publicans and harlots believe 
 his report, surely the arm of the Lord is with him. The people's 
 profiting is the minister's best testimonial.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he reproves them for their contempt of John's baptism, which
 yet, for fear of the people, they were not willing to own. To shame 
 them for it, he sets before them the faith, repentance, and obedience, 
 of the publicans and harlots, which aggravated their unbelief and 
 impenitence. As he shows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:21"><I>ch.</I> xi. 21</A>,

 that the less likely would have repented, so here that the less likely
 did repent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The publicans and harlots were like the first son in the parable, 
 from whom little of religion was expected. They promised little good, 
 and those that knew them promised themselves little good from them. 
 Their disposition was generally rude, and their conversation profligate 
 and debauched; and yet many of them were wrought upon the by the 
 ministry of John, who came in the spirit and power of Elias. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:29">Luke vii. 29</A>.

 These fitly represented the Gentile world; for, as Dr. Whitby observes,
 the Jews generally ranked the publicans with the heathen; nay, and the 
 heathen were represented by the Jews as harlots, and born of harlots,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:41">John viii. 41</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The scribes and Pharisees, the chief priests and elders, and 
 indeed the Jewish nation in general, were like the other son that gave 
 good words; they made a specious profession of religion, and yet, when 
 the kingdom of the Messiah was brought among them by the baptism of 
 John, they slighted it, they turned their back upon it, nay they 
 <I>lifted up the heel against it.</I> A hypocrite is more hardly 
 convinced and converted than a gross sinner; the form of godliness, if 
 that be rested in, becomes one of Satan's strongholds, by which he 
 opposes the power of godliness. It was an aggravation of their 
 unbelief, 

 [1.] That John was such an excellent person, that he came, and came to 
 them, in <I>the way of righteousness.</I> The better the means are, the 
 greater will the account be, if not improved.

 [2.] That, when they saw the publicans and harlots go before them into
 the kingdom of heaven, they did not afterward repent and believe; were
 not thereby provoked to a holy emulation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:14">Rom. xi. 14</A>.

 Shall publicans and harlots go away with grace and glory; and shall not
 we put in for a share? Shall our inferiors be more holy and more happy
 than we? They had not the wit and grace that Esau had, who was moved to 
 take other measures than he had done, by the example of his younger 
 brother,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+28:6">Gen. xxviii. 6</A>.

 These proud priests, that set up for leaders, scorned to follow, though
 it were into the kingdom of heaven, especially to follow publicans; 
 through the pride of their countenance, they would not seek after God, 
 after Christ,

 <TR><TD><FONT SIZE=+1><I>The Parable of the Wicked Husbandmen.</I></FONT></TD>
 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>33  Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which
 planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a
 winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen,
 and went into a far country:
 &nbsp; 34  And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his
 servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of
 it.
 &nbsp; 35  And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and
 killed another, and stoned another.
 &nbsp; 36  Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they
 did unto them likewise.
 &nbsp; 37  But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
 reverence my son.
 &nbsp; 38  But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among
 themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us
 seize on his inheritance.
 &nbsp; 39  And they caught him, and cast <I>him</I> out of the vineyard, and
 slew <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 40  When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he
 do unto those husbandmen?
 &nbsp; 41  They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked
 men, and will let out <I>his</I> vineyard unto other husbandmen, which
 shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
 &nbsp; 42  Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,
 The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the
 head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is
 marvellous in our eyes?
 &nbsp; 43  Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken
 from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 44  And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but
 on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
 &nbsp; 45  And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his
 parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
 &nbsp; 46  But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
 multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This parable plainly sets forth the sin and ruin of the Jewish nation; 
 they and their leaders are the husbandmen here; and what is spoken for 
 conviction to them, is spoken for caution to all that enjoy the 
 privileges of the visible church, not to be high-minded, but fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here the privileges of the Jewish church, represented by the 
 letting out of a vineyard to the husbandmen; they were as tenants 
 holding by, from, and under, God the great Householder. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How God established a church for himself in the world. The kingdom 
 of God upon earth is here compared to a vineyard, furnished with all 
 things requisite to an advantageous management and improvement of it. 
 
 (1.) He planted this vineyard. The church is <I>the planting of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:3">Isa. lxi. 3</A>.

 The forming of a church is a work by itself, like the planting of a 
 vineyard, which requires a great deal of cost and care. It is <I>the 
 vineyard which his right hand has planted</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:15">Ps. lxxx. 15</A>),

 planted with the <I>choicest vine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:2">Isa. v. 2</A>),

 <I>a noble vine,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:21">Jer. ii. 21</A>.

 The earth of itself produces thorns and briars; but vines must be
 planted. The being of a church is owing to God's distinguishing favour, 
 and his manifesting himself to some, and not to others.

 (2.) He hedged it round about. Note, God's church in the world is taken
 under his special protection. It is <I>a hedge round about,</I> like 
 that about Job on every side 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:10">Job i. 10</A>),
 
 a wall of fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:5">Zech. ii. 5</A>.
 
 Wherever God has a church, it is, and will always be, his peculiar
 care. The covenant of circumcision and the ceremonial law were a hedge 
 or a wall of partition about the Jewish church, which is taken down by 
 Christ; who yet has appointed a gospel order and discipline to be the 
 hedge of his church. He will not have his vineyard to lie in common, 
 that those who are without, may thrust in at pleasure; not to lie at 
 large, that those who are within, may lash out at pleasure; but care is 
 taken to set bounds about this holy mountain.

 (3.) He <I>digged a wine-press and built a tower.</I> The altar of 
 burnt-offerings was the wine-press, to which all the offerings were 
 brought. God instituted ordinances in his church, for the due oversight 
 of it, and for the promoting of its fruitfulness. What could have been 
 done more to make it every way convenient?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he entrusted these visible church-privileges with the nation and 
 people of the Jews, especially their chief priests and elders; he let 
 it out to them as husbandmen, not because he had need of them as 
 landlords have of their tenants, but because he would try them, and be 
 honoured by them. When in Judah God was known, and his name was great, 
 when they were taken to be to God <I>for a people, and for a name, and 
 for a praise</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:11">Jer. xiii. 11</A>),

 when he <I>revealed his word unto Jacob</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:19">Ps. cxlvii. 19</A>),

 when the <I>covenant of life and peace</I> was made with Levi

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:4,5">Mal. ii. 4, 5</A>),

 then this vineyard was let out. See an abstract of the lease,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:11,12">Cant. viii. 11, 12</A>.

 The Lord of the vineyard was to have <I>a thousand pieces of silver</I>
 (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:13">Isa. vii. 13</A>);

 the main profit was to be his, but the keepers were to have two
 hundred, a competent and comfortable encouragement. And then he <I>went 
 into a far country.</I> When God had in a visible appearance settled 
 the Jewish church at mount Sinai, he did in a manner withdraw; they had 
 no more such open vision, but were left to the written word. Or, they 
 imagined that he was gone into a far country, as Israel, when they made 
 the calf, fancied that Moses was gone. They put far from them the evil 
 day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God's expectation of rent from these husbandmen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 It was a reasonable expectation; for <I>who plants a vineyard, and eats 
 not of the fruit thereof?</I> Note, From those that enjoy 
 church-privileges, both ministers and people, God looks for fruit 
 accordingly. 

 1. His expectations were not hasty; he did not demand a fore-rent,
 though he had been at such expense upon it; but staid <I>till the time 
 of the fruit drew near,</I> as it did now that John preached the 
 <I>kingdom of heaven is at hand.</I> God waits to be gracious, that he 
 may give us time. 

 2. They were not high; he did not require them to come at their peril,
 upon penalty of forfeiting their lease if they ran behind-hand; but he 
 sent his <I>servants to them,</I> to remind them of their duty, and of 
 the rent-day, and to help them in gathering in the fruit, and making 
 return of it. These servants were the prophets of the Old Testament, 
 who were sent, and sometimes directly, to the people of the Jews, to 
 reprove and instruct them. 

 3. They were not hard; it was only to <I>receive the fruits.</I> He
 did not demand more than they could make of it, but some fruit of that 
 which he himself planted--an observance of the laws and statutes he 
 gave them. What could have been done more reasonable? Israel was an 
 empty vine, nay it was become the degenerate plant of a strange vine, 
 and brought forth wild grapes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The husbandmen's baseness in abusing the messengers that were sent 
 to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When he sent them his servants, they abused them, though they 
 represented the master himself, and spoke in his name. Note, The calls 
 and reproofs of the word, if they do not engage, will but exasperate. 
 See here what hath all along been the lot of God's faithful messengers, 
 more or less; 

 (1.) To suffer; <I>so persecuted they the prophets,</I> who were hated 
 with a cruel hatred. They not only despised and reproached them, but 
 treated them as the worst of malefactors--they beat them, and killed 
 them, and stoned them. They beat Jeremiah, killed Isaiah, stoned 
 Zechariah the son of Jehoiada in the temple. If they that <I>live godly 
 in Christ Jesus</I> themselves shall <I>suffer persecution,</I> much 
 more they that press others to it. This was God's old quarrel with the 
 Jews, misusing his prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:16">2 Chron. xxxvi. 16</A>.

 (2.) It has been their lot to suffer from their Master's own tenants; 
 they were the husbandmen that treated them thus, the chief priests and 
 elders that <I>sat in Moses's chair,</I> that professed religion and 
 relation to God; these were the most bitter enemies of the Lord's 
 prophets, that cast them out, and killed them, and said, <I>Let the 
 Lord be glorified,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5">Isa. lxvi. 5</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:1,2,26:11">Jer. xx. 1, 2; xxvi. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now see, 

 [1.] How God persevered in his goodness to them. He sent other 
 servants, more than the first; though the first sped not, but were 
 abused. He had sent them John the Baptist, and him they had beheaded; 
 and yet he sent them his disciples, to prepare his way. O the riches of 
 the patience and forbearance of God, in keeping up in his church a 
 despised, persecuted ministry!

 [2.] How they persisted in their wickedness. They <I>did unto them 
 likewise.</I> One sin makes way for another of the same kind. They that 
 are drunk with the blood of the saints, add drunkenness to thirst, and 
 still cry, Give, give.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. At length, he sent them his Son; we have seen God's goodness in 
 sending, and their badness in abusing, the servants; but in the latter 
 instance both these exceed themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Never did grace appear more gracious than in <I>sending the 
 Son.</I> This was done <I>last of all.</I> Note, All the prophets were 
 harbingers and forerunners to Christ. He was sent last; for if nothing 
 else would work upon them, surely this would; it was therefore served 
 for the <I>ratio ultima--the last expedient. Surely they will reverence
 my Son,</I> and therefore I will send him. Note, It might reasonably be 
 expected that the Son of God, when he came to his own, should be 
 reverenced; and reverence to Christ would be a powerful and effectual 
 principle of fruitfulness and obedience, to the glory of God; if they 
 will but reverence the Son, the point is gained. <I>Surely they will 
 reverence my Son,</I> for he comes with more authority than the 
 servants could; judgment is committed to him, that <I>all men should 
 honour him.</I> There is greater danger in refusing him than in 
 despising Moses's law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Never did sin appear more sinful than in the abusing of him, which 
 was now to be done in two or three days. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] How it was plotted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>);

 <I>When they saw the Son:</I> when he came, whom the people owned and 
 followed as the Messiah, who would either have the rent paid, or 
 distrain for it; this touched their copyhold, and they were resolved to 
 make one bold push for it, and to preserve their wealth and grandeur by 
 taking <I>him</I> out of the way, who was the only hindrance to it, and 
 rival with them. <I>This is the heir, come, let us kill him.</I> Pilate 
 and Herod, the princes of this world, <I>knew not;</I> for <I>if they 
 had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>.

 But the <I>chief priests and elders</I> knew that <I>this was the
 heir,</I> at least some of them; and therefore <I>Come, let us kill 
 him.</I> Many are killed for what they have. The chief thing they 
 envied him, and for which they hated and feared him, was his interest 
 in the people, and their hosannas, which, if he was taken off, they 
 hope to engross securely to themselves. They pretended that he must 
 die, to save the people from the Romans

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:50">John xi. 50</A>);

 but really he must die, to save their hypocrisy and tyranny from that
 reformation which the expected kingdom of the Messiah would certainly 
 bring along with it. He drives the buyers and sellers out of the 
 temple; and therefore <I>let us kill him;</I> and then, as if the 
 premises must of course go to the occupant, <I>let us seize on his 
 inheritance.</I> They thought, if they could but get rid of this Jesus, 
 they should carry all before them in the church without control, might 
 impose what traditions, and force the people to what submissions, they 
 pleased. Thus they <I>take counsel against the Lord and his 
 Anointed;</I> but he that <I>sits in heaven,</I> laughs to see them 
 <I>outshot in their own bow;</I> for, while they thought to kill him, 
 and so to seize on his inheritance, he went by his cross to his crown, 
 and they were broken pieces with a rod of iron, and their inheritance 
 seized. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:2,3,6,9">Ps. ii. 2, 3, 6, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] How this plot was executed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 While they were so set upon killing him, in pursuance of their design 
 to secure their own pomp and power, and while he was so set upon dying, 
 in pursuance of his design to subdue Satan, and save his chosen, no 
 wonder if they soon <I>caught him, and slew him,</I> when his hour was 
 come. Though the Roman power condemned him, yet it is still charged 
 upon the chief priests and elders; for they were not only the 
 prosecutors, but the principal agents, and had <I>the greater sin. Ye 
 have taken,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>.

 Nay looking upon him to be as unworthy to live, as they were unwilling
 he should, <I>they cast him out of the vineyard,</I> out of the holy 
 church, which they supposed themselves to have the key of, and out of 
 the holy city for he was crucified <I>without the gate,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:12">Heb. xiii. 12</A>.

 As if <I>He</I> had been the shame and reproach, who was the greatest
 glory of his people Israel. Thus they who persecuted the servants,
 persecuted the Son; as men treat God's ministers, they would treat 
 Christ himself, if he were with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is their doom read out of their own mouths, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:40,41"><I>v.</I> 40, 41</A>.

 He puts it to them, <I>When the Lord of the vineyard cometh, what will 
 he do unto these husbandmen?</I> He puts it to themselves, for their 
 stronger conviction, that <I>knowing the judgment of God</I> against 
 them which do such things, they might be the more inexcusable. Note, 
 God's proceedings are so unexceptionable, that there needs but an 
 appeal to sinners themselves concerning the equity of them. God will be 
 <I>justified when he speaks.</I> They could readily answer, <I>He will 
 miserably destroy those wicked men.</I> Note, Many can easily 
 prognosticate the dismal consequences of other people's sins, that see 
 not what will be the end of their own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Our Saviour, in his question, supposes that <I>the lord of the 
 vineyard will come,</I> and reckon with them. God is the Lord of the 
 vineyard; the property is his, and he will make <I>them</I> know it, 
 who now <I>lord it over his heritage,</I> as if it were all their own. 
 The Lord of the vineyard will come. Persecutors say in their hearts, He 
 <I>delays his coming,</I> he <I>doth not see,</I> he <I>will not 
 require;</I> but they shall find, though he bear long with them, he 
 will not bear always. It is comfort to abused saints and ministers, 
 that <I>the Lord is at hand,</I> the <I>Judge stands before the 
 door.</I> When he comes, what will he do to carnal professors? What 
 will he do to cruel persecutors? They must be called to account, they 
 have their day now; but he <I>sees that his day is coming.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They, in their answer, suppose that it will be a terrible reckoning; 
 the crime appearing so very black, you may be sure,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he will <I>miserably destroy those wicked men;</I> it is 
 destruction that is their doom. <B><I>Kakous kakos
 apolesei</I></B>--<I>Malos male perdet.</I> Let men never expect to do
 ill, and fare well. This was fulfilled upon the Jews, in that miserable 
 destruction which was brought upon them by the Romans, and was 
 completed about forty years after this; and unparalleled ruin, attended 
 with all the most dismal aggravating circumstances. It will be 
 fulfilled upon all that tread in the steps of their wickedness; hell is 
 everlasting destruction, and it will be the most miserable destruction 
 to them of all others, that have enjoyed the greatest share of church 
 privileges, and have not improved them. The hottest place in hell will 
 be the portion of hypocrites and persecutors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That he will <I>let out his vineyard to other husbandmen.</I> 
 Note, God will have a church in the world, notwithstanding the 
 unworthiness and opposition of many that abuse the privileges of it. 
 The unbelief and frowardness of man shall not make the word of God of 
 no effect. If one will not, another will. The Jews' leavings were the 
 Gentiles' feast. Persecutors may destroy the ministers, but cannot 
 destroy the church. The Jews imagined that no doubt <I>they were the 
 people,</I> and wisdom and holiness must <I>die with them;</I> and if 
 they were cut off, what would God do for a church in the world? But 
 when God makes use of any to bear up his name, it is not because he 
 needs them, nor is he at all beholden to them. If we were made a 
 desolation and an astonishment, God could build a flourishing church 
 upon our ruins; for he is never at a loss what to do for his great 
 name, whatever becomes of us, and of our place and nation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The further illustration and application of this by Christ himself, 
 telling them, in effect, that they had rightly judged.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He illustrates it by referring to a scripture fulfilled in this 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>);

 <I>Did ye never read in the scriptures?</I> Yes, no doubt, they had 
 often read and sung it, but had not considered it. We lose the benefit 
 of what we read for want of meditation. The scripture he quotes is 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:22,23">Ps. cxviii. 22, 23</A>,

 the same context out of which the children fetched their hosannas. The
 same word yields matter of praise and comfort to Christ's friends and 
 followers, which speaks conviction and terror to his enemies. Such a 
 two-edged sword is the word of God. That scripture, the <I>Stone which 
 the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner,</I> 
 illustrates the preceding parable, especially that part of it which 
 refers to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The builders' rejecting of the stone is the same with the 
 husbandmen's abusing of the son that was sent to them. The chief 
 priests and the elders were the builders, had the oversight of the 
 Jewish church, which was God's building: and they would not allow 
 Christ a place in their building, would not admit his doctrine or laws 
 into their constitution; they threw him aside as a despised broken 
 vessel, a stone that would serve only for a stepping-stone, to be 
 trampled upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The advancing of this stone to be the head of the corner is the 
 same with <I>letting out the vineyard to other husbandmen.</I> He who 
 was rejected by the Jews was embraced by the Gentiles; and to that 
 church where there is no difference of circumcision or uncircumcision, 
 <I>Christ is all, and in all.</I> His authority over the gospel church, 
 and influence upon it, his ruling it as the Head, and uniting it as the 
 Corner-stone, are the great tokens of his exhaltation. Thus, in spite 
 of the malice of the priests and elders, he <I>divided a portion with 
 the great,</I> and received <I>his kingdom,</I> though they would not 
 have him to reign over them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The hand of God was in all this; <I>This is the Lord's doing.</I> 
 Even the rejecting of him by the Jewish builders was by the determinate 
 counsel and foreknowledge of God; he permitted and overruled it; much 
 more was his advancement to the Head of the corner; his right hand and 
 his holy arm brought it about; it was God himself that <I>highly 
 exalted him,</I> and gave him <I>a name above every name; and it is 
 marvellous in our eyes.</I> The wickedness of the Jews that rejected 
 him is marvellous,; that men should be so prejudiced against their own 
 interest! See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:9,10,14">Isa. xxix. 9, 10, 14</A>.

 The honour done him by the Gentile world, notwithstanding the abuses
 done him by his own people, is marvellous; that he whom men despised 
 and abhorred, should be adored by kings! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:7">Isa. xlix. 7</A>.

 But <I>it is the Lord's doing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He applies it to them, and application is the life of preaching.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He applies the sentence which they had passed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 and turns it upon themselves; not the former part of it, concerning the 
 miserable destruction of the husbandmen (he could not bear to speak of 
 that), but the latter part, of <I>letting out the vineyard to 
 others;</I> because though it looked black upon the Jews, it spoke good 
 to the Gentiles. Know then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] That the Jews shall be unchurched; <I>The kingdom of God shall be 
 taken from you.</I> This turning out of the husbandmen speaks the same 
 doom with that of dismantling the vineyard, and laying it common. 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:5">Isa. v. 5</A>.

 To the Jews had long pertained <I>the adoption and the glory</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Rom. ix. 4</A>);

 to them were committed the <I>oracles of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:2">Rom. iii. 2</A>),

 and the sacred trust of revealed religion, and bearing up of God's name
 in the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:1,2">Ps. lxxvi. 1, 2</A>);

 but now it shall be so no longer. They were not only unfruitful in the
 use of their privileges, but, under pretence of them, opposed the 
 gospel of Christ, and so forfeited them, and it was not long ere the 
 forfeiture was taken. Note, It is a righteous thing with God to remove 
 church privileges from those that not only sin against them, but sin 
 with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:4,5">Rev. ii. 4, 5</A>.

 The kingdom of God was taken from the Jews, not only by the temporal 
 judgments that befel them, but by the spiritual judgments they lay 
 under, their blindness of mind, hardness of heart, and indignation at 
 the gospel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:8-10,1Th+2:15">Rom. xi. 8-10; 1 Thess. ii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] That the Gentiles shall be taken in. God needs not ask us leave 
 whether he shall have a church in the world; though his vine be plucked 
 up in one place, he will find another to plant it in. He will give it 
 <B><I>ethnei</I></B>--<I>to the Gentile world,</I> that will <I>bring
 forth the fruit of it.</I> They who had been not a people, and had not 
 obtained mercy, became favourites of Heaven. This is the mystery which 
 blessed Paul was so much affected with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:30,33">Rom. xi. 30, 33</A>),

 and which the Jews were so much affronted by, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:21,22">Acts xxii. 21, 22</A>.

 At the first planting of Israel in Canaan, the <I>fall of the Gentiles
 was the riches of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:10,11">Ps. cxxxv. 10, 11</A>),

 so, at their extirpation, the fall of Israel was the riches of the
 Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:12">Rom. xi. 12</A>.

 It shall go to <I>a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</I> Note,
 Christ knows beforehand who will bring forth gospel fruits in the use 
 of gospel means; because our fruitfulness is all the work of his own 
 hands, and <I>known unto God are all his works.</I> They shall bring 
 forth the fruits better than the Jews had done; God has had more glory 
 from the New Testament church than from that of the Old Testament; for, 
 when he changes, it shall not be to his loss.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He applies the scripture which he had quoted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>),
 
 to their terror, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 This <I>Stone,</I> which the <I>builders refused, is set for the fall 
 of many in Israel;</I> and we have here the doom of two sorts of 
 people, for whose fall it proves that Christ is set.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Some, through ignorance, stumble at Christ in his estate of 
 humiliation; when this Stone lies on the earth, where the builders 
 threw it, they, through their blindness and carelessness, fall on it, 
 fall over it, and <I>they shall be broken.</I> The offence they take at 
 Christ, will not hurt him, any more than he that stumbles, hurts the 
 stone he stumbles at; but it will hurt themselves; they will fall, and 
 be broken, and snared, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:14,1Pe+2:7,8">Isa. viii. 14; 1 Pet. ii. 7, 8</A>.

 The unbelief of sinners will be their ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Others, through malice, oppose Christ, and bid defiance to him in
 his estate of exaltation, when this Stone is advanced to the head of 
 the corner; and on them <I>it shall fall,</I> for they pull it on their 
 own heads, as the Jews did by that challenge, <I>His blood be upon us 
 and upon our children,</I> and <I>it will grind them to powder.</I> The 
 former seems to bespeak the sin and ruin of all unbelievers; this is 
 the greater sin, and sorer ruin, of persecutors, that <I>kick against 
 the pricks,</I> and persist in it. Christ's kingdom will be a 
 burthensome stone to all those that attempt to overthrow it, or heave 
 it out of its place; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:3">Zech. xii. 3</A>.

 This Stone cut out of the mountain without hands, will break in pieces
 all opposing power,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:34,35">Dan. ii. 34, 35</A>.

 Some make this an allusion to the manner of stoning to death among the
 Jews. The malefactors were first thrown down violently from a high
 scaffold upon a great stone, which would much bruise them; but then
 they threw another great stone upon them, which would crush them to
 pieces: one way or other, Christ will utterly destroy all those that
 fight against him. If they be so stout-hearted, that they are not
 destroyed by falling on this stone, yet it shall fall on them, and so
 destroy them. He will <I>strike through kings,</I> he will <I>fill the
 places with dead bodies,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:5,6">Ps. cx. 5, 6</A>.

 None ever hardened his heart against God and prospered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The entertainment which this discourse of Christ met 
 with among the chief priests and elders, that heard his parables.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>They perceived that he spake of them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:25"><I>v.</I> 45</A>),

 and that in what they said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>)

 they had but read their own doom. Note, A guilty conscience needs no
 accuser, and sometimes will save a minister the labour of saying, 
 <I>Thou art the man. Mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur--Change but 
 the name, the tale is told of the.</I> So quick and powerful is the 
 word of God, and such a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the 
 heart, that it is easy for bad men (if conscience be not quite seared) 
 to perceive that it speaks of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>They sought to lay hands on him.</I> Note, When those who hear 
 the reproofs of the word, perceive that it speaks of them, if it do not 
 do them a great deal of good, it will certainly do them a great deal of
 hurt. If they be not pricked to the heart with conviction and 
 contrition, as they were 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:37">Acts ii. 37</A>,

 they will be cut to the heart with rage and indignation, as they were

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:33">Acts v. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They durst not do it, <I>for fear of the multitude, who took him for 
 a prophet,</I> though not for the Messiah; this served to keep the 
 Pharisees in awe. The fear of the people restrained them from speaking
 ill of John 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and here from doing ill to Christ. Note, God has many ways of 
 restraining the remainders of wrath, as he has of making that which 
 breaks out redound to his praise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:10">Ps. lxxvi. 10</A>.</P>
