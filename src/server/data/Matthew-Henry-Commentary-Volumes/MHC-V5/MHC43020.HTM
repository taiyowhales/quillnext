 This evangelist, though he began not his gospel as the rest did, yet 
 concludes it as they did, with the history of Christ' resurrection; not 
 of the thing itself, for none of them describe how he rose, but of the 
 proofs and evidences of it, which demonstrated that he was risen. The 
 proofs of Christ's resurrection, which we have in this chapter, are 

 I. Such as occurred immediately at the sepulchre.

 1. The sepulchre found empty, and the graveclothes in good order, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 2. Two angels appearing to Mary Magdalene at the sepulchre, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>.

 3. Christ himself appearing to her,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:14-18">ver. 14-18</A>.

 II. Such as occurred afterwards at the meetings of the apostles. 

 1. At one, the same day at evening that Christ rose, when Thomas was 
 absent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:19-25">ver. 19-25</A>.

 2. At another, that day seven-night, when Thomas was with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:26-31">ver. 26-31</A>.

 What is related here is mostly what was omitted by the other 
 evangelists.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The first <I>day</I> of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when
 it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken
 away from the sepulchre.
 &nbsp; 2  Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other
 disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken
 away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they
 have laid him.
 &nbsp; 3  Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came
 to the sepulchre.
 &nbsp; 4  So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun
 Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
 &nbsp; 5  And he stooping down, <I>and looking in,</I> saw the linen clothes
 lying; yet went he not in.
 &nbsp; 6  Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the
 sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,
 &nbsp; 7  And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the
 linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
 &nbsp; 8  Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to
 the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
 &nbsp; 9  For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise
 again from the dead.
 &nbsp; 10  Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.

 There was no one thing of which the apostles were more concerned to
 produce substantial proof than the resurrection of their Master, 

 1. Because it was that which he himself appealed to as the last and
 most cogent proof of his being the Messiah. Those that would not 
 believe other signs were referred to this sign of the prophet Jonas. 
 And therefore enemies were most solicitous to stifle the notice of 
 this, because it was put on this issue, and, if he be risen, they are 
 not only murderers, but murderers of the Messiah. 

 2. Because it was upon this the performance of his undertaking for our
 redemption and salvation did depend. If he give his life a ransom, and 
 do not resume it, it does not appear that his giving it was accepted as 
 a satisfaction. If he be imprisoned for our debt, and lie by it, we are 
 undone,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:17">1 Cor. xv. 17</A>.

 3. Because he never showed himself alive after his resurrection to all 
 the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:40,41">Acts x. 40, 41</A>.

 We should have said, "Let his ignominious death be private, and his 
 glorious resurrection public." But God's thoughts are not as ours; and 
 he ordered it that his death should be public before the sun, by the 
 same token that the sun blushed and hid his face upon it. But the 
 demonstrations of his resurrection should be reserved as a favour for 
 his particular friends, and by them be published to the world, that 
 those might be blessed who have not seen, and yet have believed. The 
 method of proof is such as gives abundant satisfaction to those who are 
 piously disposed to receive the doctrine and law of Christ, and yet 
 leaves room for those to object who are willingly ignorant and 
 obstinate in their unbelief. And this is a fair trial, suited to the
 case of those who are probationers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:1-10">these verses</A>

 we have the first step towards the proof of Christ's resurrection,
 which is, that the sepulchre was found empty. <I>He is not here,</I> 
 and, if so, they must tell us where he is or we conclude him risen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Mary Magdalene, coming to the sepulchre, finds the <I>stone taken 
 away.</I> This evangelist does not mention the other women that went 
 with Mary Magdalene, but here only, because she was the most active and 
 forward in this visit to the sepulchre, and in her appeared the most 
 affection; and it was an affection kindled by a good cause, in 
 consideration of the great things Christ had done for her. Much was
 forgiven her, therefore she loved much. She had shown her affection to
 him while he lived, attended his doctrine, ministered to him of her
 substance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:2,3">Luke viii. 2, 3</A>.

 It does not appear that she had any business now at Jerusalem, but to
 wait upon him for the women were not bound to go up to the feast, and
 probably she and others followed him the closer, as Elisha did Elijah,
 now that they knew their Master would shortly be <I>taken from their
 head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:1-6">2 Kings ii. 1-6</A>.

 The continued instances of her respect to him at and after his death 
 prove the sincerity of her love. Note, Love to Christ, if it be 
 cordial, will be constant. Her love to Christ was <I>strong as 
 death,</I> the death of the cross, for it stood by that; <I>cruel as 
 the grave,</I> for it made a visit to that, and was not deterred by its 
 terrors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She <I>came to the sepulchre,</I> to wash the dead body with her 
 tears, for she <I>went to the grave, to weep there,</I> and to 
 <I>anoint it with the ointment</I> she had prepared. The grave is a 
 house that people do not care for making visits to. They that are
 <I>free among the dead</I> are <I>separated from the living;</I> and it 
 must be an extraordinary affection to the person which will endear his 
 grave to us. It is especially frightful to the weak and timourous sex. 
 Could she, that had not strength enough to <I>roll away the stone,</I> 
 pretend to such a presence of mind as to enter the grave? The Jews' 
 religion forbade them to meddle any more than needs must with graves 
 and dead bodies. In visiting Christ's sepulchre she exposed herself, 
 and perhaps the disciples, to the suspicion of a design to <I>steal him 
 away;</I> and what real service could she do him by it? But her love 
 answers these, and a thousand such objections. Note, 

 (1.) We must study to do honour to Christ in those things wherein yet 
 we cannot be profitable to him. 

 (2.) Love to Christ will take off the terror of death and the grave. If 
 we cannot come to Christ but through that darksome valley, even in 
 that, if we love him, we shall <I>fear no evil.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She came as soon as she could, for she came, 

 (1.) Upon the <I>first day of the week,</I> as soon as ever the sabbath 
 was gone, longing, not to <I>sell corn</I> and to <I>set forth 
 wheat</I> (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:5">Amos viii. 5</A>),

 but to be at the sepulchre. Those that love Christ will take the first 
 opportunity of testifying their respect to him. This was the first 
 Christian sabbath, and she begins it accordingly with enquiries after 
 Christ. She had spent the day before in commemorating the work of 
 creation, and therefore rested; but now she is upon search into the 
 work of redemption, and therefore makes a visit to Christ and him 
 crucified. 

 (2.) She came <I>early, while it was yet dark;</I> so early did she set 
 out. Note, Those who would seek Christ so as to find him must seek him 
 early; that is, 

 [1.] Seek him solicitously, with such a care as even breaks the sleep; 
 be up early for fear of missing him.

 [2.] Seek him industriously; we must deny ourselves and our own repose 
 in pursuit of Christ. 

 [3.] Seek him betimes, early in our days, early every day. <I>My voice
 shalt thou hear in the morning.</I> That day is in a fair way to be 
 well ended that is thus begun. Those that diligently enquire after 
 Christ <I>while it is yet dark</I> shall have such light given them 
 concerning him as shall shine <I>more and more.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. She found the stone taken away, which she had seen <I>rolled to the 
 door of the sepulchre.</I> Now this was, 

 (1.) A surprise to her, for she little expected it. Christ crucified is 
 the fountain of life. His grave is one of the wells of salvation; if we 
 come to it in faith; though to a carnal heart it be a spring shut up, 
 we shall find the stone rolled away (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:10">Gen. xxix. 10</A>)

 and free access to the comforts of it. Surprising comforts are the 
 frequent encouragements of early seekers. 

 (2.) It was the beginning of a glorious discovery; the Lord was risen, 
 though she did not at first apprehend it so. Note, 

 [1.] Those that are most constant in their adherence to Christ, and 
 most diligent in their enquiries after him, have commonly the first and 
 sweetest notices of the divine grace. Mary Magdalene, who followed 
 Christ to the last in his humiliation, met him with the first in his 
 exaltation. 

 [2.] God ordinarily reveals himself and his comforts to us by degrees; 
 to raise our expectations and quicken our enquiries.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Finding the stone taken away, she hastens back to Peter and John, 
 who probably lodged together at that end of the town, not far off, and 
 acquaints them with it: "<I>They have taken the Lord out of the 
 sepulchre,</I> envying him the honour of such a decent burying-place, 
 <I>and we know not where they have laid him,</I> nor where to find him, 
 that we may pay him the remainder of our last respects." Observe here, 
 
 1. What a notion Mary had of the thing as it now appeared; she found
 the stone gone, looked into the grave, and saw it empty. Now one would 
 expect that the first thought that offered itself would have been, 
 Surely the Lord is risen; for whenever he had told them that he should 
 be crucified, which she had now lately seen accomplished, he still 
 subjoined in the same breath that <I>the third day he should rise 
 again.</I> Could she feel the great earthquake that happened as she was 
 coming to the sepulchre, or getting ready to come, and now see the 
 grave empty, and yet have no thought of the resurrection enter into her 
 mind? what, no conjecture, no suspicion of it? So it seems by the odd 
 construction she puts upon the removing of the stone, which was very 
 far fetched. Note, When we come to reflect upon our own conduct in a 
 <I>cloudy and dark day,</I> we shall stand amazed at our dulness and 
 forgetfulness, that we could miss of such thoughts as afterwards appear 
 obvious, and how they could be so far out of the way when we had 
 occasion for them. She suggested, <I>They have taken away the Lord;</I> 
 either the chief priests have taken him away, to put him in a worse 
 place, or Joseph and Nicodemus have, upon second thoughts, taken him 
 away, to avoid the ill-will of the Jews. Whatever was her suspicion, it 
 seems it was a great vexation and disturbance to her that the body was 
 gone; whereas, if she had understood it rightly, nothing could be more 
 happy. Note, Weak believers often make that the matter of their 
 complaint which is really just ground of hope, and matter of joy. We 
 cry out that this and the other creature-comfort are taken away, and we 
 know not how to retrieve them, when indeed the removal of our temporal 
 comforts, which we lament, is in order to the resurrection of our 
 spiritual comforts, which we should rejoice in too. 

 2. What a narrative she made of it to Peter and John. She did not stand
 poring upon the grief herself, but acquaints her friends with it. Note, 
 The communication of sorrows is one good improvement of the communion 
 of saints. Observe, Peter, though he had denied his Master, had not 
 deserted his Master's friends; by this appears the sincerity of his 
 repentance, that he associated with the disciple whom Jesus loved. And 
 the disciples' keeping up their intimacy with him as formerly, 
 notwithstanding his fall, teaches us to restore those with a spirit of 
 meekness that have been faulty. If God has received them upon their 
 repentance, why should not we?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Peter and John go with all speed to the sepulchre, to satisfy 
 themselves of the truth of what was told them, and to see if they could 
 make any further discoveries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 Some think that the other disciples were with Peter and John when the 
 news came; for they <I>told these things to the eleven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:9">Luke xxiv. 9</A>.
 
 Others think that Mary Magdalene told her story only to Peter and John,
 and that the other women told theirs to the other disciples; yet none 
 of them went to the sepulchre but Peter and John, who were two of the 
 first three of Christ's disciples, often distinguished from the rest by 
 special favours. Note, It is well when those that are more honoured 
 than others with the privileges of disciples are more active than 
 others in the duty of disciples, more willing to take pains and run 
 hazards in a good work. 

 1. See here what use we should make of the experience and observations
 of others. When Mary told them what she had seen, they would not in 
 this sense take her word, but would go and see with their own eyes. Do 
 others tell us of the comfort and benefit of ordinances? Let us be
 engaged thereby to make trial of them. Come and see how good it is to 
 draw near to God. 

 2. See how ready we should be to share with our friends in their cares
 and fears. Peter and John hastened to the sepulchre, that they might be 
 able to give Mary a satisfactory answer to her jealousies. We should 
 not grudge any pains we take for the succouring and comforting of the 
 weak and timorous followers of Christ.

 3. See what haste we should make in a good work, and when we are going
 on a good errand. Peter and John consulted neither their ease nor their 
 gravity, but ran to the sepulchre, that they might show the strength of 
 their zeal and affection, and might lose no time. If we are in the way 
 of God's commandments, we should run in that way. 

 4. See what a good thing it is to have good company in a good work.
 Perhaps neither of these disciples would have ventured to the sepulchre 
 alone, but, being both together, they made no difficulty of it. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:9">Eccl. iv. 9</A>.

 5. See what a laudable emulation it is among disciples to strive which 
 shall excel, which shall exceed, in that which is good. It was no 
 breach of ill manners for John, though the younger, to outrun Peter, 
 and get before him. We must do our best, and neither envy those that 
 can do better, nor despise those that do as they can, though they come 
 behind.

 (1.) He that got foremost in this race as <I>the disciple whom Jesus 
 loved</I> in a special manner, and who therefore in a special manner 
 loved Jesus. Note, Sense of Christ's love to us, kindling love in us to 
 him again, will make us to excel in virtue. The love of Christ will 
 constrain us more than any thing to abound in duty. 

 (2.) He that was cast behind was Peter, who had denied his Master, and 
 was in sorrow and shame for it, and this clogged him as a weight; sense 
 of guilt cramps us, and hinders our enlargement in the service of God. 
 When conscience is offended we lose ground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Peter and John, having come to the sepulchre, prosecute the 
 enquiry, yet improve little in the discovery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. John went no further than Mary Magdalene had done. 

 (1.) He had the curiosity to look into the sepulchre, and saw it was 
 empty. He <I>stooped down,</I> and <I>looked in.</I> Those that would 
 find the knowledge of Christ must stoop down, and look in, must with a 
 humble heart submit to the authority of divine revelation, and must 
 <I>look wistly.</I> 

 (2.) Yet he had not courage to go into the sepulchre. The warmest 
 affections are not always accompanied with the boldest resolutions; 
 many are swift to run religion's race that are not stout to fight her 
 battles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Peter, though he came last, went in first, and made a more exact 
 discovery than John had done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 Though John outran him, he did not therefore turn back, nor stand 
 still, but made after him as fast as he could; and, while John was with 
 much caution looking in, he came, and with great courage <I>went into 
 the sepulchre.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Observe here the boldness of Peter, and how God dispenses his 
 gifts variously. John could out-run Peter, but Peter could out-dare 
 John. It is seldom true of the same persons, what David says poetically 
 of Saul and Jonathan, that they were <I>swifter than eagles,</I> and 
 yet <I>stronger than lions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:23">2 Sam. i. 23</A>.

 Some disciples are quick, and they are useful to quicken those that are
 slow; others are bold, and they are useful to embolden those that are 
 timorous; <I>diversity of gifts, but one Spirit.</I> Peter's venturing 
 into the sepulchre may teach us,

 [1.] That those who in good earnest seek after Christ must not frighten 
 themselves with bugbears and foolish fancies: "There is a lion in the 
 way, a ghost in the grave." 

 [2.] That good Christians need not be afraid of the grave, since Christ 
 has lain in it; for to them there is nothing in it frightful; it is not 
 the pit of destruction, nor are the worms in it never-dying worms. Let 
 us therefore not indulge, but conquer, the fear we are apt to conceive 
 upon the sight of a dead body, or being alone among the graves; and, 
 since we must be dead and in the grave shortly, let us make death and 
 the grave familiar to us, as our near kindred,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:14">Job xvii. 14</A>.

 [3.] We must be willing to go through the grave to Christ; that way he 
 went to his glory, and so must we. If we cannot see God's face and 
 live, better die than never see it. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:25">Job xix. 25</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Observe the posture in which he found things in the sepulchre. 
 
 [1.] Christ had left his grave-clothes behind him there; what clothes 
 he appeared in to his disciples we are not told, but he never appeared 
 in his grave-clothes, as ghosts are supposed to do; no, he laid them 
 aside, <I>First,</I> Because he arose to die no more; death was to have 
 no more dominion over him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:9">Rom. vi. 9</A>.

 Lazarus came out with his grave-clothes on, for he was to use them
 again; but Christ, rising to an immortal life, came out free from those 
 incumbrances. <I>Secondly,</I> because he was going to be clothed with
 the robes of glory, therefore he lays aside these rags; in the heavenly 
 paradise there will be no more occasion for clothes than there was in 
 the earthly. The ascending prophet dropped his mantle. <I>Thirdly,</I> 
 When we arise from the death of sin to the life of righteousness, we 
 must leave our grave-clothes behind us, must put off all our 
 corruptions. <I>Fourthly,</I> Christ left those in the grave, as it
 were, for our use if the grave be a bed to the saints, thus he hath 
 sheeted that bed, and made it ready for them; and the napkin by itself 
 is of use for the mourning survivors to <I>wipe away their tears.</I>

 [2.] The grave-clothes were found in very good order, which serves for 
 an evidence that his body was not stolen away while men slept. Robbers 
 of tombs have been known to take away the clothes and leave the body; 
 but none [prior to the practices of modern resurrectionists] ever took 
 away the body and left the clothes, especially when it was fine linen 
 and new,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+15:46">Mark xv. 46</A>.

 Any one would rather choose to carry a dead body in its clothes than 
 naked. Or, if those that were supposed to have stolen it would have 
 left the grave-clothes behind, yet it cannot be supposed they should 
 find leisure to fold up the linen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) See how Peter's boldness encouraged John; now he took heart and 
 ventured in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and <I>he saw and believed;</I> not barely believed what Mary said, 
 that the body was gone (no thanks to him to believe what <I>he 
 saw</I>), but he began to believe that Jesus was risen to life again, 
 though his faith, as yet, was weak and wavering.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] John followed Peter in venturing. It should seem, he durst not 
 have gone into the sepulchre if Peter had not gone in first. Note, It 
 is good to be emboldened in a good work by the boldness of others. The 
 dread of difficulty and danger will be taken off by observing the 
 resolution and courage of others. Perhaps John's quickness had made 
 Peter run faster, and now Peter's boldness makes John venture further, 
 than otherwise either the one or the other would have done; though 
 Peter had lately fallen under the disgrace of being a deserter, and 
 John had been advanced to the honour of a confidant (Christ having 
 committed his mother to him), yet John not only associated with Peter, 
 but thought it no disparagement to follow him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Yet, it should seem, John got the start of Peter in believing. 
 Peter saw and wondered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:12">Luke xxiv. 12</A>),

 but John saw and believed. A mind disposed to contemplation may perhaps 
 sooner receive the evidence of divine truth than a mind disposed to 
 action. But what was the reason that they were so slow of heart to
 believe? The evangelist tells us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 as yet they <I>knew not the scripture,</I> that is, they did not 
 consider, and apply, and duly improve, what they knew of the scripture, 
 that he must <I>rise again from the dead.</I> The Old Testament spoke 
 of the resurrection of the Messiah; they believed him to be the 
 Messiah; he himself had often told them that, according to the 
 scriptures of the Old Testament, he should rise again; but they had not 
 presence of mind sufficient by these to explain the present 
 appearances. Observe here, <I>First,</I> How unapt the disciples 
 themselves were, at first, to believe the resurrection of Christ, which 
 confirms the testimony they afterwards gave with so much assurance 
 concerning it; for, by their backwardness to believe it, it appears 
 that they were not credulous concerning it, nor of those simple ones 
 that believe every word. If they had had any design to advance their 
 own interest by it, they would greedily have caught at the first spark 
 of its evidence, would have raised and supported one another's 
 expectations of it, and have prepared the minds of those that followed 
 them to receive the notices of it; but we find, on the contrary, that 
 their hopes were frustrated, it was to them as a strange thing, and one 
 of the furthest things from their thoughts. Peter and John were so shy 
 of believing it at first that nothing less than the most convincing 
 proof the thing was capable of could bring them to testify it 
 afterwards with so much assurance. Hereby it appears that they were not 
 only honest men, who would not deceive others, but cautious men, who 
 would not themselves be imposed upon. <I>Secondly,</I> What was the 
 reason of their slowness to believe; because as yet they <I>knew not 
 the scripture.</I> This seems to be the evangelist's acknowledgment of 
 his own fault among the rest; he does not say, "For as yet Jesus had 
 not appeared to them, had not shown them his hands and his side," but, 
 "As yet he had not <I>opened their understandings to understand the 
 scripture</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:44,45">Luke xxiv. 44, 45</A>),

 for that is the <I>most sure word of prophecy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Peter and John pursued their enquiry no further, but desisted, 
 hovering between faith and unbelief 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The disciples went away,</I> not much the wiser, <I>to their own 
 home,</I> <B><I>pros heautous</I></B>--<I>to their own friends and 
 companions,</I> the rest of the disciples to their own lodgings, for 
 homes they had none at Jerusalem. They went away, 

 (1.) For fear of being taken up upon suspicion of a design to steal 
 away the body, or of being charged with it now that it was gone Instead 
 of improving their faith, their care is to secure themselves, to shift 
 for their own safety. In difficult dangerous times it is hard even for 
 good men to go on in their work with the resolution that becomes them. 
 
 (2.) Because they were at a loss, and knew not what to do next, nor 
 what to make of what they had seen; and therefore, not having courage 
 to stay at the grave, they resolve to go home, and wait till God shall 
 <I>reveal even this unto them,</I> which is an instance of their 
 weakness as yet. 

 (3.) It is probable that the rest of the disciples were together; to 
 them they return, to make report of what they had discovered and to 
 consult with them what was to be done; and, probably, now they 
 appointed their meeting in the evening, when Christ came to them. It is 
 observable that before Peter and John came to the sepulchre an angel 
 had appeared there, rolled away the stone, frightened the guard, and 
 comforted the women; as soon as they were gone from the sepulchre, Mary 
 Magdalene here sees two angels in the sepulchre 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and yet Peter and John come to the sepulchre, and go into it, and see 
 none. What shall we make of this? Where were the angels when Peter and 
 John were at the sepulchre, who appeared there before and after?

 [1.] Angels appear and disappear at pleasure, according to the orders 
 and instructions given them. They may be, and are really, where they 
 are not visibly; nay, it should seem, may be visible to one and not to 
 another, at the same time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:23,2Ki+6:17">Num. xxii. 23; 2 Kings vi. 17</A>.

 How they make themselves visible, then invisible, and then visible 
 again, it is presumption for us to enquire; but that they do so is 
 plain from this story. 

 [2.] This favour was shown to those who were early and constant in 
 their enquiries after Christ, and was the reward of those that came 
 first and staid last, but denied to those that made a transient visit. 
 
 [3.] The apostles were not to receive their instructions from the 
 angels, but from the Spirit of grace. See

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she
 wept, she stooped down, <I>and looked</I> into the sepulchre,
 &nbsp; 12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head,
 and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
 &nbsp; 13  And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith
 unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not
 where they have laid him.
 &nbsp; 14  And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw
 Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
 &nbsp; 15  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
 thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir,
 if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him,
 and I will take him away.
 &nbsp; 16  Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith
 unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.
 &nbsp; 17  Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet
 ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them,
 I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and <I>to</I> my God, and
 your God.
 &nbsp; 18  Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen
 the Lord, and <I>that</I> he had spoken these things unto her.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 St. Mark tells us that Christ appeared first to Mary Magdalene 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:9">Mark xvi. 9</A>);
 
 that appearance is here largely related; and we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The constancy and fervency of Mary Magdalene's affection to the Lord 
 Jesus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She staid at the sepulchre, when Peter and John were gone, because 
 there her Master had lain, and there she was likeliest to hear some 
 tidings of him. Note, 

 (1.) Where there is a true love to Christ there will be a constant 
 adherence to him, and a resolution with purpose of heart to cleave to 
 him. This good woman, though she has lost him, yet, rather than seem to 
 desert him, will abide by his grave for his sake, and continue in his 
 love even when she wants the comfort of it. 

 (2.) Where there is a true desire of acquaintance with Christ there 
 will be a constant attendance on the means of knowledge. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:2,3">Hos. vi. 2, 3</A>,

 <I>The third day he will raise us up;</I> and then shall we know the 
 meaning of that resurrection, if we follow on to know, as Mary 
 here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She staid there weeping, and these tears loudly bespoke her 
 affection to her Master. Those that have lost Christ have cause to 
 weep; she wept at the remembrance of his bitter sufferings; wept for 
 his death, and the loss which she and her friends and the country 
 sustained by it; wept to think of returning home without him; wept 
 because she did not now find his body. Those that seek Christ must 
 <I>seek him sorrowing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:48">Luke ii. 48</A>),

 must weep, not for him, but for themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>As she wept, she looked into the sepulchre,</I> that her eye 
 might affect her heart. When we are in search of something that we have 
 lost we look again and again in the place where we last left it, and 
 expected to have found it. She will look <I>yet seven times,</I> not 
 knowing but that at length she may see some encouragement. Note, 

 (1.) Weeping must not hinder seeking. Though she wept, she <I>stooped 
 down and looked in.</I> 

 (2.) Those are likely to seek and find that seek with affection, that 
 seek in tears.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The vision she had of two angels in the sepulchre, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The description of the persons she saw. They were <I>two angels in 
 white, sitting</I> (probably on some benches or ledges hewn out in the 
 rock) one at <I>the head,</I> and the other at the <I>feet,</I> of the 
 grave. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Their nature. They were angels, messengers from heaven, sent on 
 purpose, on this great occasion, 

 [1.] To honour the Son and to grace the solemnity of his resurrection. 
 Now that the Son of God was again to be brought into the world, the 
 angels have a charge to attend him, as they did at his birth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:6">Heb. i. 6</A>.

 [2.] To comfort the saints; to speak good words to those that were in 
 sorrow, and, by giving them notice that the Lord was risen, to prepare 
 them for the sight of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their number: <I>two,</I> not a <I>multitude of the heavenly 
 host,</I> to sing praise, only two, to bear witness; for out of the 
 mouth of two witnesses this word would be established.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Their array: They were <I>in white,</I> denoting, 

 [1.] Their purity and holiness. The best of men <I>standing before the 
 angels,</I> and compared with them, <I>are clothed in filthy 
 garments</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:3">Zech. iii. 3</A>),

 but angels are spotless; and glorified saints, when they come to be as 
 the angels, shall <I>walk with Christ in white.</I> 

 [2.] Their glory, and glorying, upon this occasion. The white in which 
 they appeared represented the brightness of that state into which 
 Christ was now risen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Their posture and place: They sat, as it were, reposing themselves 
 in Christ's grave; for angels, though they needed not a restoration, 
 were obliged to Christ for their establishment. These angels went into 
 the grave, to teach us not to be afraid of it, nor to think that our 
 resting in it awhile will be any prejudice to our immortality; no, 
 matters are so ordered that the grave is not much out of our way to 
 heaven. It intimates likewise that angels are to be employed about the
 saints, not only at their death, to carry their souls into Abraham's
 bosom, but at the great day, <I>to raise their bodies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:31">Matt. xxiv. 31</A>.
 
 These angelic guards (and angels are called <I>watchers</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:23">Dan. iv. 23</A>),
 
 keeping possession of the sepulchre, when they had frightened away the
 guards which the enemies had set, represents Christ's victory over the
 powers of darkness, routing and defeating them. Thus Michael and his
 angels are more than conquerors. Their sitting to face one another, one
 at his bed's head, the other at his bed's feet, denotes their care of
 the entire body of Christ, his mystical as well as his natural body,
 from head to foot; it may also remind us of the two cherubim, placed
 one at either end of the mercy-seat, looking one at another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+25:18">Exod. xxv. 18</A>.
 
 Christ crucified was the great propitiatory, at the head and feet of 
 which were these two cherubim, not with flaming swords, to keep us 
 from, but welcome messengers, to direct us to, the way of life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their compassionate enquiry into the cause of Mary Magdalene's grief 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Woman, why weepest thou?</I> This question was, 

 (1.) A rebuke to her weeping: "<I>Why weepest thou,</I> when thou has 
 cause to rejoice?" Many of the floods of our tears would <I>dry 
 away</I> before such a search as this into the fountain of them. <I>Why 
 are thou cast down?</I> 

 (2.) It was designed to show how much angels are concerned at the 
 griefs of the saints, having a charge to minister to them for their 
 comfort. Christians should thus sympathize with one another.

 (3.) It was only to make an occasion of informing her of that which 
 would turn her mourning into rejoicing, would <I>put off her sackcloth, 
 and gird her with gladness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The melancholy account she gives them of her present distress: 
 <I>Because they have taken away</I> the blessed body I came to embalm, 
 <I>and I know not where they have laid it.</I> The same story she had 
 told, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 In it we may see,

 (1.) The weakness of her faith. If she had had faith <I>as a grain of 
 mustard-seed,</I> this mountain would have been removed; but we often 
 perplex ourselves needlessly with imaginary difficulties, which faith 
 would discover to us as real advantages. Many good people complain of 
 the clouds and darkness they are under, which are the necessary methods 
 of grace for the humbling of their souls, the mortifying of their sins, 
 and the endearing of Christ to them. 

 (2.) The strength of her love. Those that have a true affection for
 Christ cannot but be in great affliction when they have lost either the 
 comfortable tokens of his love in their souls or the comfortable 
 opportunities of conversing with him, and doing him honour, in his 
 ordinances. Mary Magdalene is not diverted from her enquiries by the 
 surprise of the vision, nor satisfied with the honour of it; but still 
 she harps upon the same string: <I>They have taken away my Lord.</I> A 
 sight of angels and their smiles will not suffice without a sight of 
 Christ and God's smiles in him. Nay, the sight of angels is but an 
 opportunity of pursuing her enquiries after Christ. All creatures, the 
 most excellent, the most dear, should be used as means, and but as 
 means, to bring us into acquaintance with God in Christ. The angels 
 asked her, <I>Why weepest thou?</I> I have cause enough to weep, says 
 she, for <I>they have taken away my Lord,</I> and, like Micah, <I>What 
 have I more?</I> Do you ask, Why I weep? <I>My beloved has withdrawn 
 himself, and is gone.</I> Note, None know, but those who have 
 experienced it, the sorrow of a deserted soul, that has had comfortable 
 evidences of the love of God in Christ, and hopes of heaven, but has 
 now lost them, and walks in darkness; such a <I>wounded spirit who can 
 bear?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's appearing to her while she was talking with the angels, 
 and telling them her case. Before they had given her any answer, Christ 
 himself steps in, to satisfy her enquiries, for God now speaketh to us 
 by his Son; none but he himself can direct us to himself. Mary would 
 fain know where her Lord is, and behold he is at her right hand. Note, 
 
 1. Those that will be content with nothing short of a sight of Christ
 shall be put off with nothing less. He never said to the soul that 
 sought him, <I>Seek in vain.</I> "Is it Christ that thou wouldest have? 
 Christ thou shalt have." 

 2. Christ, in manifesting himself to those that seek him, often outdoes
 their expectations. Mary longs to see the dead body of Christ, and 
 complains of the loss of that, and behold she sees him alive. Thus he 
 does for his praying people more than they are able to ask or think. In 
 this appearance of Christ to Mary observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How he did at first conceal himself from her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He stood as a common person, and she looked upon him accordingly,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 She stood expecting an answer to her complaint from the angels; and 
 either seeing the shadow, or hearing the tread, of some person behind 
 her, she <I>turned herself back</I> from talking with the angels, and 
 <I>sees Jesus himself</I> standing, the very person she was looking 
 for, and yet she <I>knew not that it was Jesus.</I> Note, <I>First, The 
 Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:18">Ps. xxxiv. 18</A>),

 nearer than they are aware. Those that seek Christ, though they do not 
 see him, may yet be sure he is not far from them. <I>Secondly,</I>
 Those that diligently seek the Lord will turn every way in their 
 enquiry after him. <I>Mary turned herself back,</I> in hopes of some 
 discoveries. Several of the ancients suggest that Mary was directed to 
 look behind her by the angels' rising up, and doing their obeisance to 
 the Lord Jesus, whom they saw before Mary did; and that she looked back 
 to see to whom it was they paid such a profound reverence. But, if so, 
 it is not likely that she would have taken him for the gardener; 
 rather, therefore, it was her earnest desire in seeking that made her 
 turn every way. <I>Thirdly,</I> Christ is often near his people, and 
 they are not aware of him. She <I>knew not that it was Jesus;</I> not 
 that he appeared in any other likeness, but either it was a careless 
 transient look she cast upon him, and, her eyes being full of care, she 
 could not so well distinguish, or <I>they were holden, that she should 
 not know him,</I> as those of the two disciples,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:16">Luke xxiv. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He asked her a common question, and she answered him accordingly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The question he asked her was natural enough, and what 
 any one would have asked her: "<I>Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest 
 thou?</I> What business hast thou here in the garden so early? And what 
 is all this noise and ado for?" Perhaps it was spoken with some 
 roughness, as Joseph spoke to his brethren when he made himself 
 strange, before he made himself known to them. It should seem, this was 
 the first word Christ spoke after his resurrection: "<I>Why weepest 
 thou?</I> I am risen." The resurrection of Christ has enough in it to 
 ally all our sorrows, to check the streams, and dry up the fountains, 
 of our tears. Observe here, Christ takes cognizance, 

 1. Of his people's griefs, and enquires, <I>Why weep you?</I> He
 bottles their tears, and records them in his book. 

 2. Of his people's cares and enquires, <I>Whom seek you, and what would
 you have?</I> When he knows they are seeking him, yet he will know it 
 from them; they must tell him whom they seek.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The reply she made him is natural enough; she does not 
 give him a direct answer, but, as if she should say, "Why do you banter 
 me, and upbraid me with my tears? You know why I weep, and whom I 
 seek;" and therefore, <I>supposing him to be the gardener,</I> the 
 person employed by Joseph to dress and keep his garden, who, she 
 thought, was come thither thus early to his work, she said, <I>Sir, if 
 thou hast carried him hence,</I> pray <I>tell me where thou hast laid 
 him, and I will take him away.</I> See here, 

 1. The error of her understanding. She supposed our Lord Jesus to be
 the gardener, perhaps because he asked what authority she had to be 
 there. Note, Troubled spirits, in a cloudy and dark day, are apt to 
 misrepresent Christ to themselves, and to put wrong constructions upon 
 the methods of his providence and grace. 

 2. The truth of her affection. See how her heart was set upon finding
 Christ. She puts the question to every one she meets, like the careful 
 spouse, <I>Saw you him whom my soul loveth?</I> She speaks respectfully 
 to a gardener, and calls him <I>Sir,</I> in hopes to gain some 
 intelligence from him concerning her beloved. When she speaks of 
 Christ, she does not name him; but, <I>If thou have borne him 
 hence,</I> taking it for granted that this gardener was full of 
 thoughts concerning this Jesus as well as she, and therefore could not 
 but know whom she meant. Another evidence of the strength of her 
 affection was that, wherever he was laid, she would undertake to remove 
 him. Such a body, with such a weight of spices about it, was much more
 than she could pretend to carry; but true love thinks it can do more 
 than it can, and makes nothing of difficulties. She supposed this
 gardener grudged that the body of one that was ignominiously crucified 
 should have the honour to be laid in his master's new tomb, and that 
 therefore he had removed it to some sorry place, which he thought 
 fitter for it. Yet Mary does not threaten to tell his master, and get 
 him turned out of his place for it; but undertakes to find out some 
 other sepulchre, to which he might be welcome. Christ needs not to stay 
 where he is thought a burden.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How Christ at length made himself known to her, and, by a pleasing 
 surprise, gave her infallible assurances of his resurrection. Joseph at 
 length said to his brethren, <I>I am Joseph.</I> So Christ here to Mary 
 Magdalene, now that he is entered upon his exalted state. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] How Christ discovered himself to this good woman that was seeking 
 him in tears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Jesus saith unto her, Mary.</I> It was said with an emphasis, and 
 the air of kindness and freedom with which he was wont to speak to her. 
 Now he changed his voice, and spoke like himself, not like the 
 gardener. Christ's way of making himself known to his people is by his 
 word, his word applied to their souls, speaking to them in particular. 
 When those whom God <I>knew by name</I> in the counsels of his love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:12">Exod. xxxiii. 12</A>)

 <I>are called by name</I> in the efficacy of his grace, then <I>he 
 reveals his Son in them</I> as in Paul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:16">Gal. i. 16</A>),

 when Christ called to him by name, <I>Saul, Saul.</I> Christ's <I>sheep 
 know his voice,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:4"><I>ch.</I> x. 4</A>.

 This one word, <I>Mary,</I> was like that to the disciples in the 
 storm, <I>It is I.</I> Then the word of Christ does us good when we put 
 our names into the precepts and promises. "In this Christ calls to me, 
 and speaks to me."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] How readily she received this discovery. When Christ said, "Mary, 
 dost thou not know me? are you and I grown such strangers?" she was 
 presently aware who it was, as the spouse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:8">Cant. ii. 8</A>),

 <I>It is the voice of my beloved.</I> She turned herself, and said, 
 <I>Rabboni, My Master.</I> It might properly be read with an 
 interrogation, "<I>Rabboni? Is it my master?</I> Nay, but is it 
 indeed?" Observe, <I>First,</I> The title of respect she gives Him: 
 <I>My Master;</I> <B><I>didaskale</I></B>--<I>a teaching master.</I> 
 The Jews called their doctors <I>Rabbies,</I> great men. Their critics 
 tell us that <I>Rabbon</I> was with them a more honourable title than 
 <I>Rabbi;</I> and therefore Mary chooses that, and adds a note of 
 appropriation, <I>My great Master.</I> Note, Notwithstanding the 
 freedom of communion which Christ is pleased to admit us to with 
 himself, we must remember that he is our <I>Master,</I> and to be 
 approached with a <I>godly fear. Secondly,</I> With what liveliness of 
 affection she gives this title to Christ. <I>She turned</I> from the 
 angels, whom she had in her eye, to look unto Jesus. We must take off 
 our regards from all creatures, even the brightest and best, to fix 
 them upon Christ, from whom nothing must divert us, and with whom 
 nothing must interfere. When <I>she thought it had been the 
 gardener,</I> she looked another way while speaking to him; but now 
 that she knew the voice of Christ <I>she turned herself.</I> The soul 
 that hears Christ's voice, and is turned to him, calls him, with joy 
 and triumph, <I>My Master.</I> See with what pleasure those who love 
 Christ speak of his authority over them. <I>My Master, my great
 Master.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The further instructions that Christ gave her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Touch me not,</I> but go and carry the news to the disciples."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He diverts her from the expectation of familiar society 
 and conversation with him at this time: <I>Touch me not, for I am not 
 yet ascended.</I> Mary was so transported with the sight of her dear 
 Master that she forgot herself, and that state of glory into which he 
 was now entering, and was ready to express her joy by affectionate 
 embraces of him, which Christ here forbids at this time. 

 1. <I>Touch me not</I> thus at all, for I am to ascend to heaven. He
 bade the disciples touch him, for the confirmation of their faith; he 
 allowed the women to take hold of his feet, and worship him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:9">Matt. xxviii. 9</A>);

 but Mary, supposing that he was risen, as Lazarus was, to live among 
 them constantly, and converse with them freely as he had done, upon 
 that presumption was about to take hold of his hand with her usual 
 freedom. This mistake Christ rectified; she must believe him, and
 adore him, as exalted, but must not expect to be familiar with him as 
 formerly. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:16">2 Cor. v. 16</A>.

 He forbids her to dote upon his bodily presence, to set her heart on
 this, or expect its continuance, and leads her to the spiritual
 converse and communion which she should have with him after he was
 ascended to his Father; for the greatest joy of his resurrection was
 that it was a step towards his ascension. Mary thought, now that her
 Master was risen, he would presently set up a temporal kingdom, such as
 they had long promised themselves. "No," says Christ, "touch me not,
 with any such thought; think not to lay hold on me, so as to detain me
 here; for, though <I>I am not yet ascended, go to my brethren, and tell
 them, I am to ascend.</I>" As before his death, so now after his
 resurrection, he still harps upon this, that he was going away, was
 <I>no more in the world;</I> and therefore they must look higher than
 his bodily presence, and look further than the present state of things.
 
 2. "<I>Touch me not,</I> do not stay to touch me now, stay not now to 
 make any further enquiries, or give any further expressions of joy, for 
 <I>I am not yet ascended,</I> I shall not depart immediately, it may as 
 well be done another time; the best service thou canst do now is to 
 carry the tidings to the disciples; lose no time therefore, but go away 
 with all speed." Note, Public service ought to be preferred before 
 private satisfaction. <I>It is more blessed to give than to 
 receive.</I> Jacob must let an angel go, when the day breaks, and it is 
 time for him to look after his family. Mary must not stay to talk with
 her Master, but must carry his message; for it is a day of good 
 tidings, which she must not engross the comfort of, but hand it to 
 others. See that story, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:9">2 Kings vii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He directs her what message to carry to his disciples:
 <I>But go to my brethren, and tell them,</I> not only that I am risen
 (she could have told them that of herself, for she had seen him), but
 that <I>I ascend.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> To whom this message is sent: <I>Go to my brethren</I> with
 it; for he is not ashamed to call them so. 

 (1.) He was now entering upon his glory, and was <I>declared to be the 
 Son of God with</I> greater <I>power</I> than ever, yet he owns his 
 disciples as his brethren, and expresses himself with more tender 
 affection to them than before; he had called them friends, but never 
 brethren till now. Though Christ be high, yet he is not haughty. 
 Notwithstanding his elevation, he disdains not to own his poor 
 relations. 

 (<I>b.</I>) His disciples had lately carried themselves very 
 disingenuously towards him; he had never seen them together since 
 <I>they all forsook him and fled,</I> when he was apprehended; justly 
 might he now have sent them an angry message: "Go to yonder treacherous 
 deserters, and tell them, I will never trust them any more, or have any 
 thing more to do with them." No, he forgives, he forgets, and does not 
 upbraid.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> By whom it is sent: by <I>Mary Magdalene, out of whom had 
 been cast seven devils,</I> yet now thus favoured. This was her reward 
 for her constancy in adhering to Christ, and enquiring after him; and a 
 tacit rebuke to the apostles, who had not been so close as she was in 
 attending on the dying Jesus, nor so early as she was in meeting the 
 rising Jesus; she becomes an apostle to the apostles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>c.</I> What the message itself is: <I>I ascend to my Father.</I> Two 
 full breasts of consolation are here in these words:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) Our joint-relation to God, resulting from our union with 
 Christ, is an unspeakable comfort. Speaking of that inexhaustible 
 spring of light, life, and bliss, he says, He is <I>my Father, and our 
 Father; my God, and your God.</I> This is very expressive of the near 
 relation that subsists between Christ and believers: <I>he that
 sanctifieth, and those that are sanctified, are both one; for they
 agree in one,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:11">Heb. ii. 11</A>.

 Here we have such an advancement of Christians, and such a 
 condescension of Christ, as bring them very near together, so admirably 
 well is the matter contrived, in order to their union.

 [<I>a.</I>] It is the great dignity of believers that <I>the Father of
 our Lord Jesus Christ</I> is, in him, <I>their Father.</I> A vast 
 difference indeed there is between the respective foundations of the 
 relation; he is Christ's Father by eternal generation, ours by a 
 gracious adoption; yet even this warrants us to call him, as Christ 
 did, <I>Abba, Father.</I> This gives a reason why Christ called them 
 brethren, because his Father was their Father. Christ was now ascending 
 to appear as an <I>advocate with the Father</I>--with <I>his 
 Father,</I> and therefore we may hope he will prevail for any 
 thing--with <I>our Father,</I> and therefore we may hope he will 
 prevail for us. 

 [<I>b.</I>] It is the great condescension of Christ that he is pleased 
 to own the believer's God for his God: <I>My God, and your God;</I> 
 mine, that he may be yours; the God of the Redeemer, to support him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:26">Ps. lxxxix. 26</A>),

 that he might be the God of the redeemed, to save them. The summary of 
 the new covenant is that God <I>will be to us a God;</I> and therefore 
 Christ being the surety and head of the covenant, who is primarily 
 dealt with, and believers only through him as his spiritual seed, this 
 covenant-relation fastens first upon him, God becomes his God, and so 
 ours; we partaking of a divine nature, Christ's Father is our Father; 
 and, he partaking of the human nature, our God is his God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) Christ's ascension into heaven, in further prosecution of 
 his undertaking for us, is likewise an unspeakable comfort: "Tell them 
 I must shortly ascend; that is the next step I am to take." Now this 
 was intended to be, 

 [<I>a.</I>] A word of caution to these disciples, not to expect the 
 continuance of his bodily presence on earth, nor the setting up of his 
 temporal kingdom among men, which they dreamed of. "No, tell them, I
 am risen, not to stay with them, but to go on their errand to heaven." 
 Thus those who are raised to a spiritual life, in conformity to 
 Christ's resurrection, must reckon that they rise to ascend; <I>they 
 are quickened with Christ that they may sit with him in heavenly 
 places,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:5,6">Eph. ii. 5, 6</A>.

 Let them not think that this earth is to be their home and rest; no, 
 being born from heaven, they are bound for heaven; their eye and aim 
 must be upon another world, and this must be ever upon their hearts, I 
 ascend, therefore must I seek things above. 

 [<I>b.</I>] A word of comfort to them, and to all <I>that shall believe 
 in him through their word;</I> he was then ascending, he is now 
 <I>ascended to his Father, and our Father.</I> This was his 
 advancement; he ascended to receive those honours and powers which were 
 to be the recompence of his humiliation; he says it with triumph, that 
 those who love him may rejoice. This is our advantage; for he ascended 
 as a conqueror, <I>leading captivity captive</I> for us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:18">Ps. lxviii. 18</A>),

 he ascended as our forerunner, <I>to prepare a place for us,</I> and to 
 be ready to receive us. This message was like that which Joseph's 
 brethren brought to Jacob concerning him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+45:26">Gen. xlv. 26</A>),

 <I>Joseph is yet alive,</I> and not only so, <I>vivit imo, et in 
 senatum venit--he lives, and comes into the senate too; he is governor 
 over all the land of Egypt;</I> all power is his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some make those words, <I>I ascend to my God and your God,</I> to 
 include a promise of our resurrection, in the virtue of Christ's 
 resurrection; for Christ had proved the resurrection of the dead from
 these words, <I>I am the God of Abraham,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:32">Matt. xxii. 32</A>.

 So that Christ here insinuates, "As he is my God, and hath therefore 
 raised me, so he is your God, and will therefore raise you, and be your 
 God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:3">Rev. xxi. 3</A>.

 <I>Because I live, you shall live also.</I> I now ascend, to honour my
 God, and you shall ascend to him as your God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is Mary Magdalene's faithful report of what she had seen and 
 heard to the disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>She came and told the disciples,</I> whom she found together, 
 <I>that she had seen the Lord.</I> Peter and John had left her seeking 
 him carefully with tears, and would not stay to seek him with her; and 
 now she comes to tell them that she had found him, and to rectify the 
 mistake she had led them into by enquiring after the dead body, for now 
 she found it was a living body and a glorified one; so that she found 
 what she sought, and, what was infinitely better, she had joy in her 
 sight of the Master herself, and was willing to communicate of her joy, 
 for she knew it would be good news to them. When God comforts us, it is 
 with this design, that we may comfort others. And as she told them what 
 she had seen, so also what she had heard; she had seen the Lord alive, 
 of which this was a token (and a good token it was) <I>that he had 
 spoken these things unto her</I> as a message to be delivered to them, 
 and she delivered it faithfully. Those that are acquainted with the 
 word of Christ themselves should communicate their knowledge for the 
 good of others, and not grudge that others should know as much as they 
 do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Then the same day at evening, being the first <I>day</I> of the
 week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled
 for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and
 saith unto them, Peace <I>be</I> unto you.
 &nbsp; 20  And when he had so said, he showed unto them <I>his</I> hands and
 his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.
 &nbsp; 21  Then said Jesus to them again, Peace <I>be</I> unto you: as <I>my</I>
 Father hath sent me, even so send I you.
 &nbsp; 22  And when he had said this, he breathed on <I>them,</I> and saith
 unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
 &nbsp; 23  Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them;
 <I>and</I> whose soever <I>sins</I> ye retain, they are retained.
 &nbsp; 24  But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with
 them when Jesus came.
 &nbsp; 25  The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen
 the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands
 the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the
 nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The infallible proof of Christ's resurrection was his <I>showing 
 himself alive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:3">Acts i. 3</A>.

 In these verses, we have an account of his first appearance to the
 college of the disciples, on the day on which he rose. He had sent them 
 the tidings of his resurrection by trusty and credible messengers; but 
 to show his love to them, and confirm their faith in him, he came 
 himself, and gave them all the assurances they could desire of the 
 truth of it, that they might not have it by hearsay only, and at second 
 hand, but might themselves be eye-witnesses of his being alive, because 
 they must attest it to the world, and build the church upon that 
 testimony. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When and where this appearance was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 It was <I>the same day</I> that he rose, <I>being the first day of the 
 week,</I> the day after the Jewish sabbath, at a private meeting of the 
 disciples, ten of them, and some more of their friends with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:33">Luke xxiv. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There are three secondary ordinances (as I may call them) instituted by 
 our Lord Jesus, to continue in his church, for the support of it, and 
 for the due administration of the principal ordinances--the word, 
 sacraments, and prayer; these are, the Lord's day, solemn assemblies, 
 and standing ministry. The mind of Christ concerning each of these is
 plainly intimated to us in these verses; of the first two, here, in the
 circumstances of this appearance, the other 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Christ's kingdom was to be set up among men, immediately upon his 
 resurrection; and accordingly we find the very day he arose, though but 
 a day of small things, yet graced with those solemnities which should 
 help to keep up a face of religion throughout all the ages of the 
 church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is a Christian sabbath observed by the disciples, and owned by 
 our Lord Jesus. The visit Christ made to his disciples was on <I>the 
 first day of the week.</I> And the first day of the week is (I think) 
 the only day of the week, or month, or year, that is ever mentioned by 
 number in all the New Testament; and this is several times spoken of as 
 a day religiously observed. Though it was said here expressly
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)
 
 that Christ arose on <I>the first day of the week,</I> and it might 
 have been sufficient to say here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 he appeared the same day at evening; yet, to put an honour upon the 
 day, it is repeated, <I>being the first day of the week;</I> not that 
 the apostles designed to put honour upon the day (they were yet in 
 doubt concerning the occasion of it), but God designed to put honour 
 upon it, by ordering it that they should be altogether, to receive 
 Christ's first visit on that day. Thus, in effect, he blessed and
 sanctified that day, because in it the Redeemer rested.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is a Christian assembly solemnized by the disciples, and also 
 owned by the Lord Jesus. Probably the disciples met here for some 
 religious exercise, to pray together; or, perhaps, they met to compare 
 notes, and consider whether they had sufficient evidence of their 
 Master's resurrection, and to consult what was now to be done, whether 
 they should keep together or scatter; they met to know one another's 
 minds, strengthen one another's hands, and concert proper measures to 
 be taken in the present critical juncture. This meeting was private, 
 because they durst not appear publicly, especially in a body. They met
 in a house, but they kept the door shut, that they might not be seen
 together, and that no one might come among them but such as they knew;
 for they feared the Jews, who would prosecute the disciples as
 criminals, that they might seem to believe the lie they would deceive
 the world with, that his <I>disciples came by night, and stole him
 away.</I> Note, 

 (1.) The disciples of Christ, even in difficult times, must not 
 <I>forsake the assembling of themselves together,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:25">Heb. x. 25</A>.

 Those <I>sheep of the flock were scattered</I> in the storm; but sheep 
 are sociable, and will come together again. It is no new thing for the 
 assemblies of Christ's disciples to be driven into corners, and forced 
 into the wilderness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:14,Pr+28:12">Rev. xii. 14; Prov. xxviii. 12</A>.

 (2.) God's people have been often obliged to <I>enter into their
 chambers, and shut their doors,</I> as here, <I>for fear of the 
 Jews.</I> Persecution is allotted them, and retirement from persecution 
 is allowed them; and then where shall we look for them but in <I>dens 
 and caves of the earth.</I> It is a real grief, but no real reproach, 
 to Christ's disciples, thus to abscond.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What was said and done in this visit Christ made to his disciples, 
 and his interview between them. When they were assembled, Jesus came 
 among them, in his own likeness, yet drawing a veil over the brightness 
 of his body, now begun to be glorified, else it would have dazzled 
 their eyes, as in his transfiguration. Christ came among them, to give 
 them a specimen of the performance of his promise, that, <I>where two 
 or three are gathered together in his name, he will be in the midst of 
 them.</I> He came, though <I>the doors were shut.</I> This does not at 
 all weaken the evidence of his having a real human body after his 
 resurrection; though the doors were shut, he knew how to open them 
 without any noise, and come in so that they might not hear him, as 
 formerly he had walked on the water, and yet had a true body. It is a 
 comfort to Christ's disciples, when their solemn assemblies are reduced 
 to privacy, that no doors can shut out Christ's presence from them. We 
 have five things in this appearance of Christ:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) His kind and familiar salutation of his disciples: <I>He said, 
 Peace be unto you.</I> This was not a word of course, though commonly 
 used so at the meeting of friends, but a solemn, uncommon benediction, 
 conferring upon them all the blessed fruits and effects of his death 
 and resurrection. The phrase was common, but the sense was now 
 peculiar. <I>Peace be unto you</I> is as much as, All good be to you, 
 all peace always by all means. Christ had left them his peace for their
 legacy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:27"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 27</A>.

 By the death of the testator the testament was become of force, and he 
 was now risen from the dead, to prove the will, and to be himself the 
 executor of it. Accordingly, he here makes prompt payment of the 
 legacy: <I>Peace be unto you.</I> His speaking peace makes peace, 
 <I>creates the fruit of the lips, peace;</I> peace with God, peace in 
 your own consciences, peace with one another; all this peace be with 
 you; not peace with the world, but peace in Christ. His sudden 
 appearing in <I>the midst of them</I> when they were full of doubts 
 concerning him, full of fears concerning themselves, could not but put 
 them into some disorder and consternation, the noise of which waves he 
 stills with this word, <I>Peace be unto you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His clear and undeniable manifestation of himself to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 And here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The method he took to convince them of the truth of his 
 resurrection, They now saw him alive whom multitudes had seen dead two 
 or three days before. Now the only doubt was whether this that they saw 
 alive was the same individual body that had been seen dead; and none 
 could desire a further proof that it was so than the scars or marks of 
 the wounds in the body. Now, <I>First,</I> The marks of the wounds, and 
 very deep marks (though without any pain or soreness), remained in the 
 body of the Lord Jesus even after his resurrection, that they might be 
 demonstrations of the truth of it. Conquerors glory in the marks of 
 their wounds. Christ's wounds were to speak on earth that it was he
 himself, and therefore he arose with them; they were to speak in
 heaven, in the intercession he must ever live to make, and therefore he
 ascended with them, and appeared in the midst of <I>the throne, a Lamb
 as it had been slain, and bleeding afresh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:6">Rev. v. 6</A>.

 Nay, it should seem, he will come again with his scars, that <I>they 
 may look on him whom they pierced. Secondly,</I> These marks he showed 
 to his disciples, for their conviction. They had not only the 
 satisfaction of seeing him look with the same countenance, and hearing 
 him speak with the same voice they had been so long accustomed to, 
 <I>Sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora, ferebat--Such were his 
 gestures, such his eyes and hands!</I> but they had the further 
 evidence of these peculiar marks: he opened his hands to them, that 
 they might see the marks of the wounds on them; he opened his breast, 
 as the nurse hers to the child, to show them the wound there. Note, The 
 exalted Redeemer will ever show himself open-handed and open-hearted to 
 all his faithful friends and followers. When Christ manifests his love 
 to believers by the comforts of his Spirit, assures them that 
 <I>because he lives they shall live also,</I> then <I>he shows them his 
 hands and his side.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The impression it made upon them, and the good it did them. 
 <I>First,</I> They were convinced that they saw the Lord: so was their 
 faith confirmed. At first, they thought they saw an apparition only, a 
 phantasm; but now they knew it was the Lord himself. Thus many true 
 believers, who, while they were weak, feared their comforts were but 
 imaginary, afterwards find them, through grace, real and substantial. 
 They ask not, Is it the Lord? but are assured, it is he. <I>Secondly, 
 Then they were glad;</I> that which strengthened their faith raised 
 their joy; <I>believing they rejoice.</I> The evangelist seems to write 
 it with somewhat of transport and triumph. <I>Then! then! were the 
 disciples glad, when they saw the Lord,</I> If it <I>revived the spirit 
 of Jacob</I> to hear that <I>Joseph was yet alive,</I> how would it 
 revive the heart of these disciples to hear that Jesus is again alive? 
 It is life from the dead to them. Now that word of Christ was fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:22"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 22</A>),

 <I>I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice.</I> This wiped
 away all tears from their eyes. Note, A sight of Christ will gladden 
 the heart of a disciple at any time; the more we see of Christ, the 
 more we shall rejoice in him; and our joy will never be perfect till we 
 come <I>where we shall see him as he is.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The honourable and ample commission he gave them to be his agents 
 in the planting of his church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The preface to their commission, which was the solemn repetition 
 of the salutation before: <I>Peace be unto you.</I> This was intended, 
 either, <I>First,</I> To raise their attention to the commission he was 
 about to give them. The former salutation was to still the tumult of 
 their fear, that they might calmly attend to the proofs of his 
 resurrection; this was to reduce the transport of their joy, that they
 might sedately hear what he had further to say to them; or,
 <I>Secondly,</I> To encourage them to accept of the commission he was
 giving them. Though it would involve them in a great deal of trouble,
 yet he designed their honour and comfort in it, and, in the issue, it
 would be peace to them. Gideon received his commission with this word,
 <I>Peace be unto thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:22,23">Judg. vi. 22, 23</A>.

 Christ is our Peace; if he is with us, peace is to us. Christ was now 
 sending the disciples to publish peace to the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:7">Isa. lii. 7</A>),

 and he here not only confers it upon them for their own satisfaction, 
 but commits it to them as a trust to be by them transmitted to all the 
 sons of peace,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:5,6">Luke x. 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The commission itself, which sounds very great: <I>As my Father 
 hath sent me, even so send I you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> It is easy to understand how Christ sent them; he 
 appointed them to go on with his work upon earth, and to lay out 
 themselves for the spreading of his gospel, and the setting up of his 
 kingdom, among men.  He sent them authorized with a divine warrant, 
 armed with a divine power,--sent them as ambassadors to treat of peace, 
 and as heralds to proclaim it,--sent them as servants to bid to the 
 marriage. Hence they were called <I>apostles</I>--<I>men sent.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> But how Christ sent them as the Father sent him is not
 so easily understood; certainly their commissions and powers were 
 infinitely inferior to his; but,

 1. Their work was of the same kind with his, and they were to go on
 where he left off. They were not sent to be priests and kings, like
 him, but only prophets. As he was sent to bear witness to the truth, so 
 were they; not to be mediators of the reconciliation, but only 
 preachers and publishers of it. Was he sent, <I>not to be ministered 
 to, but to minister? not to do his own will, but the will of him that 
 sent him? not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fill them 
 up?</I> So were they. As the Father sent him <I>to the lost sheep of 
 the house of Israel,</I> so he sent them into all the world. 

 2. He had a power to send them equal to that which the Father had to
 send him. Here the force of the comparison seems to lie. By the same
 authority that the Father sent me do I send you. This proves the 
 Godhead of Christ; the commissions he gave were of equal authority with 
 those which the Father gave, and as valid and effectual to all intents 
 and purposes, equal with those he gave to the Old-Testament prophets in 
 visions. The commissions of Peter and John, by the plain word of 
 Christ, are as good as those of Isaiah and Ezekiel, by <I>the Lord 
 sitting on his throne;</I> nay, equal with that which was given to the 
 Mediator himself for his work. Had he an incontestable authority, and 
 an irresistible ability, for his work? so had they for theirs. Or
 thus, <I>As the Father hath sent me</I> is, as it were, the recital of 
 his power; by virtue of the authority given him as a Mediator, he gave 
 authority to them, as his ministers, to act for him, and in his name, 
 with the children of men; so that those who received them, or rejected 
 them, received or rejected him, and him that sent him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:20"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The qualifying of them for the discharge of the trust reposed in 
 them by their commission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>He breathed on them, and said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost.</I> 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The sign he used to assure them of, and affect them with, the gift 
 he was now about to bestow upon them: <I>He breathed on them;</I> not 
 only to show them, by this breath of life, that he himself was really 
 alive, but to signify to them the spiritual life and power which they 
 should receive from him for all the services that lay before them. 
 Probably he breathed upon them all together, not upon each severally 
 and, though Thomas was not with them, yet the Spirit of the Lord knew 
 where to find him, as he did Eldad and Medad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:26">Num. xi. 26</A>.

 Christ here seems to refer to the creation of man at first, by the 
 breathing of the breath of life into him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:7">Gen. ii. 7</A>),

 and to intimate that he himself was the author of that work, and that
 the spiritual life and strength of ministers and Christians are derived 
 from him, and depend upon him, as much as the natural life of Adam and 
 his seed. As <I>the breath of the Almighty</I> gave life to man and 
 began the old world, so the breath of the mighty Saviour gave life to 
 his ministers, and began a new world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:4">Job xxxiii. 4</A>.

 Now this intimates to us, <I>First,</I> That the Spirit is the breath
 of Christ, <I>proceeding from the Son.</I> The Spirit, in the Old 
 Testament, is compared to breath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:9">Ezek. xxxvii. 9</A>),

 <I>Come, O breath;</I> but the New Testament tells us it is Christ's 
 breath. <I>The breath of God</I> is put for the power of his wrath
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:4,30:33">Isa. xi. 4; xxx. 33</A>);

 but the breath of Christ signifies the power of his grace; the 
 breathing of threatenings is changed into the breathings of love by the 
 mediation of Christ. Our words are uttered by our breath, so the word 
 of Christ <I>is spirit and life.</I> The word comes from the Spirit, 
 and the Spirit comes along with the word. <I>Secondly,</I> That the 
 Spirit is the gift of Christ. The apostles communicated the Holy Ghost
 by the laying on of hands, those hands being first lifted up in prayer, 
 for they could only beg this blessing, and carry it as messengers; but 
 Christ conferred the Holy Ghost by breathing, for he is the author of 
 the gift, and from him it comes originally. Moses could not give his 
 Spirit, God did it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:17">Num. xi. 17</A>);
 
 but Christ did it himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The solemn grant he made, signified by this sign, <I>Receive ye 
 the Holy Ghost,</I> in part now, as an earnest of what you shall 
 further receive <I>not many days hence.</I>" They now received more of 
 the Holy Ghost than they had yet received. Thus spiritual blessings
 are given gradually; to him that has shall be given. Now that Jesus 
 began to be glorified more of the Spirit began to be given: see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:39"><I>ch.</I> vii. 39</A>.

 Let us see what is contained in this grant. <I>First,</I> Christ hereby
 gives them assurance of the Spirit's aid in their future work, in the 
 execution of the commission now given them: "<I>I send you,</I> and you 
 shall have the Spirit to go along with you." Now the <I>Spirit of the 
 Lord rested upon them</I> to qualify them for all the services that lay 
 before them. Whom Christ employs he will clothe with his Spirit, and 
 furnish with all needful powers. <I>Secondly,</I> He hereby gives them 
 experience of the Spirit's influences in their present case. He had
 shown them his hands and his side, to convince them of the truth of his 
 resurrection; but the plainest evidences will not of themselves work 
 faith, witness the infidelity of the soldiers, who were the only 
 eye-witnesses of the resurrection. "Therefore <I>receive ye the Holy 
 Ghost,</I> to work faith in you, and to open your understandings." They 
 were now in danger of the Jews: "Therefore receive ye the Holy Ghost, 
 to work courage in you." What Christ said to them he says to all true 
 believers, <I>Receive ye the Holy Ghost,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:13">Eph. i. 13</A>.

 What Christ gives we must receive, must submit ourselves and our whole 
 souls to the quickening, sanctifying, influences of the blessed 
 Spirit-receive his motions, and comply with them--receive his powers 
 and make use of them: and those who thus obey this word as a precept 
 shall have the benefit of it as a promise; they shall receive the Holy 
 Ghost as the guide of their way and the earnest of their 
 inheritance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) One particular branch of the power given them by their commission 
 particularized 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 "<I>Whosesoever sins you remit,</I> in the due execution of the powers 
 you are entrusted with, they are remitted to them, and they may take 
 the comfort of it; <I>and whosesoever sins you retain,</I> that is, 
 pronounce unpardoned and the guilt of them bound on, <I>they are 
 retained,</I> and the sinner may be sure of it, to his sorrow." Now 
 this follows upon their receiving the Holy Ghost; for, if they had not 
 had an extraordinary spirit of discerning, they had not been fit to be 
 entrusted with such an authority; for, in the strictest sense, this is 
 a special commission to the apostles themselves and the first preachers 
 of the gospel, who could distinguish who were in the <I>gall of 
 bitterness and bond of iniquity,</I> and who were not. By virtue of 
 this power, Peter struck Ananias and Sapphira dead, and Paul struck 
 Elymas blind. Yet it must be understood as a general charter to the 
 church and her ministers, not securing an infallibility of judgment to 
 any man or company of men in the world, but encouraging the faithful 
 stewards of the mysteries of God to stand to the gospel they were sent 
 to preach, for that God himself will stand to it. The apostles, in 
 preaching remission, must begin at Jerusalem, though she had lately 
 brought upon herself the guilt of Christ's blood: "Yet you may declare 
 their sins remitted upon gospel terms." And Peter did so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:38,3:19">Acts ii. 38; iii. 19</A>.

 Christ, being risen for our justification, sends his gospel heralds to 
 proclaim the jubilee begun, the act of indemnity now passed; and by 
 this rule men shall be judged,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:48,Ro+2:16,Jam+2:12"><I>ch.</I> xii. 48; 
 Rom. ii. 16; Jam. ii. 12</A>.

 God will never alter this rule of judgment, nor vary from it; those
 whom the gospel acquits shall be acquitted, and those whom the gospel 
 condemns shall be condemned, which puts immense honour upon the 
 ministry, and should put immense courage into ministers. Two ways the 
 apostles and ministers of Christ remit and retain sin, and both as 
 having authority:--

 [1.] By sound doctrine. They are commissioned to tell the world that 
 salvation is to be had upon gospel terms, and no other, and they shall 
 find God will say <I>Amen</I> to it; so shall their doom be. 

 [2.] By a strict discipline, applying the general rule of the gospel to 
 particular persons. "Whom you admit into communion with you, according 
 to the rules of the gospel, God will admit into communion with himself; 
 and whom you cast out of communion as impenitent, and obstinate in 
 scandalous and infectious sins, shall be bound over to the righteous 
 judgment of God."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The incredulity of Thomas, when the report of this was made to 
 him, which introduced Christ's second appearance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is Thomas's absence from this meeting, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He is said to be <I>one of the twelve,</I> one of the college of the
 apostles, who, though now eleven, had been twelve, and were to be so 
 again. They were but eleven, and one of them was missing: Christ's 
 disciples will never be all together till the general assembly at the 
 great day. Perhaps it was Thomas's unhappiness that he was 
 absent--either he was not well, or had not notice; or perhaps it was 
 his sin and folly--either he was diverted by business or company, which 
 he preferred before this opportunity, or he durst not come for <I>fear 
 of the Jews;</I> and he called that his prudence and caution which was 
 his cowardice. However, by his absence he missed the satisfaction of 
 seeing his Master risen, and of sharing with the disciples in their joy 
 upon that occasion. Note, Those know not what they lose who carelessly
 absent themselves from the stated solemn assemblies of Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The account which the other disciples gave him of the visit their 
 Master had made them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 The next time they saw him they <I>said unto him,</I> with joy enough, 
 <I>We have seen the Lord;</I> and no doubt they related to him all that 
 had passed, particularly the satisfaction he had given them by showing 
 them his hands and his side. It seems, though Thomas was then from
 them, he was not long from them; absentees for a time must not be 
 condemned as apostates for ever: Thomas is not Judas. Observe with what 
 exultation and triumph they speak it: "<I>We have seen the Lord,</I> 
 the most comfortable sight we ever saw." This they said to Thomas,

 (1.) To upbraid him with his absence: "<I>We have seen the Lord,</I> 
 but thou hast not." Or rather, 

 (2.) To inform him: "<I>We have seen the Lord,</I> and we wish thou 
 hadst been here, to see him too, for thou wouldest have seen enough to 
 satisfy thee." Note, The disciples of Christ should endeavour to 
 <I>build up one another in their most holy faith,</I> both by repeating 
 what they have heard to those that were absent, that they may hear it 
 at second hand, and also by communicating what they have experienced.
 Those that by faith have seen the Lord, and tasted that he is gracious, 
 should tell others what God has done for their souls; only let boasting 
 be excluded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The objections Thomas raised against the evidence, to justify 
 himself in his unwillingness to admit it. "Tell me not that you have 
 seen the Lord alive; you are too credulous; somebody has made fools of 
 you. For my part, <I>except I shall</I> not only <I>see in his hands 
 the print of the nails,</I> but put my finger into it, <I>and thrust my 
 hand</I> into the wound <I>in his side,</I> I am resolved <I>I will not 
 believe.</I>" Some, by comparing this with what he said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:16,14:5"><I>ch.</I> xi. 16; xiv. 5</A>),

 conjecture him to have been a man of a rough, morose temper, apt to
 speak peevishly; for all good people are not alike happy in their
 temper. However, there was certainly much amiss in his conduct at this
 time. 

 (1.) He had either not heeded, or not duly regarded, what Christ had so
 often said, and that too according to the Old Testament, that he would
 <I>rise again the third day;</I> so that he ought to have said, <I>He
 is risen,</I> though he had not seen him, nor spoken with any that had.
 
 (2.) He did not pay a just deference to the testimony of his
 fellow-disciples, who were men of wisdom and integrity, and ought to 
 have been credited. He knew them to be honest men; they all ten of them 
 concurred in the testimony with great assurance; and yet he could not 
 persuade himself to say that <I>their record was true.</I> Christ had 
 chosen them to be his witnesses of this very thing to all nations; and 
 yet Thomas, one of their own fraternity, would not allow them to be 
 competent witnesses, nor trust them further than he could see them. It 
 was not, however, their veracity that he questioned, but their 
 prudence; he feared they were too credulous. 

 (3.) He tempted Christ, and <I>limited the Holy One of Israel,</I> when 
 he would be convinced by his own method, or not at all. He could not be 
 sure that the print of the nails, which the apostles told him they had 
 seen, would admit the putting of his finger into it, or the wound in 
 his side the thrusting in of his hand; nor was it fit to deal so 
 roughly with a living body; yet Thomas ties up his faith to this 
 evidence. Either he will be humoured, and have his fancy gratified, or 
 he will not believe; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:1,27:42">Matt. xvi. 1; xxvii. 42</A>.

 (4.) The open avowal of this in the presence of the disciples was an 
 offence and discouragement to them. It was not only a sin, but a 
 scandal. As one coward makes many, so does one believer, one sceptic, 
 <I>making his brethren's heart to faint like his heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:8">Deut. xx. 8</A>.

 Had he only thought this evil, and then laid his hand upon his mouth,
 to suppress it, his error had remained with himself; but his 
 proclaiming his infidelity, and that so peremptorily, might be of ill 
 consequence to the rest, who were as yet but weak and wavering.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26  And after eight days again his disciples were within, and
 Thomas with them: <I>then</I> came Jesus, the doors being shut, and
 stood in the midst, and said, Peace <I>be</I> unto you.
 &nbsp; 27  Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold
 my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust <I>it</I> into my
 side: and be not faithless, but believing.
 &nbsp; 28  And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
 &nbsp; 29  Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me,
 thou hast believed: blessed <I>are</I> they that have not seen, and
 <I>yet</I> have believed.
 &nbsp; 30  And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
 disciples, which are not written in this book:
 &nbsp; 31  But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is
 the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life
 through his name.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of another appearance of Christ to his 
 disciples, after his resurrection, when Thomas was now with them. And 
 concerning this we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When it was that Christ repeated his visit to his disciples: 
 <I>After eight days,</I> that day seven-night after he rose, which must 
 therefore be, as that was, <I>the first day of the week.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He deferred his next appearance for some time, to show his disciples 
 that he was not risen to such a life as he had formerly lived, to 
 converse constantly with them but was as one that belonged to another 
 world, and visited this only as angels do, now and then, when there was 
 occasion. Where Christ was during these eight days, and the rest of the 
 time of his abode on earth, it is folly to enquire, and presumption to 
 determine. Wherever he was, no doubt <I>angels ministered unto him.</I> 
 In the beginning of his ministry he had been forty days unseen, tempted 
 by the evil spirit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:1,2">Matt. iv. 1, 2</A>.

 And now in the beginning of his glory he was forty days, for the most
 part unseen, attended by good spirits.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He deferred it so long as seven days. And why so? 

 (1.) That he might put a rebuke upon Thomas for his incredulity. He had 
 neglected the former meeting of the disciples; and, to teach him to 
 prize those seasons of grace better for the future, he cannot have such 
 another opportunity for several days. He that slips one tide must stay 
 a good while for another. A very melancholy week, we have reason to 
 think Thomas had of it, drooping, and in suspense, while the other 
 disciples were full of joy; and it was owing to himself and his own 
 folly. 

 (2.) That he might try the faith and patience of the rest of the 
 disciples. They had gained a great point when they were satisfied that
 they had seen the Lord. <I>Then were the disciples glad;</I> but he 
 would try whether they could keep the ground they had got, when they 
 saw no more of him for some days. And thus he would gradually wean them 
 from his bodily presence, which they had doted and depended too much 
 upon. 

 (3.) That he might put an honour upon the first day of the week, and 
 give a plain intimation of his will, that it should be observed in his 
 church as the Christian sabbath, the weekly day of holy rest and holy 
 convocations. That one day in seven should be religiously observed was 
 an appointment from the beginning, as old as innocency; and that in the 
 kingdom of the Messiah the first day of the week should be that solemn 
 day this was indication enough, that Christ on that day once and again 
 met his disciples in a religious assembly. It is highly probable that 
 in his former appearance to them he appointed them that day seven-night 
 to be together again, and promised to meet them; and also that he 
 appeared to them every first day of the week, besides other times, 
 during the forty days. The religious observance of that day has been 
 thence transmitted down to us through every age of the church. This
 therefore is <I>the day which the Lord has made.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Where, and how, Christ made them this visit. It was at Jerusalem, 
 for the doors were shut now, as before, for fear of the Jews. There 
 they staid, to keep the feast of unleavened bread seven days, which 
 expired the day before this; yet they would not set out on their 
 journey to Galilee on the first day of the week, because it was the 
 Christian sabbath, but staid till the day after. Now observe, 

 1. That Thomas was with them; though he had withdrawn himself once, yet 
 not a second time. When we have lost one opportunity, we should give 
 the more earnest heed to lay hold on the next, that we may recover our 
 losses. It is a good sign if such a loss whet our desires, and a bad
 sign if it cool them. The disciples admitted him among them, and did 
 not insist upon his believing the resurrection of Christ, as they did, 
 because as yet it was but darkly revealed; they did not receive him to 
 doubtful disputation, but bade him welcome to come and see. But 
 observe, Christ did not appear to Thomas, for his satisfaction, till he 
 found him in society with the rest of his disciples, because he would 
 countenance the meetings of Christians and ministers, for there will he 
 be <I>in the midst of them.</I> And, besides, he would have all the 
 disciples witnesses of the rebuke he gave to Thomas, and yet withal of 
 the tender care he had of him.

 2. That Christ <I>came</I> in among them, and <I>stood in the
 midst,</I> and they all knew him, for he showed himself now, just as he 
 had shown himself before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 still the same, and no changeling. See the condescension of our Lord
 Jesus. The gates of heaven were ready to be opened to him, and there he 
 might have been in the midst of the adorations of a world of angels; 
 yet, for the benefit of his church, he lingered on earth, and visited 
 the little private meetings of his poor disciples, and is in the midst 
 of them. 

 3. He saluted them all in a friendly manner, as he had done before; he
 said, <I>Peace be unto you.</I> This was no vain repetition, but 
 significant of the abundant and assured peace which Christ gives, and 
 of the continuance of his blessings upon his people, for they <I>fail 
 not,</I> but are <I>new every morning,</I> new every meeting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What passed between Christ and Thomas at this meeting; and that 
 only is recorded, though we may suppose he said a great deal to the 
 rest of them. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ's gracious condescension to Thomas, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He singled him out from the rest, and applied himself particularly to 
 him: "<I>Reach hither thy finger,</I> and, since thou wilt have it so, 
 <I>behold my hands,</I> and satisfy thy curiosity to the utmost about 
 the <I>print of the nails; reach hither thy hand,</I> and, if nothing 
 less will convince thee, <I>thrust it into my side.</I>" Here we have,

 (1.) An implicit rebuke of Thomas's incredulity, in the plain reference 
 which is here had to what Thomas had said, answering it word for word, 
 for he had heard it, though unseen; and one would think that his 
 telling him of it should put him to the blush. Note, There is not an 
 unbelieving word on our tongues, no, nor thought in our minds, at any 
 time, but it is known to the Lord Jesus.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:21">Ps. lxxviii. 21</A>.

 (2.) An express condescension to this weakness, which appears in two
 things:--

 [1.] That he suffers his wisdom to be prescribed to. Great spirits will 
 not be dictated to by their inferiors, especially in their acts of 
 grace; yet Christ is pleased here to accommodate himself even to 
 Thomas's fancy in a needless thing, rather than break with him, and 
 leave him in his unbelief. He will not <I>break the bruised reed,</I> 
 but, as a good shepherd, <I>gathers that which was driven away,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:16">Ezek. xxxiv. 16</A>.
 
 We ought thus to <I>bear the infirmities of the weak,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:1,2">Rom. xv. 1, 2</A>.

 [2.] He suffers his wounds to be raked into, allows Thomas even to
 thrust his hand into his side, if then at last he would believe. Thus, 
 for the confirmation of our faith, he has instituted an ordinance on 
 purpose to keep his death in remembrance, though it was an ignominious, 
 shameful death, and one would think should rather have been forgotten, 
 and no more said of it; yet, because it was such an evidence of his 
 love as would be an encouragement to our faith, he appoints the 
 memorial of it to be celebrated. And in that ordinance where in we 
 <I>show the Lord's death</I> we are called, as it were, to put our 
 finger <I>into the print of the nails. Reach hither thy hand</I> to 
 him, who reacheth forth his helping, inviting, giving hand to thee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is an affecting word with which Christ closes up what he had to say 
 to Thomas: <I>Be not faithless but believing;</I> <B><I>me ginou 
 apistos</I></B>--<I>do not thou become an unbeliever;</I> as if he 
 would have been sealed up under unbelief, had he not yielded now. This 
 warning is given to us all: <I>Be not faithless;</I> for, if we are 
 faithless, we are Christless and graceless, hopeless and joyless; let 
 us therefore say, <I>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Thomas's believing consent to Jesus Christ. He is now ashamed of his 
 incredulity, and cries out, <I>My Lord and my God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 We are not told whether he did put his finger into the print of the 
 nails; it should seem, he did not, for Christ says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),
 
 <I>Thou hast seem, and believed;</I> seeing sufficed. And now
 faith comes off a conqueror, after a struggle with unbelief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Thomas is now fully satisfied of the truth of Christ's 
 resurrection--that the same Jesus that was crucified is now alive, and 
 this is he. His slowness and backwardness to believe may help to 
 strengthen our faith; for hereby it appears that the witnesses of 
 Christ's resurrection, who attested it to the world, and pawned their 
 lives upon it, were not easy credulous men, but cautious enough, and 
 suspended their belief of it till they saw the utmost evidence of it 
 they could desire. Thus <I>out of the eater came forth meat.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He therefore believed him to be Lord and God, and we are to 
 believe him so. 

 [1.] We must believe his deity--that he is God; not a man made God, but 
 God made man, as this evangelist had laid down his thesis at first,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1"><I>ch.</I> i. 1</A>.

 The author and head of our holy religion has the wisdom, power,
 sovereignty, and unchangeableness of God, which was necessary, because 
 he was to be not only the founder of it, but the foundation of it for 
 its constant support, and the fountain of life for its supply. 

 [2.] His mediation--that he is Lord, the one Lord,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:6,1Ti+2:5">1 Cor. viii. 6; 1 Tim. ii. 5</A>.

 He is sufficiently authorized, as pleni-potentiary, to settle the great
 concerns that lie between God and man, to take up the controversy which
 would inevitably have been our ruin, and to establish the
 correspondence that was necessary to our happiness; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:36,Ro+14:9">Acts ii. 36; Rom. xiv. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He consented to him as his Lord and his God. In faith there must 
 be the consent of the will to gospel terms, as well as the assent of 
 the understanding to gospel truths. We must accept of Christ to be that 
 to us which the Father hath appointed him. <I>My Lord</I> refers to 
 <I>Adonai</I>--my foundation and stay; <I>my God to Elohim</I>--my 
 prince and judge. God having constituted him the umpire and referee, we 
 must approve the choice, and entirely refer ourselves to him. This is 
 the vital act of faith, He is mine,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:16">Cant. ii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He made an open profession of this, before those that had been the 
 witnesses of his unbelieving doubts. He says it to Christ, and, to 
 complete the sense, we must read it, <I>Thou art</I> my Lord and my 
 God; or, speaking to his brethren, <I>This is</I> my Lord and my God. 
 Do we accept of Christ as our <I>Lord God?</I> We must go to him, and 
 tell him so, as David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:2">Ps. xvi. 2</A>),

 deliver the surrender to him as <I>our act and deed,</I> tell others 
 so, as those that triumph in our relation to Christ: <I>This is my 
 beloved.</I> Thomas speaks with an ardency of affection, as one that 
 took hold of Christ with all his might, <I>My Lord</I> and <I>my 
 God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The judgment of Christ upon the whole 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 "<I>Thomas because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed,</I> and it is 
 well thou art brought to it at last upon any terms; but <I>blessed are 
 those that have not seen, and yet have believed.</I>" Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ owns Thomas a believer. Sound and sincere believers, though 
 they be slow and weak, shall be graciously accepted of the Lord Jesus. 
 Those who have long stood it out, if at last they yield, shall find him 
 ready to forgive. No sooner did Thomas consent to Christ than Christ 
 gives him the comfort of it, and lets him know that he believes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He upbraids him with his former incredulity. He might well be 
 ashamed to think, 

 [1.] That he had been so backward to believe, and came so slowly to his 
 own comforts. Those that in sincerity have closed with Christ see a 
 great deal of reason to lament that they did not do it sooner. 

 [2.] That it was not without much ado that he was brought to believe at 
 last: "If thou hadst not seen me alive, thou wouldst not have 
 believed;" but if no evidence must be admitted but that of our own 
 senses, and we must believe nothing but what we ourselves are 
 eye-witnesses of, farewell all commerce and conversation. If this must 
 be the only method of proof, how must the world be converted to the 
 faith of Christ? He is therefore justly blamed for laying so much 
 stress upon this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He commends the faith of those who believe upon easier terms. 
 Thomas, as a believer, was truly blessed; but rather <I>blessed are 
 those that have not seen.</I> It is not meant of not seeing the objects 
 of faith (for these are invisible, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:1,2Co+4:18">Heb. xi. 1; 2 Cor. iv. 18</A>),

 but the motives of faith--Christ's miracles, and especially his 
 resurrection; blessed are those that see not these, and yet believe in 
 Christ. This may look, either backward, upon the Old-Testament saints, 
 who had not seen the things which they saw, and yet believed the 
 promise made unto the father, and lived by that faith; or forward, upon 
 those who should afterwards believe, the Gentiles, who had never seen 
 Christ in the flesh, as the Jews had. This faith is more laudable and 
 praise-worthy than theirs who saw and believed; for, 

 [1.] It evidences a better temper of mind in those that do believe. Not
 to see and yet to believe argues greater industry in searching after 
 truth, and greater ingenuousness of mind in embracing it. He that 
 believes upon that sight has his resistance conquered by a sort of 
 violence; but he that believes without it, like the Bereans, is more 
 noble. 

 [2.] It is a greater instance of the power of divine grace. The less 
 sensible the evidence is the more does the work of faith appear to be 
 the Lord's doing. Peter is blessed in his faith, because flesh and 
 blood have not revealed it to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:17">Matt. xvi. 17</A>.

 Flesh and blood contribute more to their faith that see and believe, 
 than to theirs who see not and yet believe. Dr. Lightfoot quotes a
 saying of one of the rabbin, "That one proselyte is more acceptable to 
 God than all the thousands of Israel that stood before mount Sinai; for 
 they saw and received the law, but a proselyte sees not, and yet 
 receives it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The remark which the evangelist makes upon his narrative, like an 
 historian drawing towards a conclusion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>.
 
 And here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He assures us that many other things occurred, which were all worthy 
 to be recorded, but are <I>not written in the book: many signs.</I> 
 Some refer this to all the signs that Jesus did during his whole life, 
 all the wondrous words he spoke, and all the wondrous works he did. But 
 it seems rather to be confined to the signs he did after his 
 resurrection, for these were in the presence of the disciples only, who 
 are here spoken of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:41">Acts x. 41</A>.

 Divers of his appearances are not recorded, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:5-7">1 Cor. xv. 5-7</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:3">Acts i. 3</A>.
 
 Now,

 (1.) We may here improve this general attestation, that there were
 other signs, many others, for the confirmation of our faith; and, being 
 added to the particular narratives, they very much strengthen the 
 evidence. Those that recorded the resurrection of Christ were not put 
 to fish for evidence, to take up such short and scanty proofs as they 
 could find, and make up the rest with conjecture. No, they had evidence 
 enough and to spare, and more witnesses to produce than they had 
 occasion for. The disciples, in whose presence these other signs were 
 done, were to be preachers of Christ's resurrection to others, and 
 therefore it was requisite they should have proofs of it <I>ex 
 abundanti--in abundance,</I> that they might have a strong consolation, 
 who ventured life and all upon it. 

 (2.) We need not ask why they were not all written, or why not more 
 than these, or others than these; for it is enough for us that so it 
 seemed good to the Holy Spirit, by whose inspiration this was given. 
 Had this history been a mere human composition, it had been swelled 
 with a multitude of depositions and affidavits, to prove the contested 
 truth of Christ's resurrection and long argument drawn up for the 
 demonstration of it; but, being a divine history, the penmen write with 
 a noble security, relating what amounted to a competent proof, 
 sufficient to convince those that were willing to be taught and to 
 condemn those that were obstinate in their unbelief; and, if this 
 satisfy not, more would not. Men produce all they have to say, that 
 they may gain credit; but God does not, for he can give faith. Had this 
 history been written for the entertainment of the curious, it would 
 have been more copious, or every circumstance would have brightened and 
 embellished the story; but it was written to bring men to believe, and 
 enough is said to answer that intention, whether men will hear or 
 whether they will forbear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He instructs us in the design of recording what we do find here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "These accounts are given in this and the following chapter, <I>that 
 you might believe</I> upon these evidences; that you might believe that 
 Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, declared with power to be so by 
 his resurrection."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is the design of those that wrote the gospel. Some write 
 books for their diversion, and publish them for their profit or 
 applause, others to oblige the Athenian humour, others to instruct the 
 world in arts and sciences for their secular advantage; but the 
 evangelists wrote without any view of temporal benefit to themselves or 
 others, but to bring men to Christ and heaven, and, in order to this, 
 to persuade men to believe; and for this they took the most fitting 
 methods, they brought to the world a divine revelation, supported with
 its due evidences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The duty of those that read and hear the gospel. It is their duty
 to believe, to embrace, the doctrine of Christ, and that record given
 concerning him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:11">1 John v. 11</A>.

 [1.] We are here told what the great gospel truth is which we are to
 believe--that <I>Jesus is that Christ,</I> that <I>Son of God. 
 First,</I> That he is the Christ, the person who, under the title of 
 the Messiah, was promised to, and expected by, the Old-Testament 
 saints, and who, according to the signification of the name, is 
 <I>anointed</I> of God to be a prince and a Saviour. <I>Secondly,</I>
 That he is the Son of God; not only as Mediator (for then he had not 
 been greater than Moses, who was a prophet, intercessor, and lawgiver), 
 but antecedent to his being the Mediator; for if he had not been a 
 divine person, endued with the power of God and entitled to the glory 
 of God, he had not been qualified for the undertaking-not fit either to 
 do the Redeemer's work or to wear the Redeemer's crown. 

 [2.] What the great gospel blessedness is which we are to hope
 for--<I>That believing we shall have life through his name.</I> This 
 is, <I>First,</I> To direct our faith; it must have an eye to the life, 
 the crown of life, the tree of life set before us. Life through
 Christ's name, the life proposed in the covenant which is made with us 
 in Christ, is what we must propose to ourselves as the fulness of our 
 joy and the abundant recompence of all our services and sufferings. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> To encourage our faith, and invite us to believe. Upon 
 the prospect of some great advantage, men will venture far; and greater 
 advantage there cannot be than that which is offered by the <I>words of 
 this life,</I> as the gospel is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:20">Acts v. 20</A>.

 It includes both spiritual life, in conformity to God and communion
 with him, and eternal life, in the vision and fruition of him. Both are 
 through Christ's name, by his merit and power, and both indefeasibly 
 sure to all true believers.</P>
