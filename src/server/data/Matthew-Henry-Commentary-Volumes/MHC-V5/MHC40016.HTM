 None of Christ's miracles are recorded in this chapter, but four of his 
 discourses. Here is, 

 I. A conference with the Pharisees, who challenged him to show them a
 sign from heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. Another with his disciples about the leaven of the Pharisees, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:5-12">ver. 5-12</A>.

 III. Another with them concerning himself, as the Christ, and
 concerning his church built upon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:13-20">ver. 13-20</A>.

 IV. Another concerning his sufferings for them, and theirs for him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:21-28">ver. 21-28</A>.

 And all these are written for our learning.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting
 desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.
 &nbsp; 2  He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say,
 <I>It will be</I> fair weather: for the sky is red.
 &nbsp; 3  And in the morning, <I>It will be</I> foul weather to day: for the
 sky is red and lowring. O <I>ye</I> hypocrites, ye can discern the
 face of the sky; but can ye not <I>discern</I> the signs of the times?
 &nbsp; 4  A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and
 there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet
 Jonas. And he left them, and departed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's discourse with the Pharisees and Sadducees, men 
 at variance among themselves, as appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+23:7,8">Acts xxiii. 7, 8</A>,

 and yet unanimous in their opposition to Christ; because his doctrine
 did equally overthrow the errors and heresies of the Sadducees, who 
 denied the existence of spirits and a future state; and the pride, 
 tyranny, and hypocrisy of the Pharisees, who were the great imposters 
 of the traditions of the elders. Christ and Christianity meet with 
 opposition on all hands. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their demand, and the design of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The demand was of a sign from heaven; this they desired him to show 
 them; pretending they were very willing to be satisfied and convinced, 
 when really they were far from being so, but sought excuses from an 
 obstinate infidelity. That which they pretended to desire was,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Some other sign than what they had yet had. They had great plenty 
 of signs; every miracle Christ wrought was a sign, for <I>no man could 
 do what he did unless God were with him.</I> But this will not serve, 
 they must have a sign of their own choosing; they despised those signs 
 which relieved the necessity of the sick and sorrowful, and insisted 
 upon some sign which gratify the curiosity of the proud. It is fit that 
 the proofs of divine revelation should be chosen by the wisdom of God, 
 not by the follies and fancies of men. The evidence that is given is 
 sufficient to satisfy an unprejudiced understanding, but was not 
 intended to please a vain humour. Ant it is an instance of the 
 deceitfulness of the heart, to think that we should be wrought upon by 
 the means and advantages which we have not, while we slight those which 
 we have. <I>If we hear not Moses and the prophets,</I> neither would we 
 be wrought upon <I>though one rose from the dead.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It must be a sign from heaven. They would have such miracles to 
 prove his commission, as were wrought at the giving of the law upon 
 mount Sinai: thunder, and lightening, and the voice of words, were the 
 sign from heaven they required. Whereas the sensible signs and terrible 
 ones were not agreeable to the spiritual and comfortable dispensation 
 of the gospel. Now the word comes more nigh us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:8">Rom. x. 8</A>),

 and therefore the miracles do so, and do not oblige us to keep such a 
 distance as these did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18">Heb. xii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The design was to tempt him; not to be taught by him, but to ensnare 
 him. If he should show them a sign from heaven, they would attribute it 
 to a confederacy with the <I>prince of the power of the air;</I> if he 
 should not, as they supposed he would not, they would have that to say 
 for themselves, <I>why they did not believe on him.</I> They now 
 tempted Christ as Israel did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:9">1 Cor. x. 9</A>.

 And observe their perverseness; <I>then,</I> when they had signs from
 heaven, they tempted Christ, saying, <I>Can he furnish a table in the 
 wilderness?</I> Now that he had furnished a table in the wilderness, 
 they tempted him, saying, <I>Can he give us a sign from heaven?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's reply to this demand; lest they should be <I>wise in their 
 own conceit,</I> he <I>answered these fools according to their 
 folly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:5">Prov. xxvi. 5</A>.
 
 In his answer,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He condemns their overlooking of the signs they had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 They were seeking for the signs of the kingdom of God, when it was 
 already among them. <I>The Lord was in this place,</I> and they <I>knew 
 it not.</I> Thus their unbelieving ancestors, when miracles were their 
 daily bread, asked, <I>Is the Lord among us, or is he not?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To expose this, he observes to them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Their skilfulness and sagacity in other things, particularly in
 natural prognostications of the weather; "You know that a red sky 
 over-night is a presage of fair weather, and a red sky in the morning 
 of foul weather." There are common rules drawn from observation and 
 experience, by which it is easy to foretel very probably what weather 
 it will be. When second causes have begun to work, we may easily guess 
 at their issue, so uniform is nature in its motions, and so consistent 
 with itself. We <I>know not the balancing of the clouds</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:16">Job xxxvii. 16</A>),

 but we may spell something from the faces of them. This gives no 
 countenance at all to the wild and ridiculous predictions of <I>the 
 astrologers, the star-gazers, and the monthly prognosticators</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:13">Isa. xlvii. 13</A>)

 concerning the weather long before, with which weak and foolish people 
 are imposed upon; we are sure, in general, that <I>seed-time and 
 harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, shall not cease.</I> But as 
 to the particulars, till, by the weather-glasses, or otherwise, we 
 perceive the immediate signs and harbingers of the change of weather, 
 it is not for us to know, no, not <I>that</I> concerning the times and 
 seasons. Let it suffice, that it shall be what weather pleases God; and 
 that which pleases God, should not displease us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their sottishness and stupidity in the concerns of their souls; 
 <I>Can ye not discern the signs of the times?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] "Do you not see that the Messiah is come?" The sceptre was 
 departed from Judah, Daniel's weeks were just expiring, and yet they 
 regarded not. The miracles Christ wrought, and the gathering of the 
 people to him, were plain indications that the <I>kingdom of heaven was 
 at hand,</I> that this was <I>the day of their visitation.</I> Note, 
 <I>First,</I> There are signs of the times, by which wise and upright 
 men are enabled to make moral prognostications, and so far to 
 understand the motions and methods of Providence, as from thence to 
 take their measures, and to know what Israel ought to do, as the men of 
 Issachar, as the physician from some certain symptoms finds a crisis 
 formed. <I>Secondly,</I> There are many who are skilful enough in other 
 things, and yet cannot or will not discern the day of their 
 opportunities, are not aware of the wind when it is fair for them, and 
 so let slip the gale. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:7,Isa+1:3">Jer. viii. 7; Isa. i. 3</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> It is great hypocrisy, when we slight the signs of
 God's ordaining, to seek for signs of our own prescribing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] "Do not you foresee your own ruin coming for rejecting him? You 
 will not entertain the gospel of peace, and can you not evidently 
 discern that hereby you pull an inevitable destruction upon your own 
 heads?" Note, It is the undoing of multitudes, that they are not aware 
 what will be the end of their refusing Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He refuses to give them any other sign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 as he had done before in the same words,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:39"><I>ch.</I> xii. 39</A>.

 Those that persist in the same iniquities, must expect to meet with the
 same reproofs. Here, as there, 

 (1.) He calls them <I>an adulterous generation;</I> because, while they
 professed themselves of the true church and spouse of God, they 
 treacherously departed from him, and brake their covenants with him.
 The Pharisees were <I>a generation pure in their own eyes,</I> having 
 the way of the adulterous woman, that thinks she has done no 
 wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:20">Prov. xxx. 20</A>.

 (2.) He refuses to gratify their desire. Christ will not be prescribed
 to; <I>we ask, and have not, because we ask amiss.</I> 

 (3.) He refers them to the sign of the prophet Jonas, which should yet 
 be given them; his resurrection from the dead, and his preaching by his 
 apostles to the Gentiles; these were reserved for the last and highest 
 evidences of his divine mission. Note, Though the fancies of proud men
 shall not be humoured, yet the faith of the humble shall be supported, 
 and the unbelief of them that perish left for ever inexcusable, and 
 <I>every mouth shall be stopped.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This discourse broke off abruptly; <I>he left them and departed.</I> 
 Christ will not tarry long with those that tempt him, but justly 
 withdraws from those that are disposed to quarrel with him. He left 
 them as irreclaimable; <I>Let them alone.</I> He left them to 
 themselves, left them in the hand of their own counsels; <I>so he gave 
 them up to their own hearts' lust.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
 forgotten to take bread.
 &nbsp; 6  Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven
 of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
 &nbsp; 7  And they reasoned among themselves, saying, <I>It is</I> because
 we have taken no bread.
 &nbsp; 8  <I>Which</I> when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of
 little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have
 brought no bread?
 &nbsp; 9  Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of
 the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
 &nbsp; 10  Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many
 baskets ye took up?
 &nbsp; 11  How is it that ye do not understand that I spake <I>it</I> not to
 you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the
 Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
 &nbsp; 12  Then understood they how that he bade <I>them</I> not beware of
 the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of
 the Sadducees.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's discourse with his disciples concerning bread, in 
 which, as in many other discourses, he speaks to them of spiritual 
 things under a similitude, and they misunderstand him of carnal things. 
 The occasion of it was, their forgetting to victual their ship, and to 
 take along with them provisions for their family on the other side of 
 the water; usually they carried bread along with them, because they 
 were sometimes in desert places; and when they were not, yet they would 
 not be burthensome. But now they forgot; we will hope it was because 
 their minds and memories were filled with better things. Note, Christ's 
 disciples are often such as have no great forecast for the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the caution Christ gave them, to <I>beware of the leaven of 
 the Pharisees.</I> He had now been discoursing with the Pharisees and 
 Sadducees, and saw them to be men of such a spirit, that it was 
 necessary to caution his disciples to have nothing to do with them. 
 Disciples are in most danger from hypocrites; against those that are 
 openly vicious they stand upon their guard, but against Pharisees, who 
 are great pretenders to devotion, and Sadducees, who pretend to a free 
 and impartial search after truth, they commonly lie unguarded: and 
 therefore the caution is doubted, <I>Take heed, and beware.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The corrupt principles and practices of the Pharisees and Sadducees are 
 compared to leaven; they were souring, and swelling, and spreading, 
 like leaven; they fermented wherever they came.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their mistake concerning this caution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They thought Christ hereby upbraided them with their improvidence and 
 forgetfulness, that they were so busy attending to his discourse with 
 the Pharisees, that <I>therefore</I> they forgot their private 
 concerns. Or, because having no bread of their own with them, they must 
 be beholden to their friends for supply, he would not have them to ask 
 it of the Pharisees and Sadducees, nor to receive of <I>their</I> alms, 
 because he would not so far countenance them; or, for fear, lest, under 
 pretence of feeding them, they should do them a mischief. Or, they took 
 it for a caution, not to be familiar with the Pharisees and Sadducees, 
 not to eat with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:6">Prov. xxiii. 6</A>),

 whereas the danger was not in their bread (Christ himself did eat with 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:36,11:37,14:1">Luke vii. 36; xi. 37; xiv. 1</A>),

 but in their principles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The reproof Christ gave them for this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He reproves their distrust of his ability and readiness to supply 
 them in this strait 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 "<I>O ye of little faith,</I> why are ye in such perplexity because ye 
 have <I>taken no bread,</I> that ye can mind nothing else, that ye 
 think your Master is as full of it as you, and apply every thing he 
 saith to that?" He does not chide them for their little forecast, as 
 they expected he would. Note, Parents and masters must not be angry at 
 the forgetfulness of their children and servants, more than is 
 necessary to make them take more heed another time; we are all apt to 
 be forgetful of our duty. This should serve to excuse a fault, 
 <I>Peradventure it was an oversight.</I> See how easily Christ forgave 
 his disciples' carelessness, though it was in such a material point as 
 taking bread; and do likewise. But that which he chides them for is 
 their little faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He would have them to depend upon him for supply, though it were 
 in a wilderness, and not to disquiet themselves with anxious thoughts 
 about it. Note, Though Christ's disciples be brought into wants and 
 straits, through their own carelessness and incogitancy, yet he 
 encourages them to trust in him for relief. We must not therefore use 
 this as an excuse for our want of charity to those who are really poor, 
 that they should have minded their own affairs better, and then they 
 would not have been in need. It may be so, but they must not therefore 
 be left to starve when they are in need.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He is displeased at their solicitude in this matter. The weakness 
 and shiftlessness of good people in their worldly affairs is that for 
 which men are apt to condemn them; but it is not such an offence to 
 Christ as their inordinate care and anxiety about those things. We must 
 endeavour to keep the mean between the extremes of carelessness and 
 carefulness; but of the two, the excess of thoughtfulness about the 
 world worst becomes Christ's disciples. "<I>O ye of little faith,</I> 
 why are ye disquieted for want of bread?" Note, To distrust Christ, and 
 to disturb ourselves when we are in straits and difficulties, is an 
 evidence of the weakness of our faith, which, if it were in exercise as 
 it should be, would ease us of the burthen of care, by casting it on 
 the Lord, who <I>careth for us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The aggravation of their distrust was the experience they had so 
 lately had of the power and goodness of Christ in providing for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 Though they had no bread with them, they had him with them who could 
 provide bread for them. If they had not the cistern, they had the 
 Fountain. <I>Do ye not yet understand, neither remember?</I> Note, 
 Christ's disciples are often to be blamed for the shallowness of their 
 understandings, and the slipperiness of their memories. "Have ye forgot 
 those repeated instances of merciful and miraculous supplies; five 
 thousand fed with five loaves, and four thousand with seven loaves, and 
 yet they had enough and to spare? Remember <I>how many baskets ye took 
 up.</I>" These baskets were intended for memorials, by which to keep 
 the mercy in remembrance, as the pot of manna which was preserved in 
 the ark, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:32">Exod. xvi. 32</A>.

 The fragments of those meals would be a feast now; and he that could
 furnish them with such an overplus then, surely could furnish them with 
 what was necessary now. That meat for their bodies was intended to be 
 meat or their faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:14">Ps. lxxiv. 14</A>),

 which therefore they should have lived upon, now that they had 
 forgotten to take bread. Note, We are <I>therefore</I> perplexed with
 present cares and distrusts, because we do not duly remember our former 
 experiences of divine power and goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He reproves their misunderstanding of the caution he gave them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 <I>How is it that you do not understand?</I> Note, Christ's disciples 
 may well be ashamed of the slowness and dulness of their apprehensions 
 in divine things; especially when they have long enjoyed the means of 
 grace; <I>I spake it not unto you concerning bread.</I> He took it ill, 
 
 (1.) That they should think him as thoughtful about bread as they were; 
 whereas his <I>meat and drink were to do his Father's will.</I> 

 (2.) That they should be so little acquainted with his way of 
 preaching, as to take that literally which he spoke by way of parable; 
 and should thus make themselves like the multitude, who, when Christ 
 spoke to them in parables, seeing, saw not, and hearing, heard not,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:13"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The rectifying of the mistake by this reproof 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 <I>Then understood they</I> what he meant. Note, Christ 
 <I>therefore</I> shows us our folly and weakness, that we may stir up 
 ourselves to take things right. He did not tell them expressly what he 
 meant, but repeated what he had said, that they should beware of the 
 leaven; and so obliged them, by comparing this with his other 
 discourses, to arrive at the sense of it in their own thoughts. Thus 
 Christ teaches by the Spirit of wisdom in the heart, opening the 
 understanding to the Spirit of revelation in the word. And those truths 
 are most precious, which we have thus digged for, and have found out 
 after some mistakes. Though Christ did not tell them plainly, yet now 
 they were aware that by the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, he 
 meant their doctrine and way, which were corrupt and vicious, but, as 
 they managed them, very apt to insinuate themselves into the minds of 
 men like leaven, and to <I>eat like a canker.</I> They were leading 
 men, and were had in reputation, which made the danger of infection by 
 their errors the greater. In our age, we may reckon atheism and deism 
 to be the leaven of the Sadducees, and popery to be the leaven of the 
 Pharisees, against both which it concerns all Christians to stand upon 
 their guard.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  When Jesus came into the coasts of C&aelig;sarea Philippi, he
 asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of
 man am?
 &nbsp; 14  And they said, Some <I>say that thou art</I> John the Baptist:
 some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
 &nbsp; 15  He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?
 &nbsp; 16  And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the
 Son of the living God.
 &nbsp; 17  And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou,
 Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed <I>it</I> unto
 thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
 &nbsp; 18  And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
 rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not
 prevail against it.
 &nbsp; 19  And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven:
 and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven:
 and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
 heaven.
 &nbsp; 20  Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man
 that he was Jesus the Christ.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a private conference which Christ had with his disciples 
 concerning himself. It was in the coasts of Cesarea Philippi, the 
 utmost borders of the land of Canaan northward; there in that remote 
 corner, perhaps, there was less flocking after him than in other 
 places, which gave him leisure for this private conversation with his 
 disciples. Note, When ministers are abridged in their public work, they 
 should endeavour to do the more in their own families.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ is here catechising his disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He enquires what the opinions of others were concerning him; <I>Who 
 do men say that I, the Son of man, am?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He calls himself the <I>Son of man;</I> which may be taken either, 
 
 (1.) As a title common to him with others. He was called, and justly, 
 <I>the Son of God,</I> for so he was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:35">Luke i. 35</A>);

 but he called himself the Son of man; for he is really and truly "Man, 
 made of a woman." In courts of honour, it is a rule to distinguish men 
 by their highest titles; but Christ, having now emptied himself, though 
 he was the Son of God, will be known by the style and title of the Son 
 of man. Ezekiel was often so called to <I>keep</I> him humble; Christ 
 called himself so, to show that he <I>was</I> humble. Or, 

 (2.) As a title peculiar to him as Mediator. He is made known, in 
 Daniel's vision, as the <I>Son of man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13">Dan. vii. 13</A>.

 I am the Messiah, that Son of man that was promised. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He enquires what people's sentiments were concerning him: "<I>Who do 
 men say that I am? The Son of man?</I>" (So I think it might better be
 read). "Do they own me for the Messiah?" He asks not, "Who do the 
 <I>scribes</I> and <I>Pharisees</I> say that I am?" They were 
 prejudiced against him, and said that he was a deceiver and in league 
 with Satan; but, "Who do <I>men</I> say that I am?" He referred to the 
 common people, whom the Pharisees despised. Christ asked this question, 
 not as one that knew not; for if he knows what men think, much more 
 what they say; nor as one desirous to hear his own praises, but to make 
 the disciples solicitous concerning the success of their preaching, by 
 showing that he himself was so. The common people conversed more 
 familiarly with the disciples than they did with their Master, and 
 therefore from them he might better know what they said. Christ had not 
 plainly said who he was, but left people to infer it from his works, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:24,25">John x. 24, 25</A>.

 Now he would know what inferences the people drew from <I>them,</I> and
 from the miracles which his apostles wrought in his name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. To this question the disciples have him an answer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>Some say, thou art John the Baptist, &c.</I> There were some that 
 said, he was the <I>Son of David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:23"><I>ch.</I> xii. 23</A>),

 and the great Prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:14">John vi. 14</A>.

 The disciples, however, do not mention that opinion, but only such
 opinions as were wide of the truth, which they gathered up from their 
 countrymen. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They are different opinions; some say one thing, and others 
 another. Truth is one; but those who vary from that commonly vary one 
 from another. Thus Christ came eventually to send division, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:51">Luke xii. 51</A>.
 
 Being so noted a Person, every one would be ready to pass his verdict
 upon him, and, "Many men, many minds;" those that were not willing to 
 own him to be the Christ, wandered in endless mazes, and followed the 
 chase of every uncertain guess and wild hypothesis.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They are honourable opinions, and bespeak the respect they had for 
 him, according to the best of their judgment. These were not the 
 sentiments of his enemies, but the sober thoughts of those that 
 followed him with love and wonder. Note, It is possible for men to have 
 good thoughts of Christ, and yet not right ones, a high opinion of him, 
 and yet not high enough.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They all suppose him to be <I>one risen from the dead;</I> which 
 perhaps arose from a confused notion they had of the resurrection of 
 the Messiah, before his public preaching, as of Jonas. Or their notions 
 arose from an excessive value for antiquity; as if it were not possible 
 for an excellent man to be produced in their own age, but it must be 
 one of the ancients returned to life again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) They are all false opinions, built upon mistakes, and wilful 
 mistakes. Christ's doctrines and miracles bespoke him to be an 
 extraordinary Person; but because of the meanness of his appearance, so 
 different from what they expected, they would not own him to be the 
 Messiah, but will grant him to be any thing rather than that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>Some say, thou art John the Baptist.</I> Herod said so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:2"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 2</A>),

 and those about him would be apt to say as he said. This notion might
 be strengthened by an opinion they had, that those who died as martyrs, 
 should rise again before others; which some think the second of the 
 seven sons refers to, in his answer to Antiochus, 
 
 <U>2 Macc. vii. 9</U>,

 <I>The King of the world shall raise us up, who have died for his laws, 
 unto everlasting life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>Some Elias;</I> taking occasion, no doubt, from the prophecy of 
 Malachi 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:5"><I>ch.</I> iv. 5</A>),

 <I>Behold, I will send you Elijah.</I> And the rather, because Elijah
 (as Christ) did many miracles, and was himself, in his translation, the 
 greatest miracle of all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] <I>Others Jeremias:</I> they fasten upon him, either because he 
 was the weeping prophet, and Christ was often in tears; or because God 
 had <I>set him over the kingdoms and nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:10">Jer. i. 10</A>),

 which they thought agreed with their notion of the Messiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] <I>Or, one of the prophets.</I> This shows what an honourable idea 
 they entertained of the prophets; and yet they were <I>the children of 
 them that persecuted and slew them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:29"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 29</A>.

 Rather than they would allow Jesus of Nazareth, one of their own
 country, to be such an extraordinary Person as his works bespoke him to 
 be, they would say, "It was not he, but <I>one of the old 
 prophets.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He enquires what <I>their</I> thoughts were concerning him; "<I>But 
 who say ye that I am?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Ye tell me what other people say of me; can ye say better?" 

 1. The disciples had themselves been better taught than others; had, by 
 their intimacy with Christ, greater advantages of getting knowledge 
 than others had. Note, It is justly expected that those who enjoy 
 greater plenty of the means of knowledge and grace than others, should 
 have a more clear and distinct knowledge of the things of God than 
 others. Those who have more acquaintance with Christ than others,
 should have truer sentiments concerning him, and be able to give a 
 better account of him than others. 

 2. The disciples were trained up to teach others, and therefore it was
 highly requisite that they should understand the truth themselves: "Ye 
 that are to preach the gospel of the kingdom, what are your notions of 
 him that sent you?" Note, Ministers must be examined before they be 
 sent forth, especially what their sentiments are of Christ, and who 
 they say that he is; for how can they be owned as ministers of Christ, 
 that are either ignorant or erroneous concerning Christ? This is a 
 question we should every one of us be frequently putting to ourselves, 
 "<I>Who</I> do we say, <I>what</I> kind of one do we say, that <I>the 
 Lord Jesus is?</I> Is he precious to us? Is he in our eyes the chief of 
 ten thousand? Is he the Beloved of our souls?" It is well or ill with 
 us, according as our thoughts are right or wrong concerning Jesus 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Well, this is the question; now let us observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Peter's answer to this question, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 To the former question concerning the opinion others had of Christ, 
 several of the disciples answered, according as they had heard people 
 talk; but to this Peter answers in the name of all the rest, they all 
 consenting to it, and concurring in it. Peter's temper led him to be 
 forward in speaking upon all such occasions, and sometimes he spoke 
 well, sometimes amiss; in all companies there are found some warm, bold 
 men, to whom a precedency of speech falls of course; Peter was such a 
 one: yet we find other of the apostles sometimes speaking as the mouth 
 of the rest; as <I>John</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+9:38">Mark ix. 38</A>),
 
 <I>Thomas, Philip,</I> and <I>Jude,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:5,8,22">John xiv. 5, 8, 22</A>.

 So that this is far from being a proof of such primacy and superiority 
 of Peter above the rest of the apostles, as the church of Rome ascribes 
 to him. They will needs advance him to be a judge, when the utmost they 
 can make of him, is, that he was but foreman of the jury, to speak for 
 the rest, and that only <I>pro h&acirc;c vice--for this once;</I> not 
 the perpetual dictator or speaker of the house, only chairman upon this 
 occasion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Peter's answer is short, but it is full, and true, and to the purpose; 
 <I>Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God.</I> Here is a 
 confession of the Christian faith, addressed to Christ, and so made an 
 act of devotion. Here is a confession of the true God as the living 
 God, in opposition to dumb and dead idols, and of <I>Jesus Christ, whom 
 he hath sent,</I> whom to know is <I>life eternal.</I> This is the 
 conclusion of the whole matter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The people called him <I>a Prophet, that Prophet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:14">John vi. 14</A>);
 
 but the disciples own him to be the Christ, the anointed One; the great 
 Prophet, Priest, and King of the church; the true Messiah promised to 
 the fathers, and depended on by them as <I>He that shall come.</I> It 
 was a great thing to believe this concerning one whose outward 
 appearance was so contrary to the general idea the Jews had of the 
 Messiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He called himself the <I>Son of Man;</I> but they owned him to be 
 <I>the Son of the living God.</I> The <I>people's</I> notion of him 
 was, that he was the ghost of a dead man, Elias, or Jeremias; but 
 <I>they</I> know and believe him to be <I>the Son of the living 
 God,</I> who has life in himself, and has given to his Son to have life 
 in himself, and to be the <I>Life of the world.</I> If he be <I>the Son 
 of the living God,</I> he is of the same nature with him: and though 
 his divine nature was now veiled with the cloud of flesh, yet there 
 were those who looked through it, and <I>saw his glory, the glory as of 
 the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</I> Now can 
 we with an assurance of faith subscribe to this confession? Let us 
 then, with a fervency of affection and adoration, go to Christ, and 
 tell him so; Lord Jesus, <I>thou art the Christ, the Son of the living 
 God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ's approbation of his answer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:17-19"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>);

 in which Peter is replied to, both as a believer and as an apostle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] As a believer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Christ shows himself well pleased with Peter's confession, that it was 
 so clear and express, without <I>ifs</I> or <I>ands,</I> as we say. 
 Note, The proficiency of Christ's disciples in knowledge and grace is 
 very acceptable to him; and Christ shows him whence he received the 
 knowledge of this truth. At the first discovery of this truth in the 
 dawning of the gospel day, it was a mighty thing to believe it; <I>all 
 men had not this knowledge,</I> had not this faith. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Peter had the happiness of it; <I>Blessed art thou, Simon
 Bar-jona.</I> He reminds him of his rise and original, the meanness of 
 his parentage, the obscurity of his extraction; he was <I>Bar-jonas--The
 son of a dove;</I> so some. Let him remember <I>the rock out of which 
 he was hewn,</I> that he may see he was not born to this dignity, but 
 preferred to it by the divine favour; it was free grace that made him 
 to differ. Those that have received the Spirit must remember who is 
 their Father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:12">1 Sam. x. 12</A>.

 Having reminded him of this, he makes him sensible of his great
 happiness as a believer; <I>Blessed art thou.</I> Note, True believers 
 are truly blessed, and those are blessed indeed whom Christ pronounces 
 blessed; his saying they are so, makes them so. "Peter, thou art a
 happy man, who thus <I>knowest the joyful sound,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:15">Ps. lxxxix. 15</A>.

 <I>Blessed are your eyes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:16"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 16</A>.

 All happiness attends the right knowledge of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> God must have the glory of it; "<I>For flesh and blood 
 have not revealed it to thee.</I> Thou hadst this neither by the 
 invention of thy own wit and reason, nor by the instruction and 
 information of others; this light sprang neither from nature nor from 
 education, but from my Father who is in heaven." Note, 

 1. The Christian religion is a revealed religion, has its rise in
 heaven; it is a religion from above, given by inspiration of God, not 
 the learning of philosophers, nor the politics of statesmen. 

 2. Saving faith is the gift of God, and, wherever it is, is wrought by
 him, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for his sake, and upon the 
 score of his mediation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:29">Phil. i. 29</A>.

 <I>Therefore</I> thou art blessed, because <I>my Father has revealed it
 to thee.</I> Note, The revealing of Christ to us and in us is a 
 distinguishing token of God's good will, and a firm foundation of true 
 happiness; and blessed are they that are thus highly favoured.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Perhaps Christ discerned something of pride and vain-glory in Peter's 
 confession; a subtle sin, and which is apt to mingle itself even with 
 our good duties. It is hard for good men to compare themselves with 
 others, and not to have too great a conceit of themselves; to prevent 
 which, we should consider that our preference to others is no 
 achievement of our own, but the free gift of God's grace too us, and 
 not to others; so that we have nothing to boast of, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:1,1Co+4:7">Ps. cxv. 1; 1 Cor. iv. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Christ replies to him as an apostle or minister, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 Peter, in the name of the church, had confessed Christ, and to him 
 therefore the promise intended for the church is directed. Note, There 
 is nothing lost by being forward to confess Christ; for those who 
 honour him, he will honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Upon occasion of this great confession made of Christ, which is the 
 church's homage and allegiance, he signed and published this royal, 
 this divine charter, by which that body politic is incorporated. Such 
 is the communion between Christ and the church, the Bridegroom and the 
 spouse. God had a church in the world from the beginning, and it was 
 built upon the rock of the promised Seed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>.

 But now, that promised Seed being come, it was requisite that the
 church should have a new charter, as Christian, and standing in
 relation to a Christ already come. Now here we have that charter; and a
 thousand pities it is, that this word, which is the great support of
 the kingdom of Christ, should be wrested and pressed into the service
 of antichrist. But the devil has employed his subtlety to pervert it,
 as he did that promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:11">Ps. xci. 11</A>,

 which he perverted to his own purpose,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:6"><I>ch.</I> iv. 6</A>,

 and perhaps both that scripture and this he thus perverted because they
 stood in his way, and therefore he owed them a spite.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the purport of this charter is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> To establish the being of the church; <I>I say also unto
 thee.</I> It is Christ that makes the grant, he who is the church's 
 Head, and Ruler, to whom all judgment is committed, and from whom all 
 power is derived; he who makes it pursuant to the authority received 
 from the Father, and his undertaking for the salvation of the elect. 
 The grant is put into Peter's hand; "I say it to <I>thee.</I>" The Old 
 Testament promises relating to the church were given immediately to 
 particular persons, eminent for faith and holiness, as to Abraham and 
 David; which yet gave no supremacy to them, much less to any of their 
 successors; so the New-Testament charter is here delivered to Peter as 
 an agent, but to the use and behoof of the church in all ages, 
 according to the purposes therein specified and contained. Now it is 
 here promised,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That Christ would build his church upon a rock. This body politic is 
 incorporated by the style and title of <I>Christ's church.</I> It is a 
 number o the children of men called out of the world, and set apart 
 from it, and dedicated to Christ. It is not <I>thy</I> church, but 
 <I>mine.</I> Peter remembered this, when he cautioned ministers <I>not 
 to lord it over God's heritage.</I> The church is Christ's peculiar, 
 appropriated to him. The world is God's, and they that dwell therein; 
 but the church is a chosen remnant, that stands in relation to God 
 through Christ as Mediator. It bears him image and superscription.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The Builder and Maker of the church is Christ himself; <I>I will 
 build it.</I> The church is a temple which Christ is the Builder of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:11-13">Zech. vi. 11-13</A>.

 Herein Solomon was a type of Christ, and Cyrus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:28">Isa. xliv. 28</A>.

 The materials and workmanship are his. By the working of his Spirit
 with the preaching of his word he adds souls to his church, and so 
 builds it up with living stones,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 <I>Ye are God's building;</I> and building is a progressive work; the 
 church in this world is but <I>in fieri--in the forming,</I> like a 
 house in the building. It is a comfort to all those who wish well to 
 the church, that Christ, who has divine wisdom and power, undertakes to 
 build it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The foundation on which it is built is, <I>this Rock.</I> Let the 
 architect do his part ever so well, if the foundation be rotten, the 
 building will not stand; let us therefore see what the foundation is, 
 and it must be meant of Christ, for <I>other foundation can no man 
 lay.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:16">Isa. xxviii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The church is built upon a <I>rock;</I> a firm, strong, and 
 lasting foundation, which time will not waste, nor will it sink under 
 the weight of the building. Christ would not build his house upon the 
 sand, for he knew that storms would arise. A rock is high, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+61:2">Ps. lxi. 2</A>.
 
 Christ's church does not stand upon a level with this world; a rock is
 large, and extends far, so does the church's foundation; and the more 
 large, the more firm; those are not the church's friends that narrow 
 its foundation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It is built upon <I>this</I> rock; thou art <I>Peter,</I> which 
 signifies <I>a stone or rock;</I> Christ gave him that name when he 
 first called him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:42">John i. 42</A>),

 and here he confirms it; "Peter, thou dost answer thy name, thou art a 
 solid, substantial disciple, fixed and stayed, and one that there is 
 some hold of. Peter is thy name, and strength and stability are with 
 thee. Thou art not shaken with the waves of men's fluctuating opinions 
 concerning me, but established in the present truth," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:12">2 Pet. i. 12</A>.

 From the mention of this significant name, occasion is taken for this
 metaphor of <I>building upon a rock.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Some by this rock understand Peter himself as an apostle,
 the chief, though not the prince, of the twelve, senior among them, but 
 not superior over them. The church is built upon the foundation of the 
 apostles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:20">Eph. ii. 20</A>.

 The first stones of that building were laid in and by their ministry;
 hence their names are said to be <I>written in the foundations</I> of 
 the new Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:14">Rev. xxi. 14</A>.

 Now Peter being that apostle by whose hand the first stones of the
 church were laid, both in Jewish converts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1-47">Acts ii.</A>),

 and in the Gentile converts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:1-48">Acts x.</A>),

 he might in some sense be said to be the rock on which it was built.
 <I>Cephas</I> was one that seemed to be a pillar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:9">Gal. ii. 9</A>.

 But it sounds very harsh, to call a man that only lays the first stone 
 of a building, which is a transient act, the foundation on which it is 
 built, which is an abiding thing. Yet if it were so, this would not
 serve to support the pretensions of the Bishop of Rome; for Peter had 
 no such headship as he claims, much less could he derive it to his 
 successors, least of all to the Bishops of Rome, who, whether they are 
 so in place or no, is a question, but that they are not so in the truth 
 of Christianity, is past all question.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> Others, by this <I>rock,</I> understand <I>Christ; 
 "Thou art Peter,</I> thou hast the name of a <I>stone,</I> but <I>upon 
 this rock,</I> pointing to himself, <I>I will build my church.</I>" 
 Perhaps he laid his hand on his breast, as when he said, <I>Destroy 
 this temple</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:19">John ii. 19</A>),

 when he <I>spoke of the temple of his body.</I> Then he took occasion 
 from the temple, where he was, so to speak of himself, and gave 
 occasion to some to misunderstand him of that; so here he took occasion 
 from Peter, to speak of himself as the Rock, and gave occasion to some 
 to misunderstand him of Peter. But this must be explained by those many 
 scriptures which speak of Christ as the only Foundation of the church; 
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:11,1Pe+2:6">1 Cor. iii. 11; 1 Pet. ii. 6</A>.

 Christ is both its Founder and its Foundation; he draws souls, and
 draws them to himself; to him they are united, and on him they rest and 
 have a constant dependence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> Others by this <I>rock</I> understand this confession 
 which Peter made of Christ, and this comes all to one with 
 understanding it of Christ himself. It was a good confession which 
 Peter witnessed, <I>Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God;</I> 
 the rest concurred with him in it. "Now," saith Christ, "this is that 
 great truth <I>upon which I will build my church.</I>" 

 1. Take away this truth itself, and the universal church falls to the
 ground. If Christ be not the Son of God, Christianity is a cheat, and 
 the church is a mere chimera; <I>our preaching is vain, your faith is 
 vain, and you are yet in your sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:14-17">1 Cor. xv. 14-17</A>.

 If Jesus be not the Christ, those that own him are not of the church,
 but deceivers and deceived.

 2. Take away the faith and confession of this truth from any
 particular church, and it ceases to be a part of Christ's church, and 
 relapses to the state and character of infidelity. This is <I>articulus 
 stantis et cadentis ecclesia--that article, with the admission or the 
 denial of which the church either rises or falls;</I> "the main hinge 
 on which the door of salvation turns;" those who let go this, do not 
 hold the foundation; and though they may call themselves Christians, 
 they give themselves the lie; for the church is a sacred society, 
 incorporated upon the certainty and assurance of this great truth; and 
 great it is, and has prevailed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ here promises to preserve and secure his church, when it is 
 built; <I>The gates of hell shall not prevail against it;</I> neither 
 against this truth, nor against the church which is built upon it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This implies that the church has enemies that fight against it, 
 and endeavour its ruin overthrow, here represented by <I>the gates of 
 hell, that is,</I> the city of hell; (which is directly opposite to 
 this heavenly city, this <I>city of the living God</I>), the devil's 
 interest among the children of men. The gates of hell are the powers 
 and policies of the devil's kingdom, the dragon's head and horns, by 
 which he <I>makes war with the Lamb;</I> all that comes out of 
 hell-gates, as being hatched and contrived there. These fight against 
 the church by opposing gospel truths, corrupting gospel ordinances, 
 persecuting good ministers and good Christians; drawing or driving, 
 persuading by craft or forcing by cruelty, to that which is 
 inconsistent with the purity of religion; this is the design of the 
 gates of hell, to root out the name of Christianity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:4">Ps. lxxxiii. 4</A>),

 <I>to devour the man-child</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:9">Rev. xii. 9</A>),

 to raze this city to the ground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) This assures us that the enemies of the church shall not gain 
 their point. While the world stands, Christ will have a church in it, 
 in which his truths and ordinances shall be owned and kept up, in spite 
 of all the opposition of the powers of darkness; <I>They shall not 
 prevail against it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:1,2">Ps. cxxix. 1, 2</A>.

 This gives no security to any particular church, or church-governors
 that they shall never err, never apostatize or be destroyed; but that 
 somewhere or other the Christian religion shall have a being, though 
 not always in the same degree of purity and splendour, yet so as that 
 the entail of it shall never be quite cut off. The <I>woman lives, 
 though in a wilderness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:14">Rev. xii. 14</A>),
 
 <I>cast down but not destroyed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:9">2 Cor. iv. 9</A>).
 
 Corruptions grieving, persecutions grievous, but neither fatal. The 
 church may be foiled in particular encounters, but in the main battle 
 it shall come off <I>more than a conqueror.</I> Particular believers 
 are <I>kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:5">1 Pet. i. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The other part of this charter is, to settle the order 
 and government of the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 When a city or society is incorporated, officers are appointed and 
 empowered to act for the common good. A city without government is a 
 chaos. Now this constituting of the government of the church, is here
 expressed by the delivering of the keys, and, with them, a power to 
 bind and loose. This is not to be understood of any peculiar power that 
 Peter was invested with, as if he were sole door-keeper of the kingdom 
 of heaven, and had that key of David which belongs only to the Son of 
 David; no, this invests all the apostles and their successors with a 
 ministerial power to guide and govern the church of Christ, as it 
 exists in particular congregations or churches, according to the rules 
 of the gospel. <I>Claves regni c&aelig;lorum in B. Petro apostolo
 cuncti suscepimus sacerdotes--All we that are priests, received, in the 
 person of the blessed apostle Peter, the keys of the kingdom of 
 heaven;</I> so Ambrose <I>De Dignit. Sacerd.</I> Only the keys were 
 first put into Peter's hand, because he was the first <I>that opened 
 the door of faith to the Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:28">Acts x. 28</A>.

 As the king, in giving a charter to a corporation, empowers the
 magistrates to hold courts in his name, to try matters of fact, and 
 determine therein according to law, confirming what is so done 
 regularly as if done in any of the superior courts; so Christ, having 
 incorporated his church, hath appointed the office of the ministry for 
 the keeping up of order and government, and to see that his laws be 
 duly served; <I>I will give thee the keys.</I> He doth not say, "I 
 <I>have</I> given them," or "I <I>do</I> now;" but "I <I>will</I> do 
 it," meaning after his resurrection; <I>when he ascended on high, he 
 gave those gifts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8">Ephes. iv. 8</A>;

 then this power was actually given, not to Peter only, but to all the
 rest,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:19,20,Joh+20:21"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 19, 20; John xx. 21</A>.

 He doth not say, The keys <I>shall</I> be given, but, <I>I will
 give</I> them; for ministers derive their authority from Christ, and 
 all their power is to be used in his name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:4">1 Cor. v. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 1. The power here delegated is a spiritual power; it is a power 
 <I>pertaining to the kingdom of heaven,</I> that is, to the church, 
 that part of it which is militant here on earth, to the gospel 
 dispensation; that is it about which the apostolical and ministerial 
 power is wholly conversant. It is not any civil, secular power that is 
 hereby conveyed, Christ's <I>kingdom is not of this world;</I> their 
 instructions afterward were <I>in things pertaining to the kingdom of 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:3">Acts i. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is the <I>power</I> of the keys that is given, alluding to the 
 custom of investing men with authority in such a place, by delivering 
 to them the keys of the place. Or as the master of the house gives the 
 keys to the steward, the keys of the stores where the provisions are 
 kept, that he may give to every one in the house <I>his portion of meat 
 in due season</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:42">Luke xii. 42</A>),

 and deny it as there is occasion, according to the rules of the family.
 Ministers are <I>stewards,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:1,Tit+1:7">1 Cor. iv. 1; Tit. i. 7</A>.

 Eliakim, who had <I>the key</I> of the house of David, <I>was over the 
 household,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:22">Isa. xxii. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is a power to <I>bind and loose,</I> that is (following the
 metaphor of the keys), to shut and open. Joseph, who was lord of 
 Pharaoh's house, and steward of the stores, had power <I>to bind his 
 princes, and to teach his senators wisdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:21,22">Ps. cv. 21, 22</A>.

 When the stores and treasures of the house are shut up from any, they
 are bound, <I>interdico tibi aqu&acric; et igne--I forbid thee the use 
 of fire and water;</I> when they are opened to them again, they are 
 loosed from that bond, are discharged from the censure, and restored to 
 their liberty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. It is a power which Christ has promised to own the due 
 administration of; he will ratify the sentences of his stewards with 
 his own approbation; <I>It shall be bound in heaven, and loosed in 
 heaven:</I> not that Christ hath hereby obliged himself to confirm all 
 church-censures, right or wrong; but such as are duly passed according 
 to the word, <I>clave non errante--the key turning the right way,</I>
 such are sealed in heaven; that is, the word of the gospel, in the 
 mouth of faithful ministers, is to be looked upon, not as the word of 
 man, but as the word of God, and to be received accordingly, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:13.Joh+12:20">1 Thess. ii. 13; John xii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now <I>the keys of the kingdom of heaven are,</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The key of <I>doctrine,</I> called the key of <I>knowledge.</I> 
 "Your business shall be to explain to the world the will of God, both 
 as to truth and duty; and for this you shall have your commissions, 
 credentials, and full instructions to bind and loose:" these, in the 
 common speech of the Jews, at that time, signified to prohibit and 
 permit; to teach or declare a thing to be unlawful was to <I>bind;</I> 
 to be lawful, was to <I>loose.</I> Now the apostles had an 
 extraordinary power of this kind; some things forbidden by the law of 
 Moses were now to be allowed, as the eating of such and such meats; 
 some things allowed there were now to be forbidden, as divorce; and the 
 apostles were empowered to declare this to the world, and men might 
 take it upon their words. When Peter was first taught himself, and then 
 taught others, <I>to call nothing common or unclean,</I> this power was 
 exercised. There is also an ordinary power hereby conveyed to all 
 ministers, to preach the gospel as appointed officers; to tell people, 
 in God's name, and according to the scriptures, <I>what is good, and 
 what the Lord requires of them:</I> and they who <I>declare the whole 
 counsel of God,</I> use these keys well, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:27">Acts xx. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some make the giving of the keys to allude to the custom of the Jews in 
 creating a doctor of the law, which was to put into his hand the keys 
 of the chest where the book of the law was kept, denoting his being 
 authorized to take and read it; and <I>the binding and loosing,</I> to 
 allude to the fashion about their books, which were in rolls; they shut 
 them by binding them up with a string, which they untied when they 
 opened them. Christ gives his apostles power to shut or open the book 
 of the gospel to people, as the case required. See the exercise of this 
 power, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:46,18:6">Acts xiii. 46; xviii. 6</A>.

 When ministers preach pardon and peace to the penitent, wrath and the
 curse to the impenitent, in Christ's name, they act then pursuant to 
 this authority of binding and loosing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The key of <I>discipline,</I> which is but the application of the 
 former to particular persons, upon a right estimate of their characters 
 and actions. It is not legislative power that is hereby conferred, but 
 judicial; the judge doth not make the law, but only declares what is 
 law, and upon an impartial enquiry into the merits of the cause, gives 
 sentence accordingly. Such is <I>the power of the keys,</I> wherever it 
 is lodged, with reference to church-membership and the privileges 
 thereof. 

 [1.] Christ's ministers have a power to admit into the church; "<I>Go, 
 disciple all nations, baptizing them;</I> those who profess faith in 
 Christ, and obedience to him, admit them and their seed members of the 
 church by baptism." Ministers are to let in to <I>the wedding-feast 
 those that are bidden;</I> and to keep out such as are apparently unfit 
 for so holy a communion.

 [2.] They have a power to expel and cast out such as have forfeited 
 their church-membership, that is binding; refusing to unbelievers the 
 application of gospel promises and the seals of them; and declaring to 
 such as appear to be <I>in the gall of bitterness and bond of 
 iniquity,</I> that <I>they have no part or lot in the matter,</I> as 
 Peter did to Simon Magus, though he had been baptized; and this is a 
 binding over to the judgment of God.

 [3.] They have a power to restore and to receive in again, upon their 
 repentance, such as had been thrown out; to loose those whom they had 
 bound; declaring to them, that, if their repentance be sincere, the 
 promise of pardon belongs to them. The apostles had a miraculous gift 
 of <I>discerning spirits;</I> yet even <I>they</I> went by the rule of 
 outward appearances (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:21,1Co+5:1,2Co+2:7,1Ti+1:20">Acts viii. 21;
 1 Cor. v. 1; 2 Cor. ii. 7; 1 Tim. i. 20</A>),
 
 which ministers may still make a judgment upon, if they be skilful and 
 faithful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is the charge which Christ gave his disciples, to 
 keep this private for the present 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 <I>They must tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.</I> What they 
 had professed to him, they must not yet publish to the world, for 
 several reasons; 

 1. Because this was the time of preparation for his kingdom: the great 
 thing now preached, was, that <I>the kingdom of heaven was at hand;</I> 
 and therefore those things were now to be insisted on, which were 
 proper to make way for Christ; as the doctrine of repentance; not this 
 great truth, in and with which <I>the kingdom of heaven</I> was to be 
 actually set up. Every thing is beautiful in its season, and it is good 
 advice, <I>Prepare thy work, and afterwards build,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:27">Prov. xxiv. 27</A>.

 2. Christ would have his Messiahship proved by his works, and would
 rather <I>they</I> should testify of him than that his <I>disciples</I> 
 should, because their testimony was but as his own, which he insisted 
 not on. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:31,34">John v. 31, 34</A>.

 He was so secure of the demonstration of his miracles, that he waived
 other witnesses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:25,38">John x. 25, 38</A>.

 3. If they had known <I>that he was Jesus the Christ, they would not
 have crucified the Lord of glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8">1 Cor. ii. 8</A>.

 4. Christ would not have the apostles preach this, till they had the
 most convincing evidence ready to allege in confirmation of it. Great 
 truths may suffer damage by being asserted before they can be 
 sufficiently proved. Now the great proof of Jesus being the Christ was 
 his resurrection: by that <I>he was declared to be the Son of God, with 
 power;</I> and therefore the divine wisdom would not have this truth 
 preached, till that could be alleged for proof of it. 

 5. It was requisite that the preachers of so great a truth should be
 furnished with greater measures of the Spirit than the apostles as yet 
 had; therefore the open asserting of it was adjourned till the Spirit 
 should be poured out upon them. But when Christ was glorified and the 
 Spirit poured out, we find Peter proclaiming upon the house-tops what 
 was here spoken in a corner

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:36">Acts ii. 36</A>),

 <I>That God hath made this same Jesus both Lord and Christ;</I> for, as 
 there is a time to keep silence, so there is a time to speak.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Christ's discourse with his disciples concerning his own 
 sufferings; in which observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Christ's foretelling of his sufferings. Now he <I>began</I> to do 
 it, and from this time he frequently spake of them. Some hints he had 
 already given of his sufferings, as when he said, <I>Destroy this 
 temple:</I> when he spake of <I>the Son of man being lifted up,</I> and 
 of <I>eating his flesh, and drinking his blood:</I> but now he 
 <I>began</I> to show it, to speak plainly and expressly of it. Hitherto 
 he had not touched upon this, because the disciples were weak, and 
 could not well bear the notice of a thing so very strange, and so very 
 melancholy; but now that they were more ripe in knowledge, and strong 
 in faith, he began to tell them this. Note, Christ reveals his mind to 
 his people gradually, and lets in light as they can bear it, and are 
 fit to receive it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>From that time,</I> when they had made that full confession of 
 Christ, that he was the Son of God, then he began to show them this. 
 When he found them knowing in one truth, he taught them another; <I>for 
 to him that has, shall be given.</I> Let them first be established in 
 the principles of the doctrine of Christ, and then go on to perfection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:1">Heb. vi. 1</A>.

 If they had not been well grounded in the belief of Christ's being the
 Son of God, it would have been a great shaking to their faith. All 
 truths are not to be spoken to all persons at all times, but such as 
 are proper and suitable to their present state. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he foretold concerning his sufferings, the particulars and 
 circumstances of them, and all surprising.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The place where he should suffer. He must go to Jerusalem, the 
 head city, the holy city, and suffer there. Though he lived most of his 
 time in Galilee, he must die at Jerusalem; there all the sacrifices 
 were offered, there therefore <I>he</I> must die, <I>who is the great 
 sacrifice.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The persons by whom he should suffer; <I>the elders, and chief 
 priests, and scribes;</I> these made up the great sanhedrim, which sat 
 at Jerusalem, and was had in veneration by the people. Those that 
 should have been most forward in owning and admiring Christ, were the 
 most bitter in persecuting him. It was strange that men of knowledge in 
 the scripture, who professed to expect the Messiah's coming, and 
 pretended to have something sacred in their character, should use him 
 thus barbarously when he did come. It was the Roman power that 
 condemned and crucified Christ, but he lays it at the door of <I>the 
 chief priests and scribes,</I> who were the first movers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What he should suffer; <I>he must suffer many things, and be 
 killed.</I> His enemies' insatiable malice, and his own invincible 
 patience, appear in the variety and multiplicity of his sufferings (he 
 suffered many things) and in the extremity of them; nothing less than 
 his death would satisfy them, he must be killed. The suffering of many 
 things, if not unto death, is more tolerable; for while there is life, 
 there is hope; and death, without such prefaces, would be less 
 terrible; but <I>he must</I> first <I>suffer many things, and then be 
 killed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) What should be the happy issue of all his sufferings; he shall 
 <I>be raised again the third day.</I> As the prophets, so Christ 
 himself, when he testified beforehand his sufferings, testified withal 
 the glory that should follow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11">1 Pet. i. 11</A>.

 His rising again the third day proved him to be the Son of God,
 notwithstanding his sufferings; and therefore he mentions that, to keep 
 up their faith. When he spoke of the cross and the shame, he spoke in 
 the same breath of <I>the joy set before him,</I> in the prospect of 
 which <I>he endured the cross, and despised the shame.</I> Thus we must 
 look upon Christ's suffering for us, trace in it the way to his glory; 
 and thus we must look upon our suffering for Christ, look through it to 
 the recompence of reward. <I>If we suffer with him, we shall reign
 with him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Why he foretold his sufferings. 

 (1.) To show that they were the product of an eternal counsel and 
 consent; were agreed upon between the Father and the Son from eternity; 
 <I>Thus is behoved Christ to suffer.</I> The matter was settled in 
 <I>the determinate counsel and foreknowledge,</I> in pursuance of his 
 own voluntary susception and undertaking for our salvation; his 
 sufferings were no surprise to him, did not come upon him as a snare, 
 but he had a distinct and certain foresight of them, which greatly 
 magnifies his love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:4">John xviii. 4</A>.

 (2.) To rectify the mistakes which his disciples had imbibed concerning
 the external pomp and power of his kingdom. Believing him to be the 
 Messiah, they counted upon nothing but dignity and authority in the 
 world; but here Christ reads them another lesson, tells them of the 
 cross and sufferings; nay, that the chief priests and the elders, whom, 
 it is likely, they expected to be the supports of the Messiah's 
 kingdom, should be its great enemies and persecutors; this would give 
 them quite another idea of that kingdom which they themselves had 
 preached the approach of; and it was requisite that this mistake should 
 be rectified. Those that follow Christ must be dealt plainly with, and 
 warned not to expect great things in this world. 

 (3.) It was to prepare them for the share, at least, of sorrow and 
 fear, which they must have in his sufferings. When he suffered many 
 things, the disciples could not but suffer some; if their Master be 
 killed, they will be seized with terror; let them know it before, that 
 they may provide accordingly, and, being fore-<I>warned,</I> may be 
 fore-<I>armed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The offence which Peter took at this he said, <I>Be it far from 
 thee, Lord:</I> probably he spake the sense of the rest of the 
 disciples, as before, for he was chief speaker. <I>He took him, and 
 began to rebuke him.</I> Perhaps Peter was a little elevated with the 
 great things Christ had how said unto him, which made him more bold 
 with Christ than did become him; so hard is it to keep the spirit low 
 and humble in the midst of great advancements!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It did not become Peter to contradict his Master, or take upon him 
 to advise him; he might have wished, <I>that, if it were possible, this 
 cup might pass away,</I> without saying so peremptorily, <I>This shall 
 not be,</I> when Christ had said, <I>It must be. Shall any teach God 
 knowledge? He that reproveth God, let him answer it.</I> Note, When 
 God's dispensations are either intricate or cross to us, it becomes us 
 silently to acquiesce in, and not to prescribe to, the divine will; God 
 knows what he has to do, without our teaching. Unless we know the mind 
 of the Lord, it is not for us to be his counsellors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:34">Rom. xi. 34</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It savoured much of fleshly wisdom, for him to appear so warmly 
 against suffering, and to startle thus at the offence of the cross. It 
 is the corrupt part of us, that is thus solicitous to sleep in a whole 
 skin. We are apt to look upon sufferings as they relate to this present 
 life, to which they are uneasy; but there are other rules to measure 
 them by, which, if duly observed, will enable us cheerfully to bear 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:18">Rom. viii. 18</A>.

 See how passionately Peter speaks: "<I>Be it far from thee, Lord.</I>
 God forbid, that thou shouldst suffer and be killed; we cannot bear the 
 thoughts of it." <I>Master, spare thyself:</I> so it might be read; 
 <B><I>hileos soi, kyrie</I></B>--"<I>Be merciful to thyself,</I> and 
 then no one else can be cruel to thee; pity thyself, and then <I>this 
 shall not be to thee.</I>" He would have Christ to dread suffering as 
 much as he did; but we mistake, if we measure Christ's love and 
 patience by our own. He intimates, likewise, the improbability of the 
 thing, humanly speaking; "<I>This shall not be unto thee.</I> It is 
 impossible that one who hath so great an interest in the people as thou 
 hast, should be crushed by the elders, who fear the people: this can 
 never be; we that have followed thee, will fight for thee, if occasion 
 be; and there are thousands that will stand by us."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's displeasure against Peter for this suggestion of his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 We do not read of any thing said or done by any of his disciples, at 
 any time, that he resented so much as this, though they often 
 offended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. How he expressed his displeasure: He turned upon Peter, and (we may 
 suppose) with a frown said, <I>Get thee behind me, Satan.</I> He did 
 not so much as take time to deliberate upon it, but gave an immediate 
 reply to the temptation, which was such as made it to appear how ill he 
 took it. Just now, he had said, <I>Blessed art thou, Simon,</I> and had 
 even laid him in his bosom; but here, <I>Get thee behind me, Satan;</I> 
 and there was cause for both. Note, A good man may by a surprise of 
 temptation soon grow very unlike himself. He answered him as he did 
 Satan himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:10"><I>ch.</I> iv. 10</A>.

 Note,

 (1.) It is the subtlety of Satan, to send temptations to us by the
 unsuspected hands of our best and dearest friends. Thus he assaulted 
 Adam by Eve, Job by his wife, and here Christ by his beloved Peter. It 
 concerns us therefore not to be ignorant of his devices, but to stand 
 against his wiles and depths, by standing always upon our guard against 
 sin, whoever moves us to it. Even the kindnesses of our friends are
 often abused by Satan, and made use of as temptations to us. 

 (2.) Those who have their spiritual senses exercised, will be aware of 
 the voice of Satan, even in a friend, a disciple, a minister, that 
 dissuades them from their duty. We must not regard who speaks, so much 
 as what is spoken; we should learn to know the devil's voice when he 
 speaks in a saint as well as when he speaks in a serpent. Whoever takes 
 us off from that which is good, and would have us afraid of doing too 
 much for God, speaks Satan's language. 

 (3.) We must be free and faithful in reproving the dearest friend we 
 have, that saith or doth amiss, though it may be under colour of 
 kindness to us. We must not compliment, but rebuke, mistaken 
 courtesies. <I>Faithful are the wounds of a friend.</I> Such smitings
 must be accounted kindnesses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:5">Ps. cxli. 5</A>.

 (4.) Whatever appears to be a temptation to sin, must be resisted with 
 abhorrence, and not parleyed with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What was the ground of this displeasure; why did Christ thus resent 
 a motion that seemed not only harmless, but kind? Two reasons are 
 given:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Thou art an offence to me</I>--<B><I>Skandalon mou
 ei</I></B>--<I>Thou art my hindrance</I> (so it may be read); "thou
 standest in my way." Christ was hastening on in the work of our 
 salvation, and his heart was so much upon it, that he took it ill to be 
 hindered, or tempted to start back from the hardest and most 
 discouraging part of his undertaking. So strongly was he engaged for 
 our redemption, that they who but indirectly endeavoured to divert him 
 from it, touched him in a very tender and sensible part. Peter was not 
 so sharply reproved for disowning and denying his Master in his 
 sufferings as he was for dissuading him from them; though that was the 
 defect, this the excess, of kindness. It argues a very great firmness 
 and resolution of mind in any business, when it is <I>an offence</I> to 
 be dissuaded, and a man will not endure to hear any thing to the 
 contrary; like that of Ruth, <I>Entreat me not to leave thee.</I> Note, 
 Our Lord Jesus preferred our salvation before his own ease and safety; 
 for <I>even Christ pleased not himself</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:3">Rom. xv. 3</A>);

 he came into the world, not to spare himself, as Peter advised, but to 
 spend himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See why he called Peter <I>Satan,</I> when he suggested this to him; 
 because, whatever stood in the way of our salvation, he looked upon as 
 coming from the devil, who is a sworn enemy to it. The same Satan that 
 afterward entered into Judas, maliciously to destroy him in his 
 undertaking, here prompted Peter plausibly to divert him from it. Thus 
 <I>he changes himself into an angel of light.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thou art an offence to me. Note, 

 [1.] Those that engage in any great good work must expect to meet with 
 hindrance and opposition from friends and foes, from within and from 
 without.

 [2.] Those that obstruct our progress in any duty must be looked upon 
 as an offence to us. <I>Then</I> we do the will of God as Christ did, 
 <I>whose meat and drink it was to do it,</I> when it is a trouble to us 
 to be solicited from our duty. Those that hinder us from doing or 
 suffering for God, when we are called to it, whatever they are in other 
 things in that they are <I>Satans, adversaries</I> to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Thou savourest not the things that are of God, but those that 
 are of men.</I> Note, 

 [1.] <I>The things that are of God,</I> that is, the concerns of his 
 will and glory, often clash and interfere with <I>the things that are 
 of men,</I> that is, with our own wealth, pleasure, and reputation. 
 While we mind Christian duty as out way and work, and the divine favour 
 as our end and portion, we <I>savour the things of God;</I> but if 
 these be minded, the flesh must be denied, hazards must be run and 
 hardships borne; and here is the trial which of the two we savour.

 [2.] Those that inordinately fear, and industriously decline suffering 
 for Christ, when they are called to it, savour more of the things of 
 man than of the things of God; they relish those things more 
 themselves, and make it appear to others that they do so.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any <I>man</I> will come
 after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow
 me.
 &nbsp; 25  For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and
 whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
 &nbsp; 26  For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole
 world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ, having shown his disciples that <I>he</I> must suffer, and that 
 he was ready and willing to suffer, here shows them that <I>they</I> 
 must suffer too, and must be ready and willing. It is a weighty 
 discourse that we have in these verses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the law of discipleship laid down, and the terms fixed, upon 
 which we may have the honour and benefit of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He said this to his disciples, not only that they might instruct others 
 concerning it, but that by this rule they might examine their own 
 security. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What it is to be a disciple of Christ; it is to come after him. When 
 Christ called his disciples, this was the word of command, <I>Follow 
 me.</I> A true disciple of Christ is one that doth follow him in duty, 
 and shall follow him to glory. He is one that comes after Christ, not 
 one that prescribes to him, as Peter now undertook to do, forgetting 
 his place. A disciple of Christ comes after him, as the sheep after the 
 shepherd, the servant after his master, the soldiers after their 
 captain; he is one that aims at the same end that Christ aimed at, the 
 glory of God, and the glory of heaven: and one that walks in the same 
 way that he walked in, is led by his Spirit, treads in his steps, 
 submits to his conduct, and <I>follows the Lamb, whithersoever he 
 goes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:4">Rev. xiv. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What are the great things required of those that will be Christ's 
 disciples; <I>If any man will come,</I> <B><I>ei tis 
 thelei</I></B>--<I>If any man be willing</I> to come. It denotes a
 deliberate choice, and cheerfulness and resolution in that choice. Many 
 are disciples more by chance or the will of others than by any act of 
 their own will; but Christ will have his people volunteers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.
 
 It is as if Christ had said, "If any of the people that are not my
 disciples, be steadfastly minded to come to me, and if you that are, be 
 in like manner minded to adhere to me, it is upon these terms, these 
 and no other; you must <I>follow me</I> in sufferings as well as in 
 other things, and therefore when you sit down to count the cost, reckon 
 upon it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now what are these terms?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>Let him deny himself.</I> Peter had advised Christ to spare 
 himself, and would be ready, in the like case, to take the advice; but 
 Christ tells them all, they must be so far from <I>sparing</I> 
 themselves, that they must <I>deny</I> themselves. Herein they must
 come after Christ, for his birth, and life, and death, were all a 
 continued act of self-denial, a self-emptying, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:7,8">Phil. ii. 7, 8</A>.

 If self-denial be a hard lesson, and against the grain to flesh and
 blood, it is no more than what our Master learned and practised before 
 us and for us, both for our redemption and for our instruction; and 
 <I>the servant is not above his lord.</I> Note, All the disciples and 
 followers of Jesus Christ must deny themselves. It is the fundamental 
 law of admission into Christ's school, and the first and great lesson 
 to be learned in this school, to deny ourselves; it is both the 
 <I>strait</I> gate, and the <I>narrow</I> way; it is necessary in order 
 to our learning all the other good lessons that are there taught. We
 must deny ourselves absolutely, we must not admire our own shadow, nor 
 gratify our own humour; we must not lean to our own understanding, nor 
 seek our own things, nor be our own end. We must deny ourselves 
 comparatively; we must deny ourselves for Christ, and his will and 
 glory, and the service of his interest in the world; we must deny 
 ourselves for our brethren, and for their good; and we must deny 
 ourselves for ourselves, deny the appetites of the body for the benefit 
 of the soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>Let him take up his cross.</I> The cross is here put for all 
 sufferings, as men or Christians; providential afflictions, 
 persecutions for righteousness' sake, every trouble that befals us, 
 either for doing well or for not doing ill. The troubles of Christians 
 are fitly called <I>crosses,</I> in allusion to the death of the cross, 
 which Christ was obedient to; and it should reconcile us to troubles, 
 and take off the terror of them, that they are what we bear in common 
 with Christ, and such as he hath borne before us. Note, 

 [1.] Every disciple of Christ hath his cross, and must count upon it; 
 as each hath his special duty to be done, so each hath his special 
 trouble to be borne, and every one feels most from his own burthen. 
 Crosses are the common lot of God's children, but of this common lot of 
 God's children, but of this common lot each hath his particular share. 
 That is our cross which Infinite Wisdom has appointed for us, and a 
 Sovereign Providence has laid on us, as fittest for us. It is good for 
 us to call the cross we are under <I>our own,</I> and entertain it 
 accordingly. We are apt to think we could bear such a one's cross 
 better than our own; but that is best which is, and we ought to make 
 the best of it.

 [2.] Every disciple of Christ must take up that which the wise God hath 
 made his cross. It is an allusion to the Roman custom of compelling 
 those that were condemned to be crucified, to carry their cross: when 
 Simon carried Christ's cross after him, this phrase was illustrated.
 <I>First,</I> It is supposed that the cross lies in our way, and is 
 prepared for us. We must not make crosses to ourselves, but must 
 accommodate ourselves to those which God has made for us. Our rule is, 
 not to go a step out of the way of duty, either to meet a cross, or to 
 miss one. We must not by our rashness and indiscretion pull crosses 
 down upon our own heads, but must take them up when they are laid in 
 our way. We must so manage an affliction, that it may not be a 
 stumbling-block or hindrance to us in any service we have to do for 
 God. We must take it up out of our way, by getting over <I>the offence 
 of the cross; None of these things move me;</I> and we must then go on 
 with it in our way, though it lie heavy. <I>Secondly,</I> That which we 
 have to do, is, not only to bear the cross (that a stock, or a stone, 
 or a stick may do), not only to be silent under it, but we must <I>take 
 up</I> the cross, must improve it to some good advantage. We should not 
 say, "This is an evil, and I must bear it, because I cannot help it;" 
 but, "This is an evil, and I will bear it, because it shall work for my 
 good." When we <I>rejoice in our afflictions, and glory in them,</I> 
 then we take up the cross. This fitly follows upon denying ourselves; 
 for he that will not deny himself the pleasures of sin, and the 
 advantages of this world for Christ, when it comes to the push, will 
 never have the heart to take up his cross. "He that cannot take up the 
 resolution to live a saint, has a demonstration within himself, that he 
 is never likely to die a martyr;" so Archbishop Tillotson.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) <I>Let him follow me,</I> in this particular of taking up the 
 cross. Suffering saints must look unto Jesus, and take from him both 
 direction and encouragement in suffering. Do we bear the cross? We 
 therein follow Christ, who bears it <I>before</I> us, bears it 
 <I>for</I> us, and so bears it <I>from</I> us. He bore the heavy end of 
 the cross, the end that had the curse upon it, that was a heavy end, 
 and so made the other light and easy for us. Or, we may take it in 
 general, we must follow Christ in all instances of holiness and 
 obedience. Note, The disciples of Christ must study to imitate their 
 Master, and conform themselves in every thing to his example, and 
 continue in well-doing, whatever crosses lie in their way. To do well 
 and to suffer ill, is to follow Christ. <I>If any man will come after 
 me, let him follow me;</I> that seems to be <I>idem per idem--the same
 thing over again.</I> What is the difference? Surely it is this, "<I>If 
 any man will come after me,</I> in profession, and so have the name and 
 credit of a disciple, <I>let him follow me in truth,</I> and so do the 
 work and duty of a disciple." Or thus, "<I>If any man will set out 
 after me,</I> in good beginnings, <I>let him</I> continue to <I>follow 
 me</I> with all perseverance." That is <I>following the Lord fully,</I> 
 as Caleb did. Those that come after Christ, must follow after him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are arguments to persuade us to submit to these laws, and come 
 up to these terms. Self-denial, and patient suffering, are hard 
 lessons, which will never be learned if we consult with flesh and 
 blood; let us therefore consult with our Lord Jesus, and see what 
 advice he gives us; and here he gives us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Some considerations proper to engage us to these duties of 
 self-denial and suffering for Christ. Consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The weight of that eternity which depends upon our present choice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 <I>Whosoever will save his life,</I> by denying Christ, <I>shall lose 
 it: and whosoever</I> is content to <I>lose his life,</I> for owning 
 Christ, <I>shall find it.</I> Here are <I>life and death, good and 
 evil, the blessing and the curse, set before us.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The misery that attends the most plausible apostasy. <I>Whosoever 
 will save his life</I> in this world, if it be by sin, he <I>shall lose 
 it</I> in another; he that forsakes Christ, to preserve a temporal life 
 and avoid a temporal death, will certainly come short of eternal life, 
 and will be hurt of the second death, and eternally held by it. There 
 cannot be a fairer pretence for apostasy and iniquity than saving the 
 life by it, so cogent is the law of self-preservation; and yet even 
 that is folly, for it will prove in the end self-destruction; the life 
 saved is but for a moment, the death shunned is but as a sleep; but the 
 life lost is everlasting, and the death run upon is the depth and 
 complement of all misery, and an endless separation from all good. Now, 
 let any rational man consider of it, take advice and speak his mind, 
 whether there is any thing got, at long run, by apostasy, though a man 
 save his estate, preferment, or life, by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The advantage that attends the most perilous and expensive 
 constancy; <I>Whosoever will lose his life for Christ's sake</I> in 
 this world, <I>shall find it</I> in a better, infinitely to his 
 advantage. Note, <I>First,</I> Many a life is lost, for Christ's sake, 
 in doing his work, by labouring fervently for his name; in suffering 
 work, by choosing rather to die than to deny him or his truths and 
 ways. Christ's holy religion is handed down to us, sealed with the 
 blood of thousands, that have <I>not known their own souls,</I> but 
 have <I>despised their lives</I> (as Job speaks in another case), 
 though very valuable ones, when they have stood in competition with 
 their duty and <I>the testimony of Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:4">Rev. xx. 4</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Though many have been losers for Christ, even of life 
 itself, yet never any one was, or will be, a loser by him in the end. 
 The loss of other comforts, for Christ, may possibly be made up in this 
 world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:30">Mark x. 30</A>);

 the loss of life cannot, but it shall be made up in the other world, in 
 an eternal life; the believing prospect of which hath been the great 
 support of suffering saints in all ages. An assurance of the life they 
 should find, in lieu of the life they hazarded, hath enabled them to 
 triumph over death in all its terrors; to go smiling to a scaffold, and 
 stand singing at a stake, and to call the utmost instances of their 
 enemies' rage but <I>a light affliction.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The worth of the soul which lies at stake, and the worthlessness 
 of the world in comparison of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>).

 <I>What is a man profited, if he gain the whole world and lose his own 
 soul?</I> <B><I>ten psychen autou</I></B>; the same word which is 
 translated <I>his life</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 for the <I>soul</I> is the <I>life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:7">Gen. ii. 7</A>.

 This alludes to that common principle, that, whatever a man gets, if he
 lose his life, it will do him no good, he cannot enjoy his gains. But 
 it looks higher, and speaks of the soul as immortal, and a loss of it 
 beyond death, which cannot be compensated by the gain of the whole 
 world. Note, <I>First,</I> Every man has a soul of his own. The soul is 
 the spiritual and immortal part of man, which thinks and reasons, has a 
 power of reflection and prospect, which actuates the body now, and will 
 shortly act in a separation from the body. Our souls are our own not in 
 respect of dominion and property (for we are not our <I>own, All souls 
 are mine,</I> saith God), but in respect of nearness and concern; our 
 souls are our own, for they are ourselves. <I>Secondly,</I> It is 
 possible for the soul to be lost, and there is danger of it. The soul 
 is lost when it is eternally separated from all the good to all the 
 evil that a soul is capable of; when it dies as far as a soul can die; 
 when it is separated from the favour of God, and sunk under his wrath 
 and curse. A man is never undone till he is in hell. <I>Thirdly,</I> If 
 the soul be lost, it is of the sinner's own losing. The <I>man loses 
 his own soul,</I> for he does that which is certainly destroying to it, 
 and neglects that which alone would be saving, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:9">Hos. xiii. 9</A>.

 The sinner dies because he will die; <I>his blood is on his own head.
 Fourthly,</I> One soul is worth more than all the world; our own souls 
 are of greater value to us than all the wealth, honour, and pleasures 
 of this present time, if we had them. Here is <I>the whole world</I> 
 set in the scale against <I>one soul,</I> and <I>Tekel</I> written upon 
 it; it is weighed in the balance, and found too light to weigh it down.
 This is Christ's judgment upon the matter, and he is a competent Judge; 
 he had reason to know the price of <I>souls,</I> for he redeemed them; 
 nor would he under-rate the world, for he made it. <I>Fifthly,</I> The 
 winning of the world is often the losing of the soul. Many a one has 
 ruined his eternal interest by his preposterous and inordinate care to 
 secure and advance his temporal ones. It is <I>the love of the 
 world,</I> and the eager pursuit of it, <I>that drowns men in 
 destruction and perdition. Sixthly,</I> The loss of the soul is so 
 great a loss, that the gain of the whole world will not countervail it, 
 or make it up. He that loses his soul, though it be to gain the world, 
 makes a very bad bargain for himself, and will sit down at last an 
 unspeakable loser. When he comes to balance the account, and to compare 
 profit and loss, he will find that, instead of the advantage he 
 promised himself, he is ruined to all intents and purposes, is 
 irreparably broken.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</I> Note, If once 
 the soul be lost, it is lost for ever. There is no 
 <B><I>antallagma</I></B>--<I>counter-price,</I> that can be paid, or
 will be accepted. It is a loss that can never be repaired, never be 
 retrieved. If, after that great price which Christ laid down to redeem 
 our souls, and to restore us to the possession of them, they be so 
 neglected for the world, that they come to be lost, that new mortgage 
 will never be taken off; there remains no more sacrifice for sins, nor 
 price for souls, but the equity of redemption is eternally precluded. 
 Therefore it is good to be wise in time, and do well for ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here are some considerations proper to encourage us in self-denial 
 and suffering for Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The assurance we have of Christ's glory, at his second coming to 
 judge the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 If we look to the end of all these things, the period of the world, and 
 the posture of souls then, we shall thence form a very different idea 
 of the present state of things. If we see things as the <I>will</I> 
 appear then, we shall see them as they <I>should</I> appear now.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The great encouragement to steadfastness in religion is taken from the 
 second coming of Christ, considering it,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] As his honour; <I>The Son of man shall come in the glory of his 
 Father, with his angels.</I> To look upon Christ in his state of 
 humiliation, so abased, so abused, <I>a reproach of men, and despised 
 of the people,</I> would discourage his followers from taking any 
 pains, or running any hazards for him; but with an eye of faith to see 
 the Captain of our salvation coming in his glory, in all the pomp and 
 power of the upper world, will animate us, and make us think nothing 
 too much to do, or too hard to suffer, or him. <I>The Son of man shall 
 come.</I> He here gives himself the title of his humble state (he is 
 the <I>Son of man</I>), to show that he is not ashamed to own it. His 
 first coming was in the meanness of his children, who being partakers 
 of flesh, he took part of the same; but his second coming will be in 
 the glory of his Father. At his first coming, he was attended with poor 
 disciples; at his second coming, he will be attended with glorious 
 angels; and <I>if we suffer with him, we shall be glorified with 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:12">2 Tim. ii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] As our concern; <I>Then he shall reward every man according to his 
 works.</I> Observe, <I>First,</I> Jesus Christ will come as a Judge, to 
 dispense rewards and punishments, infinitely exceeding the greatest 
 that any earthly potentate has the dispensing of. The terror of men's 
 tribunal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:18"><I>ch.</I> x. 18</A>)

 will be taken off by a believing prospect of the glory of Christ's
 tribunal. <I>Secondly,</I> Men will then be rewarded, not according to 
 their gains in this world, but according to their works, according to 
 what they were and did. In that day, the treachery of backsliders will 
 be punished with eternal destruction, and the constancy of faithful 
 souls recompensed with a crown of life. <I>Thirdly,</I> The best
 preparative for that day is to <I>deny ourselves, and take up our 
 cross, and follow Christ;</I> for so we shall make the Judge our 
 Friend, and these things will then pass well in the account. 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> The rewarding of men according to their works is 
 deferred till that day. Here good and evil seem to be dispensed 
 promiscuously; we see not apostasy punished with immediate strokes, nor 
 fidelity encouraged with immediate smiles, from heaven; but in that day 
 all will be set to rights. Therefore <I>judge nothing before the 
 time,</I>

 (2.) The near approach of his kingdom in this world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 It was so near, that there were some attending him who should live to 
 see it. As Simeon was assured that he should not see death till he had 
 seen the Lord's Christ come in the flesh; so some here are assured that 
 they shall not taste death (death is a sensible thing, its terrors are 
 seen, its bitterness is tasted) till they had seen the Lord's Christ 
 coming in his kingdom. At the end of time, he shall come in his 
 Father's glory; but now, in the fulness of time, he was to come in his 
 own kingdom, his mediatorial kingdom. Some little specimen was given of 
 his glory a few days after this, in his transfiguration

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:1"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 1</A>);

 then he tried his robes. But this points at Christ's coming by the
 pouring out of his Spirit, the planting of the gospel church, the 
 destruction of Jerusalem, and the taking away of the place and nation 
 of the Jews, who were the most bitter enemies to Christianity. Here was 
 <I>the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</I> Many then present lived to 
 see it, particularly John, who lived till after the destruction of 
 Jerusalem, and saw Christianity planted in the world. Let <I>this</I> 
 encourage the followers of Christ to suffer for him, 

 [1.] That their undertaking shall be succeeded; the apostles were 
 employed in setting up Christ's kingdom; let them know, for their 
 comfort, that whatever opposition they meet with, yet they shall carry 
 their point, shall <I>see of the travail of their soul.</I> Note, It is 
 a great encouragement to suffering saints to be assured, not only of 
 the safety, but of the advancement of Christ's kingdom among men; not 
 only <I>notwithstanding</I> their sufferings, but <I>by</I> their 
 sufferings. A believing prospect of the success of the kingdom of 
 grace, as well as of our share in the kingdom of glory, may carry us 
 cheerfully through our sufferings.

 [2.] That their cause shall be pleaded; their deaths shall be revenged, 
 and their persecutors reckoned with.

 [3.] That this shall be done shortly, in the present age. Note, The
 nearer the church's deliverances are, the more cheerful should we be in 
 our sufferings for Christ. <I>Behold the Judge standeth before the 
 door.</I> It is spoken as a favour to those that should survive the 
 present cloudy time, that they should see better days. Note, It is 
 desirable to share with the church in her joys, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:12">Dan. xii. 12</A>.

 Observe, Christ saith, <I>Some</I> shall live to see those glorious 
 days, not <I>all;</I> some shall enter into the promised land, but 
 others shall fall in the wilderness. He does not tell them <I>who</I> 
 shall live to see this kingdom, lest if they had known, they should 
 have put off the thoughts of dying, but <I>some</I> of them shall; 
 <I>Behold, the Lord is at hand. The Judge standeth before the door; be 
 patient, therefore, brethren.</I></P>
