 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We left Christ newly baptized, and owned by a voice from heaven and the 
 descent of the Holy Ghost upon him. Now, in this chapter, we have, 

 I. A further preparation of him for his public ministry by his being
 tempted in the wilderness, of which we had the same account before in 
 Matthew as we have here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:1-13">ver. 1-13</A>.

 II. His entrance upon his public work in Galilee

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>),

 particularly,

 1. At Nazareth, the city where he had been bred up

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:16-30">ver. 16-30</A>),

 which we had no account of before in Matthew. 

 2. At Capernaum, where, having preached to admiration
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:31-32">ver. 31-32</A>),

 he cast the devil out of a man that was possessed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:33-37">ver. 33-37</A>),

 cured Peter's mother-in-law of a fever 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:38,39">ver. 38, 39</A>),

 and many others that were sick and possessed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:40,41">ver. 40, 41</A>),

 and then went and did the same in other cities of Galilee,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan,
 and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
 &nbsp; 2 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he
 did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.
 &nbsp; 3 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God,
 command this stone that it be made bread.
 &nbsp; 4 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall
 not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.
 &nbsp; 5 And the devil, taking him up into a high mountain, showed
 unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
 &nbsp; 6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee,
 and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to
 whomsoever I will I give it.
 &nbsp; 7 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
 &nbsp; 8 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me,
 Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,
 and him only shalt thou serve.
 &nbsp; 9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of
 the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast
 thyself down from hence:
 &nbsp; 10 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over
 thee, to keep thee:
 &nbsp; 11 And in <I>their</I> hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any
 time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
 &nbsp; 12 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt
 not tempt the Lord thy God.
 &nbsp; 13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed
 from him for a season.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The last words of the foregoing chapter, that Jesus was the <I>Son of 
 Adam,</I> bespeak him to be the <I>seed of the woman;</I> being so, we 
 have here, according to the promise, <I>breaking the serpent's 
 head,</I> baffling and foiling the devil in all his temptations, who by 
 one temptation had baffled and foiled our first parents. Thus, in the 
 beginning of the war, he made reprisals upon him, and conquered the 
 conqueror.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this story of Christ's temptation, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he was <I>prepared</I> and <I>fitted</I> for it. He that 
 designed him the trial furnished him accordingly; for though we know 
 not what exercises may be before us, nor what encounters we may be 
 reserved for, Christ did, and was provided accordingly; and God doth 
 for us, and we hope will provide accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was <I>full of the Holy Ghost,</I> who had <I>descended on him 
 like a dove.</I> He had now greater measures of the gifts, graces, and 
 comforts, of the Holy Ghost than ever before. Note, Those are well 
 armed against the strongest temptations that are <I>full of the Holy 
 Ghost.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was newly <I>returned from Jordan,</I> where he was baptized, and 
 owned by a voice from heaven to be the beloved Son of God; and thus he 
 was <I>prepared</I> for this combat. Note, When we have had the most 
 comfortable communion with God, and the clearest discoveries of his 
 favour to us, we may expect that Satan will set upon us (the richest 
 ship is the pirate's prize), and that God will suffer him to do so, 
 that the power of his grace may be manifested and magnified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He was <I>led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</I> by the good 
 Spirit, who led him as a champion into the field, to fight the enemy 
 that he was sure to conquer. His being <I>led into the wilderness,</I> 
 
 (1.) <I>Gave</I> some advantage to the tempter; for there he had him
 alone, no friend with him, by whose prayers and advice he might be 
 assisted in the hour of temptation. <I>Woe to him that is alone! He 
 might</I> give Satan advantage, who knew his own strength; <I>we may 
 not,</I> who know our own weakness. 

 (2.) He <I>gained</I> some advantage to himself, during his forty days' 
 fasting in the wilderness. We may suppose that he was wholly taken up
 in proper meditation, and in consideration of his own undertaking, and 
 the work he had before him; that he spent all his time in immediate, 
 intimate, converse with his Father, as Moses in the mount, without any 
 diversion, distraction, or interruption. Of all the days of Christ's 
 life in the flesh, these seem to come nearest to the angelic perfection 
 and the heavenly life, and this prepared him for Satan's assaults, and 
 hereby he was fortified against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He continued fasting 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>In those days he did eat nothing.</I> This fast was altogether 
 miraculous, like those of Moses and Elijah, and shows him to be, like 
 them, a prophet <I>sent of God.</I> It is probable that it was in the 
 wilderness of Horeb, the same wilderness in which Moses and Elijah 
 fasted. As by retiring into the <I>wilderness</I> he showed himself 
 perfectly indifferent to the <I>world,</I> so by his <I>fasting</I> he 
 showed himself perfectly indifferent to the <I>body;</I> and Satan 
 cannot easily take hold of those who are thus loosened from, and dead 
 to, the <I>world</I> and the <I>flesh.</I> The more we <I>keep under 
 the body,</I> and bring it into subjection, the less advantage Satan 
 has against us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he was assaulted by one temptation after another, and how he 
 defeated the design of the tempter in every assault, and became more 
 than a conqueror. During the <I>forty days,</I> he was <I>tempted of 
 the devil</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 not by an inward suggestion, for the prince of this world had nothing 
 in Christ by which to inject any such, but by outward solicitations, 
 perhaps in the likeness of a serpent, as he tempted our first parents. 
 But at the end of the forty days he came nearer to him, and did as it 
 were close with him, when he perceived <I>that he was hungry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Probably, our Lord Jesus then began to look about among the trees, to
 see if he could find any thing that was eatable, whence the devil took 
 occasion to make the following proposal to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He tempted him to <I>distrust his Father's</I> care of him, and to 
 <I>set up for himself,</I> and shift for provision for himself in such 
 a way as his Father had not appointed for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>If thou be the Son of God,</I> as the voice from heaven declared, 
 <I>command this stone to be made bread.</I> 

 (1.) "I counsel thee to do it; for God, if he be thy Father, has
 forgotten thee, and it will be long enough ere he sends either ravens 
 or angels to feed thee." If we begin to think of being our own carvers, 
 and of living by our own forecast, without depending upon divine 
 providence, of getting wealth <I>by our might and the power of our 
 hands,</I> we must look upon it as a temptation of Satan's, and reject 
 it accordingly; it is Satan's counsel to think of an independence upon 
 God. 

 (2.) "I <I>challenge</I> thee to do it, if thou canst; if thou dost not 
 do it, I will say thou art <I>not the Son of God;</I> for John Baptist 
 said lately, <I>God is able of stones to raise up children to 
 Abraham,</I> which is the greater; thou therefore hast not the power of 
 the <I>Son of God,</I> if thou dost not <I>of stones make bread</I> for 
 thyself, when thou needest it, which is the less." Thus was God himself 
 tempted in the wilderness: <I>Can he furnish a table? Can he give
 bread?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:19,20">Ps. lxxxviii. 19, 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 [1.] Christ yielded not to the temptation; he would not <I>turn</I> 
 that <I>stone</I> into <I>bread;</I> no, though he was hungry; 
 <I>First,</I> Because he would not do what Satan bade him do, for that 
 would have looked as if there had been indeed a compact between him and 
 the prince of the devils. Note, We must not do any thing that looks 
 like <I>giving place to the devil.</I> Miracles were wrought for the 
 confirming of faith, and the devil had no faith to be confirmed, and 
 therefore he would not do it <I>for him.</I> He did his signs <I>in the 
 presence of his disciples</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:30">John xx. 30</A>),

 and particularly the <I>beginning of his miracles,</I> turning water 
 into wine, which he did, that his disciples might believe on him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:11">John ii. 11</A>);

 but here in the wilderness he had no disciples with him.
 <I>Secondly,</I> He wrought miracles for the ratification of his 
 doctrine, and therefore till he began to <I>preach</I> he would not 
 begin to work miracles. <I>Thirdly,</I> He would not work miracles
 <I>for himself</I> and his own supply, lest he should seem impatient of 
 <I>hunger,</I> whereas he came not to <I>please himself,</I> but to 
 <I>suffer grief,</I> and that grief among others; and because he would 
 show that he <I>pleased not himself,</I> he would rather turn <I>water 
 into wine,</I> for the credit and convenience of his friends, than 
 <I>stones into bread,</I> for his own <I>necessary supply.
 Fourthly,</I> He would reserve the proof of his being the Son of God 
 for hereafter, and would rather be upbraided by Satan with being weak, 
 and not able to do it, than be persuaded by Satan to do that which it 
 was fit for him to do; thus he was upbraided by his enemies as if he 
 could not <I>save himself,</I> and <I>come down from the cross,</I> 
 when he could have come down, but would not, because it was not fit 
 that he should. <I>Fifthly,</I> He would not do any thing that looked 
 like distrust of his Father, or <I>acting separately</I> from him, or 
 any thing disagreeable to his present state. Being in all things 
 <I>made like unto his brethren,</I> he would, like the other children 
 of God, live in a dependence upon the divine Providence and promise, 
 and trust him either to send him a supply into the wilderness or to 
 <I>lead him to a city of habitation</I> where there was a supply, as he 
 used to do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:5-7">Ps. cvii. 5-7</A>),

 and in the mean time would <I>support</I> him, though he was hungry, as 
 he had done these forty days past.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He returned a scripture-answer to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>It is written.</I> This is the first word recorded as spoken by 
 Christ after his instalment in his prophetical office; and it is a 
 quotation out of the Old Testament, to show that he came to assert and 
 maintain the authority of the scripture as uncontrollable, even by 
 Satan himself. And though he had the Spirit without measure, and had a
 doctrine of his own to preach and a religion to found, yet it agreed 
 with Moses and the prophets, whose writings he therefore lays down as a 
 rule to himself, and recommends to us as a reply to Satan and his 
 temptations. The word of God is our <I>sword,</I> and faith in that 
 word is our <I>shield;</I> we should therefore be <I>mighty in the 
 scriptures,</I> and <I>go in that might,</I> go forth, and go on, in 
 our spiritual warfare, know <I>what is written,</I> for it is <I>for 
 our learning,</I> for <I>our use.</I> The text of scripture he makes 
 use of is quoted from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:3">Deut. viii. 3</A>:

 "<I>Man shall not live by bread alone.</I> I need not turn the stone
 into bread, for God can send <I>manna</I> for my nourishment, as he did 
 for Israel; man can live <I>by every word of God,</I> by whatever God 
 will appoint that he shall live by." How had Christ lived, lived 
 comfortably, these last forty days? Not <I>by bread,</I> but by the 
 <I>word of God,</I> by meditation upon that word, and communion with 
 it, and with God in and by it; and in like manner he could <I>live 
 yet,</I> though now he began to be <I>hungry.</I> God has many ways of 
 providing for his people, without the ordinary means of subsistence; 
 and therefore he is not at any time to be distrusted, but at all times 
 to be depended upon, in the way of duty. If meat be wanting, God can 
 take away the appetite, or give such degrees of patience as will enable 
 a man even to <I>laugh at destruction and famine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:22">Job v. 22</A>),

 or make <I>pulse and water</I> more nourishing than <I>all the portion 
 of the king's meat</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:12,13">Dan. i. 12, 13</A>),

 and enable his people to <I>rejoice in the Lord,</I> when the
 <I>fig-tree doth not blossom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:17">Hab. iii. 17</A>.

 She was an active believer who said that she had made many a meal's 
 meat of the promises when she wanted bread.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He tempted him to <I>accept from him</I> the kingdom, which, as the 
 <I>Son of God,</I> he expected to receive from <I>his Father,</I> and 
 to <I>do him homage</I> for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 This evangelist puts this temptation second, which Matthew had put
 last, and which, it should seem, was really the last; but Luke was full 
 of it, as the blackest and most violent, and therefore hastened to it. 
 In the devil's tempting of our first parents, he presented to them the 
 forbidden fruit, first as <I>good for food,</I> and then as <I>pleasant 
 to the eyes;</I> and they were overpowered by both these charms. Satan 
 here first tempted Christ to turn the stones into bread, which would be 
 good for food, and then showed him the kingdoms of the world and the 
 glory of them, which were <I>pleasant to the eyes;</I> but in both 
 these he overpowered Satan, and perhaps with an eye to that, Luke 
 changes the order. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How Satan <I>managed</I> this temptation, to prevail with Christ 
 to become a tributary to him, and to receive his kingdom by delegation 
 from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He gave him a prospect of <I>all the kingdoms of the world in a 
 moment of time,</I> an airy representation of them, such as he thought 
 most likely to strike the fancy, and seem a <I>real</I> prospect. To 
 succeed the better, he <I>took him up</I> for this purpose <I>into a 
 high mountain;</I> and, because we next after the temptation find 
 Christ on the other side Jordan, some think it probable that it was to 
 the top of Pisgah that the devil took him, whence Moses has a sight of 
 Canaan. That it was but a phantasm that the devil here presented our 
 Saviour with, as the prince of the power of the air, is confirmed by 
 that circumstance which Luke here takes notice of, that it was done 
 <I>in a moment of time;</I> whereas, if a man take a prospect of but 
 one country, he must do it successively, must turn himself round, and 
 take a view first of one part and then of another. Thus the devil 
 thought to impose upon our Saviour with a fallacy--<I>a deceptio
 visus;</I> and, by making him believe that he could <I>show him all the 
 kingdoms of</I> the world, would draw him into an opinion that he could 
 <I>give him</I> all those kingdoms.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He boldly alleged that these kingdoms were <I>all delivered to 
 him</I> that he had power to dispose of them and all their 
 <I>glory,</I> and to give them to <I>whomsoever he would,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Some think that herein he pretended to be an angel of light, and that,
 as one of the angels that was set over the kingdoms, he had out-bought, 
 or out-fought, all the rest, and so was <I>entrusted</I> with the 
 disposal of them all, and, in God's name, would give them to him, 
 knowing they were designed for him; but clogged with this condition, 
 that he should <I>fall down and worship him,</I> which a good angel 
 would have been so far from demanding that he would not have admitted 
 it, no, not upon showing much greater things than these, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:10,22:9">Rev. xix. 10; xxii. 9</A>.

 But I rather take it that he claimed this power as Satan, and as 
 <I>delivered to him</I> not by <I>the Lord,</I> but by the kings and 
 people of these kingdoms, who gave their power and honour to the devil,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:2">Eph. ii. 2</A>.

 Hence he is called the <I>god of this world,</I> and the <I>prince of
 this world.</I> It was promised to the Son of God that he should have 
 <I>the heathen for his inheritance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8">Ps. ii. 8</A>.

 "Why," saith the devil, "the heathen are <I>mine,</I> are my subjects
 and votaries; but, however, they shall be thine, I will give them 
 <I>thee,</I> upon condition that thou <I>worship me</I> for them, and 
 say that they are the <I>rewards which I have given thee,</I> as others 
 have done before <I>thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hos+2:12">Hos. ii. 12</A>),

 and consent to have and <I>hold them by, from, and under, me.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] He demanded of him homage and adoration: <I>If thou wilt worship 
 me, all shall be thine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 <I>First,</I> He would have him worship him himself. Perhaps he does
 not mean so as never to worship God, but let him worship him in 
 conjunction with God; for the devil knows, if he can but once come in a 
 partner, he shall soon be sole proprietor. <I>Secondly,</I> He would 
 indent with him, that when, according to the promise made to him, he 
 had got possession of the kingdoms of this world, he should make no 
 alteration of religions in them, but permit and suffer the nations, as 
 they had done hitherto, to <I>sacrifice to devils</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:20">1 Cor. x. 20</A>);

 that he should still keep up <I>demon-worship</I> in the world, and 
 then let him take all the power and glory of the kingdoms if he 
 pleased. Let who will take the wealth and grandeur of this earth, Satan 
 has all he would have if he can but have men's hearts, and affections, 
 and adorations, can but <I>work in the children of</I> disobedience; 
 for then he effectually <I>devours them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How our Lord Jesus <I>triumphed</I> over this temptation. He gave 
 it a peremptory repulse, rejected it with abhorrence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Get thee behind me, Satan,</I> I cannot bear the mention of it. 
 What! worship the enemy of God whom I came to serve? and of man whom
 I came to save? No, I will never do it." Such a temptation as this was 
 not to be <I>reasoned with,</I> but immediately refused; it was 
 presently knocked on the head with one word, <I>It is written, Thou 
 shalt worship the Lord thy God;</I> and not only so, but <I>him 
 only,</I> him and <I>no other.</I> And therefore Christ will not 
 worship Satan, nor, when he has the <I>kingdoms of the world 
 delivered</I> to him by his Father, as he expects shortly to have, will 
 he suffer any remains of the worship of the devil to continue in them. 
 No, it shall be perfectly rooted out and abolished, wherever his gospel 
 comes. He will make no composition with him. <I>Polytheism</I> and 
 <I>idolatry</I> must go down, as Christ's kingdom gets up. Men must be 
 <I>turned from the power of Satan unto God,</I> from the worship of 
 devils to the worship of the only living and true God. This is the 
 great divine law that Christ will re-establish among men, and by his 
 holy religion reduce men to the obedience of, <I>That God only is to be 
 served and worshipped;</I> and therefore whoever set up any creature as 
 the object of religious worship, though it were a saint or an angel, or 
 the virgin Mary herself, they directly thwart Christ's design, and 
 relapse into heathenism.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He tempted him to be his own murderer, in a presumptuous confidence 
 of his Father's protection, such as he had no warrant for.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What he designed in this temptation: <I>If thou be the Son of God, 
 cast thyself down,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 [1.] He would have him seek for a new proof of his being the <I>Son of 
 God,</I> as if that which his Father had given him by the voice from 
 heaven, and the descent of the Spirit upon him, were not sufficient, 
 which would have been a dishonour to God, as if he had not chosen the 
 most proper way of giving him the assurance of it; and it would have 
 argued a distrust of the Spirit's dwelling in him, which was the great 
 and most convincing proof to himself of his being the <I>Son of 
 God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:8,9">Heb. i. 8, 9</A>.

 [2.] He would have him seek a new method of proclaiming and publishing
 this to the world. The devil, in effect, suggests that it was in an 
 <I>obscure corner</I> that he was attested to be the Son of God, among 
 a company of ordinary people, who attended John's baptism, that his 
 honours were proclaimed; but if he would now declare from <I>the 
 pinnacle of the temple,</I> among all the great people who attend the 
 temple-service, that he was the Son of God, and then, for proof of it, 
 throw himself down unhurt, he would presently be received by every body 
 as a messenger sent from heaven. Thus Satan would have him seek honours 
 of his devising (in contempt of those which God had put on him), and 
 manifest himself in the temple at Jerusalem; whereas God designed he 
 should be more manifest among John's penitents, to whom his doctrine 
 would be more welcome than to the priests.

 [3.] It is probable he had some hopes that, though he could not throw 
 him down, to do him the least mischief, yet, if he would but throw 
 himself down, the fall might be his death, and then he should have got 
 him finely out of the way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How he backed and enforced this temptation. He suggested, <I>It is 
 written,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Christ had quoted scripture against him; and he thought he would be
 quits with him, and would show that he could quote scripture as well as 
 he. It has been usual with heretics and seducers to pervert scripture, 
 and to press the sacred writings into the service of the worst of 
 wickednesses. <I>He shall give his angels charge over thee,</I> if thou 
 be his Son, and <I>in their hands they shall bear thee up.</I> And now 
 that he was upon the pinnacle of the temple he might especially expect 
 this ministration of angels; for, if he was the Son of God, the 
 <I>temple</I> was the proper place for him to be in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:46"><I>ch.</I> ii. 46</A>);

 and, if any place under the sun had a guard of angels constantly, it
 must needs be that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:17">Ps. lxviii. 17</A>.

 It is true, God has promised the protection of angels, to encourage us
 to trust him, not to tempt him; as far as the promise of God's presence 
 with us, so far the promise of the angels' ministration goes, but no 
 further: "They shall keep thee when thou goest on the ground, where thy 
 way lies, but not if thou wilt presume to fly in the air."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) How he was baffled and defeated in the temptation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Christ quoted

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:16">Deut. vi. 16</A>,

 where it is said, <I>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God,</I> by 
 desiring a sign for the proof of divine revelation, when he has already 
 given that which is sufficient; for so Israel did, when they <I>tempted 
 God in the wilderness,</I> saying, He <I>gave us water out of the rock; 
 but can he give flesh also?</I> This Christ would be guilty of if he 
 should say, "He did indeed prove me to be the Son of God, by sending 
 the Spirit upon me, which is the <I>greater;</I> but can he also give 
 his angels a charge concerning me, which is the <I>less?</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What was the result and issue of this combat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Our victorious Redeemer kept his ground, and came off a conqueror, not
 for himself only, but for us also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The devil emptied his quiver: <I>He ended all the temptation.</I> 
 Christ gave him opportunity to say and do all he could against him; he 
 let him try all his force, and yet defeated him. Did Christ suffer, 
 being tempted, till all the temptation was ended? And must not we 
 expect also to pass all our trials, to go through the <I>hour of 
 temptation</I> assigned us?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He then quitted the field: He <I>departed from him.</I> He saw it 
 was to no purpose to attack him; he had <I>nothing in him</I> for his 
 fiery darts to fasten upon; he had no blind side, no weak or unguarded 
 part in his wall, and therefore Satan gave up the cause. Note, If we 
 resist the devil, he will flee from us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Yet he continued his malice against him, and departed with a 
 resolution to attack him again; he departed but <I>for a season,</I> 
 <B><I>achri kairou</I></B>--<I>till a season,</I> or till the season
 when he was again to be let loose upon him, not as a <I>tempter,</I> to 
 draw him to <I>sin,</I> and so to strike at <I>his head,</I> which was 
 what he now aimed at and was wholly defeated in; but as a 
 <I>persecutor,</I> to bring him to <I>suffer</I> by Judas and the other 
 wicked instruments whom he employed, and so to <I>bruise his heel,</I> 
 which it was told him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>)

 he should have to do, and would do, though it would be the breaking of 
 <I>his own head.</I> He <I>departed now</I> till that season came which 
 Christ calls the <I>power of darkness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:53"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 53</A>),

 and when the prince of this world would again <I>come,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:30">John xiv. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee:
 and there went out a fame of him through all the region round
 about.
 &nbsp; 15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
 &nbsp; 16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and,
 as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day,
 and stood up for to read.
 &nbsp; 17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet
 Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where
 it was written,
 &nbsp; 18 The Spirit of the Lord <I>is</I> upon me, because he hath
 anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to
 heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives,
 and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that
 are bruised,
 &nbsp; 19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
 &nbsp; 20 And he closed the book, and he gave <I>it</I> again to the
 minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the
 synagogue were fastened on him.
 &nbsp; 21 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture
 fulfilled in your ears.
 &nbsp; 22 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
 which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this
 Joseph's son?
 &nbsp; 23 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this
 proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done
 in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.
 &nbsp; 24 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted
 in his own country.
 &nbsp; 25 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the
 days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six
 months, when great famine was throughout all the land;
 &nbsp; 26 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, <I>a
 city</I> of Sidon, unto a woman <I>that was</I> a widow.
 &nbsp; 27 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
 prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.
 &nbsp; 28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things,
 were filled with wrath,
 &nbsp; 29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him
 unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they
 might cast him down headlong.
 &nbsp; 30 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After Christ had vanquished the evil spirit, he made it appear how much 
 he was under the influence of the good Spirit; and, having defended 
 himself against the devil's assaults, he now begins to act 
 <I>offensively,</I> and to make those attacks upon him, by his 
 preaching and miracles, which he could not resist or repel.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What is here said in general of his preaching, and the entertainment 
 it met with <I>in Galilee,</I> a remote part of the country, distant 
 from Jerusalem; it was a part of Christ's humiliation that he began his 
 ministry there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But, 

 1. Thither he came <I>in the power of the Spirit.</I> The same Spirit 
 that qualified him for the exercise of his prophetical office strongly 
 inclined him to it. He was not to wait for a call from men, for he had 
 light and life in himself. 

 2. There he <I>taught in their synagogues,</I> their places of public
 worship, where they met, not, as in the temple, for ceremonial 
 services, but for the moral acts of devotion, to read, expound, and 
 apply, the word, to pray and praise, and for church-discipline; these 
 came to be more frequent since the captivity, when the ceremonial 
 worship was near expiring. 

 3. This he did so as that he gained a great reputation. <I>A fame of
 him went through all that region</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and it was a good fame; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 he <I>was glorified of all.</I> Every body admired him, and cried him 
 up; they never heard such preaching in all their lives. Now, at first, 
 he met with no contempt or contradiction; all <I>glorified</I> him, and 
 there were none as yet that vilified him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of his preaching at Nazareth, the city where he was brought up; and 
 the entertainment it met with there. And here we are told how he 
 <I>preached</I> there, and how he was <I>persecuted.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he preached there. In that observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The opportunity he had for it: <I>He came to Nazareth</I> when he 
 had gained a reputation in other places, in hopes that thereby 
 something at least of the contempt and prejudice with which his 
 countrymen would look upon him might be worn off. There he took
 occasion to preach, 

 [1.] In the <I>synagogue,</I> the proper place, where it had been 
 <I>his custom</I> to attend when he was a private person, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 We ought to attend on the public worship of God, as we have
 opportunity. But, now that he was entered upon his public ministry,
 there he preached. Where the multitudes of fish were, there this wise 
 Fisherman would cast his net.

 [2.] On the sabbath day, the proper time which the pious Jews spent, 
 not in a mere ceremonial rest from worldly labour, but in the duties of 
 God's worship, as of old they frequented the schools of the prophets on 
 the <I>new moons</I> and the <I>sabbaths.</I> Note, It is good to keep 
 sabbaths in solemn assemblies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The call he had to it. 

 [1.] He <I>stood up to read.</I> They had in their synagogues seven 
 readers every sabbath, the first a priest, the second a Levite, and the 
 other five Israelites of that synagogue. We often find Christ
 <I>preaching</I> in other synagogues, but never <I>reading,</I> except 
 in this synagogue at Nazareth, of which he had been many years a 
 member. Now he offered his service as he had perhaps often done; he 
 read one of the lessons out of the prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:15">Acts xiii. 15</A>.

 Note, The reading of the scripture is very proper work to be done in
 religious assemblies; and Christ himself did not think it any 
 disparagement to him to be employed in it.

 [2.] The <I>book of the prophet Esaias</I> was <I>delivered to him,</I> 
 either by the ruler of the synagogue or by the minister mentioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 so that he was no intruder, but duly authorized <I>pro hac vice--on 
 this occasion.</I> The second lesson for <I>that</I> day being in the 
 prophecy of Esaias, they gave him that volume to read in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The text he preached upon. He <I>stood up to read,</I> to teach us 
 reverence in <I>reading</I> and <I>hearing</I> the word of God. When 
 Ezra opened the book of the law, <I>all the people stood up</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:5">Neh. viii. 5</A>);

 so did Christ here, when he read in the book of the prophets. Now the 
 book being <I>delivered to him,</I>

 [1.] He <I>opened</I> it. The books of the Old Testament were in a 
 manner <I>shut up</I> till Christ opened them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:11">Isa. xxix. 11</A>.

 Worthy <I>is the Lamb that was slain to take the book, and open the
 seals;</I> for he can open, not the book only, but the understanding.

 [2.] He <I>found</I> the place which was appointed to be read <I>that 
 day</I> in course, which he needed not to be directed to; he soon found 
 it, and read it, and took it for his text. Now his text was taken out 
 of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1,2">Isa. lxi. 1, 2</A>,
 
 which is here quoted at large,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 There was a providence in it that that portion of scripture should be
 read that day, which speaks so very plainly of the Messiah, that they 
 might be left inexcusable who <I>knew him not,</I> though they heard 
 <I>the voices of the prophets</I> read <I>every sabbath day,</I> which 
 bore witness of him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:27">Acts xiii. 27</A>.

 This text gives a full account of Christ's undertaking, and the work he
 came into the world to do. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> How he was qualified for the work: <I>The Spirit of the 
 Lord is upon me.</I> All the gifts and graces of the Spirit were 
 conferred upon him, not by measure, as upon other prophets, but without 
 measure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:34">John iii. 34</A>.

 He now came <I>in the power of the Spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> How he was commissioned: <I>Because he had anointed 
 me,</I> and <I>sent me.</I> His extraordinary qualification amounted to 
 a commission; his being <I>anointed</I> signifies both his being fitted 
 for the undertaking and called to it. Those whom God <I>appoints</I>
 to any service he <I>anoints</I> for it: "Because he hath sent me, he 
 hath sent his Spirit along with me."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> What his work was. He was qualified and 
 commissioned,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To be a great <I>prophet.</I> He was <I>anointed to preach;</I> that 
 is three times mentioned here, for that was the work he was now 
 entering upon. Observe, 

 (1.) To <I>whom</I> he was to preach: to the <I>poor;</I> to those that 
 were <I>poor in the world,</I> whom the Jewish doctors disdained to 
 undertake the teaching of and spoke of with contempt; to those that 
 were <I>poor in spirit,</I> to the meek and humble, and to those that 
 were truly sorrowful for sin: to them the gospel and the grace of it 
 will be welcome, and they shall have it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:5">Matt. xi. 5</A>.

 (2.) <I>What</I> he was to <I>preach.</I> In general, he must preach
 <I>the gospel.</I> He is sent <B><I>euangelizesthai</I></B>--to 
 <I>evangelize</I> them; not only to preach to them, but to make that 
 preaching effectual; to bring it, not only to their ears, but to their 
 hearts, and deliver them into the mould of it. Three things he is to 
 preach:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>Deliverance to the captives,</I> The gospel is a proclamation 
 of liberty, like that to Israel in Egypt and in Babylon. By the merit 
 of Christ sinners may be loosed from the bonds of guilt, and by his 
 Spirit and grace from the bondage of corruption. It is a deliverance 
 from the worst of thraldoms, which all those shall have the benefit of 
 that are willing to make Christ their Head, and are willing to be ruled 
 by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] <I>Recovering of sight to the blind.</I> He came not only by the 
 word of his gospel to bring <I>light</I> to them that sat <I>in the 
 dark,</I> but by the power of his grace to give sight to them that were 
 <I>blind;</I> not only the Gentile world, but every unregenerate soul, 
 that is not only in <I>bondage,</I> but in <I>blindness,</I> like 
 Samson and Zedekiah. Christ came to tell us that he has 
 <I>eye-salve</I> for us, which we may have for the asking; that, if our 
 prayer be, <I>Lord, that our eyes may be opened,</I> his answer shall 
 be, <I>Receive your sight.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] <I>The acceptable year of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He came to let the world know that the God whom they had offended was
 willing to be reconciled to them, and to <I>accept</I> of them upon new 
 terms; that there was yet a way of making their services acceptable to 
 him; that there is now a time of <I>good will toward men.</I> It 
 alludes to the year of <I>release,</I> or that of <I>jubilee,</I> which 
 was an <I>acceptable year</I> to servants, who were then set at 
 liberty; to debtors, against whom all actions then dropped; and to 
 those who had mortgaged their lands, for then they returned to them 
 again. Christ came to sound the <I>jubilee</I>-trumpet; and blessed 
 were they that heard <I>the joyful sound,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:15">Ps. lxxxix. 15</A>.

 It was an acceptable time, for it was a day of salvation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ came to be a great <I>Physician;</I> for he was sent to 
 <I>heal the broken-hearted,</I> to comfort and cure afflicted 
 consciences, to give peace to those that were troubled and humbled for 
 sins, and under a dread of God's wrath against them for them, and to 
 bring them to rest who were weary and heavy-laden, under the burden of 
 guilt and corruption.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. To be a great <I>Redeemer.</I> He not only proclaims liberty to the 
 captives, as Cyrus did to the Jews in Babylon (<I>Whoever will, may go 
 up</I>), but he sets at liberty them that are bruised; he doth by his 
 Spirit <I>incline</I> and <I>enable</I> them to make use of the liberty 
 granted, as then none did but those <I>whose spirit God stirred up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:5">Ezra i. 5</A>.

 He came in God's name to discharge poor sinners that were debtors and
 prisoners to divine justice. The prophets could but <I>proclaim
 liberty,</I> but Christ, as one having authority, as one that had
 <I>power on earth to forgive sins,</I> came to <I>set at liberty;</I>
 and therefore this clause is added here. Dr. Lightfoot thinks that,
 according to a liberty the Jew allowed their readers, to compare
 scripture with scripture, in their reading, for the explication of the
 text, Christ added it from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:6">Isa. lviii. 6</A>,

 where it is made the duty of the acceptable year to let <I>the
 oppressed go free,</I> where the phrase the LXX. uses is the same with 
 this here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Here is Christ's <I>application</I> of this text to himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 When he had read it, he <I>rolled up the book,</I> and gave it again 
 <I>to the minister,</I> or <I>clerk,</I> that attended, and <I>sat 
 down,</I> according to the custom of the Jewish teachers; he <I>sat 
 daily in the temple, teaching,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:55">Matt. xxvi. 55</A>.

 Now he <I>began</I> his discourse thus, "<I>This day is this scripture
 fulfilled in your ears.</I> This, which Isaiah wrote by way of 
 prophecy, I have now read to you by way of history." It now began to be 
 fulfilled in Christ's entrance upon his public ministry; <I>now,</I> in 
 the report they heard of his preaching and miracles in other places; 
 <I>now,</I> in his preaching to them in their own synagogue. It is most 
 probable that Christ went on, and showed particularly how this 
 scripture was fulfilled in the doctrine he preached concerning <I>the 
 kingdom of heaven at hand;</I> that it was preaching liberty, and 
 sight, and healing, and all the blessings of <I>the acceptable year of 
 the Lord.</I> Many other gracious words proceeded out of his mouth, 
 which these were but the <I>beginning</I> of; for Christ often preached 
 long sermons, which we have but a short account of. This was enough to 
 introduce a great deal: <I>This day is this scripture fulfilled.</I> 
 Note,

 [1.] All the scriptures of the Old Testament that were to be fulfilled 
 in the Messiah had their full accomplishment in the Lord Jesus, which 
 abundantly proves that this was <I>he that should come.</I>

 [2.] In the providences of God, it is fit to observe the <I>fulfilling 
 of the scriptures.</I> The works of God are the accomplishment not only 
 of his secret word, but of his word revealed; and it will help us to 
 understand both the scriptures and the providences of God to compare 
 them one with another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Here is the <I>attention</I> and <I>admiration</I> of the 
 auditors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Their <I>attention</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>The eyes of all them that were in the synagogue</I> (and, probably,
 there were a great many) <I>were fastened on him,</I> big with 
 expectation what he would say, having heard so much of late concerning 
 him. Note, It is good, in hearing the word, to keep the eye fixed upon
 the minister by whom God is speaking to us; for, as the eye effects the 
 heart, so, usually, the heart follows the eye, and is wandering, or 
 fixed, as that is. Or, rather, let us learn hence to keep the eye fixed 
 upon Christ speaking to us in and by the minister. <I>What saith my 
 Lord unto his servants?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Their <I>admiration</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>They all bore him witness</I> that he spoke admirably well, and to 
 the purpose. They all commended him, and <I>wondered at the gracious 
 words that proceeded out of his mouth;</I> and yet, as appears by what 
 follows, they did not <I>believe in him.</I> Note, It is possible that 
 those who are admirers of good ministers and good preaching may yet be 
 themselves not true Christians. Observe, <I>First,</I> What it was
 they admired: The <I>gracious words which proceedeth out of his 
 mouth.</I> The <I>words of grace;</I> good words, and spoken in a 
 winning melting way. Note, Christ's words are <I>words of grace,</I> 
 for, grace being <I>poured into his lips</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:2">Ps. xlv. 2</A>),

 words of grace poured from them. And these words of grace are to be 
 <I>wondered at;</I> Christ's name was Wonderful, and in nothing was he 
 more so than in his grace, in the words of his grace, and the power 
 that went along with those words. We may well wonder that he should 
 speak such <I>words of grace</I> to such graceless wretches as we are. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> What it was that increased their wonder and that was 
 the consideration of his original: <I>They said, Is not this Joseph's 
 son,</I> and therefore his extraction mean and his education mean? Some 
 from this suggestion took occasion perhaps so much the more to admire 
 his <I>gracious words,</I> concluding he must needs be <I>taught of 
 God,</I> for they knew no one else had taught him; while others perhaps 
 with this consideration corrected their wonder at his gracious words, 
 and concluded there could be nothing <I>really</I> admirable in them, 
 whatever appeared, because he was the <I>Son of Joseph.</I> Can any 
 thing great, or worthy our regard, come from one so mean?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Christ's anticipating an objection which he knew to be in the 
 minds of many of his hearers. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What the objection was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 "<I>You will surely say to me, Physician, heal thyself.</I> Because you 
 know that I am the Son of Joseph, your neighbour, you will expect that 
 I should work miracles among you, as I have done in other places; as 
 one would expect that a physician, if he be able, should heal, not only 
 himself, but those of his own family and fraternity." Most of Christ's 
 miracles were <I>cures;</I>--"Now why should not the sick in thine own 
 city be <I>healed</I> as well as those in other cities?" They were 
 designed to cure people of their unbelief;--"Now why should not the 
 disease of unbelief, if it be indeed a disease, be cured in those of 
 thine own city as well as in those of others? <I>Whatsoever we have 
 heard done in Capernaum,</I> that has been so much talked of, <I>do 
 here also in thine own country.</I>" They were pleased with <I>Christ's 
 gracious words,</I> only because they hoped they were but the 
 introduction to some <I>wondrous works</I> of his. They wanted to have 
 their lame, and blind, and sick, and lepers, healed and helped, that 
 the charge of their town might be eased; and that was the chief thing 
 they looked at. They thought their own town as worthy to be the stage
 of miracles as any other; and why should not he rather draw company to 
 that than to any other? And why should not his neighbours and 
 acquaintances have the benefit of his preaching and miracles, rather 
 than any other?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] How he answers this objection against the course he took.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> By a plain and positive reason why he would not make 
 Nazareth his headquarters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 because it generally holds true <I>that no prophet is accepted in his 
 own country,</I> at least not so well, nor with such probability of 
 doing good, as in some other country; experience seals this. When 
 prophets have been sent with messages and miracles of mercy, few of 
 their own country-men, that have known their extraction and education, 
 have been fit to <I>receive them.</I> So Dr. Hammond. Familiarity
 breeds contempt; and we are apt to think meanly of those whose 
 conversation we have been accustomed to; and they will scarcely be duly 
 honoured as <I>prophets</I> who were well known when they were in the 
 rank of <I>private men.</I> That is most esteemed that is 
 <I>far-fetched</I> and <I>dear-bought,</I> above what is 
 <I>home-bred,</I> though really more excellent. This arises likewise 
 from the envy which neighbours commonly have towards one another, so 
 that they cannot endure to see him their <I>superior</I> whom awhile 
 ago they took to be every way their <I>inferior.</I> For this reason, 
 Christ declined working miracles, or doing any thing extraordinary, at 
 Nazareth, because of the rooted prejudices they had against him 
 there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> By pertinent examples of two of the most famous 
 prophets of the Old Testament, who chose to dispense their favours 
 among foreigners rather than among their own countrymen, and that, no 
 doubt, by divine direction. 

 1. Elijah maintained a <I>widow of Sarepta,</I> a <I>city of Sidon,</I>
 one that was a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel, when there was a 
 <I>famine in the land,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.
 
 The story we have 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:9">1 Kings xvii. 9</A>,

 &c. It is said there that the heaven was shut up <I>three years and six
 months;</I> whereas it is said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:1">1 Kings xviii. 1</A>,

 that <I>in the third year Elijah</I> showed himself to Ahab, and there
 was <I>rain;</I> but that was not the third year of the drought, but 
 the third year of Elijah's sojourning with the widow of Sarepta. As God 
 would hereby show himself a <I>Father of the fatherless,</I> and a 
 <I>Judge of the widows,</I> so he would show that he was rich in mercy 
 to all, even to the Gentiles.

 2. Elisha cleansed Naaman the Syrian of his leprosy, though he was a
 Syrian, and not only a foreigner, but an enemy to Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 <I>Many lepers were in Israel in the days of Eliseus,</I> four
 particularly, that brought the news of the Syrians' raising the siege 
 of Samaria with precipitation, and leaving the plunder of their tents 
 to enrich Samaria, when Elisha was himself in the besieged city, and 
 this was the accomplishment of his prophecy too; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+7:1,3">2 Kings vii. 1, 3</A>,

 &c. And yet we do not find that Elisha cleansed them, no not for a
 reward of their service, and the good tidings they brought, but only 
 the Syrian; for none besides had faith to apply himself to the prophet 
 for a cure. Christ himself often met with greater faith among Gentiles 
 than in Israel. And here he mentions both these instances, to show that 
 he did not dispense the favour of his miracles by private respect, but 
 according to God's wise appointment. And the people of Israel might as 
 justly have said to Elijah, or Elisha, as the Nazarenes to Christ, 
 <I>Physician, heal thyself.</I> Nay, Christ wrought his miracles, 
 though not among his townsmen, yet among Israelites, whereas these 
 great prophets wrought theirs among Gentiles. The examples of the 
 saints, though they will not make a bad action good, yet will help to 
 free a good action from the blame of exceptious people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he was <I>persecuted</I> at Nazareth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That which provoked them was his taking notice of the favour which 
 God by Elijah and Elisha showed to the Gentiles: <I>When they heard 
 these things, they were filled with wrath</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 they were <I>all so;</I> a great change since 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>,

 when they <I>wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his
 mouth;</I> thus uncertain are the opinions and affections of the 
 multitude, and so very fickle. If they had mixed faith with those 
 gracious words of Christ which they wondered at, they would have been 
 awakened by these latter words of his to take heed of sinning away 
 their opportunities; but those only <I>pleased the ear,</I> and went no 
 further, and therefore these <I>grated on the ear,</I> and irritated 
 their corruptions. They were angry that he should compare himself, whom 
 they knew to be the son of Joseph, with those great prophets, and 
 compare them with the men of that corrupt age, when all had bowed the 
 knee to Baal. But that which especially exasperated them was that he 
 intimated some kindness God had in reserve for the Gentiles, which the 
 Jews could by no means bear the thoughts of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+22:21">Acts xxii. 21</A>.

 Their pious ancestors pleased themselves with the hopes of adding the 
 Gentiles to the church (witness many of David's psalms and Isaiah's 
 prophecies); but this degenerate race, when they had forfeited the 
 covenant themselves, hated to think that any others should be taken 
 in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They were provoked to that degree that they made an attempt upon 
 his life. This was a severe trial, now at his setting out, but a 
 specimen of the usage he met with when he <I>came to his own,</I> and 
 they <I>received him not.</I> 

 [1.] They <I>rose up</I> in a tumultuous manner against him, 
 interrupted him in his discourse, and themselves in their devotions, 
 for they could not stay until their synagogue-worship was over.

 [2.] They <I>thrust him out of the city,</I> as one not worthy to have 
 a residence among them, though there he had had a settlement so long. 
 They thrust from them the Saviour and the salvation, as if he had been 
 the offscouring of all things. How justly might he have called for fire 
 from heaven upon them! But this was the day of his patience.

 [3.] They <I>led him to the brow of the hill,</I> with a purpose to 
 <I>throw him down headlong,</I> as one not fit to live. Though they 
 knew how inoffensively he had for so many years lived among them, how 
 shining his conversation had been,--though they had heard such a fame 
 of him and had but just now themselves <I>admired his gracious 
 words,</I>--though in justice he ought to have been allowed a fair 
 hearing and liberty to explain himself, yet they hurried him away in a 
 popular fury, or frenzy rather, to put him to death in a most barbarous 
 manner. Sometimes they were ready to stone him for the <I>good 
 works</I> he did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:32">John x. 32</A>),

 here for not doing the good works they expected from him. To such a 
 height of wickedness was violence sprung up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Yet he escaped, because his hour was not yet come: He <I>passed 
 through the midst of them</I> unhurt. Either he blinded their eyes, as 
 God did those of the Sodomites and Syrians, or he bound their hands, or 
 filled them with confusion, so that they could not do what they 
 designed; for his work was not done, it was but just begun; his hour 
 was not yet come, when it was come, he freely surrendered himself. They 
 <I>drove</I> him from them, and he <I>went his way.</I> He would have 
 gathered Nazareth, but they <I>would not,</I> and therefore their house 
 is <I>left to them desolate.</I> This added to the reproach of his 
 being Jesus of Nazareth, that not only it was a place whence no good 
 thing was expected, but that it was such a wicked, rude place, and so 
 <I>unkind</I> to him. Yet there was a providence in it, that he should 
 not be much respected by the men of Nazareth, for that would have 
 looked like a collusion between him and his old acquaintance; but now, 
 though they <I>received him not,</I> there were those that did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught
 them on the sabbath days.
 &nbsp; 32 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was
 with power.
 &nbsp; 33 And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of
 an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,
 &nbsp; 34 Saying, Let <I>us</I> alone; what have we to do with thee, <I>thou</I>
 Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who
 thou art; the Holy One of God.
 &nbsp; 35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out
 of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came
 out of him, and hurt him not.
 &nbsp; 36 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves,
 saying, What a word <I>is</I> this! for with authority and power he
 commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.
 &nbsp; 37 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country
 round about.
 &nbsp; 38 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's
 house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever;
 and they besought him for her.
 &nbsp; 39 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left
 her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.
 &nbsp; 40 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick
 with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands
 on every one of them, and healed them.
 &nbsp; 41 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying,
 Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking <I>them</I> suffered
 them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.
 &nbsp; 42 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert
 place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed
 him, that he should not depart from them.
 &nbsp; 43 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to
 other cities also: for therefore am I sent.
 &nbsp; 44 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When Christ was expelled Nazareth, he came to Capernaum, another city 
 of Galilee. The account we have in these verses of his preaching and 
 miracles there we had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:21">Mark i. 21</A>,

 &c. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His preaching: <I>He taught them on the sabbath days,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 In hearing the word preached, as an ordinance of God, we <I>worship
 God,</I> and it is a proper work for <I>sabbath days.</I> Christ's 
 preaching much affected the people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 they were <I>astonished at his doctrine,</I> there was weight in every 
 word he said, and admirable discoveries were made to them by it. The 
 doctrine itself was astonishing, and not only as it came from one that 
 had not had a liberal education. <I>His word was with power;</I> there 
 was a commanding force in it, and a working power went along with it to 
 the conscience of men. The doctrine Paul preached hereby proved itself 
 to be of God, that it came <I>in demonstration of the Spirit and of 
 power.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His miracles. Of these we have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Two particularly specified, showing Christ to be,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A <I>controller</I> and <I>conqueror</I> of <I>Satan,</I> in the 
 world of mankind, and in the souls of people, by his power to cast him 
 out of the bodies of those he had taken possession of; for <I>for this 
 purpose was he manifested, that he might destroy the works of the 
 devil.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 [1.] The devil is an <I>unclean spirit,</I> his nature directly 
 contrary to that of the pure and <I>holy</I> God, and degenerated from 
 what it was at first. 

 [2.] This unclean spirit works in the children of men; in the souls of 
 many, as then in men's bodies.

 [3.] It is possible that those who are very much under the power and 
 working of Satan may yet be found <I>in the synagogue,</I> among the 
 worshippers of God.

 [4.] Even the devils <I>know and believe</I> that <I>Jesus Christ is 
 the Holy One of God,</I> is sent of God, and is a <I>Holy One.</I> 

 [5.] They believe and <I>tremble.</I> This unclean spirit <I>cried out 
 with a loud voice,</I> under a <I>certain fearful looking for of 
 judgment,</I> and apprehensive that Christ was now come to destroy him.
 Unclean spirits are subject to continual frights.

 [6.] The devils have <I>nothing to do with Jesus Christ,</I> nor desire 
 to have any thing to do with him; for he took not on him the nature of 
 angels.

 [7.] Christ has the devil under check: <I>He rebuked him,</I> saying, 
 <I>Hold thy peace;</I> and this word he spoke <I>with power;</I> 
 <B><I>phimotheti</I></B>--<I>Be muzzled,</I> Christ did not only enjoin 
 him silence, but stopped his mouth, and forced him to be silent against 
 his will.

 [8.] In the breaking of Satan's power, both the enemy that is conquered 
 shows his malice, and Christ, the conqueror, shows his over-ruling 
 grace. Here, <I>First,</I> The devil showed what he would have done, 
 when he <I>threw the man in the midst,</I> with force and fury, as if 
 he would have dashed him to pieces. But, <I>Secondly,</I> Christ showed 
 what a power he had over him, in that he not only forced him to leave 
 him, but to leave him without so much as <I>hurting</I> him, without 
 giving him a parting blow, a parting gripe. Whom Satan cannot 
 <I>destroy,</I> he will do all the <I>hurt</I> he can to; but this is a 
 comfort, he can harm them no further than Christ permits; nay, he shall 
 not do them any real harm. He <I>came out,</I> and <I>hurt him not;</I> 
 that is, the poor man was perfectly well in an instant, though the 
 devil left him with so much rage that all that were present thought he 
 had torn him to pieces.

 [9.] Christ's power over devils was universally acknowledged and 
 adored, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 No one doubted the truth of the miracle; it was evident beyond
 contradiction, nor was any thing suggested to diminish the glory of it, 
 for they were <I>all amazed, saying, What a word is this!</I> They that 
 pretended to cast out devils did it with abundance of charms and 
 spells, to pacify the devil, and lull him asleep, as it were; but 
 Christ commanded them <I>with authority and power,</I> which they could 
 not gainsay or resist. Even the <I>prince of the power of the air</I> 
 is his vassal, and trembles before him.

 [10.] This, as much as any thing, gained Christ a reputation, and 
 spread his fame. This instance of his power, which many now-a-days make 
 light of, was then, by them that were eye-witnesses of it (and those no 
 fools either, but men of penetration), magnified, and was looked upon 
 as greatly magnifying him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>);

 upon the account of this, <I>the fame of him went out,</I> more than 
 ever, <I>into every place of the country round about.</I> Our Lord 
 Jesus, when he set out at first in his public ministry, was greatly 
 talked of, more than afterwards, when people's admiration wore off with 
 the novelty of the thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ showed himself to be <I>a healer of diseases.</I> In the 
 former, he struck at the root of man's misery, which was Satan's 
 enmity, the origin of all the mischief: in this, he strikes at one of 
 the most spreading branches of it, one of the most common calamities of 
 human life, and that is bodily diseases, which came in with sin, are 
 the most common and sensible corrections for it in this life, and 
 contribute as much as any thing towards the making of our few days 
 <I>full of trouble.</I> These our Lord Jesus came to take away the 
 sting of, and, as an indication of that intention, when he was on 
 earth, chose to confirm his doctrine by such miracles, mostly, as took 
 away the diseases themselves. Of all bodily diseases none are more 
 common or fatal to grown people than <I>fevers;</I> these come 
 suddenly, and suddenly cut off the number of men's months in the midst; 
 they are sometimes <I>epidemical,</I> and <I>slay their thousands</I> 
 in a little time. Now here we have Christ's curing a fever with a 
 word's speaking; the place was in Simon's house, his patient was 
 Simon's wife's mother, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:38,39"><I>v.</I> 38, 39</A>.
 
 Observe,

 [1.] Christ is a guest that will pay well for his entertainment; those 
 that bid him welcome into their hearts and houses shall be no losers by 
 him; he comes with healing.

 [2.] Even families that Christ visits may be visited with sickness. 
 Houses that are blessed with his <I>distinguishing favours</I> are 
 liable to the <I>common calamities</I> of this life. Simon's wife's
 mother was <I>ill</I> of a <I>fever.</I> <I>Lord, behold, he whom thou 
 lovest is sick.</I>

 [3.] Even good people may sometimes be exercised with the sharpest 
 afflictions, more grievous than others: She was <I>taken with a great 
 fever,</I> very acute, and high, and threatening; perhaps it seized her 
 head, and made her delirious. The most gentle fevers may by degrees 
 prove dangerous; but this was at first <I>a great fever.</I>

 [4.] No age can exempt from diseases. It is probable that Peter's 
 mother-in-law was <I>in years,</I> and yet in a <I>fever.</I>

 [5.] When our relations are sick, we ought to apply ourselves to 
 Christ, by faith and prayer, on their account: <I>They besought him for 
 her;</I> and there is a particular promise that the prayer of faith 
 shall benefit the sick.

 [6.] Christ has a tender concern for his people when they are in 
 sickness and distress: <I>He stood over her,</I> as one concerned for 
 her, and compassionating her case.

 [7.] Christ had, and still has, a sovereign power over bodily diseases: 
 <I>He rebuked the fever,</I> and with a word's speaking commanded it 
 away, and <I>it left her.</I> He saith to diseases, <I>Go,</I> and they 
 go; <I>Come,</I> and they come; and can still <I>rebuke fevers,</I> 
 even great fevers.

 [8.] This proves Christ's cures to be miraculous, that they were done 
 in an instant: <I>Immediately she arose.</I>

 [9.] Where Christ gives a new life, in recovery from sickness, he 
 designs and expects that it should be a new life indeed, spent more 
 than ever in his service, to his glory. If distempers be rebuked, and 
 we arise from a bed of sickness, we must set ourselves to minister to 
 Jesus Christ.

 [10.] Those that minister to Christ must be ready to minister to all 
 that are his for his sake: She <I>ministered to them,</I> not only to 
 <I>him</I> that had cured her, but to them that had <I>besought him for 
 her.</I> We must study to be grateful to those that have prayed for 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A general account given by wholesale of many other miracles of the 
 same kind, which Christ did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He <I>cured many that were diseased,</I> even all without 
 exception that made their application to him, and it was <I>when the 
 sun was setting</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>);

 in the evening of that sabbath day which he had spent in the synagogue. 
 Note, It is good to do a full sabbath day's work, to abound in the work 
 of the day, in some good work or other, even till sun-set; as those 
 that call the sabbath, and the business of it, <I>a delight.</I> 
 Observe, He cured <I>all that were sick,</I> poor as well as rich, and 
 though they were sick of <I>divers diseases;</I> so that there was no 
 room to suspect that he had only a specific for some one disease. He 
 had a remedy for every malady. The sign he used in healing was 
 <I>laying his hands</I> on the sick; not lifting up his hands for them, 
 for he healed as having authority. He healed by his own power. And thus 
 he would put honour upon that sign which was afterwards used in 
 conferring the Holy Ghost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He cast the devil out of many that were possessed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.
 
 Confessions were extorted from the demoniacs. They said, <I>Thou art
 Christ the Son of God,</I> but they said it <I>crying</I> with rage and 
 indignation; it was a confession upon the rack, and therefore was not 
 admitted in evidence. Christ <I>rebuked them,</I> and did not <I>suffer 
 them to say that they knew him to be the Christ,</I> that it might 
 appear, beyond all contradiction, that he had obtained a conquest over 
 them, and not made a compact with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here is his removal from Capernaum, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:42,43"><I>v.</I> 42, 43</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He <I>retired</I> for awhile into a place of <I>solitude.</I> It 
 was but a little while that he allowed himself for sleep; not only 
 because a <I>little served him,</I> but because he was <I>content with 
 a little,</I> and never indulged himself in ease; but, <I>when it was 
 day,</I> he <I>went into a desert place,</I> not to live constantly 
 like a hermit, but to be sometimes <I>alone with God,</I> as even those 
 should be, and contrive to be, that are most engaged in public work, or 
 else their work will go on but poorly, and they will find themselves 
 never <I>less alone</I> than when <I>thus alone.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He <I>returned</I> again to the places of <I>concourse</I> and to 
 the work he had to do there. Though a <I>desert place</I> may be a 
 convenient <I>retreat,</I> yet it is not a <I>convenient residence,</I> 
 because we were not sent into this world to <I>live to ourselves,</I> 
 no, not to the <I>best part</I> of ourselves only, but to glorify God 
 and do good in our generation. 

 [1.] He was earnestly solicited to stay at Capernaum. <I>The people</I> 
 were exceedingly fond of him; I doubt, more because he had healed their 
 sick than because he had preached repentance to them. <I>They sought 
 him,</I> enquired which way he went; and, though it was in a <I>desert 
 place,</I> they <I>came unto him.</I> A desert is no desert if we be 
 <I>with Christ</I> there. They <I>detained him that he should not
 depart from them,</I> so that if he would go it should not be for want 
 of invitation. His old neighbours at Nazareth had driven him from them, 
 but his new acquaintances at Capernaum were very importunate for his 
 continuance with them. Note, It ought not to discourage the ministers 
 of Christ that some reject them, for they will meet with others that 
 will welcome them and their message.

 [2.] He chose rather to <I>diffuse</I> the light of his gospel to 
 <I>many</I> places than to fix it to <I>one,</I> that no one might 
 pretend to be a <I>mother-church</I> to the rest. Though he was welcome 
 at Capernaum, and had done abundance of good there, yet he is <I>sent 
 to preach the gospel to other cities also;</I> and Capernaum must not 
 insist upon his stay there. They that enjoy the benefit of the gospel 
 must be willing that others also should share in that benefit, and not 
 covet the <I>monopoly</I> of it; and those ministers who are not 
 <I>driven</I> from one place may yet be <I>drawn</I> to another by a 
 prospect of greater usefulness. Christ, though he preached not in vain 
 in the synagogue at Capernaum, yet would not be tied to that, but 
 <I>preached in the synagogues of Galilee,</I>

 <I>Bonum est sui diffusivum--What is good is self-diffusive.</I> It is
 well for us that our Lord Jesus has not tied himself to any one place 
 or people, but, wherever two or three are gathered in his name, he will 
 be in the midst of them: and even in <I>Galilee of the Gentiles</I> his 
 special presence is in the Christian synagogues.</P>
