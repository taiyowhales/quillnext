 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the close of the foregoing chapter we had an account of the first
 disciples whom Jesus called, Andrew and Peter, Philip and Nathanael.
 These were the first-fruits to God and to the Lamb,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:4">Rev. xiv. 4</A>.

 Now, in this chapter, we have,

 I. The account of the first miracle which Jesus wrought-turning water
 into wine, at Cana of Galilee

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>),

 and his appearing at Capernaum,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:12">ver. 12</A>.

 II. The account of the first passover he kept at Jerusalem after he
 began his public ministry; his driving the buyers and sellers out of 
 the temple
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>);

 and the sign he gave to those who quarrelled with him for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:18-22">ver. 18-22</A>),

 with an account of some almost believers, that followed him, thereupon,
 for some time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:23-25">ver. 23-25</A>),

 but he knew them too well to put any confidence in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;
 and the mother of Jesus was there:
 &nbsp; 2  And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the
 marriage.
 &nbsp; 3  And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto
 him, They have no wine.
 &nbsp; 4  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee?
 mine hour is not yet come.
 &nbsp; 5  His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto
 you, do <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 6  And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the
 manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three
 firkins apiece.
 &nbsp; 7  Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And
 they filled them up to the brim.
 &nbsp; 8  And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the
 governor of the feast. And they bare <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 9  When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was
 made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which
 drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the
 bridegroom,
 &nbsp; 10  And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set
 forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is
 worse: <I>but</I> thou hast kept the good wine until now.
 &nbsp; 11  This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
 manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of Christ's miraculous conversion of water into 
 wine at a marriage in Cana of Galilee. There were some few so well 
 disposed as to believe in Christ, and to follow him, when he <I>did no 
 miracle;</I> yet it was not likely that many should be wrought upon 
 till he had something wherewith to answer those that asked, <I>What 
 sign showest thou?</I> He could have wrought miracles before, could 
 have made them the common actions of his life and the common 
 entertainments of his friends; but, miracles being designed for the 
 sacred and solemn seals of his doctrine, he began not to work any till 
 he began to preach his doctrine. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The occasion of this miracle. Maimonides observes it to be to the 
 honour of Moses that all the signs he did in the wilderness he did 
 <I>upon necessity;</I> we needed food, he brought us manna, and so did 
 Christ. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The time: the <I>third day</I> after he came into Galilee. The 
 evangelist keeps a journal of occurrences, for no day passed without 
 something extraordinary done or said. Our Master filled up his time 
 better than his servants do, and never lay down at night complaining, 
 as the Roman emperor did, that he had <I>lost a day.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The place: it was at Cana in Galilee, in the tribe of Asher 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:28">Josh. xix. 28</A>),

 of which, before, it was said that <I>he shall yield royal
 dainties,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:20">Gen. xlix. 20.</A>

 Christ began to work miracles in an obscure corner of the country,
 remote from Jerusalem, which was the public scene of action, to show 
 that he <I>sought not honour from men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:41"><I>ch.</I> v. 41</A>),

 but would put honour <I>upon the lowly.</I> His doctrine and miracles
 would not be so much opposed by the plain and honest Galileans as they 
 would be by the proud and prejudiced rabbies, politicians, and 
 grandees, at Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The occasion itself was a <I>marriage;</I> probably one or both of 
 the parties were akin to our Lord Jesus. The <I>mother of Jesus</I> is 
 said to be <I>there,</I> and not to be <I>called,</I> as Jesus and his 
 disciples were, which intimates that she was there as one at home. 
 Observe the honour which Christ hereby put upon the ordinance of 
 marriage, that he graced the solemnity of it, not only with his 
 presence, but with his first miracle; because it was instituted and 
 blessed in innocency, because by it he would still <I>seek a godly 
 seed,</I> because it resembles the mystical union between him and his 
 church, and because he foresaw that in the papal kingdom, while the 
 marriage ceremony would be unduly <I>dignified</I> and advanced into a 
 <I>sacrament,</I> the <I>married state</I> would be unduly 
 <I>vilified,</I> as inconsistent with any sacred function. There was a 
 <I>marriage</I>--<B><I>gamos</I></B>, a <I>marriage-feast,</I> to grace
 the solemnity. Marriages were usually celebrated with festivals 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:22,Jdg+14:10">Gen. xxix. 22; Judg. xiv. 10</A>),

 in token of joy and friendly respect, and for the confirming of
 love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Christ and his mother and disciples were principal guests at this 
 entertainment. <I>The mother of Jesus</I> (that was her most honourable 
 title) <I>was there;</I> no mention being made of Joseph, we conclude 
 him dead before this. Jesus was <I>called,</I> and he came, accepted 
 the invitation, and feasted with them, to teach us to be 
 <I>respectful</I> to our relations, and <I>sociable</I> with them, 
 though they be mean. Christ was to come in a way different from that of 
 John Baptist, who came <I>neither eating nor drinking,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:18,19">Matt. xi. 18, 19</A>.

 It is the wisdom of the prudent to study how to <I>improve</I>
 conversation rather than how to <I>decline</I> it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>There was a marriage, and Jesus was called.</I> Note, 

 [1.] It is very desirable, when there is a <I>marriage,</I> to have 
 Jesus Christ <I>present</I> at it; to have his spiritual gracious 
 presence, to have the marriage owned and blessed by him: the 
 <I>marriage</I> is then <I>honourable</I> indeed; and they that 
 <I>marry in</I> the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:39">1 Cor. vii. 39</A>)

 do not marry <I>without him.</I> 

 [2.] They that would have Christ with them at their marriage must 
 invite him by prayer; that is the messenger that must be sent to heaven 
 for him; and he will come: <I>Thou shalt call, and I will answer.</I> 
 And he will turn the water into wine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The disciples also were invited, those five whom he had called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:35-51">
 <I>ch.</I> 1</A>),

 for as yet he had no more; they were his family, and were invited with
 him. They had thrown themselves upon his care, and they soon found 
 that, though he had no wealth, he had good friends. Note, 

 [1.] Those that <I>follow</I> Christ shall <I>feast</I> with him, they 
 shall <I>fare</I> as he <I>fares,</I> so he has <I>bespoken</I> for 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:26"><I>ch.</I> xii. 26</A>):
 
 <I>Where I am, there shall my servant be also.</I>

 [2.] Love to Christ is testified by a love to those that are his, for
 his sake; <I>our goodness extendeth not to him,</I> but <I>to the 
 saints.</I> Calvin observes how <I>generous</I> the maker of the feast 
 was, though he seems to have been but of small substance, to invite 
 four or five strangers more than he thought of, because they were 
 followers of Christ, which shows, saith he, that there is more of 
 freedom, and liberality, and true friendship, in the conversation of 
 some meaner persons than among many of higher rank.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The miracle itself. In which observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They <I>wanted wine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 (1.) There was <I>want</I> at a <I>feast;</I> though much was provided,
 yet all was spent. While we are in this world we sometimes find 
 ourselves <I>in straits,</I> even then when we think ourselves in the 
 <I>fulness of our sufficiency.</I> If always <I>spending,</I> perhaps 
 all is spent ere we are aware.

 (2.) There was want at a <I>marriage feast.</I> Note, They who, being 
 <I>married,</I> are come to <I>care for the things of the world</I> 
 must expect <I>trouble in the flesh,</I> and count upon disappointment.

 (3.) It should seem, Christ and his disciples were the occasion of this 
 want, because there was more company than was expected when the 
 provision was made; but they who straiten themselves for Christ shall 
 not lose by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The <I>mother of Jesus</I> solicited him to assist her friends in 
 this strait. We are told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>)

 what passed between Christ and his mother upon this occasion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) She acquaints him with the difficulty they were in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>She saith unto him, They have no wine.</I> Some think that she did
 not expect from him any miraculous supply (he having as yet wrought no 
 miracle), but that she would have him make some <I>decent</I> excuse to 
 the company, and make the best of it, to save the bridegroom's 
 reputation, and keep him in countenance; or (as Calvin suggests) would 
 have him make up the want of wine with some holy profitable discourse.
 But, most probably, she looked for a miracle; for she knew he was now 
 appearing as the great prophet, like unto Moses, who so often 
 seasonably supplied the wants of Israel; and, though this was his first 
 public miracle, perhaps he had sometimes relieved her and her husband 
 in their low estate. The bridegroom might have sent out for more wine, 
 but she was for going to the fountain-head. Note, 

 [1.] We ought to be concerned for the wants and straits of our friends, 
 and not <I>seek our own things</I> only. 

 [2.] In our own and our friends' straits it is our wisdom and duty to 
 apply ourselves to Christ by prayer. 

 [3.] In our addresses to Christ, we must not prescribe to him, but 
 humbly spread our case before him, and then <I>refer ourselves</I> to 
 him to do as he pleases.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He gave her a reprimand for it, for he saw more amiss in it than 
 we do, else he had not treated it thus.--Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The rebuke itself: <I>Woman, what have I to do with thee?</I> As 
 many as Christ loves, he rebukes and chastens. He calls her 
 <I>woman,</I> not <I>mother.</I> When we begin to be assuming, we 
 should be reminded what we are, <I>men</I> and <I>women,</I> frail, 
 foolish, and corrupt. The question, <B><I>ti emoi kai soi</I></B>, 
 might be read, <I>What is that to me and thee?</I> What is it to us if 
 they do want? But it is always as we render it, <I>What have I to do 
 with thee?</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:12,2Sa+16:10,Ezr+4:3,Mt+8:29">Judges xi. 12;
 2 Sam. xvi. 10; Ezra iv. 3; Matt. viii. 29</A>.

 It therefore bespeaks a resentment, yet not at all inconsistent with
 the reverence and subjection which he paid to his mother, according to 
 the fifth commandment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:51">Luke ii. 51</A>);

 for there was a time when it was Levi's praise that he <I>said to his
 father, I have not known him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">Deut. xxxiii. 9</A>.

 Now this was intended to be, <I>First,</I> A check to his mother for
 interposing in a matter which was the act of his Godhead, which had no 
 dependence on her, and which she was not the mother of. Though, as man, 
 he was David's Son and hers; yet, as God, he was David's Lord and hers, 
 and he would have her know it. The greatest advancements must not make 
 us forget ourselves and our place, nor the familiarity to which the 
 covenant of grace admits us breed contempt, irreverence, or any kind or
 degree of presumption. <I>Secondly,</I> It was an instruction to others 
 of his relations (many of whom were present here) that they must never 
 expect him to have any regard to his kindred according to the flesh, in 
 his working miracles, or that therein he should gratify them, who in 
 this matter were no more to him than other people. In the things of God 
 we must not <I>know faces. Thirdly,</I> It is a standing testimony 
 against that idolatry which he foresaw his church would in after-ages 
 sink into, in giving undue honours to the virgin Mary, a crime which 
 the Roman catholics, as they call themselves, are notoriously guilty 
 of, when they call her the <I>queen of heaven,</I> the <I>salvation of 
 the world,</I> their <I>mediatrix,</I> their <I>life</I> and 
 <I>hope;</I> not only depending upon her merit and intercession, but 
 beseeching her to <I>command her Son</I> to do them good: <I>Monstra te 
 esse matrem--Show that thou art his mother. Jussu matris impera 
 salvatori--Lay thy maternal commands on the Saviour.</I> Does he not 
 here expressly say, when a miracle was to be wrought, even in the days 
 of his humiliation, and his mother did but tacitly hint an 
 intercession, <I>Woman, what have I to do with thee?</I> This was 
 plainly designed either to <I>prevent</I> or <I>aggravate</I> such 
 gross idolatry, such horrid blasphemy. The Son of God is appointed our 
 Advocate with the Father; but the mother of our Lord was never designed 
 to be our advocate with the Son.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The reason of this rebuke: <I>Mine hour is not yet come.</I> For 
 every thing Christ did, and that was done to him, he had <I>his 
 hour,</I> the <I>fixed</I> time and the <I>fittest</I> time, which was 
 punctually observed. <I>First,</I> "Mine hour for <I>working 
 miracles</I> is not yet come." Yet afterwards he wrought this, before 
 the hour, because he foresaw it would confirm the faith of his infant 
 disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 which was the end of all his miracles: so that this was an earnest of
 the many miracles he would work when his <I>hour was come.
 Secondly,</I> "Mine hour of working miracles <I>openly</I> is <I>not
 yet come;</I> therefore do not talk of it thus <I>publicly."
 Thirdly,</I> "It <I>not the hour</I> of my exemption from thy authority
 <I>yet come,</I> now that I have begun to act as a prophet?" So Gregory
 Nyssen. <I>Fourthly,</I> "Mine hour for working <I>this miracle</I> is
 not yet come." His mother moved him to help them <I>when the wine began
 to fail</I> (so it may be read,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 but his hour was not yet come till it was quite spent, and there was a
 <I>total want;</I> not only to prevent any suspicion of mixing some of 
 the wine that was left with the water, but to teach us that man's 
 extremity is God's opportunity to appear for the help and relief of his 
 people. Then <I>his hour is come</I> when we are reduced to the utmost 
 strait, and know not what to do. This encouraged those that waited for 
 him to believe that though his hour was not <I>yet come</I> it would 
 come. Note, The delays of mercy are not to be construed the denials of 
 prayer. <I>At the end it shall speak.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Notwithstanding this, she encouraged herself with expectations 
 that he would help her friends in this strait, for she bade the 
 servants <I>observe his orders,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 [1.] She took the reproof very submissively, and did not reply to it. 
 It is best not to deserve reproof from Christ, but next best to be meek 
 and quiet under it, and to count it a kindness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:5">Ps. cxli. 5</A>.

 [2.] She kept her hope in Christ's mercy, that he would yet grant her 
 desire. When we come to God in Christ for any mercy, two things
 discourage us:--<I>First,</I> Sense of <I>our own follies</I> and 
 infirmities "Surely such imperfect prayers as ours cannot speed." 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Sense of <I>our Lord's frowns and rebukes.</I> 
 Afflictions are continued, deliverances delayed, and God seems angry at 
 our prayers. This was the case of the mother of our Lord here, and yet
 she encourages herself with hope that he will at length give in an 
 answer of peace, to teach us to wrestle with God by faith and fervency 
 in prayer, even when he seems in his providence to walk contrary to us. 
 We must <I>against hope believe in hope,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:18">Rom. iv. 18</A>.

 [3.] She directed the servants to have an eye <I>to him</I> 
 immediately, and not to make their applications to her, as it is 
 probable <I>they had done.</I> She quits all pretensions to an 
 <I>influence</I> upon him, or <I>intercession</I> with him; let their 
 souls <I>wait only</I> on him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:5">Ps. lxii. 5</A>.

 [4.] She directed them punctually to observe his orders, without 
 disputing, or asking questions. Being conscious to herself of a fault 
 in <I>prescribing</I> to him, she cautions the servants to take heed of 
 the same fault, and to attend both his time and his way for supply: 
 "<I>Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it,</I> though you may think it 
 ever so improper. If he saith, Give the guests water, when they call 
 for wine, do it. If he saith, Pour out from the bottoms of the vessels 
 that are spent, do it. He can make a few drops of wine multiply to so
 many draughts." Note, Those that expect Christ's <I>favours</I> must 
 with an implicit obedience observe his <I>orders.</I> The way of duty 
 is the way to mercy; and Christ's methods must not be objected 
 against.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Christ did at length miraculously supply them; for he is often 
 better than his word, but never worse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The miracle itself was <I>turning water into wine;</I> the 
 substance of water acquiring a new form, and having all the accidents 
 and qualities of wine. Such a <I>transformation</I> is a 
 <I>miracle;</I> but the popish <I>transubstantiation,</I> the substance 
 changed, the accidents remaining the same, is a monster. By this Christ 
 showed himself to be the God of nature, who maketh the earth to bring 
 forth wine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:14,15">Ps. cix. 14, 15</A>.

 The extracting of the blood of the grape every year from the moisture
 of the earth is no less a work of power, though, being according to the 
 common law of nature, it is not such a work of wonder, as this. The 
 beginning of Moses's miracles was turning water into blood

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:9,7:20">Exod. iv. 9; vii. 20</A>),

 the beginning of Christ's miracles was turning water into wine; which
 intimates the difference between the law of Moses and the gospel of 
 Christ. The curse of the law turns water into blood, common comforts 
 into bitterness and terror; the blessing of the gospel turns water into 
 wine. Christ hereby showed that his errand into the world was to 
 heighten and improve creature-comforts to all believers, and make them 
 comforts indeed. Shiloh is said to <I>wash his garments in wine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:11">Gen. xlix. 11</A>),

 the water for washing being <I>turned into wine.</I> And the gospel
 call is, <I>Come ye to the waters, and buy wine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:1">Isa. lv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The circumstances of it magnified it and freed it from all 
 suspicion of cheat or collusion; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> It was done in water-pots 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>There were set there six water-pots of stone.</I> Observe, 

 1. For what use these water-pots were intended: for the legal
 purifications from ceremonial pollutions enjoined by the law of God, 
 and many more by the tradition of the elders. The <I>Jews eat not, 
 except they wash often</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+7:3">Mark vii. 3</A>),

 and they used much water in their washing, for which reason here were
 six large water-pots provided. It was a saying among them, <I>Qui
 mult&acirc; utitur aqu&acirc; in lavando, multas consequetur in hoc
 mundo divitias--He who uses much water in washing will gain much wealth
 in this world.</I> 

 2. To what use Christ put them, quite different from what they were
 intended for; to be the receptacles of the miraculous wine. Thus Christ 
 came to bring in the grace of the gospel, which is as <I>wine,</I> that 
 cheereth God and man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:13">Judg. ix. 13</A>),

 instead of the shadows of the law, which were as water, <I>weak and
 beggarly elements.</I> These were <I>water-pots,</I> that had never
 been used to have wine in them; and of <I>stone,</I> which is not apt
 to retain the scent of former liquors, if ever they had had wine in
 them. They contained <I>two or three firkins apiece;</I> two or three
 <I>measures, baths,</I> or <I>ephahs;</I> the quantity is uncertain,
 but very considerable. We may be sure that it was not intended to be
 all drank at this feast, but for a further kindness to the new-married
 couple, as the multiplied oil was to the poor widow, out of which she
 might <I>pay her debt,</I> and <I>live of the rest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:7">2 Kings iv. 7</A>.
 
 Christ gives like himself, gives abundantly, according to his riches in
 glory. It is the penman's language to say, <I>They contained two or 
 three firkins,</I> for the Holy Spirit could have ascertained just how 
 much; thus (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:19"><I>ch.</I> vi. 19</A>)

 teaching us to speak cautiously, and not confidently, of those things 
 of which we have not good assurance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> The water-pots were filled <I>up to the brim</I> by 
 the servants at Christ's word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 As Moses, the servant of the Lord, when God bade him, went to the rock, 
 to draw water; so these servants, when Christ bade them, went to the 
 water, to fetch wine. Note, Since no difficulties can be opposed to the 
 arm of God's power, no improbabilities are to be objected against the 
 word of his command.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> The miracle was wrought suddenly, and in such a manner 
 as greatly magnified it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> As soon as they had filled the water-pots, presently he said, 
 <I>Draw out now</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 and it was done,

 (<I>a.</I>) Without any ceremony, in the eye of the spectators. One
 would have thought, as Naaman, he should have come out, and
 <I>stood,</I> and <I>called on the name of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:11">2 Kings v. 11</A>.

 No, he sits still in his place, says not a word, but <I>wills</I> the
 thing, and so works it. Note, Christ does great things and marvellous 
 <I>without noise,</I> works manifest changes in a hidden way. Sometimes 
 Christ, in working miracles, used words and signs, but it was <I>for 
 their sakes that stood by,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:42"><I>ch.</I> xi. 42</A>.

 (<I>b.</I>) Without any hesitation or uncertainty in his own breast. He
 did not say, <I>Draw out now,</I> and let me <I>taste it,</I> 
 questioning whether the thing were done as he willed it or no; but with 
 the greatest assurance imaginable, though it was his <I>first 
 miracle,</I> he recommends it to the master of the feast <I>first.</I> 
 As he knew what he <I>would</I> do, so he knew what he <I>could</I> do, 
 and made no essay in his work; but all was good, very good, even in the 
 beginning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> Our Lord Jesus directed the servants, 

 (<I>a.</I>) To <I>draw it out;</I> not to let it alone in the vessel, 
 to be admired, but to <I>draw it out,</I> to be drank. Note, 

 [<I>a.</I>] Christ's works are all <I>for use;</I> he gives no man a
 talent to be <I>buried,</I> but to be <I>traded with.</I> Has he turned 
 thy water into wine, given thee knowledge and grace? It is to <I>profit 
 withal;</I> and therefore <I>draw out now.</I>

 [<I>b.</I>] Those that would know Christ must make trial of him, must
 attend upon him in the use of ordinary means, and then may expect 
 extraordinary influence. That which is <I>laid up</I> for all that
 <I>fear God</I> is <I>wrought for those that trust in him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:19">Ps. xxxi. 19</A>),

 that by the exercise of faith <I>draw out</I> what is <I>laid up.</I>

 (<I>b.</I>) To present it to <I>the governor of the feast.</I> Some 
 think that this <I>governor of the feast</I> was only the chief guest, 
 that sat at the upper end of the table; but, if so, surely our Lord 
 Jesus should have had that place, for he was, upon all accounts, the 
 principal guest; but it seems another had the uppermost room, probably 
 one that <I>loved</I> it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:6">Matt. xxiii. 6</A>),

 and <I>chose</I> it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:7">Luke xiv. 7</A>.

 And Christ, according to his own rule, <I>sat down in the lowest
 room;</I> but, though he was not treated as the Master of the feast, he 
 kindly approved himself a friend to the feast, and, if not its founder, 
 yet its best benefactor. Others think that this <I>governor</I> was the 
 inspector and monitor of the feast: the same with Plutarch's 
 <I>symposiarcha,</I> whose office it was to see that each had enough, 
 and none did exceed, and that there were no indecencies or disorders. 
 Note, Feasts have need of governors, because too many, when they are at 
 feasts, have not the government of themselves. Some think that this 
 <I>governor</I> was the <I>chaplain,</I> some priest or Levite that 
 craved a blessing and gave thanks, and Christ would have the cup 
 brought to him, that he might bless it, and bless God for it; for the 
 extraordinary tokens of Christ's presence and power were not to 
 supersede, or jostle out, the ordinary rules and methods of piety and 
 devotion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> The wine which was thus miraculously provided was of 
 the best and richest kind, which was acknowledged by the governor of 
 the feast; and that it was really so, and not his fancy, is certain, 
 because he knew not whence it was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10.</A>

 1. It was certain that this was <I>wine.</I> The governor knew this 
 when he drank it, though he knew not <I>whence it was;</I> the servants 
 knew whence it was, but had not yet tasted it. If the taster had seen
 the drawing of it, or the drawers had had the tasting of it, something 
 might have been imputed to fancy; but now no room is left for 
 suspicion. 

 2. That it was the best wine. Note, Christ's works commend themselves
 even to those that know not their author. The products of miracles were 
 always the best in their kind. This wine had a <I>stronger body,</I> 
 and <I>better flavour,</I> than ordinary. This the governor of the 
 feast takes notice of to the bridegroom, with an air of pleasantness, 
 as <I>uncommon.</I>

 (1.) The common method was otherwise. Good wine is brought out to the
 best advantage at the beginning of a feast, when the guests have their 
 heads clear and their appetites fresh, and can relish it, and will 
 commend it; but <I>when they have well drank,</I> when their heads are 
 confused, and their appetites palled, good wine is but thrown away upon 
 them, worse will serve then. See the vanity of all the pleasures of 
 sense; they soon surfeit, but never satisfy; the longer they are 
 enjoyed, the less pleasant they grow. 

 (2.) This bridegroom obliged his friends with a reserve of the best
 wine for the grace-cup: <I>Thou hast kept the good wine until now;</I>
 not knowing to whom they were indebted for this good wine, he returns
 the thanks of the table to the bridegroom. <I>She did not know that I
 gave her corn and wine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:8">Hos. ii. 8</A>.
 
 Now, 

 [1.] Christ, in providing thus plentifully for the guests, though he
 hereby allows a sober cheerful use of wine, especially in times of 
 rejoicing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:10">Neh. viii. 10</A>),

 yet he does not invalidate his own caution, nor invade it, in the
 least, which is, that our hearts be not <I>at any time,</I> no not at a
 marriage feast, <I>overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:34">Luke xxi. 34</A>.

 When Christ provided so much <I>good wine</I> for them that had <I>well
 drunk,</I> he intended to try their sobriety, and to teach them <I>how 
 to abound,</I> as well as <I>how to want.</I> Temperance <I>per 
 force</I> is a thankless virtue; but if divine providence gives us 
 abundance of the delights of sense, and divine grace enables us to use 
 them moderately, this is self-denial that is praiseworthy. He also 
 intended that some should be left for the confirmation of the truth of 
 the miracle to the faith of others. And we have reason to think that 
 the guests at this table were so well <I>taught,</I> or at least were 
 now so well awed by the presence of Christ, that none of them abused 
 this wine to excess. Theses two considerations, drawn from this story, 
 may be sufficient at any time to fortify us against temptations to 
 intemperance: <I>First,</I> That our meat and drink are the <I>gifts of 
 God's bounty</I> to us, and we owe our liberty to use them, and our 
 comfort in the use of them, to the mediation of Christ; it is therefore 
 ungrateful and impious to abuse them. <I>Secondly,</I> That, wherever 
 we are, Christ has his eye upon us; we should <I>eat bread before 
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:12">Exod. xviii. 12</A>),

 and then we should not <I>feed ourselves without fear.</I> 

 [2.] He has given us a specimen of the method he takes in dealing with 
 those that deal with him, which is, to reserve the <I>best</I> for the 
 <I>last,</I> and therefore they must <I>deal upon trust.</I> The 
 recompence of their services and sufferings is reserved for the other 
 world; it is a glory <I>to be revealed.</I> The pleasures of sin give 
 their colour in the cup, but <I>at the last bite;</I> but the pleasures 
 of religion will be <I>pleasures for evermore.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In the conclusion of this story 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)
 
 we are told, 

 1. That this was <I>the beginning of miracles</I> which Jesus did. Many
 miracles had been wrought <I>concerning</I> him at his birth and
 baptism, and he himself was the greatest miracle of all; but this was
 the first that was wrought <I>by</I> him. He could have wrought
 miracles when he disputed with the doctors, but his hour was not come.
 He had power, but there was a <I>time of the hiding of his power.</I>
 
 2. That herein he <I>manifested his glory;</I> hereby he proved himself
 to be the Son of God, and his glory to be that of the only-begotten of
 the Father. He also discovered the nature and end of his office; the 
 power of a God, and the grace of a Saviour, appearing in all his 
 miracles, and particularly in this, manifested the glory of the 
 long-expected Messiah. 

 3. That <I>his disciples believed on him.</I> Those whom he had called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:35-51"><I>ch.</I> i.</A>),

 who had seen no miracle, and yet followed him, now saw this, shared in
 it, and had their faith strengthened by it. Note, 

 (1.) Even the faith that is true is at first but weak. The strongest 
 men were once babes, so were the strongest Christians.

 (2.) The manifesting of the glory of Christ is the great confirmation 
 of the faith of Christians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother,
 and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not
 many days.
 &nbsp; 13  And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
 Jerusalem,
 &nbsp; 14  And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and
 doves, and the changers of money sitting:
 &nbsp; 15  And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them
 all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured
 out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
 &nbsp; 16  And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence;
 make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.
 &nbsp; 17  And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal
 of thine house hath eaten me up.
 &nbsp; 18  Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign showest
 thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
 &nbsp; 19  Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and
 in three days I will raise it up.
 &nbsp; 20  Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in
 building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
 &nbsp; 21  But he spake of the temple of his body.
 &nbsp; 22  When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples
 remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the
 scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The short visit Christ made to Capernaum, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It was a large and populous city, about a day's journey from Cana; it 
 is called <I>his own city</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:1">Matt. ix. 1</A>),

 because he made it his head-quarters in Galilee, and what little rest
 he had was there. It was a place of concourse, and <I>therefore</I>
 Christ chose it, that the fame of his doctrine and miracles might 
 thence spread the further. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The company that attended him thither: <I>his mother, his brethren, 
 and his disciples.</I> Wherever Christ went, 

 (1.) He <I>would not</I> go alone, but would take those with him who 
 had put themselves under his guidance, that he might instruct them, and 
 that they might attest his miracles.

 (2.) He <I>could not</I> go alone, but they would follow him, because 
 they liked the sweetness either of his doctrine or of his wine,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:26"><I>ch.</I> vi. 26</A>.

 His mother, though he had lately given her to understand that in the
 works of his ministry he should pay no more respect to her than to any 
 other person, yet followed him; not to intercede with him, but to learn 
 of him. His <I>brethren</I> also and relations, who were at the 
 marriage and were wrought upon by the miracle there, and <I>his 
 disciples,</I> who attended him wherever he went. It should seem, 
 people were more affected with Christ's miracles at first than they 
 were afterwards, when custom made them seem less strange.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His continuance there, which was at this time <I>not many days,</I> 
 designing now only to <I>begin</I> the acquaintance he would afterwards 
 <I>improve</I> there. Christ was still upon the remove, would not 
 confine his usefulness to <I>one</I> place, because <I>many</I> needed 
 him. And he would teach his followers to look upon themselves but as 
 <I>sojourners</I> in this world, and his ministers to follow their 
 opportunities, and go where their work led them. We do not now find 
 Christ in the synagogues, but he privately instructed his friends, and 
 thus entered upon his work <I>by degrees.</I> It is good for young 
 ministers to accustom themselves to pious and edifying discourse in 
 private, that they may with the better preparation, and greater awe, 
 approach their public work. He did not stay long at Capernaum, because 
 the passover was at hand, and he must attend it at Jerusalem; for every 
 thing is beautiful in its season. The less good must give way to the 
 greater, and all the dwellings of Jacob must give place to the gates of 
 Zion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The passover he kept at Jerusalem; it is the <I>first</I> after his 
 baptism, and the evangelist takes notice of all the passovers he kept 
 henceforward, which were four in all, the <I>fourth</I> that at which 
 he suffered (three years after this), and half a year was now past
 since his baptism. Christ, being <I>made under the law,</I> observed
 the passover at Jerusalem; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:17">Exod. xxiii. 17</A>.

 Thus he taught us by his example a strict observance of divine
 institutions, and a diligent attendance on religious assemblies. He 
 went up to Jerusalem when <I>the passover was at hand,</I> that he 
 might be there <I>with the first.</I> It is called <I>the Jews' 
 passover,</I> because it was peculiar to them (Christ is <I>our</I> 
 Passover); now shortly God will no longer own it for his. Christ kept 
 the passover at Jerusalem yearly, ever since he was twelve years old, 
 in obedience to the law; but now that he has entered upon his public 
 ministry we may expect something more from him than before; and two 
 things we are here told he did there:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He <I>purged the temple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:14-17"><I>v.</I> 14-17</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The first place we find him in at Jerusalem was the <I>temple,</I> 
 and, it should seem, he did not make any public appearance till he came 
 thither; for his presence and preaching there were that glory of the 
 latter house which was to <I>exceed the glory of the former,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:9">Hag. ii. 9</A>.
 
 It was foretold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1">Mal. iii. 1</A>):

 <I>I will send my messenger,</I> John Baptist; he never preached in the
 temple, but <I>the Lord, whom ye seek,</I> he shall <I>suddenly come to 
 his temple,</I> suddenly after the appearing of John Baptist; so that 
 this was the time, and the temple the place, when, and where, the 
 Messiah was to be expected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The first work we find him at in the temple was the <I>purging</I> 
 of it; for so it was foretold there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:2,3">Mal. iii. 2, 3</A>):

 <I>He shall sit as a refiner and purify the sons of Levi.</I> Now was
 come the <I>time of reformation.</I> Christ came to be the great 
 reformer; and, according to the method of the reforming kings of Judah, 
 he first <I>purged out</I> what was amiss (and that used to be 
 passover-work too, as in Hezekiah's time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:14,15">2 Chron. xxx. 14, 15</A>,
 
 and Josiah's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:4">2 Kings xxiii. 4</A>,

 &c.), and
 then taught them to do well. First <I>purge out the old leaven,</I> and 
 then <I>keep the feast.</I> Christ's design in coming into the world 
 was to reform the world; and he expects that all who come to him should 
 reform their hearts and lives, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:2">Gen. xxxv. 2</A>.

 And this he has taught us by purging the temple. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What were the corruptions that were to be purged out. He found a 
 market in one of the courts of the temple, that which was called the 
 <I>court of the Gentiles,</I> within the <I>mountain of that house.</I> 
 There, <I>First,</I> They sold <I>oxen, and sheep, and doves,</I> for 
 sacrifice; we will suppose, not for common use, but for the convenience 
 of those who came out of the country, and could not bring their 
 sacrifices <I>in kind</I> along with them; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+14:24-26">Deut. xiv. 24-26</A>.

 This <I>market</I> perhaps had been kept by the pool of Bethesda

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:2"><I>ch.</I> v. 2</A>),

 but was admitted into the temple by the chief priests, for filthy
 lucre; for, no doubt, the rents for standing there, and fees for
 searching the beasts sold there, and certifying that they were
 <I>without blemish,</I> would be a considerable revenue to them. Great
 corruptions in the church owe their rise to the love of money, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:5,10">1 Tim. vi. 5, 10.</A>

 <I>Secondly,</I> They <I>changed money,</I> for the convenience of
 those that were to pay a half-shekel <I>in specie</I> every year, by 
 way of poll, for the service of the tabernacle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:12">Exod. xxx. 12</A>),

 and no doubt they got by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What course our Lord took to purge out those corruptions. He had 
 seen these in the temple formerly, when he was in a private station; 
 but never went about to drive them out till now, when he had taken upon 
 him the public character of a prophet. He did not complain to the
 chief priests, for he knew they countenanced those corruptions. But he 
 himself,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First, Drove out the sheep and oxen,</I> and those that <I>sold 
 them,</I> out of the temple. He never used <I>force</I> to drive any 
 <I>into</I> the temple, but only to drive those out that profaned it. 
 He did not seize the sheep and oxen for himself, did not 
 <I>distrain</I> and impound them, though he found them <I>damage 
 faissant-actual trespassers</I> upon his Father's ground; he only drove 
 them out, and their owners with them. He made a scourge of <I>small 
 cords,</I> which probably they had led their sheep and oxen with, and 
 thrown them away upon the ground, whence Christ gathered them. Sinners 
 prepare the scourges with which they themselves will be driven out from 
 the temple of the Lord. He did not make a scourge to chastise the 
 offenders (his punishments are of another nature), but only to drive
 out the cattle; he aimed no further than at reformation. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:3,4,2Co+10:8">Rom. xiii. 3, 4; 2 Cor. x. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He <I>poured out the changers' money,</I> <B><I>to 
 kerma</I></B>--<I>the small money</I>--the <I>Nummorum Famulus.</I> In
 <I>pouring out</I> the money, he showed his contempt of it; he threw it 
 to the ground, to the earth as it <I>was.</I> In <I>overthrowing</I> the 
 tables, he showed his displeasure against those that make religion a 
 matter of worldly gain. Money-changers in the temple are the scandal of 
 it. Note, In reformation, it is good to make thorough work; he <I>drove 
 them all out;</I> and not only threw out the money, but, in overturning 
 the tables, threw out the trade too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly, He said to them that sold doves</I> (sacrifices for the 
 poor), <I>Take these things hence.</I> The doves, though they took up 
 less room, and were a less nuisance than the oxen and sheep, yet must 
 not be allowed there. The sparrows and swallows were welcome, that were 
 left to God's providence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:3">Ps. lxxxiv. 3</A>),

 but not the doves, that were appropriated to man's profit. God's temple
 must not be made a pigeon-house. But see Christ's prudence in his zeal. 
 When he drove out the sheep and oxen, the owners might follow them; 
 when he poured out the money, they might gather it up again; but, if he 
 had turned the doves flying, perhaps they could not have been 
 retrieved; therefore to them that sold doves he said, <I>Take these 
 things hence.</I> Note, Discretion must always guide and govern our 
 zeal, that we do nothing unbecoming ourselves, or mischievous to 
 others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> He gave them a good reason for what he did: <I>Make 
 not my Father's house a house of merchandise.</I> Reason for conviction 
 should accompany force for correction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> Here is a reason why they should not profane the temple, 
 because it was the <I>house of God,</I> and not to be made a house of 
 merchandise. Merchandise is a good thing in the exchange, but not in 
 the temple. This was, 

 (<I>a.</I>) to <I>alienate</I> that which was dedicated to the honour 
 of God; it was <I>sacrilege;</I> it was robbing God.

 (<I>b.</I>) It was to debase that which was solemn and awful, and to 
 make it mean.

 (<I>c.</I>) It was to disturb and distract those services in which men 
 ought to be most solemn, serious, and intent. It was particularly an 
 affront to the <I>sons of the stranger</I> in their worship to be 
 forced to herd themselves with the sheep and oxen, and to be distracted 
 in their worship by the noise of a market, for this market was kept in 
 the court of the Gentiles.

 (<I>d.</I>) It was to make the business of religion subservient to a
 secular interest; for the holiness of the place must advance the
 market, and promote the sale of their commodities. Those make God's
 house a house of merchandise, 

 [<I>a.</I>] Whose minds are filled with cares about worldly business 
 when they are attending on religious exercises, as those, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:5,Eze+33:31">Amos viii. 5; Ezek. xxxiii. 31</A>.

 [<I>b.</I>] Who perform divine offices for filthy lucre, and sell the
 gifts of the Holy Ghost,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:18">Acts viii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> Here is a reason why he was concerned to purge it, because it 
 <I>was his Father's house.</I> And, 

 (<I>a.</I>) Therefore he had authority to purge it, for he was
 faithful, as a Son <I>over his own house.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:5,6">Heb. iii. 5, 6</A>.

 In calling God his Father, he intimates that he was the Messiah, of
 whom it was said, <I>He shall build a house for my name, and I will be 
 his Father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:13,14">2 Sam. vii. 13, 14</A>.

 (<I>b.</I>) Therefore he had a zeal for the purging of it: "It is <I>my 
 Father's house,</I> and therefore I cannot bear to see it profaned, and 
 <I>him</I> dishonoured." Note, If God be our Father in heaven, and it 
 be therefore our desire that his name may be sanctified, it cannot but 
 be our grief to see it polluted. Christ's purging the temple thus may 
 justly be reckoned among his <I>wonderful works. Inter omnia signa 
 qu&aelig; fecit Dominus, hoc mihi videtur esse mirabilius--Of all 
 Christ's wonderful works this appears to me the most
 wonderful.</I>--Hieron. Considering,

 [<I>a.</I>] That he did it without the <I>assistance</I> of any of his 
 <I>friends;</I> probably it had been no hard matter to have raised the 
 <I>mob,</I> who had a great veneration for the temple, against these 
 profaners of it; but Christ never countenanced any thing that was 
 tumultuous or disorderly. There was one to <I>uphold,</I> but his own 
 arm did it. 

 [<I>b.</I>] That he did it without the <I>resistance</I> of any of his 
 <I>enemies,</I> either the market-people themselves, or the chief 
 priests that gave them their licences, and had the <I>posse 
 templi--temple force,</I> at their command. But the corruption was too 
 plain to be justified; sinners' own consciences are reformers' best 
 friends; yet that was not all, there was a divine power put forth 
 herein, a power over the spirits of men; and in this non-resistance of 
 theirs that scripture was fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:2,3">Mal. iii. 2, 3</A>),
 
 <I>Who shall stand when he appeareth?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fifthly,</I> Here is the remark which his disciples made upon it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):
 
 <I>They remembered that it was written, The Zeal of thine house hath
 eaten me up.</I> They were somewhat surprised at first to see him to
 whom they were directed as the <I>Lamb of God</I> in such a heat, and
 him whom they believed to be the <I>King of Israel</I> take so little
 state upon him as to do this himself; but one scripture came to their
 thoughts, which taught them to reconcile this action both with the
 meekness of the <I>Lamb of God</I> and with the majesty of the <I>King
 of Israel;</I> for David, speaking of the Messiah, takes notice of his
 <I>zeal for God's house,</I> as so great that it even <I>ate him
 up,</I> it made him forget himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:9">Ps. lxix. 9</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The disciples came to understand the meaning of what Christ did, by
 remembering the scriptures: <I>They remembered</I> now <I>that it was 
 written.</I> Note, The word of God and the works of God do mutually 
 explain and illustrate each other. Dark scriptures are expounded by 
 their accomplishment in providence, and difficult providences are made 
 easy by comparing them with the scriptures. See of what great use it is 
 to the disciples of Christ to be <I>ready</I> and <I>mighty</I> in the 
 scriptures, and to have their memories well stored with scripture 
 truths, by which they will be <I>furnished for every good work,</I> 

 2. The scripture they remembered was very apposite: <I>The zeal of
 thine house hath eaten me up.</I> David was in this a type of Christ 
 that he was <I>zealous for God's house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:2,3">Ps. cxxxii. 2, 3</A>.

 What he did for it was <I>with all his might;</I> see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:2">1 Chron. xxix. 2</A>.

 The latter part of that verse

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:9">Ps. lxix. 9</A>)

 is applied to Christ
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:3">Rom. xv. 3</A>),

 as the former part of it here. All the graces that were to be found
 among the Old-Testament saints were eminently in Christ, and 
 particularly this of zeal for the house of God, and in them, as they 
 were patterns to us, so they were types of him. Observe,

 (1.) Jesus Christ was zealously affected to the house of God, his
 church: he loved it, and was always jealous for its honour and welfare.

 (2.) This zeal did even <I>eat him up;</I> it made him <I>humble</I>
 himself, and <I>spend</I> himself, and <I>expose</I> himself. <I>My
 zeal has consumed me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:139">Ps. cxix. 139</A>.

 Zeal for the house of God forbids us to consult our own credit, ease,
 and safety, when they come in competition with our duty and Christ's 
 service, and sometimes carries on our souls in our duty so far and so 
 fast that our bodies cannot keep pace with them, and makes us as deaf 
 as our Master was to those who suggested, <I>Spare thyself.</I> The 
 grievances here redressed might seem but small, and such as should have 
 been connived at; but such was Christ's zeal that he could not bear 
 even <I>those</I> that <I>sold and bought in the temple. Si ibi ebrios 
 inveniret quid faceret Dominus!</I> (saith St. Austin.) <I>If he had 
 found drunkards in the temple, how much more would he have been 
 displeased!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ, having thus purged the temple, gave a sign to those who 
 demanded it to prove his authority for so doing. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Their demand of a sign: <I>Then answered the Jews,</I> that is the 
 multitude of the people, with their leaders. Being Jews, they should 
 rather have stood by him, and assisted him to vindicate the honour of 
 their temple; but, instead of this, they objected against it. Note,
 Those who apply themselves in good earnest to the work of reformation 
 must expect to meet with opposition. When they could object nothing 
 against the thing itself, they questioned his authority to do it: 
 "<I>What sign showest thou unto us,</I> to prove thyself authorized and 
 commissioned to do these things?" It was indeed a good work to purge 
 the temple; but what had he to do to undertake it, who was in no office 
 there? They looked upon it as an act of jurisdiction, and that he must 
 prove himself <I>a prophet, yea, more than a prophet.</I> But was not 
 the thing itself sign enough? His ability to drive so many from their 
 posts, without opposition, was a proof of his authority; he that was 
 armed with such a divine power was surely armed with a divine 
 commission. <I>What ailed these</I> buyers and sellers, <I>that they 
 fled, that they were driven back?</I> Surely it was <I>at the presence 
 of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:5,7">Ps. cxiv. 5, 7</A>),
 
 no less a presence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ's answer to this demand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He did not immediately work a miracle to convince them, but gave them a 
 sign in something <I>to come,</I> the truth of which must appear by the 
 event, according to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:21,22">Deut. xviii. 21, 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, 

 [1.] The sign that he gives them is his own <I>death</I> and 
 <I>resurrection.</I> He refers them to that which would be, 
 <I>First,</I> His <I>last</I> sign. If they would not be convinced by 
 what they saw and heard, let them <I>wait. Secondly,</I> The <I>great
 sign</I> to prove him to be the Messiah; for concerning him it was 
 foretold that he should be bruised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:5">Isa. liii. 5</A>),
 
 <I>cut off</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:26">Dan. ix. 26</A>),

 and yet that he should not see corruption, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:10">Ps. xvi. 10.</A>

 These things were fulfilled in the blessed Jesus, and therefore
 <I>truly he was the Son of God,</I> and had authority in the temple, 
 his Father's house.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He foretels his death and resurrection, not in plain terms, as he 
 often did to his disciples, but in figurative expressions; as 
 afterwards, when he gave this for a sign, he called it the <I>sign of 
 the prophet Jonas,</I> so here, <I>Destroy this temple, and in three 
 days I will raise it up.</I> Thus he spoke in parables to those who 
 were willingly ignorant, that <I>they might not perceive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:13,14">Matt. xiii. 13, 14</A>.

 Those that will not see shall not see. Nay, this figurative speech used
 here proved such a <I>stumbling-block</I> to them that it was produced 
 in evidence against him at his trial to prove him a blasphemer.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:60,61">Matt. xxvi. 60, 61</A>.

 Had they humbly asked him the meaning of what he said, he would have
 told them, and it had been a savour of life unto life to them, but they 
 were resolved to cavil, and it proved a savour of death unto death. 
 They that would not be convinced were hardened, and the manner of 
 expressing this prediction occasioned the accomplishment of the 
 prediction itself. <I>First,</I> He foretels his death by the Jews' 
 malice, in these words, <I>Destroy you this temple;</I> that is, "You 
 will destroy it, I know you will. I will permit you to destroy it." 
 Note, Christ, even at the beginning of his ministry, had a clear 
 foresight of all his sufferings at the end of it, and yet went on 
 cheerfully in it. It is good, at <I>setting out,</I> to expect the 
 <I>worst. Secondly,</I> He foretels his resurrection by his own power: 
 In <I>three days I will raise it up.</I> There were others that <I>were 
 raised,</I> but Christ raised himself, resumed his own life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] He chose to express this by <I>destroying</I> and 
 <I>re-edifying</I> the temple, <I>First,</I> Because he was now to 
 justify himself in purging the temple, which they had profaned; as if 
 he had said, "You that defile one temple will destroy another; and I 
 will prove my authority to <I>purge</I> what you have <I>defiled</I> by 
 <I>raising</I> what you will <I>destroy.</I>" The profaning of the 
 temple is the <I>destroying</I> of it, and its reformation its 
 <I>resurrection. Secondly,</I> Because the death of Christ was indeed 
 the destruction of the Jewish temple, the procuring cause of it; and 
 his resurrection was the raising up of another temple, the gospel 
 church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:12">Zech. vi. 12</A>.
 
 The ruins of their place and <I>nation</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:48"><I>ch.</I> xi. 48</A>)
 
 were the riches of the world. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:11,Ac+15:16">Amos ix. 11; Acts xv. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Their cavil at this answer: "<I>Forty and six years was this 
 temple in building,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20.</A>

 Temple work was always slow work, and canst thou make such quick work 
 of it?" Now here,

 [1.] They show <I>some knowledge;</I> they could tell how long the 
 temple was in building. Dr. Lightfoot computes that it was just 
 forty-six years from the founding of Zerubbabel's temple, in the second 
 year of Cyrus, to the complete settlement of the temple service, in the 
 32nd year of Artaxerxes; and the same from Herod's beginning to build 
 this temple, in the 18th year of his reign, to this very time, when the 
 Jews said that this as just forty-six years: 
 <B><I>okodomethe</I></B>--<I>hath this temple been built.</I> 

 [2.] They show <I>more ignorance, First,</I> Of the <I>meaning of 
 Christ's words.</I> Note, Men often run into gross mistakes by 
 understanding that literally which the scripture speaks figuratively. 
 What abundance of mischief has been done by interpreting, <I>This is my 
 body,</I> after a corporal and carnal manner! <I>Secondly,</I> Of 
 <I>the almighty power of Christ,</I> as if he could do no more than 
 another man. Had they known that this was he who <I>built all 
 things</I> in six days they would not have made it such an absurdity 
 that he should build a temple in three days.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) A vindication of Christ's answer from their cavil. The difficulty 
 is soon solved by explaining the terms: <I>He spoke of the temple of 
 his body,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Though Christ had discovered a great respect for the temple, in 
 <I>purging</I> it, yet he will have us know that the holiness of it, 
 which he was so jealous for, was but <I>typical,</I> and leads us to 
 the consideration of another temple of which that was but a shadow, the 
 substance being Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:9,Col+2:17">Heb. ix. 9; Col. ii. 17</A>.

 Some think that when he said, Destroy <I>this</I> temple, he pointed to
 his own body, or laid his hand upon it; however, it is certain that he 
 <I>spoke of the temple of his body.</I> Note, The body of Christ is the 
 true temple, of which that at Jerusalem was a type.

 [1.] Like the temple, it was built by immediate divine direction: "<I>A
 body hast thou prepared me,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:19">1 Chron. xxviii. 19</A>.

 [2.] Like the temple, it was a <I>holy house;</I> it is called <I>that
 holy thing.</I> 

 [3.] It was, like the temple, the habitation of God's glory; there the 
 eternal Word dwelt, the true shechinah. He is <I>Emmanuel--God with 
 us.</I> 

 [4.] The temple was the place and <I>medium</I> of intercourse between 
 God and Israel: there God revealed himself to them; there they 
 presented themselves and their services to him. Thus by Christ God 
 speaks to us, and we speak to him. Worshippers looked <I>towards</I> 
 that house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:30,35">1 Kings viii. 30, 35</A>.

 So we must worship God with an eye to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) A reflection which the disciples made upon this, long after, 
 inserted here, to illustrate the story 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>When he was risen from the dead,</I> some years after, <I>his
 disciples remembered that he had said this.</I> We found them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>,

 remembering what had been <I>written before of him,</I> and here we
 find them remembering what they had <I>heard from him.</I> Note, The
 memories of Christ's disciples should be like the treasure of the good
 house-holder, furnished with things both <I>new</I> and <I>old,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:52">Matt. xiii. 52</A>.

 Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] <I>When they remembered</I> that saying: <I>When he was risen from 
 the dead.</I> It seems, they did not at this time fully understand 
 Christ's meaning, for they were as yet but babes in knowledge; but they 
 laid up the saying in their hearts, and afterwards it became both 
 intelligible and useful. Note, It is good to <I>hear for the time to 
 come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:23">Isa. xlii. 23</A>.

 The juniors in years and profession should treasure up those truths of
 which at present they do not well understand either the meaning or the 
 use, for they will be serviceable to them hereafter, when they come to 
 greater proficiency. It was said of the scholars of Pythagoras that his 
 precepts seemed to freeze in them till they were forty years old, and 
 then they began to thaw; so this saying of Christ revived in the 
 memories of his disciples <I>when he was risen from the dead;</I> and 
 why the? <I>First,</I> Because <I>then</I> the Spirit was poured out to 
 bring things to their remembrance which Christ had said to them, and to 
 make them both <I>easy</I> and <I>ready</I> to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:26"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 26</A>.

 That very day that Christ rose form the dead he <I>opened their
 understandings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:45">Luke xxiv. 45</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Because then this saying of Christ was fulfilled. When
 the temple of his body had been <I>destroyed</I> and was <I>raised 
 again,</I> and that upon the <I>third day,</I> then they remembered 
 this among other words which Christ had said to this purport. Note, It 
 contributes much to the understanding of the scripture to observe the 
 fulfilling of the scripture. The event will expound the prophecy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What use they made of it: <I>They believed the scripture, and the 
 word that Jesus had said;</I> their belief of these was confirmed and 
 received fresh support and vigour. They were slow of heart to believe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:25">Luke xxiv. 25</A>),

 but they were <I>sure.</I> The <I>scripture</I> and the <I>word of
 Christ</I> are here put together, not because they concur and exactly
 agree together, but because they mutually illustrate and strengthen 
 each other. When the disciples saw both what they had read in the Old 
 Testament, and what they had heard from Christ's own mouth, fulfilled 
 in his death and resurrection, they were the more confirmed in their 
 belief of both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast
 <I>day,</I> many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles
 which he did.

 all <I>men,</I>
 &nbsp; 25  And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew
 what was in man.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the success, the poor success, of Christ's 
 preaching and miracles at Jerusalem, while he kept the passover there.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That our Lord Jesus, when he was at Jerusalem at the passover, did 
 preach and work miracles. People's <I>believing on him</I> implied that 
 he preached; and it is expressly said, <I>They saw the miracles he 
 did.</I> He was now in Jerusalem, the holy city, whence the <I>word of 
 the Lord</I> was to go <I>froth.</I> His residence was mostly in 
 Galilee, and therefore when he was <I>in Jerusalem</I> he was very 
 busy. The time was holy time, <I>the feast-day,</I> time appointed for 
 the service of God; at the passover the <I>Levites taught the good 
 knowledge of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:22">2 Chron. xxx. 22</A>),

 and Christ took that opportunity of preaching, when the concourse of
 people was great, and thus he would own and honour the divine 
 institution of the passover.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That hereby many were brought to <I>believe in his name,</I> to 
 acknowledge him a <I>teacher come from God,</I> as Nicodemus did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:2"><I>ch.</I> iii. 2</A>),

 a great prophet; and, probably, some of those who <I>looked for
 redemption in Jerusalem</I> believed him to be the Messiah promised, so 
 ready were they to welcome the first appearance of that <I>bright and 
 morning star.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That yet <I>Jesus did not commit himself unto them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):
 
 <B><I>ouk episteuen heauton autois</I></B>--<I>He did not trust himself
 with them.</I> It is the same word that is used for <I>believing</I> in 
 him. So that to believe in Christ is to <I>commit ourselves</I> to him 
 and to his guidance. Christ did not see cause to repose any confidence 
 in these new converts at Jerusalem, where he had many enemies that 
 sought to destroy him, either, 

 1. Because they were <I>false,</I> at least some of them, and would
 betray him if they had an opportunity, or were strongly tempted to do 
 so. He had more disciples that he could trust among the Galileans than 
 among the dwellers at Jerusalem. In dangerous times and places, it is 
 wisdom to take heed in whom you confide; <B><I>memneso 
 apistein</I></B>--<I>learn to distrust.</I> Or, 

 2. Because they were <I>weak,</I> and I would hope that this was the
 worst of it; not that they were <I>treacherous</I> and designed him a 
 mischief, but,

 (1.) They were <I>timorous,</I> and wanted zeal and courage, and might 
 perhaps be frightened to do a wrong thing. In times of difficulty and 
 danger, cowards are not fit to be trusted. Or,

 (2.) They were <I>tumultuous,</I> and wanted discretion and management.
 These in Jerusalem perhaps had their expectations of the 
 <I>temporal</I> reign of the Messiah more raised than others, and, in 
 that expectation, would be ready to give some bold strokes at the 
 government if Christ would have <I>committed himself to them</I> and 
 put himself at the head of them; but he would not, for his kingdom is 
 not of this world. We should be shy of turbulent unquiet people, as our 
 Master here was, though they profess to <I>believe in Christ,</I> as 
 these did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That the reason why he did not <I>commit himself</I> to them was 
 because he <I>knew</I> them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 knew the wickedness of some and the weakness of others. The evangelist
 takes this occasion to assert Christ's omniscience. 

 1. He <I>knew all men,</I> not only their names and faces, as it is
 possible for us to know many, but their nature, dispositions, 
 affections, designs, as we do not know <I>any man,</I> scarcely 
 <I>ourselves.</I> He knows <I>all men,</I> for his powerful hand made 
 them all, his piercing eye sees them all, sees into them. He knows his 
 <I>subtle enemies,</I> and all their secret projects; his <I>false 
 friends,</I> and their true characters; what they really are, whatever 
 they pretend to be. He knows them that are truly his, knows their 
 integrity, and knows their infirmity too. He <I>knows their frame.</I> 
 
 2. He <I>needed not that any should testify of man.</I> His knowledge
 was not by information from others, but by his own infallible 
 intuition. It is the infelicity of earthly princes that they must see 
 with other men's eyes, and hear with other men's ears, and take things 
 as they are represented to them; but Christ goes purely upon his own 
 knowledge. Angels are his messengers, but not his spies, for <I>his own
 eyes run to and fro through the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9">2 Chron. xvi. 9</A>.

 This may comfort us in reference to Satan's accusations, that Christ
 will not take men's characters from him.

 3. He <I>knew what was in man;</I> in particular persons, in the nature
 and race of man. We know what is done <I>by men;</I> Christ knows what 
 is <I>in them, tries the heart and the reins.</I> This is the 
 prerogative of that essential eternal Word,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12,13">Heb. iv. 12, 13</A>.

 We invade his prerogative if we presume to judge men's hearts. How fit
 is Christ to be the <I>Saviour of men,</I> very fit to be the 
 physician, who has such a perfect knowledge of the patient's state and 
 case, temper and distemper; knows what is in him! How fit also to be 
 the <I>Judge of all!</I> For the judgment of him who knows <I>all 
 men,</I> all <I>in</I> men, must needs be <I>according to 
 truth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now this is all the success of Christ's preaching and miracles at 
 Jerusalem, in this journey. The Lord comes to his temple, and none come
 to him but a parcel of weak simple people, that he can neither have
 <I>credit</I> from nor put <I>confidence</I> in; yet he shall at length 
 <I>see of the travail of his soul.</I></P>
