 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A great variety of observable passages we have, in this chapter, 
 concerning our Lord Jesus, the substance of all which we had before in 
 Matthew, but divers circumstances we have, which we did not there meet 
 with. Here is, 

 I. Christ contemned by his countrymen, because he was one of them, and
 they knew, or thought they knew, his original, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. The just power he gave his apostles over unclean spirits, and an
 account given of their negotiation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:7-13">ver. 7-13</A>.

 III. A strange notion which Herod and others had of Christ, upon which
 occasion we have the story of the martyrdom of John Baptist, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:14-29">ver. 14-29</A>.
 
 IV. Christ's retirement into a desert place with his disciples; the
 crowds that followed him thither to receive instruction from him; and
 his feeding five thousand of them with five loaves and two fishes, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:30-44">ver. 30-44</A>.

 V. Christ's walking upon the sea to his disciples, and the abundance
 of cures he wrought on the other side of the water, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:45-56">ver. 45-56</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And he went out from thence, and came into his own country;
 and his disciples follow him.
 &nbsp; 2  And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the
 synagogue: and many hearing <I>him</I> were astonished, saying, From
 whence hath this <I>man</I> these things? and what wisdom <I>is</I> this
 which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought
 by his hands?
 &nbsp; 3  Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of
 James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters
 here with us? And they were offended at him.
 &nbsp; 4  But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour,
 but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own
 house.
 &nbsp; 5  And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his
 hands upon a few sick folk, and healed <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 6  And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round
 about the villages, teaching.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, I. Christ makes a visit to <I>his own country,</I> the place not 
 of his birth, but of his education; that was <I>Nazareth;</I> where his 
 relations were. He had been in danger of his life among them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:29">Luke iv. 29</A>),

 and yet he came among them again; so strangely doth he wait to be 
 gracious, and seek the salvation of his enemies. Whither he went, 
 though it was into danger, <I>his disciples followed him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);
 
 for they had left all, to follow him whithersoever he went.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. There he <I>preached</I> in their <I>synagogue,</I> on the 
 <I>sabbath day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It seems, there was not such flocking to him there as in other places, 
 so that he had no opportunity of preaching till they came together on 
 the sabbath day; and then he expounded a portion of scripture with 
 great clearness. In religious assemblies, on sabbath days, the word of 
 God is to be preached according to Christ's example. We <I>give 
 glory</I> to God by receiving instruction from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They could not but own that which was very honourable concerning 
 him. 

 1. That he spoke with great <I>wisdom,</I> and that this wisdom was
 <I>given to him,</I> for they knew he had no learned education. 

 2. That he did <I>mighty works,</I> did them with his own hands, for
 the confirming of the doctrine he taught. They acknowledged the two 
 great proofs of the divine original of his gospel--the <I>divine 
 wisdom</I> that appeared in the contrivance of it, and the <I>divine 
 power</I> that was exerted for the ratifying and recommending of it; 
 and yet, though they could not deny the premises, they would not admit 
 the conclusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They studied to disparage him, and to raise prejudices in the minds 
 of people against him, notwithstanding. All this <I>wisdom,</I> and all 
 these <I>mighty works,</I> shall be of no account, because he had a 
 home-education, had never travelled, nor been at any university, or 
 bred up at the feet of any of their doctors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 <I>Is not this the Carpenter?</I> In Matthew, they upbraid him with 
 being the carpenter's son, his supposed father Joseph being of that 
 trade. But, it seems, they could say further, <I>Is not this the 
 Carpenter?</I> our Lord Jesus, it is probable, employing himself in 
 that business with his father, before he entered upon his public 
 ministry, at least, sometimes in journey-work. 

 1. He would thus <I>humble himself,</I> and make himself of no
 reputation, as one that had taken upon him the form of a servant, and 
 came to minister. Thus low did our Redeemer stoop, when he came to 
 redeem us out of our low estate. 

 2. He would thus teach us to <I>abhor idleness,</I> and to find
 <I>ourselves something to do</I> in this world; and rather to take up 
 with mean and laborious employments, and such as no more is to be got 
 by than a bare livelihood, than indulge ourselves in sloth. Nothing is 
 more pernicious for young people than to get a <I>habit of 
 sauntering.</I> The Jews had a good rule for this--that their young men 
 who were designed for scholars, were yet bred up to some trade, as Paul 
 was a tent-maker, that they might have some business to fill up their 
 time with, and, if need were, to get their bread with. 

 3. He would thus put an honour upon despised mechanics, and encourage
 those who eat the labour of their hands, though great men look upon 
 them with contempt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Another thing they upbraided him with, was, the meanness of his 
 relations; "<I>He is the son of Mary;</I> his <I>brethren</I> and 
 <I>sisters</I> are here <I>with us;</I> we know his family and 
 kindred;" and therefore, though they were <I>astonished</I> at his 
 doctrine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 yet they were <I>offended</I> at his person 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 were prejudiced against him, and looked upon him with contempt; and for 
 that reason would not receive his doctrine, though ever so well 
 recommended. May we think that if they had not known his pedigree, but 
 he had dropped among them from the clouds, without father, without 
 mother, and without descent, they would have entertained him with any 
 more respect? Truly, no; for in Judea, where this was not know, that 
 was made an objection against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:29">John ix. 29</A>);

 <I>As for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</I> Obstinate 
 unbelief will never want excuses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Let us see how Christ bore this contempt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He partly <I>excused it,</I> as a common thing, and what might be 
 expected, though not reasonably or justly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 <I>A prophet is not despised any where but in his own country.</I> Some 
 exceptions there may be to this rule; doubtless many have got over this 
 prejudice, but ordinarily it holds good, that ministers are seldom so 
 acceptable and successful in their own country as among strangers; 
 <I>familiarity</I> in the younger years breeds a contempt, the 
 advancement of one that was an inferior begets <I>envy,</I> and men 
 will hardly set those among the guides of their souls whose fathers 
 they were ready to set with the dogs of their flock; in such a case 
 therefore it must not be thought hard, it is common treatment, it was 
 Christ's, and <I>wisdom is profitable to direct</I> to other soil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He did <I>some good</I> among them, notwithstanding the slights they 
 put upon him, for he is kind even to the evil and unthankful; <I>He 
 laid his hands upon a few sick folks, and healed them.</I> Note, It is 
 generous, and becoming the followers of Christ, to content themselves 
 with the pleasure and satisfaction of doing good, though they be 
 unjustly denied the praise of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Yet he <I>could there do</I> no such mighty works, at least not so 
 many, as in other places, because of the unbelief that prevailed among 
 the people, by reason of the prejudices which their leaders instilled 
 into them against Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It is a strange expression, as if unbelief tied the hands of 
 omnipotence itself; he <I>would have done</I> as many miracles there as 
 he had done elsewhere, but he could not, because people would not make 
 application to him, nor sue for his favours; he could have wrought 
 them, but they forfeited the honour of having them wrought for them. 
 Note, By unbelief and contempt of Christ men stop the current of his 
 favours to them, and put a bar in their own door.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He <I>marvelled because of their unbelief,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 We never find Christ wondering but at the <I>faith</I> of the Gentiles 
 that were strangers, as the <I>centurion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:10">Matt. viii. 10</A>),

 and the woman of Samaria, and at the unbelief of Jews that were his own 
 countrymen. Note, The unbelief of those that enjoy the means of grace,
 is a most amazing thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He <I>went round about the village, teaching.</I> If we cannot do 
 good where we would, we must do it where we can, and be glad if we may 
 have any opportunity, though but in the villages, of serving Christ and 
 souls. Sometimes the gospel of Christ finds better entertainment in the 
 country villages, where there is less wealth, and pomp, and mirth, and 
 subtlety, than in the populous cities.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And he called <I>unto him</I> the twelve, and began to send them
 forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
 &nbsp; 8  And commanded them that they should take nothing for <I>their</I>
 journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in
 <I>their</I> purse:
 &nbsp; 9  But <I>be</I> shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.
 &nbsp; 10  And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an
 house, there abide till ye depart from that place.
 &nbsp; 11  And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye
 depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony
 against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable
 for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that
 city.
 &nbsp; 12  And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
 &nbsp; 13  And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many
 that were sick, and healed <I>them.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The commission given to the twelve apostles, to preach and work 
 miracles; it is the same which we had more largely, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:1-42">Matt. x</A>.

 Mark doth not name them here, as Matthew doth, because he had named
 them before, when they were first called into fellowship with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+3:16-19"><I>ch.</I> iii. 16-19</A>.

 Hitherto they had been conversant with Christ, and had set at his feet,
 had heard his doctrine, and seen his miracles; and now he determines to 
 make some use of them; they had <I>received,</I> that they might 
 <I>give,</I> had <I>learned,</I> that they might <I>teach;</I> and 
 therefore now he <I>began to send them forth.</I> They must not always 
 be studying in the academy, to get knowledge, but they must preach in 
 the country, to do good with the knowledge they have got. Though they
 were not as yet so well accomplished as they were to be, yet, according 
 to their present ability and capacity, they must be set to work, and 
 make further improvements afterward. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That Christ sent them forth <I>by two and two;</I> this Mark takes 
 notice of. They went two and two to a place, that out of the mouth of 
 two witnesses every word might be established; and that they might be 
 company for one another when they were among strangers, and might 
 strengthen the hands, and encourage the hearts, one of another; might 
 help one another if any thing should be amiss, and keep one another in 
 countenance. Every common soldier has his comrade; and it is an 
 approved maxim, <I>Two are better than one.</I> Christ would thus teach 
 his ministers to associate, and both lend and borrow help.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he <I>gave them power over unclean spirits.</I> He commissioned 
 them to attack the devil's kingdom, and empowered them, as a specimen 
 of their breaking his interest in the souls of men by their doctrine, 
 to cast him out of the bodies of those that were possessed. Dr. 
 Lightfoot suggests, that they cured diseases, and cast out devils, by 
 the Spirit, but preached that only which they had learned from the 
 mouth of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he <I>commanded them</I> not to take provisions along with 
 them, neither <I>victuals</I> nor <I>money,</I> that they might appear, 
 wherever they came, to be poor men, men not of this world, and 
 therefore might with the better grace call people off from it to 
 another world. When afterward he bid them <I>take purse and scrip</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:36">Luke xxii. 36</A>),

 that did not intimate (as Dr. Lightfoot observes) that his care of them
 was abated from what it had been; but that they should meet with worse 
 times and worse entertainment than they met with at their first 
 mission. In Matthew and Luke they are forbidden to <I>take staves</I> 
 with them, that is, fighting staves; but here in Mark they are bid to 
 take nothing save a <I>staff only,</I> that is, a walking staff, such 
 as pilgrims carried. They must not put on <I>shoes,</I> but 
 <I>sandals</I> only, which were only the soles of shoes tied under 
 their feet, or like pumps, or slippers; they must go in the readiest 
 plainest dress they could, and must not so much as have <I>two 
 coats;</I> for their stay abroad would be short, they must return 
 before winter, and what they wanted, those they preached to would 
 cheerfully accommodate them with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He directed them, whatever city they came to, to make that house 
 their head-quarters, which happened to be their first quarters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);
 
 "<I>There abide, till ye depart from that place.</I> And since ye know 
 ye come on an errand sufficient to make you welcome, have such charity 
 for your friends that first invited you, as to believe they do not 
 think you burthensome."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He pronounces a very heavy doom upon those that rejected the gospel 
 they preached 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 "<I>Whosoever shall not receive you,</I> or will not so much as <I>hear 
 you, depart thence</I> (if one will not, another will), and <I>shake 
 off the dust under your feet, for a testimony against</I> them. Let 
 them know that they have had a fair offer of life and happiness made 
 them, witness that dust; but that, since they have refused it, they 
 cannot expect ever to have another; let them take up with their own 
 dust, for so shall their doom be." That dust, like the dust of Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:9">Exod. ix. 9</A>),

 shall turn into a plague to them; and their condemnation in the great 
 day, will be more intolerable than <I>that of Sodom:</I> for the angels 
 were sent to Sodom, and were abused there; yet that would not bring on 
 so great a guilt and so great a ruin as the contempt and abuse of the 
 apostles of Christ, who bring with them the offers of gospel grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostles' conduct in pursuance of their commission. Though they 
 were conscious to themselves of great weakness, and expected no secular 
 advantage by it, yet, in obedience to their Master's order, and in 
 dependence upon his strength, they <I>went out</I> as Abraham, not 
 knowing whither they went. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The doctrine they preached; <I>They preached that men should 
 repent</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 that they should change their minds, and reform their lives, in 
 consideration of the near approach of the kingdom of the Messiah. Note, 
 The great design of the gospel preachers, and the great tendency of 
 gospel preaching, should be, to bring people to repentance, to a <I>new 
 heart</I> and a <I>new way.</I> They did not amuse people with curious 
 speculations, but told them that they must repent of their sins, and 
 turn to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The miracles they wrought. The power Christ gave them <I>over 
 unclean spirits,</I> was not ineffectual, nor did they receive it in 
 vain, but used it, for they <I>cast out many devils</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 and they <I>anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.</I> 
 Some think this oil was used <I>medicinally,</I> according to the 
 custom of the Jews; but I rather think it was used as a <I>sign of 
 miraculous</I> healing, by the appointment of Christ, though not 
 mentioned; and it was afterward used by those <I>elders of the 
 church,</I> to whom <I>by the Spirit</I> was given the <I>gift of 
 healing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:14">Jam. v. 14</A>.

 It is certain here, and therefore probable there, that <I>anointing the
 sick with oil,</I> is appropriated to that extraordinary power which 
 has long ceased, and therefore that sign must cease with it.</P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  And king Herod heard <I>of him;</I> (for his name was spread
 abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the
 dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.
 &nbsp; 15  Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a
 prophet, or as one of the prophets.
 &nbsp; 16  But when Herod heard <I>thereof,</I> he said, It is John, whom I
 beheaded: he is risen from the dead.
 &nbsp; 17  For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John,
 and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's
 wife: for he had married her.
 &nbsp; 18  For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to
 have thy brother's wife.
 &nbsp; 19  Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have
 killed him; but she could not:
 &nbsp; 20  For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an
 holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many
 things, and heard him gladly.
 &nbsp; 21  And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his
 birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief
 <I>estates</I> of Galilee;
 &nbsp; 22  And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and
 danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king
 said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will
 give <I>it</I> thee.
 &nbsp; 23  And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I
 will give <I>it</I> thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
 &nbsp; 24  And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I
 ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
 &nbsp; 25  And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and
 asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger
 the head of John the Baptist.
 &nbsp; 26  And the king was exceeding sorry; <I>yet</I> for his oath's sake,
 and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.
 &nbsp; 27  And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded
 his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the
 prison,
 &nbsp; 28  And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the
 damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.
 &nbsp; 29  And when his disciples heard <I>of it,</I> they came and took up
 his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The wild notions that the people had concerning our Lord Jesus, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 His own countrymen could believe nothing great concerning him, because 
 they knew his poor kindred; but others that were not under the power of 
 that prejudice against him, were yet willing to believe any thing 
 rather than the truth--that he was the Son of God, and the true 
 Messias: they said, He is Elias, whom they expected; or, <I>He is a 
 prophet,</I> one of the Old-Testament prophets raised to life, and 
 returned to this world; or <I>as one of the prophets,</I> a prophet now 
 newly raised up, equal to those under the Old Testament.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The opinion of Herod concerning him. He heard of <I>his name</I> 
 and fame, of what he said and what he did; and he said, "It is 
 certainly John Baptist, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 As sure as we are here, <I>It is John, whom I beheaded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He is <I>risen from the dead;</I> and though while he was with us <I>he 
 did no miracle,</I> yet, having removed for awhile to another world, he 
 is come again with greater power, and <I>now mighty works do show forth 
 themselves in him.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Where there is an <I>idle faith,</I> there is commonly a <I>working 
 fancy.</I> The people said, It is a prophet risen from the dead; Herod 
 said, It is <I>John Baptist risen from the dead.</I> It seems by this, 
 that the <I>rising of a prophet from the dead,</I> to do <I>mighty 
 works,</I> was a thing expected, and was thought neither impossible nor 
 improbable, and it was now readily suspected when it was <I>not 
 true;</I> but afterward, when <I>it was true</I> concerning Christ, and 
 a truth undeniably evidenced, yet then it was obstinately gainsaid and 
 denied. Those who most wilfully disbelieve the truth, are commonly most 
 credulous of errors and fancies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They who fight against the cause of God, will find themselves 
 baffled, even when they think themselves conquerors; they cannot gain 
 their point, for the word of the Lord endures for ever. They who 
 rejoiced when the witnesses were slain, fretted as much, when in three 
 or four days they <I>rose again</I> in their successors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10,11">Rev. xi. 10, 11</A>.

 The impenitent unreformed sinner, that escapeth the sword of Jehu, 
 shall Elisha slay.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. A guilty conscience needs no accuser or tormentor but itself. Herod 
 charges himself with the murder of John, which perhaps no one else dare 
 charge him with; <I>I beheaded him;</I> and the terror of it made him 
 imagine that Christ was John risen. He feared John while he lived, and 
 now, when he thought he had got clear of him, fears him ten times worse 
 when he is dead. One might as well be haunted with ghosts and furies, 
 as with the horrors of an accusing conscience; those therefore who 
 would keep an undisturbed peace, must keep an undefiled conscience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:16">Acts xxiv. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. There may be the terrors of strong conviction, where there is not 
 the truth of a saving conversion. This Herod, who had this notion 
 concerning Christ, afterward sought to kill him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:31">Luke xiii. 31</A>),

 and did set him at nought 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:11">Luke xxiii. 11</A>);

 so that he will not be persuaded, though it be <I>by one risen from the 
 dead;</I> no, not by a John the Baptist risen from the dead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A narrative of Herod's putting John Baptist to death, which is 
 brought in upon this occasion, as it was in Matthew. And here we may 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great value and veneration which Herod had some time had for 
 John Baptist, which is related only by this evangelist, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Here we see what a great way a man may go toward grace and glory, and 
 yet come short of both, and perish eternally.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He <I>feared John, knowing that he was a just man, and a holy.</I> 
 It is possible that a man may have a great reverence for good men, and 
 especially for good ministers, yea, and for that in them that is good, 
 and yet himself be a bad man. Observe,

 [1.] John was a <I>just man, and a holy;</I> to make a complete good 
 man, both justice and holiness are necessary; holiness toward God, and 
 justice toward men. John was mortified to this world, and so was a good 
 friend both to justice and holiness.

 [2.] Herod knew this, not only by common fame, but by personal 
 acquaintance with him. Those that have but little justice and holiness 
 themselves, may yet discern it with respect in others. And,

 [3.] He therefore <I>feared</I> him, he honoured him. Holiness and 
 justice command veneration, and many that are not good themselves, have 
 respect for those that are.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He <I>observed</I> him; he sheltered him from the malice of his 
 enemies (so some understand it); or, rather, he had a regard to his 
 exemplary conversation, and took notice of that in him that was 
 praiseworthy, and commended it in the hearing of those about him; he 
 made it appear that he observed what John said and did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He <I>heard him</I> preach; which was great condescension, 
 considering how mean John's appearance was. To hear Christ himself 
 preach in our streets will be but a poor plea in the great day, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:26">Luke xiii. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He <I>did many of those things</I> which John in his preaching 
 taught him. He was not only a <I>hearer of the word,</I> but in part a 
 <I>doer of the work.</I> Some sins which John in his preaching 
 reproved, he forsook, and some duties he bound himself to; but it will 
 not suffice to do <I>many</I> things, unless we have <I>respect to 
 all</I> the commandments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) He <I>heard him gladly.</I> He did not hear him with terror as 
 Felix heard Paul, but heard him with pleasure. There is a flashy joy, 
 which a hypocrite may have in hearing the word; Ezekiel was to his 
 hearers as a <I>lovely song</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:32">Ezek. xxxiii. 32</A>);

 and the <I>stony ground received the word with joy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+8:13">Luke viii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. John's faithfulness to Herod, in telling him of his faults. Herod 
 had married his brother Philip's wife, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 All the country, no doubt, cried shame on him for it, and reproached 
 him for it; but John <I>reproved</I> him, told him plainly, <I>It is 
 not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.</I> This was Herod's 
 own iniquity, which he could not leave, when he did many things that 
 John taught him; and therefore John tells him of this particularly. 
 Though he were a king, he would not spare him, any more than Elijah did 
 Ahab, when he said, <I>Hast thou killed and also taken possession?</I> 
 Though John had an interest in him, and he might fear this 
 plain-dealing would destroy his interest, yet he reproved him; for 
 <I>faithful are the wounds of a friend</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:6">Prov. xxvii. 6</A>);

 and though there are some swine that will <I>turn again, and rend</I> 
 those that <I>cast pearls</I> before them, yet, ordinarily, <I>he that 
 rebuketh a man</I> (if the person reproved has any thing of the 
 understanding of a man), <I>afterwards shall find more favour than he 
 that flattereth with his tongue,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:23">Prov. xxviii. 23</A>.

 Though it was dangerous to offend Herod, and much more to offend 
 Herodias, yet John would run the hazard rather than be wanting in his 
 duty. Note, Those ministers that would be found faithful in the work of 
 God, must not be afraid of the face of man. If we seek to please men, 
 further than is for their spiritual good, we are not the servants of 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The malice which Herodias bore to John for this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 She <I>had a quarrel with him, and would have killed him;</I> but when 
 she could not obtain that, she got him committed to prison, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 Herod respected him, till he touched him in his Herodias. Many that 
 pretend to honour prophesying, are for smooth things only, and love 
 good preaching, if it keep far enough from their beloved sin; but if 
 that be touched, they cannot bear it. No marvel if the world hate those 
 who testify of it that its works are evil. But it is better that 
 sinners persecute ministers now for their faithfulness, than curse them 
 eternally for their unfaithfulness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The plot laid to take off John's head. I am apt to think that Herod 
 was himself in the plot, notwithstanding his pretences to be displeased 
 and surprised, and that the thing was concerted between him and 
 Herodias; for it is said to be <I>when a convenient day was come</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 fit for such a purpose. 

 (1.) There must be a ball at court, upon the king's birth-day, and a 
 supper prepared for <I>his lords, high captains, and chief estates of 
 Galilee.</I> 

 (2.) To grace the solemnity, the daughter of Herodias must <I>dance</I> 
 publicly, and Herod must take on him to be wonderfully charmed with her 
 dancing; and if he be, they that <I>sit with him</I> cannot but, in 
 compliment to him, be so too. 

 (3.) The king hereupon must make her an extravagant promise, to give 
 her <I>whatever she would ask,</I> even to the <I>half of the 
 kingdom;</I> and yet, that, if rightly understood, would not have 
 reached the end designed, for John Baptist's head was worth more than 
 his <I>whole kingdom.</I> This promise is bound with an oath, that no 
 room might be left to fly off from it; <I>He sware unto her, Whatsoever 
 thou shalt ask, I will give.</I> I can scarcely think he would have 
 made such an unlimited promise, but that he knew what she would ask. 
 
 (4.) She, being instructed by Herodias her mother, asked the <I>head of 
 John Baptist;</I> and she must have it brought her <I>in a charger,</I> 
 as a pretty thing for her to play with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>);

 and there must be no delay, no time lost, she must have it <I>by and 
 by.</I> 

 (5.) Herod granted it, and the execution was done immediately while the 
 company were together, which we can scarcely think the king would have 
 done, if he had not determined the matter before. But he takes on him, 
 
 [1.] To be very backward to it, and that he would not for all the world 
 have done it, if he had not been surprised into such a promise; The 
 <I>king was exceeding sorry,</I> that is, he seemed to be so, he said 
 he was so, he looked as if he had been so; but it was all sham and 
 grimace, he was really pleased that he had found a pretence to get John 
 out of the way. <I>Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit regnare--The man who 
 cannot dissemble, knows not how to reign.</I> And yet he was not 
 without sorrow for it; he could not do it but with great regret and 
 reluctancy; natural conscience will not suffer men to sin easily; the 
 very commission of it is vexatious; what then will the reflection upon 
 it be? 

 [2.] He takes on him to be very sensible of the obligation of his oath; 
 whereas if the damsel had asked but a fourth part of his kingdom, I 
 doubt not but he would have found out a way to evade his oath. The 
 promise was rashly made, and could not bind him to do an unrighteous 
 thing. Sinful oaths must be repented of, and therefore not performed; 
 for repentance is the undoing of what we have done amiss, as far as is 
 in our power. When Theodosius the emperor was urged by a suitor with a 
 <I>promise,</I> he answered, <I>I said it,</I> but did not 
 <I>promise</I> it if it be unjust. If we may suppose that Herod knew 
 nothing of the design when he made that rash promise, it is probable 
 that he was hurried into the doing of it by those about him, only to 
 carry on the humour; for he did it <I>for their sakes who sat with 
 him,</I> whose company he was proud of, and therefore would do any 
 thing to gratify them. Thus do princes make themselves slave to those 
 whose respect they covet, and both value and secure themselves by. None 
 of Herod's subjects stood in more awe of him than he did of <I>his 
 lords, high captains, and chief estates.</I> The king sent an 
 <I>executioner,</I> a soldier of his guard. Bloody tyrants have 
 executioners ready to obey their most cruel and unrighteous decrees.
 Thus Saul has a <I>Doeg</I> at hand, to <I>fall upon the priests of the 
 Lord,</I> when his own footmen declined it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The effect of this is, 

 (1.) That Herod's wicked court is <I>all in triumph,</I> because this 
 prophet tormented them; the head is made a present of <I>to the 
 damsel,</I> and by her to her <I>mother,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 (2.) That John Baptist's sacred college is <I>all in tears;</I> the 
 disciples of John little thought of this; but, when they <I>heard of 
 it,</I> they came, and took up the neglected <I>corpse,</I> and <I>laid 
 it in a tomb;</I> where Herod, if he had pleased, might have found it, 
 when he frightened himself with the fancy that John Baptist was 
 <I>risen from the dead.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>30  And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus,
 and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they
 had taught.
 &nbsp; 31  And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a
 desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and
 going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
 &nbsp; 32  And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
 &nbsp; 33  And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and
 ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came
 together unto him.
 &nbsp; 34  And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved
 with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not
 having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
 &nbsp; 35  And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto
 him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time <I>is</I> far
 passed:
 &nbsp; 36  Send them away, that they may go into the country round
 about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they
 have nothing to eat.
 &nbsp; 37  He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And
 they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of
 bread, and give them to eat?
 &nbsp; 38  He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And
 when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.
 &nbsp; 39  And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon
 the green grass.
 &nbsp; 40  And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
 &nbsp; 41  And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he
 looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave
 <I>them</I> to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes
 divided he among them all.
 &nbsp; 42  And they did all eat, and were filled.
 &nbsp; 43  And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and
 of the fishes.
 &nbsp; 44  And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand
 men.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In there verses, we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The return to Christ of the apostles whom he had sent forth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 to preach, and work miracles. They had dispersed themselves into 
 several quarters of the country for some time, but when they had made 
 good their several appointments, by consent they <I>gathered themselves 
 together,</I> to compare notes, and came to Jesus, the centre of their 
 unity, to give him an account of what they had done pursuant to their 
 commission: as the servant that was sent to invite to the feast, and 
 had received answers from the guests, came, and <I>showed his Lord all 
 those things,</I> so did the apostles here; they <I>told him all 
 things,</I> both <I>what they had done, and what they had taught.</I> 
 Ministers are accountable both for what they <I>do,</I> and for what 
 they <I>teach;</I> and must both watch over their own souls, and watch 
 for the souls of others, as those that must <I>give account,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:17">Heb. xiii. 17</A>.

 Let them not either <I>do</I> any thing, or <I>teach</I> any thing, but
 what they are willing should be related and repeated to the Lord Jesus. 
 It is a comfort to faithful ministers, when they can appeal to Christ 
 concerning their doctrine and manner of life, both which perhaps have 
 been misrepresented by men; and he gives them leave to be free with 
 him, and to lay open their case before him, to <I>tell him all 
 things,</I> what treatment they have met with, what success, and what 
 disappointment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The tender care Christ took for their repose, after the fatigue 
 they had 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>);

 <I>He said unto them,</I> perceiving them to be almost spent, and out 
 of breath, <I>Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest 
 awhile.</I> It should seem that John's disciples came to Christ with 
 the mournful tidings of their master's death, much about the same time 
 that his own disciples came to him with the report of their 
 negotiation. Note, Christ takes cognizance of the <I>frights</I> of 
 some, and the <I>toils</I> of others, of his disciples, and provides 
 suitable relief for both, rest for those that are tired, and refuge for 
 those that are terrified. With what kindness and compassion doth Christ 
 say to them, <I>Come, and rest!</I> Note, The most active servants of 
 Christ cannot be always upon the stretch of business, but have bodies 
 that require some relaxation, some breathing-time; we shall not be able 
 to serve God without ceasing, day and night, till we come to heaven, 
 where they <I>never rest</I> from praising him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:8">Rev. iv. 8</A>.

 And the Lord is for the body, considers its frame, and not only allows 
 it time for rest, but puts it in mind of resting. <I>Come, my people, 
 enter thou into thy chambers. Return to thy rest.</I> And those that 
 work diligently and faithfully, may cheerfully retire to rest. <I>The 
 sleep of the labouring man is sweet.</I> But observe, 

 1. Christ calls them to come <I>themselves apart;</I> for, if they had
 any body with them, they would have something to say, or something to 
 do, for their good; if they must <I>rest,</I> they must be 
 <I>alone.</I> 

 2. He invites them not to some pleasant country-seat, where there were
 fine buildings and fine gardens, but <I>into a desert place,</I> where 
 the accommodations were very poor, and which was fitted by nature only, 
 and not by art, for quietness and rest. But it was of a piece with all 
 the other circumstances he was in; no wonder that he who had but a ship 
 for his preaching place, had but a desert for his resting place. 

 3. He calls them only to rest <I>awhile;</I> they must not expect to
 rest <I>long,</I> only to <I>get breath,</I> and then to go to work 
 again. There is no <I>remaining rest</I> for the people of God till
 they come to heaven. 

 4. The reason given for this, is, not so much because they had been in
 <I>constant work,</I> but because they now were in a <I>constant 
 hurry;</I> so that they had not their work in any order; <I>for there 
 were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to 
 eat.</I> Let but proper time be set, and kept for every thing, and a 
 great deal of work may be done with a great deal of ease; but if people 
 be continually coming and going, and no rule or method be observed, a 
 little work will not be done without a deal of trouble. 

 5. They withdrew, accordingly, <I>by ship;</I> not crossing the water,
 but making a coasting voyage to the desert of Bethsaida,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Going <I>by water</I> was much less toilsome than going <I>by land</I> 
 would have been. They went away <I>privately,</I> that they might be by 
 themselves. The most public persons cannot but wish to be private 
 sometimes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The diligence of the people to follow him. It was rude to do so, 
 when he and his disciples were desirous, for such good reason, to 
 <I>retire;</I> and yet they are not blamed for it, nor bid to go back, 
 but bid welcome. Note, A failure in good manners will easily be excused 
 in those who follow Christ, if it be but made up in a fulness of good 
 affections. They followed him of their own accord, without being called 
 upon. Here is no time set, no meeting appointed, no bell tolled; yet 
 they thus fly like a cloud, and as the doves to their windows. They 
 followed him <I>out of the cities,</I> quitted their houses and shops, 
 their callings and affairs, to hear him preach. They followed him 
 <I>afoot,</I> though he was gone by sea, and so, to try them, seemed to 
 put a slight upon them, and to endeavour to shake them off; yet they 
 stuck to him. They <I>ran</I> afoot, and made such haste, that they 
 <I>out-went</I> the disciples, and <I>came together</I> to him with an 
 appetite to the word of God. Nay they followed him, though it was into 
 a <I>desert place,</I> despicable and inconvenient. The presence of 
 Christ will turn a wilderness into a paradise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The entertainment Christ gave them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 <I>When he saw much people,</I> instead of being moved with 
 displeasure, because they disturbed him when he desired to be private, 
 as many a man, many a good man, would have been, he was <I>moved with 
 compassion toward them,</I> and looked upon them with concern, because 
 <I>they</I> were <I>as sheep having no shepherd,</I> they seemed to be 
 well-inclined, and manageable as sheep, and willing to be taught, but 
 they had <I>no shepherd,</I> none to lead and guide them in the right 
 way, none to feed them with good doctrine: and therefore, in compassion 
 to them, he not only <I>healed their sick,</I> as it is in Matthew, but 
 he <I>taught them many things,</I> and we may be sure that they were 
 all true and good, and fit for them to learn.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The provision he made for them all; all his hearers he generously 
 made his guests, and treated them at a <I>splendid</I> entertainment: 
 so it might truly be called, because a <I>miraculous</I> one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The disciples moved that they should be <I>sent home.</I> When 
 <I>the day was not far spent,</I> and night drew on, they said, <I>This 
 is a desert place,</I> and <I>much time is now past; send them away to 
 buy bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:35"><I>v.</I> 35, 36</A>.

 This the disciples suggested to Christ; but we do not find that the 
 multitude themselves did. They did not say, <I>Send us away</I> (though 
 they could not but be hungry), for they <I>esteemed the words of 
 Christ's mouth more than their necessary food,</I> and forgot 
 themselves when they were hearing him; but the disciples thought it 
 would be a kindness to them to dismiss them. Note, Willing minds will 
 do more, and hold out longer, in that which is good, than one would 
 expect from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ ordered that they should all be fed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>);

 <I>Give ye them to eat.</I> Though their crowding after him and his 
 disciples hindered them from eating 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 yet he would not <I>therefore,</I> to be even with them, send them away 
 fasting, but, to teach us to be kind to those who are rude to us, he 
 ordered provision to be made for them; that bread which Christ and his 
 disciples took with them into the desert, that they might make a quiet 
 meal of it for themselves, he will have them to partake of. Thus was he 
 given to hospitality. They attended on the spiritual food of his word, 
 and then he took care that they should not want corporal food. The way 
 of duty, as it is the way of safety, so it is the way to supply. Let 
 God alone to fill the pools with rain from heaven, and so to make a 
 well even in the valley of Baca, for those that are going Zion-ward, 
 from strength to strength, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:6,7">Ps. lxxxiv. 6, 7</A>.

 Providence, not <I>tempted,</I> but duly <I>trusted,</I> never yet 
 failed any of God's faithful servants, but has refreshed many with 
 seasonable and surprising relief. It has often been seen in the 
 <I>mount of the Lord, Jehovah-jireh,</I> that <I>the Lord will 
 provide</I> for those that wait on him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The disciples objected against it as impracticable; <I>Shall we go, 
 and buy two hundred penny-worth of bread, and give them to eat?</I> 
 Thus, through the weakness of their faith, instead of waiting for 
 directions from Christ, they perplex the cause with projects of their 
 own. It was a question, whether they had two hundred pence with them, 
 whether the country would of a sudden afford so much bread if they had, 
 and whether that would suffice so great a company; but thus Moses 
 objected 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:22">Num. xi. 22</A>),

 <I>Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them?</I> Christ would 
 let them see their folly in forecasting for themselves, that they might 
 put the greater value upon his provision for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Christ effected it, to universal satisfaction. They had brought with 
 them <I>five loaves,</I> for the victualling of their ship, and <I>two 
 fishes</I> perhaps they caught as they came along; and that is the bill 
 of fare. This was but a little for Christ and his disciples, and yet 
 this they must give away, as the widow her <I>two mites,</I> and as the 
 church of Macedonia's <I>deep poverty abounded to the riches of their 
 liberality.</I> We often find Christ entertained at other people's 
 tables, dining with one friend, and supping with another: but here we 
 have him supping a great many at his own charge, which shows that, when 
 others <I>ministered to him of their substance,</I> it was not because 
 he could not supply himself otherwise (if he was <I>hungry,</I> he 
 needed not <I>tell them</I>); but it was a piece of humiliation, that 
 he was pleased to submit to, nor was it agreeable to the intention of 
 miracles, that he should work them for himself. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The provision was <I>ordinary.</I> Here were no rarities, no 
 varieties, though Christ, if he had pleased, could have furnished his 
 table with them; but thus he would teach us to be content with food 
 convenient for us, and not to be desirous of dainties. If we have for 
 necessity, it is no matter though we have not for delicacy and 
 curiosity. God, in love, gives <I>meat for our hunger;</I> but, in 
 wrath, gives <I>meat for our lusts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:18">Ps. lxxviii. 18</A>.

 The promise to them that fear the Lord, is, that verily they shall be
 fed; he doth not say, They shall be <I>feasted.</I> If Christ and his 
 disciples took up with mean things, surely we may.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The guests were <I>orderly;</I> for they <I>sat down by companies 
 on the green grass</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 they <I>sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 that the provision might the more easily and regularly be distributed 
 among them; for God is the God of order, and not of confusion. Thus 
 care was taken that every one should have enough, and none be 
 over-looked, nor any have more than was fitting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) A blessing was craved upon the meat; <I>He looked up to heaven, 
 and blessed.</I> Christ did not call one of his disciples to crave a 
 blessing, but did it himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>);

 and by virtue of this blessing the bread strangely multiplied, and so 
 did the fishes, for they did <I>all eat, and were filled,</I> though 
 they were to the number of <I>five thousand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:42,44"><I>v.</I> 42, 44</A>.

 This miracle was significant, and shows that Christ came into the 
 world, to be the great feeder as well as the great healer; not only to 
 restore, but to preserve and nourish, spiritual life; and in him there 
 is enough for all that come to him, enough to fill the soul, to fill 
 the treasures; none are sent empty away from Christ, but those that 
 come to him full of themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Care was taken of the fragments that remained, with which they 
 filled <I>twelve baskets.</I> Though Christ had bread enough at 
 command, he would hereby teach us, not to make waste of any of God's 
 good creatures; remembering how many there are that do want, and that 
 we know not but we may some time or other want such fragments as we 
 throw away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>45  And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the
 ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he
 sent away the people.
 &nbsp; 46  And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain
 to pray.
 &nbsp; 47  And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the
 sea, and he alone on the land.
 &nbsp; 48  And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary
 unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto
 them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
 &nbsp; 49  But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it
 had been a spirit, and cried out:
 &nbsp; 50  For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he
 talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I;
 be not afraid.
 &nbsp; 51  And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased:
 and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and
 wondered.
 &nbsp; 52  For they considered not <I>the miracle</I> of the loaves: for
 their heart was hardened.
 &nbsp; 53  And when they had passed over, they came into the land of
 Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.
 &nbsp; 54  And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they
 knew him,
 &nbsp; 55  And ran through that whole region round about, and began to
 carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he
 was.
 &nbsp; 56  And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or
 country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that
 they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as
 many as touched him were made whole.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This passage of story we had 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+14:22">Matt. xiv. 22</A>,

 &c., only what was there related concerning Peter, is omitted here.
 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The dispersing of the assembly; Christ <I>constrained his 
 disciples</I> to go before by ship to Bethsaida, intending to follow 
 them, as they supposed, by land. The people were loth to scatter, so 
 that it cost him some time and pains to send them away. For now that 
 they had got a good supper, they were in no haste to leave him. But as 
 long as we are here in this world, we have no continuing city, no not 
 in communion with Christ. The everlasting feast is reserved for the 
 future state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ departed <I>into a mountain, to pray.</I> Observe, 

 1. He <I>prayed;</I> though he had so much preaching-work upon his
 hands, yet he was much in prayer; he prayed often, and prayed long, 
 which is an encouragement to us to depend upon the intercession he is 
 making for us at the right hand of the Father, that <I>continual</I> 
 intercession. 

 2. He went <I>alone,</I> to pray; though he needed not to retire for
 the avoiding either of distraction or of ostentation, yet, to set us an 
 example, and to encourage us in our <I>secret</I> addresses to God, he 
 prayed <I>alone,</I> and, for want of a closet, went up into a 
 mountain, to pray. A good man is never less alone than when alone with 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The disciples were in distress at sea; <I>The wind was 
 contrary</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>),

 so that they <I>toiled in rowing,</I> and could not get forward. This 
 was a specimen of the hardships they were to expect, when hereafter he 
 should send them abroad to preach the gospel; it would be like sending 
 them to sea at this time with the <I>wind in their teeth:</I> they must 
 expect to toil in rowing, they must work hard to strive against so 
 strong a stream; they must likewise expect to be tossed with waves, to 
 be persecuted by their enemies; and by exposing them now he intended to 
 train them up for such difficulties, that they might learn to <I>endure 
 hardness.</I> The church is often like a ship at sea, <I>tossed with 
 tempests, and not comforted</I> we may have Christ for us, and yet wind 
 and tide against us; but it is a comfort to Christ's disciples in a 
 storm, that their Master is in the heavenly mount, interceding for 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Christ made them a kind visit upon the water. He could have checked 
 the winds, where he was, or have sent an angel to their relief; but he 
 chose to help them in the most endearing manner possible, and therefore 
 came to them himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He did not come till the <I>fourth watch of the night,</I> not till 
 after three o'clock in the morning; but then he came. Note, If Christ's 
 visits to his people be deferred long, yet at length he will come; and 
 their extremity is his opportunity to appear for them so much the more 
 seasonably. Though the salvation tarry, yet we must wait for it; <I>at 
 the end it shall speak,</I> in the fourth watch of the night, <I>and 
 not lie.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He came, walking upon the waters. The sea was now tossed with waves, 
 and yet Christ came, walking upon it; for though the <I>floods lift up 
 their voice, the Lord on high is mightier,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:3,4">Ps. xciii. 3, 4</A>.

 No difficulties can obstruct Christ's gracious appearances for his
 people, when the set time is come. He will either find, or force, a way 
 through the most tempestuous sea, for their deliverance, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:7,8">Ps. xlii. 7, 8</A>,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He <I>would have passed by them,</I> that is, he set his face and 
 steered his course, as if he would have gone further, and took no 
 notice of them; this he did, to awaken them to call to him. Note, 
 Providence, when it is acting designedly and directly for the succour 
 of God's people, yet sometimes seems as if it were <I>giving them the 
 go-by,</I> and regarded not their case. They thought that <I>he 
 would,</I> but we may be sure that he would not, <I>have passed by 
 them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They were frightened at the sight of him, supposing him to have been 
 an apparition; <I>They all saw him, and were troubled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>),
 
 thinking it had been some d&aelig;mon, or evil genius, that haunted
 them, and raised this storm. We often perplex and frighten ourselves 
 with phantasms, the creatures of our own fancy and imagination.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He encouraged them, and silenced their fears, by making himself 
 known to them; <I>he talked</I> familiarly with them, saying, <I>Be of 
 good cheer, it is I; be not afraid.</I> Note, 

 (1.) We know not Christ till he is pleased to reveal himself to us.
 "<I>It is I;</I> I your Master, I your friend, I your Redeemer and 
 Saviour. <I>It is I,</I> that came to a troublesome earth, and now to a 
 tempestuous sea, to look after you." 

 (2.) The knowledge of Christ, as he is in himself, and near to us, is 
 enough to make the disciples of Christ cheerful even in a storm, and no 
 longer fearful. <I>If it be so, why am I thus?</I> If it is Christ that 
 is with thee, <I>be of good cheer, be not afraid.</I> Our fears are 
 soon satisfied, if our mistakes be but rectified, especially our 
 mistakes concerning Christ. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:19,2Ki+6:15-17">Gen. xxi. 19; 2 Kings vi. 15-17</A>.

 Christ's presence with us in a stormy day, is enough to make us of good
 cheer, though clouds and darkness be round about us. He said, <I>It is 
 I.</I> He doth not tell them who he was (there was no occasion), they 
 knew his voice, as the sheep know the voice of their own shepherd,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:4">John x. 4</A>.

 How readily doth the spouse say, once and again, <I>It is the voice of
 my beloved!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:8,5:2">Cant. ii. 8; v. 2</A>.

 He said, <B><I>ego eimi</I></B>--<I>I am he;</I> or <I>I am;</I> it is
 God's name, when he comes to deliver Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:14">Exod. iii. 14</A>.

 So it is Christ's, now that he comes to deliver his disciples. When
 Christ said to those that came to apprehend him by force, <I>I am 
 he,</I> they were struck down by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:6">John xviii. 6</A>.

 When he saith to those that come to apprehend him by faith, <I>I am
 he,</I> they are raised up by it, and comforted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He <I>went up to them into the ship,</I> embarked in the same bottom 
 with them, and so made them perfectly easy. Let them but have their 
 Master with them, and all is well. And as soon as he was come into the 
 ship, <I>the wind ceased.</I> In the former storm that they were in, it 
 is said, <I>He arose, and rebuked the winds, and said to the sea, 
 Peace, be still</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:39"><I>ch.</I> iv. 39</A>);

 but here we read of no such formal command given, only the wind ceased
 all of a sudden. Note, Our Lord Jesus will be sure to do his own work
 always effectually, though not always alike solemnly, and with 
 observation. Though we hear not the command given, yet, if thus the 
 wind cease, and we have the comfort of a calm, say, It is because 
 Christ is in the ship, and his decree is gone forth <I>or ever we are 
 aware,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:12">Cant. vi. 12</A>.

 When we come with Christ to heaven, the wind ceaseth presently; there
 are no storms in the upper region.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. They were more surprised and astonished at this miracle than did 
 become them, and there was that at the bottom of their astonishment, 
 which was really culpable; <I>They were sore amazed in themselves,</I> 
 were in a perfect ecstasy; as if it were a new and unaccountable thing, 
 as if Christ had never done the like before, and they had no reason to 
 expect he should do it now; they ought to admire the power of Christ, 
 and to be confirmed hereby in their belief of his being the Son of God: 
 but why all this confusion about it? It was because they <I>considered 
 not the miracle of the loaves;</I> had they given that its due weight, 
 they would not have been so much surprised at this; for his multiplying 
 the bread was as great an instance of his power as his walking on the 
 water. They were strangely stupid and unthinking, and their heart was 
 hardened, or else they would not have thought it a thing incredible 
 that Christ should command a calm. It is for want of a right 
 understanding of Christ's former works, that we are transported at the 
 thought of his present works, as if there never were the like 
 before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. When they came to the land of Gennesaret, which lay between 
 Bethsaida and Capernaum, the people bid them very welcome; <I>The men 
 of that place</I> presently <I>knew Jesus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>),

 and knew what mighty works he did wherever he came, what a universal 
 Healer he was; they knew likewise that he used to stay but a little 
 while at a place, and therefore they were concerned to improve the 
 opportunity of this kind visit which he made them; <I>They ran through 
 that whole region round about,</I> with all possible expedition, and 
 <I>began to carry about in beds those that were sick,</I> and not able 
 to go themselves; there was no danger of their getting cold when they 
 hoped to get a cure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>.

 Let him go where he would, he was crowded with patients--in towns, in 
 the cities, in the villages about the cities; they <I>laid the sick in 
 the streets,</I> to be in his way, and begged leave for them to touch 
 if it were but <I>the border of his garment,</I> as the woman with the 
 bloody issue did, by whom, it should seem, this method of application 
 was first brought in; <I>and as many as touched, were made whole.</I> 
 We do not find that they were desirous to be taught by him, only to be 
 healed. If ministers could not cure people's bodily diseases, what 
 multitudes would attend them! But it is sad to think how much more 
 concerned the most of men are about their bodies than about their 
 souls.</P>
