 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have in this chapter remarkable instances of the power and pity of
 the Lord Jesus, sufficient to convince us that he is both able to save
 to the uttermost all that come to God by him, and as willing as he is
 able. His power and pity appear here in the good offices he did,

 I. To the bodies of people, in curing the palsy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:2-8">ver. 2-8</A>);

 raising to life the ruler's daughter, and healing the bloody issue

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:18-26">ver. 18-26</A>);

 giving sight to two blind men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:27-31">ver. 27-31</A>);

 casting the devil out of one possessed
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:32-34">ver. 32-34</A>);

 and healing all manner of sickness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:35">ver. 35</A>.

 II. To the souls of people; in forgiving sins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:2">ver. 2</A>);

 calling Matthew, and conversing freely with publicans and sinners

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>);

 considering the frame of his disciples, with reference to the duty of
 fasting

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:14-17">ver. 14-17</A>);

 preaching the gospel, and, in compassion to the multitude, providing
 preachers for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:35-38">ver. 35-38</A>.

 Thus did he prove himself to be, as undoubtedly he is, the skilful,
 faithful Physician, both of soul and body, who has sufficient remedies 
 for all the maladies of both: for which we must, therefore, apply 
 ourselves to him, and glorify him both with our bodies and with our 
 spirits, which are his, in return to him for his kindness to both.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into
 his own city.
 &nbsp; 2  And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy,
 lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick
 of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.
 &nbsp; 3  And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves,
 This <I>man</I> blasphemeth.
 &nbsp; 4  And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye
 evil in your hearts?
 &nbsp; 5  For whether is easier, to say, <I>Thy</I> sins be forgiven thee;
 or to say, Arise, and walk?
 &nbsp; 6  But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
 to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise,
 take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.
 &nbsp; 7  And he arose, and departed to his house.
 &nbsp; 8  But when the multitudes saw <I>it,</I> they marvelled, and
 glorified God, which had given such power unto men.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first words of this chapter oblige us to look back to the close of 
 that which precedes it, where we find the Gadarenes so resenting the 
 loss of their swine, that they were disgusted with Christ's company, 
 and besought him to <I>depart out of their coasts.</I> Now here it 
 follows, <I>He entered into a ship, and passed over.</I> They bid him 
 begone, and he took them at their word, and we never read that he came 
 into their coasts again. Now here observe, 

 1. His justice--that he left them. Note, Christ will not tarry long
 where he is not welcome. In righteous judgment, he forsakes those 
 places and persons that are weary of him, but abides with those that 
 covet and court his stay. <I>If the unbeliever will depart</I> from 
 Christ, <I>let him depart;</I> it is at his peril, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:15">1 Cor. vii. 15</A>.

 2. His patience--that he did not leave some destroying judgment behind
 him, to punish them, as they deserved, for their contempt and 
 contumacy. How easily, how justly, might he have sent them after their 
 swine, who were already so much under the devil's power. The 
 provocation, indeed, was very great: but he put it up, and passed it 
 by; and, without any angry resentments or upbraidings, he <I>entered 
 into a ship, and passed over.</I> This was the day of his patience; he 
 came not to <I>destroy men's lives,</I> but to save them; not to kill, 
 but to cure. Spiritual judgments agree more with the constitution of 
 gospel times; yet some observe, that in those bloody wars which the 
 Romans made upon the Jews, which began not many years after this, they 
 first besieged the town of Gadara, where these Gadarenes dwelt. Note, 
 Those that drive Christ from them, draw all miseries upon them. Woe 
 unto us, if God depart from us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He came <I>into his own city, Capernaum,</I> the principal place of his 
 residence at present 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:1">Mark ii. 1</A>),

 and therefore called <I>his own city.</I> He had himself testified,
 that a prophet is least honoured in <I>his own country</I> and
 <I>city,</I> yet thither he came; for he <I>sought not his own 
 honour;</I> but, being in a state of humiliation, he was content to be 
 despised of the people. At Capernaum all the circumstances recorded in 
 this chapter happened, and are, therefore, put together here, though, 
 in the harmony of the evangelists, other events intervened. When the 
 Gadarenes desired Christ to depart, they of Capernaum received him. If 
 Christ be affronted by some, there are others in whom he will be 
 glorious; if one will not, another will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the first occurrence, after Christ's return to Capernaum, as 
 recorded in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:1-8">these verses</A>,

 was the cure of the man sick of the palsy. In which we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>faith of his friends</I> in bringing him to Christ. His 
 distemper was such, that he could not come to Christ himself, but as he 
 was carried. Note, Even the halt and the lame may be brought to Christ, 
 and they shall not be rejected by him. If we do as well as we can, he 
 will accept of us. Christ had an eye to their faith. Little children 
 cannot go to Christ themselves, but he will have an eye to the faith of 
 those that bring them, and it shall not be in vain. <I>Jesus saw their 
 faith,</I> the faith of the paralytic himself, as well as of them that 
 brought him; Jesus saw the habit of faith, though his distemper, 
 perhaps, impaired his intellect, and obstructed the actings of it. Now 
 their faith was, 

 1. A strong faith; they firmly believed that Jesus Christ both could
 and would heal him; else they would not have brought the sick man to 
 him so publicly, and through so much difficulty. 

 2. A humble faith; though the sick man was unable to stir a step, they 
 would not ask Christ to make him a visit, but brought him to attend on 
 Christ. It is fitter that we should wait on Christ, than he on us.

 3. An active faith: in the belief of Christ's power and goodness, they
 brought the sick man to him, <I>lying on a bed,</I> which could not be 
 done without a deal of pains. Note, A strong faith regards no obstacles 
 in pressing after Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The <I>favour of Christ,</I> in what he said to him; <I>Son, be of 
 good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee.</I> This was a sovereign cordial 
 to a sick man, and was enough to <I>make all his bed in his 
 sickness;</I> and to make it easy to him. We read not of any thing said 
 to Christ; probably the poor sick man could not speak for himself, and 
 they that brought him chose rather to speak by actions than words; they 
 set him before Christ; that was enough. Note, It is not in vain to 
 present ourselves and our friends to Christ, as the objects of his 
 pity. Misery cries as well as sin, and mercy is no less quick of 
 hearing than justice. Here is, in what Christ said, 

 1. A kind compellation; <I>Son.</I> Note, Exhortations and consolations
 to the afflicted speak to them as to sons, for afflictions are fatherly
 discipline, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:5">Heb. xii. 5</A>.

 2. A gracious encouragement; "<I>Be of good cheer. Have a good heart on
 it;</I> cheer up thy spirits." Probably the poor man, when let down 
 among them all in his bed, was put out of countenance, was afraid of a 
 rebuke for being brought in so rudely: but Christ does not stand upon 
 ceremony; he bids him <I>be of good cheer;</I> all would be well, he 
 should not be laid before Christ in vain. Christ bids him <I>be of good 
 cheer;</I> and then cures him. He would have those to whom he deals his 
 gifts, to be cheerful in seeking him, and in trusting in him; to be of 
 good courage. 

 3. A good reason for that encouragement; <I>Thy sins are forgiven
 thee.</I> Now this may be considered,

 (1.) as an introduction to the cure of his bodily distemper; "Thy sins 
 are <I>pardoned,</I> and therefore thou shalt be healed." Note, As sin 
 is the cause of sickness, so the remission of sin is the comfort of 
 recovery from sickness; not but that sin may be pardoned, and yet the 
 sickness not removed; not but that the sickness may be removed, and yet 
 the sin not pardoned: but if we have the comfort of our reconciliation 
 to God, with the comfort of our recovery from sickness, this makes it a 
 mercy indeed to us, as to Hezekiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:17">Isa. xxxviii. 17</A>.
 
 Or,

 (2.) As a reason of the command to <I>be of good cheer,</I> whether he
 were cured of his disease or not; "Though I should not heal thee, wilt 
 thou not say thou hast not sought in vain, if I assure thee that <I>thy 
 sins are pardoned;</I> and wilt thou not look upon that as a sufficient 
 ground of comfort, though thou shouldst continue <I>sick of the 
 palsy?</I>" Note, They who, through grace, have some evidence of the 
 forgiveness of their sins, have reasons to be of good cheer, whatever 
 outward troubles or afflictions they are under; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:24">Isa. xxxiii. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The <I>cavil of the scribes</I> at that which Christ said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);
 
 They <I>said within themselves,</I> in their hearts, <I>among
 themselves,</I> in their secret whisperings, <I>This man 
 blasphemeth.</I> See how the greatest instance of heaven's power and 
 grace is branded with the blackest note of hell's enmity; Christ's 
 pardoning sin is termed blasphemy; nor had it been less, if he had not 
 had commission from God for it. They, therefore, are guilty of 
 blasphemy, that have no such commission, and yet pretend to pardon 
 sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The conviction which Christ gave them of the unreasonableness of 
 this cavil, before he proceeded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He <I>charged them with it.</I> Though they did but say it within 
 themselves, he <I>knew their thoughts.</I> Note, Our Lord Jesus has the 
 perfect knowledge of all that we say within ourselves. Thoughts are 
 secret and sudden, yet naked and open before Christ, the eternal Word 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12,13">Heb. iv. 12, 13</A>),

 and he <I>understands them afar off,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:2">Ps. cxxxix. 2</A>.

 He could say to them (which no mere man could), <I>Wherefore think ye
 evil in your hearts?</I> Note, There is a great deal of evil in sinful 
 thoughts, which is very offensive to the Lord Jesus. He being the 
 Sovereign of the heart, sinful thoughts invade his right, and disturb 
 his possession; therefore he takes notice of them, and is much 
 displeased with them. In them lies the <I>root of bitterness,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:5">Gen. vi. 5</A>.

 The sins that begin and end in the heart, and go no further, are as
 dangerous as any other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He <I>argued them out of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.
 
 Where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How he <I>asserts</I> his authority in the <I>kingdom of 
 grace.</I> He undertakes to make out, that the <I>Son of man,</I> the 
 Mediator, has <I>power on earth to forgive sins;</I> for 
 <I>therefore</I> the Father has <I>committed all judgment to the 
 Son,</I> and has given him this authority, <I>because he is the Son of 
 man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:22,27">John v. 22, 27</A>.

 If he has <I>power to give eternal life,</I> as he certainly has

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:2">John xvii. 2</A>),

 he must have power to forgive sin; for guilt is a bar that must be
 removed, or we can never get to heaven. What an encouragement is this
 to poor sinners to repent, that the power of pardoning sin is put into
 the hands of the <I>Son of man,</I> who is bone of our bone! And if he
 had this <I>power on earth,</I> much more now that he is exalted to the
 Father's right hand, to give <I>repentance and remission of sins,</I>
 and so to be both <I>a Prince and a Saviour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:31">Acts v. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How he <I>proves</I> it, by his power in the kingdom of nature; 
 his power to cure diseases. Is it not as easy to say, <I>Thy sins are 
 forgiven thee,</I> as to say, <I>Arise and walk?</I> He that can cure 
 the disease, whether <I>declaratively</I> as a Prophet, or 
 <I>authoritatively</I> as God, can, in like manner, forgive the sin. 
 Now, 

 [1.] This is a general argument to prove that Christ had a divine 
 mission. His miracles, especially his miraculous cures, confirm what he 
 said of himself, that he was the Son of God; the <I>power</I> that 
 appeared in his cures proved him <I>sent of God;</I> and the 
 <I>pity</I> that appeared in them proved him sent of God <I>to heal and 
 save.</I> The God of truth would not set his seal to a lie.

 [2.] It had a particular cogency in this case. The palsy was but a 
 symptom of the disease of sin; now he made it to appear, that he could 
 effectually cure the original disease, by the immediate removal of that 
 symptom; so close a connection was there between the sin and the 
 sickness. He that had power to remove the punishment, no doubt, had 
 power to remit the sin. The scribes stood much upon a legal 
 righteousness, and placed their confidence in that, and made no great 
 matter of the <I>forgiveness of sin,</I> the doctrine upon which Christ 
 hereby designed to put honour, and to show that his great errand to the 
 world was to <I>save his people from their sins.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The immediate cure of the sick man. Christ turned from disputing 
 with them, and spake healing to him. The most necessary arguings must 
 not divert us from doing the good that our <I>hand finds to do.</I> He 
 saith to <I>the sick of the palsy, Arise, take up thy bed, and go to 
 thine house;</I> and a healing, quickening, strengthening power 
 accompanied this word 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>he arose and departed to his house.</I> Now, 

 1. Christ bid him <I>take up his bed,</I> to show that he was
 <I>perfectly cured,</I> and that not only he had no more occasion to be 
 <I>carried</I> upon his bed, but that he had strength to <I>carry 
 it.</I> 

 2. He sent him to <I>his house,</I> to be a blessing to his family,
 where he had been so long a burden; and did not take him along with him 
 for a show, which those would do in such a case who seek the honour 
 that comes from men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The impression which this made upon the multitude 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 they <I>marvelled,</I> and <I>glorified God.</I> Note, All our wonder
 should help to enlarge our hearts in <I>glorifying God,</I> who alone 
 does marvellous things. They glorified God for what he had done for 
 this poor man. Note, Others' mercies should be our praises, and we 
 should give him thanks for them, for we are members one of another. 
 Though few of this multitude were so convinced, as to be brought to 
 believe in Christ, and to follow him, yet they admired him, not as God, 
 or the Son of God, but as a <I>man</I> to whom God <I>had given such 
 power.</I> Note, God must be glorified in all the power that is 
 <I>given to men</I> to do good. For all power is originally his; it is 
 in him, as the Fountain, in men, as the cisterns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
 Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him,
 Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
 &nbsp; 10  And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house,
 behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and
 his disciples.
 &nbsp; 11  And when the Pharisees saw <I>it,</I> they said unto his
 disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?
 &nbsp; 12  But when Jesus heard <I>that,</I> he said unto them, They that be
 whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.
 &nbsp; 13  But go ye and learn what <I>that</I> meaneth, I will have mercy,
 and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but
 sinners to repentance.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have an account of the grace and favour of Christ to 
 poor publicans, particularly to Matthew. What he did to the bodies of 
 people was to make way for a kind design upon their souls. Now observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The call of Matthew, the penman of this gospel. Mark and Luke call 
 him Levi; it was ordinary for the same person to have two names: 
 perhaps Matthew was the name he was most known by as a publican, and, 
 therefore, in his humility, he called himself by that name, rather than 
 by the more honourable name of Levi. Some think Christ gave him the 
 name of Matthew when he called him to be an apostle; as Simon, he 
 surnamed Peter. Matthew signifies, <I>the gift of God,</I> Ministers 
 are God's gifts to the church; their ministry, and their ability for 
 it, are God's gifts to them. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The posture that Christ's call found Matthew in. He was <I>sitting 
 at the receipt of custom,</I> for he was a publican, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+5:27">Luke v. 27</A>.

 He was a custom-house officer at the port of Capernaum, or an
 exciseman, or collector of the land-tax. Now,

 (1.) He was in his calling, as the rest of them whom Christ called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:18"><I>ch.</I> iv. 18</A>.

 Note, As Satan chooses to come, with his temptations, to those that are
 idle, so Christ chooses to come, with his calls, to those that are 
 employed. But, 

 (2.) It was a calling of ill fame among serious people; because it was 
 attended with so much corruption and temptation, and there were so few 
 in that business that were honest men. Matthew himself owns what he was 
 before his conversion, as does St. Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:13">1 Tim. i. 13</A>),

 that the grace of Christ in calling him might be the more magnified,
 and to show, that God has his remnant among all sorts of people. None 
 can justify themselves in their unbelief, by their calling in the 
 world; for there is no <I>sinful</I> calling, but some have been saved 
 <I>out of it,</I> and no <I>lawful calling,</I> but some have been 
 saved <I>in it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The preventing power of this call. We find not that Matthew looked 
 after Christ, or had any inclination to follow him, though some of his 
 kindred were already disciples of Christ, but Christ prevented him with 
 the blessings of his goodness. He is found of those that seek him not. 
 Christ <I>spoke first;</I> we have not chosen him, but he hath chosen 
 us. He said, <I>Follow me;</I> and the same divine, almighty power 
 accompanied this word to convert Matthew, which attended that word 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>Arise and walk,</I> to cure the man sick of the palsy. Note, A
 saving change is wrought in the soul by Christ as the <I>Author,</I> 
 and his word as the <I>means.</I> His gospel is the <I>power of God 
 unto salvation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:16">Rom. i. 16</A>.

 The call was effectual, for he came at the call; <I>he arose, and</I>
 followed him immediately; neither denied, nor deferred his obedience. 
 The power of divine grace soon answers and overcomes all objections. 
 Neither his commission for his place, nor his gains by it, could detain 
 him, when Christ called him. <I>He conferred not with flesh and
 blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:15,16">Gal. i. 15, 16</A>.

 He quitted his post, and his hopes of preferment in that way; and,
 though we find the disciples that were fishers occasionally fishing 
 again afterwards, we never find Matthew at the receipt of custom 
 again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's converse with publicans and sinners upon this occasion; 
 Christ called Matthew, to introduce himself into an acquaintance with 
 the people of that profession. <I>Jesus sat at meat in the house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The other evangelists tell us, that Matthew made a <I>great feast,</I>
 which the poor fishermen, when they were called, were not able to do. 
 But when he comes to speak of this himself, he neither tells us that it 
 was his own house, nor that it was a feast, but only that he <I>sat at 
 meat in the house;</I> preserving the remembrance of Christ's favours 
 to the publicans, rather than of the respect he had paid to Christ. 
 Note, It well becomes us to speak sparingly of our own good deeds.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now observe, 

 1. When Matthew invited Christ, he invited his disciples to <I>come
 along with him.</I> Note, They that welcome Christ, must welcome all
 that are his, for his sake, and let them have a room in their hearts.
 
 2. He invited many publicans and sinners to <I>meet him.</I> This was
 the chief thing Matthew aimed at in this treat, that he might have an 
 opportunity of bringing his old associates acquainted with Christ. He 
 knew by experience what the grace of Christ could do, and would not 
 despair concerning them. Note, They who are effectually brought to 
 Christ themselves, cannot but be desirous that others also may be 
 brought to him, and ambitious of contributing something towards it. 
 True grace will not contentedly eat its morsels alone, but will invite 
 others. When by the conversion of Matthew the fraternity was broken, 
 presently his house was filled with publicans, and surely some of them 
 will <I>follow him,</I> as he <I>followed Christ.</I> Thus did Andrew 
 and Philip,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The displeasure of the Pharisees at this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They cavilled at it; <I>why eateth your Master with publicans and
 sinners?</I> Here observe, 

 1. That Christ was quarrelled with. It was not the least of his
 sufferings, that he <I>endured the contradiction of sinners against 
 himself.</I> None was more quarrelled with by men, than he that came to 
 take up the great quarrel between God and man. Thus he denied himself
 the honour due to an incarnate Deity, which was to be justified in what 
 he spake, and to have all he said readily subscribed to: for though he 
 never spoke or did anything amiss, every thing he said and did was 
 found fault with. Thus he taught us to expect and prepare for reproach, 
 and to bear it patiently. 

 2. They that quarrelled with him were the Pharisees; a proud generation
 of men, conceited of themselves, and censorious of others; of the same 
 temper with those in the prophet's time, who said, <I>Stand by thyself, 
 come not near me; I am holier than thou:</I> they were very strict in 
 avoiding <I>sinners,</I> but not in avoiding <I>sin;</I> none greater 
 zealots than they for the <I>form</I> of godliness, nor greater enemies 
 to the <I>power</I> of it. They were for keeping up the traditions of 
 the elders to a nicety, and so propagating the same spirit that they 
 were themselves governed by. 

 3. They brought their cavil, not to Christ himself; they had not the
 courage to face him with it, but to his disciples. The disciples were
 in the same company, but the quarrel is with the Master: for they would
 not have done it, if he had not; and they thought it worse in him who
 was a prophet, than in them; his dignity, they thought, should set him
 at a greater distance from such company than others. Being offended at
 the Master, they quarrel with the disciples. Note, It concerns
 Christians to be able to vindicate and justify Christ, and his
 doctrines and laws, and to be <I>ready always to give an answer to
 those that ask them a reason of the hope that is in them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:15">1 Pet. iii. 15</A>.

 While he is an Advocate for us in heaven, let us be advocates for him
 on earth, and make his reproach our own. 

 4. The complaint was his <I>eating with publicans and sinners:</I> to
 be intimate with wicked people is against the law of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:115,Ps+1:1">Ps. cxix. 115; i. 1</A>);

 and perhaps by accusing Christ of this to his disciples, they hoped to
 tempt them from him, to put them out of conceit with him, and so to 
 bring them over to themselves to be their disciples, who kept better 
 company; for they <I>compassed sea and land to make proselytes.</I> To 
 be intimate with publicans was against the <I>tradition of the 
 elders,</I> and, therefore, they looked upon it as a heinous thing. 
 They were angry with Christ for this,

 (1.) Because they <I>wished ill to him,</I> and sought occasion to
 misrepresent him. Note, It is an easy and very common thing to put the
 worst constructions upon the best words and actions. 

 (2.) Because they <I>wished no good to</I> publicans and sinners, but
 envied Christ's favour to them, and were grieved to see them brought to 
 repentance. Note, It may justly be suspected, that they have not the
 grace of God themselves, who grudge others a share in that grace, who 
 are not pleased with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The defence that Christ made for himself and his disciples, in 
 justification of their converse with publicans and sinners. The 
 disciples, it should seem, being yet weak, had to seek for an answer to 
 the Pharisees' cavil, and, therefore, bring it to Christ, and he heard 
 it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 or perhaps overheard them whispering it to his disciples. Let him
 alone to vindicate himself and to plead his own cause, to answer for 
 himself and for us too. Two things he urges in his defence,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The necessity and exigence of the case of the publicans, which 
 called aloud for his help, and therefore justified him in conversing 
 with them for their good. It was the extreme necessity of poor, lost 
 sinners, that brought Christ from the pure regions above, to these 
 impure ones; and the same was it, that brought him into this company 
 which was thought impure. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He proves the necessity of the case of the publicans: <I>they that 
 be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.</I> The 
 publicans are sick, and they need one to help and heal them, which the 
 Pharisees think they do not. Note,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Sin is the sickness of the soul; sinners are spiritually sick. 
 Original corruptions are the diseases of the soul, actual 
 transgressions are its wounds, or the eruptions of the disease. It is 
 deforming, weakening, disquieting, wasting, killing, but, blessed be 
 God, not incurable. 

 [2.] Jesus Christ is the great Physician of souls. His curing of
 bodily diseases signified this, that he arose with <I>healing under his 
 wings.</I> He is a skilful, faithful, compassionate Physician, and it 
 is his office and business to heal the sick. Wise and good men should 
 be as physicians to all about them; Christ was so. <I>Hunc affectum 
 versus omnes habet sapiens, quem versus &aelig;gros suos medicus--A 
 wise man cherishes towards all around him the feelings of a physician 
 for his patient.</I> Seneca <I>De Const.</I>

 [3.] Sin-sick souls have need of this Physician, for their disease is 
 dangerous; nature will not help itself; no man can help us; such need 
 have we of Christ, that we are undone, eternally undone, without him.
 Sensible sinners see their need, and apply themselves to him 
 accordingly. 

 [4.] There are multitudes who fancy themselves to be sound and whole, 
 who think they have <I>no need of Christ,</I> but that they can shift 
 for themselves well enough without him, as Laodicea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17">Rev. iii. 17</A>.

 Thus the Pharisees desired not the knowledge of Christ's word and ways,
 not because they had no need of him, but because they thought they had
 none. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:40,41">John ix. 40, 41</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He proves, that their necessity did sufficiently justify his 
 conduct, in conversing familiarly with them, and that he ought not to 
 be blamed for it; for that necessity made it <I>an act of charity,</I> 
 which ought always to be preferred before the formalities of a 
 religious profession, in which <I>bene</I>ficence and 
 <I>muni</I>ficence are far better than <I>magni</I>ficence, as much as 
 substance is better than shows or shadows. Those duties, which are of 
 moral and natural obligation, are to take place even of those divine 
 laws which are positive and ritual, much more of those impositions of 
 men, and traditions of the elders, which make God's law stricter than 
 he has made it. This he proves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)
 
 by a passage quoted out of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:6">Hos. vi. 6</A>,

 <I>I will have mercy and not sacrifice.</I> That morose separation from
 the society of publicans, which the Pharisees enjoined, was <I>less
 than sacrifice;</I> but Christ's conversing with them was more than an
 act of common mercy, and therefore to be preferred before it. If to do
 well ourselves is better than sacrifice, as Samuel shows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:22,23">1 Sam. xv. 22, 23</A>),

 much more to do good to others. Christ's conversing with sinners is
 here called mercy: to promote the conversion of souls is the greatest 
 act of mercy imaginable; it is <I>saving a soul from death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:20">Jam. v. 20</A>.

 Observe how Christ quotes this, <I>Go ye and learn what that
 meaneth.</I> Note, It is not enough to be acquainted with the letter of 
 scripture, but we must learn to understand the meaning of it. And they 
 have best learned the meaning of the scriptures, that have learned how 
 to apply them as a reproof to their own faults, and a rule for their 
 own practice. This scripture which Christ quoted, served not only to 
 vindicate him, but,

 [1.] To show wherein true religion consists; not in external 
 observances: not <I>in meats and drinks</I> and shows of sanctity, not 
 in little particular opinions and doubtful disputations, but in doing 
 all the good we can to the bodies and souls of others; in righteousness 
 and peace; in <I>visiting the fatherless and widows.</I>

 [2.] To condemn the Pharisaical hypocrisy of those who place religion 
 in rituals, more than in morals, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:23"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 23</A>.

 They espouse those forms of godliness which may be made consistent
 with, and perhaps subservient to, their pride, covetousness, ambition, 
 and malice, while they hate that power of it which is mortifying to 
 those lusts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He urges the nature and end of his own commission. He must keep to 
 his orders, and prosecute that for which he was appointed to be the 
 great Teacher; now, says he, "<I>I am not come to call the righteous, 
 but sinners to repentance,</I> and therefore must converse with 
 publicans." Observe, 

 (1.) What his errand was; it was to <I>call to repentance.</I> This was 
 his first text

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:17"><I>ch.</I> iv. 17</A>),

 and it was the tendency of all his sermons. Note, The gospel call is a
 call to repentance; a call to us to change our mind and to change our 
 way. 

 (2.) With whom his errand lay; not with <I>the righteous,</I> but with 
 <I>sinners.</I> That is,

 [1.] If the children of men had not been <I>sinners,</I> there had been 
 no occasion for Christ's coming among them. He is the Saviour, not of 
 man as <I>man,</I> but of man as <I>fallen.</I> Had the first Adam 
 continued in his original <I>righteousness,</I> we had not needed a 
 second Adam.

 [2.] Therefore his <I>greatest business</I> lies with the <I>greatest 
 sinners;</I> the more dangerous the sick man's case is, the more 
 occasion there is for the physician's help. Christ came into the world 
 to <I>save sinners,</I> but especially <I>the chief</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:15">1 Tim. i. 15</A>);
 
 to call not those so much, who, though sinners, are comparatively
 righteous, but the worst of sinners.

 [3.] The more sensible any sinners are of their sinfulness, the more 
 welcome will Christ and his gospel be to them; and every one chooses to 
 go where his company is desired, not to those who would rather have his 
 room. Christ came not with an expectation of succeeding among <I>the
 righteous,</I> those who conceit themselves so, and therefore will 
 sooner be sick of their Saviour, than sick of their sins, but among the 
 convinced humble <I>sinners;</I> to them Christ will come, for to them 
 he will be welcome.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we
 and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
 &nbsp; 15  And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the
 bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but
 the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them,
 and then shall they fast.
 &nbsp; 16  No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for
 that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and
 the rent is made worse.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The objections which were made against Christ and his disciples gave 
 occasion to some of the most profitable of his discourses; thus are the 
 interests of truth often served, even by the opposition it meets with 
 from gainsayers, and thus the wisdom of Christ brings good out of evil. 
 This is the third instance of it in this chapter; his discourse of his 
 power to forgive sin, and his readiness to receive sinners, was 
 occasioned by the cavils of the scribes and Pharisees; so here, from a 
 reflection upon the conduct of his family, arose a discourse concerning 
 his tenderness for it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The objection which the disciples of John made against Christ's 
 disciples, for not fasting so often as they did; which they are charged 
 with, as another instance of the looseness of their profession, besides 
 that of eating with publicans and sinners; and it is therefore 
 suggested to them, that they should change that profession for another 
 more strict. It appears by the other evangelists 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:18,Lu+5:33">Mark ii. 18 and Luke v. 33</A>)

 that the disciples of the Pharisees joined with them, and we have
 reason to suspect that they instigated them, making use of John's 
 disciples as their spokesmen, because they, being more in favour with 
 Christ and his disciples, could do it more plausibly. Note, It is no 
 new thing for bad men to set good men together by the ears; if the 
 people of God differ in their sentiments, designing men will take that 
 occasion to sow discord, and to incense them one against another, and 
 alienate them one from another, and so make an easy prey of them. If 
 the disciples of John and of Jesus clash, we have reason to suspect the 
 Pharisees have been at work underhand, blowing the coals. Now the 
 complaint is, <I>Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but thy 
 disciples fast not?</I> It is pity the duties of religion, which ought 
 to be the confirmations of holy love, should be made the occasions of 
 strife and contention; but they often are so, as here; where we may 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How they boasted of their own fasting. <I>We and the Pharisees fast 
 often.</I> Fasting has in all ages of the church been consecrated, upon 
 special occasions, to the service of religion; the Pharisees were much 
 in it; many of them kept two fast-days in a week, and yet the 
 generality of them were hypocrites and bad men. Note, False and formal 
 professors often excel others in outward acts of devotion, and even of 
 mortification. The disciples of John <I>fasted often,</I> partly in 
 compliance with their master's practice, for he came <I>neither eating 
 nor drinking</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:18"><I>ch.</I> xi. 18</A>);

 and people are apt to imitate their leaders, though not always from the
 same inward principle; partly in compliance with their master's 
 doctrine of repentance. Note, The severer part of religion is often 
 most <I>minded</I> by those that are yet under the discipline of the 
 Spirit, as a <I>Spirit of bondage,</I> whereas, though these are good 
 in their place, we must pass through them to that life of delight in 
 God and dependence on him, to which these should lead. Now they come to 
 Christ to tell him that they <I>fasted often,</I> at least they thought 
 it often. Note, <I>Most men will proclaim every one his own 
 goodness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:6">Prov. xx. 6</A>.

 There is a proneness in professors to brag of their own performance in
 religion, especially if there by any thing extraordinary in them; nay, 
 and not only to boast of them before men, but to plead them before God, 
 and confide in them as a righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How they blamed Christ's disciples for not fasting so often as they 
 did. <I>Thy disciples fast not.</I> They could not but know, that 
 Christ had instructed his disciples to keep their fasts private, and to 
 manage themselves so as that they might not <I>appear unto men to 
 fast;</I> and, therefore, it was very uncharitable in them to conclude 
 they did <I>not fast,</I> because they did not proclaim their fasts. 
 Note, We must not judge of people's religion by that which falls under 
 the eye and observation of the world. But suppose it was so, that 
 Christ's disciples did not <I>fast</I> so often or so long as they did, 
 why truly, they would therefore have it thought, that they had more 
 religion in them than Christ's disciples had. Note, It is common for 
 vain professors to make themselves a standard in religion, by which to 
 try and measure persons and things, as if all who differed from them 
 were so far in the wrong; as if all that did less than they, did too 
 little, and all that did more than they, did too much, which is a plain 
 evidence of their want of humility and charity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How they brought this complaint to Christ. Note, If Christ's 
 disciples, either by omission or commission, give offence, Christ 
 himself will be sure to hear of it, and be reflected upon for it. <I>O, 
 Jesus, are these thy Christians?</I> Therefore, as we tender the honour 
 of Christ, we are concerned to conduct ourselves well. Observe, The 
 quarrel with Christ was brought to the disciples 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 the quarrel with the disciples was brought to Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 this is the way of sowing discord and killing love, to set people
 against ministers, ministers against people, and one friend against 
 another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apology which Christ made for his disciples in this matter. 
 Christ might have upbraided John's disciples with the former part of 
 their question, <I>Why do ye fast often?</I> "Nay, you know best why 
 you do it; but the truth is, many abound in external instances of 
 devotion, that scarcely do themselves know why and wherefore." But he 
 only vindicates the practice of his disciples; when they had nothing to
 say for themselves, he had something ready to say for them. Note, As it 
 is wisdom's honour to be justified of all her children, so it is her 
 children's happiness to be all justified of wisdom. What we do 
 according to the precept and pattern of Christ, he will be sure to bear 
 us out in, and we may with confidence leave it to him to clear up our 
 integrity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things Christ pleads in defence of their <I>not fasting.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That it was not a season proper for that duty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Can the children of the bride-chamber mourn, as long as the
 bridegroom is with them?</I> Observe, Christ's answer is so framed, as 
 that it might sufficiently justify the practice of his own disciples, 
 and yet not condemn the institution of John, or the practice of his 
 disciples. When the Pharisees fomented this dispute, they hoped Christ 
 would cast blame, either on his own disciples, or on John's, but he did 
 neither. Note, When at any time we are unjustly censured, our care
 must be only to clear ourselves, not to recriminate, or throw dirt upon 
 others; and such a variety may there be of circumstances, as may 
 justify us in our practice, without condemning those that practise 
 otherwise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now his argument is taken from the common usage of joy and rejoicing 
 during the continuance of marriage solemnities; when all instances of 
 melancholy and sorrow are looked upon as improper and absurd, as it was 
 at Samson's wedding, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+14:17">Judges xiv. 17</A>.
 
 Now,

 (1.) The disciples of Christ were the <I>children of the 
 bride-chamber,</I> invited to the wedding-feast, and welcome there; the 
 disciples of the Pharisees were not so, but <I>children of the 
 bond-woman</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:25,31">Gal. iv. 25, 31</A>),

 continuing under a dispensation of darkness and terror. Note, The 
 faithful followers of Christ, who have the Spirit of adoption, have a 
 continual feast, while they who have the spirit of bondage and fear, 
 cannot rejoice for joy, as other people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:1">Hos. ix. 1</A>.

 (2.) The disciples of Christ had <I>the bridegroom with them,</I> which
 the disciples of John had not; their master was now cast into prison, 
 and lay there in continual danger of his life, and therefore it was 
 seasonable for them to <I>fast often.</I> Such a day would come upon 
 the disciples of Christ, when the bridegroom should be taken from them, 
 when they should be deprived of his bodily presence, and <I>then should 
 they fast.</I> The thoughts of parting grieved them when he was going, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:6">John xvi. 6</A>.

 Tribulation and affliction befel them when he was gone, and gave them
 occasion of <I>mourning</I> and <I>praying,</I> that is, of religious 
 fasting. Note,

 [1.] Jesus Christ is the Bridegroom of his Church, and his disciples 
 are the <I>children of the bride-chamber.</I> Christ speaks of himself 
 to John's disciples under this similitude, because that John had used 
 it, when he called himself a friend of the bridegroom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:29">John iii. 29</A>.

 And if they would by this hint call to mind what their master then
 said, they would answer themselves.

 [2.] The condition of those who are the children of the bride-chamber 
 is liable to many changes and alterations in this world; they sing of 
 mercy and judgment.

 [3.] It is merry or melancholy with the children of the bride-chamber, 
 according as they have more or less of the bridegroom's presence. When 
 he is with them, the candle of God shines upon their head, and all is 
 well; but when he is withdrawn, though but for a small moment, <I>they 
 are troubled,</I> and walk heavily; the presence and nearness of the 
 sun makes day and summer, his absence and distance, night and winter. 
 Christ is all in all to the church's joy.

 [4.] Every duty is to be done in its proper season. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:14,Jam+5:13">Eccles. vii. 14; Jam. v. 13</A>.

 There is a time to mourn and a time to laugh, to each of which we
 should accommodate ourselves, and bring forth fruit in due season. In 
 fasts, regard is to be had to the methods of God's grace towards us; 
 when he <I>mourns to us,</I> we must <I>lament;</I> and also to the 
 dispensations of his providence concerning us; there are times when 
 <I>the Lord God calls to weeping and mourning;</I> regard is likewise 
 to be had to any special work before us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:21,Ac+13:2"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 21; Acts xiii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they had not strength sufficient for that duty. This is set 
 forth in two similitudes, one of putting <I>new cloth into an old 
 garment,</I> which does but pull the old to pieces 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 the other of putting <I>new wine into old bottles,</I> which does but
 burst the bottles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Christ's disciples were not able to bear these severe exercises so well
 as those of John and of the Pharisees, which the learned Dr. Whitby 
 gives this reason for: There were among the Jews not only sects of the 
 Pharisees and Essenes, who led an austere life, but also <I>schools of 
 the prophets,</I> who frequently lived in mountains and deserts, and 
 were many of them Nazarites; they had also private academies to train 
 men up in a strict discipline; and possibly from these many of John's 
 disciples might come, and many of the Pharisees; whereas Christ's 
 disciples, being taken immediately from their callings, had not been 
 used to such religious austerities, and were unfit for them, and would 
 by them be rather unfitted for their other work. Note,

 (1.) Some duties of religion are harder and more difficult than others, 
 like <I>new cloth</I> and <I>new wine,</I> which require most 
 intenseness of mind, and are most displeasing to flesh and blood; such 
 are religious fasting and the duties that attend it. 

 (2.) The best of Christ's disciples pass through a state of infancy; 
 all the trees in Christ's garden are not of a growth, nor all his 
 scholars in the same form; there are <I>babes in Christ</I> and grown 
 men. 

 (3.) In the enjoining of religious exercises, the weakness and 
 infirmity of young Christians ought to be considered: as the food 
 provided for them must be such as is proper for their age

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:2,Heb+5:12">1 Cor. iii. 2; Heb. v. 12</A>),

 so must the work be that is cut out for them. Christ would not speak to
 his disciples that which they could not then bear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:12">John xvi. 12</A>.

 Young beginners in religion must not be put upon the hardest duties at
 first, lest they be discouraged. Such as was God's care of his Israel, 
 when he brought them out of Egypt, not to lead them by the way of the 
 Philistines

 such is Christ's care of the little ones of his family, and the lambs
 of his flock: he gently leads them. For want of this care, many times, 
 <I>the bottles break,</I> and <I>the wine is spilled;</I> the 
 profession of many miscarries and comes to nothing, through 
 indiscretion at first. Note, There may be <I>over</I>--doing even in
 <I>well</I>--doing, a being <I>righteous over-much;</I> and such an 
 <I>over</I>--doing as may prove an <I>un</I>doing through the subtlety 
 of Satan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a
 certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even
 now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
 &nbsp; 19  And Jesus arose, and followed him, and <I>so did</I> his
 disciples.
 &nbsp; 20  And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of
 blood twelve years, came behind <I>him,</I> and touched the hem of his
 garment:
 &nbsp; 21  For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment,
 I shall be whole.
 &nbsp; 22  But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
 Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And
 the woman was made whole from that hour.
 &nbsp; 23  And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the
 minstrels and the people making a noise,
 &nbsp; 24  He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but
 sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
 &nbsp; 25  But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her
 by the hand, and the maid arose.
 &nbsp; 26  And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here two passages of history put together; that of the raising 
 of Jairus's daughter to life, and that of the curing of the woman that 
 had <I>the bloody issue,</I> as he was going to Jairus's house, which 
 is introduced in a parenthesis, in the midst of the other; for Christ's 
 miracles were thick sown, and interwoven; <I>the work of him that 
 sent</I> him was his daily work. He was called to do these good works 
 from speaking the things foregoing, in answer to the cavils of the 
 Pharisees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>:

 <I>While he spake these things;</I> and we may suppose it is a pleasing
 interruption given to that unpleasant work of disputation, which, 
 though sometimes needful, a good man will gladly leave, to go about a 
 work of devotion or charity. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The ruler's address to Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 <I>A certain ruler,</I> a ruler of the synagogue, <I>came and
 worshipped him. Have any of the rulers believed on him?</I> Yes, here 
 was one, a church ruler, whose faith condemned the unbelief of the rest 
 of the rulers. This ruler had a little daughter, of twelve years old, 
 just dead, and this breach made upon his family comforts was the 
 occasion of his coming to Christ. Note, In trouble we should visit
 God: the death of our relations should drive us to Christ, who is our 
 life; it is well if any thing will do it. When affliction is in our 
 families, we must not sit down astonished, but, as Job, <I>fall down 
 and worship.</I> Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His humility in this address to Christ. He came with his errand to 
 Christ himself, and did not send his servant. Note, It is no 
 disparagement to the greatest rulers, personally to attend on the Lord 
 Jesus. He <I>worshipped him,</I> bowed the knee to him, and gave him 
 all imaginable respect. Note, They that would receive mercy from Christ 
 must give honour to Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His faith in this address; "<I>My daughter is even now dead,</I>" 
 and though any other physician would now come too late (nothing more 
 absurd than <I>post mortem medicina--medicine after death</I>), yet
 Christ comes not too late; he is a Physician after death, for he is 
 <I>the resurrection and the life;</I> "<I>O come</I> then, <I>and lay 
 thy hand upon her, and she shall live.</I>" This was quite above the 
 power of nature (<I>a privatione ad habitum non datur regressus--life
 once lost cannot be restored</I>), yet within the power of Christ, who 
 has <I>life in himself, and quickeneth whom he will.</I> Now Christ 
 works in an ordinary, <I>by</I> nature and not <I>against</I> it, and, 
 therefore, we cannot in faith bring him such a request as this; while 
 there is life, there is hope, and room for prayer; but when our friends 
 are dead, the case is determined; <I>we shall go to them, but they 
 shall not return to us.</I> But while Christ was here upon earth 
 working miracles, such a confidence as this was not only allowable but 
 very commendable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The readiness of Christ to comply with his address, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 <I>Jesus</I> immediately <I>arose,</I> left his company, <I>and
 followed him;</I> he was not only willing to grant him what he desired, 
 in raising his daughter to life, but to gratify him so far as to come 
 to his house to do it. Surely <I>he never said to the seed of Jacob, 
 Seek ye me in vain.</I> He denied to go along with the nobleman, who 
 said, <I>Sir, come down, ere my child die</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:48-50">John iv. 48-50</A>),

 yet he went along with the ruler of the synagogue, who said, <I>Sir,
 come down, and my child shall live.</I> The variety of methods which 
 Christ took in working his miracles is perhaps to be attributed to the 
 different frame and temper of mind which they were in who applied to 
 him, which he <I>who searcheth the heart</I> perfectly knew, and 
 accommodated himself to. He knows what is in man, and what course to 
 take with him. And observe, when <I>Jesus followed him, so did his 
 disciples,</I> whom he had chosen for his constant companions; it was 
 not for state, or that he might come with observation, that he took his 
 attendants with him, but that they might be the witnesses of his 
 miracles, who were hereafter to be the preachers of his doctrine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The healing of the poor woman's bloody issue. I call her a poor 
 woman, not only because her case was piteous, but because, she had 
 <I>spent it all upon physicians,</I> for the cure of her distemper, and 
 was never the better; which was a double aggravation of the misery of 
 her condition, that she had been full, but was now empty; and that she 
 had impoverished herself for the recovery of her health, and yet had 
 not her health neither. This <I>woman was diseased with a constant 
 issue of blood twelve years</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 a disease, which was not only weakening and wasting, and under which
 the body must needs languish; but which also rendered her ceremonially 
 unclean, and shut her <I>out from the courts of the Lord's house;</I> 
 but it did not cut her off from approaching to Christ. She applied 
 herself to Christ, and received mercy from him, by the way, as he 
 followed the ruler, whose daughter was dead, to whom it would be a 
 great encouragement, and a help to keep up his faith in the power of 
 Christ. So graciously does Christ consider the frame, and consult the 
 case, of weak believers. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The woman's great faith in Christ, and in his power. Her disease was 
 of such a nature, that her modesty would not suffer her to speak openly 
 to Christ for a cure, as others did, but by a peculiar impulse of the 
 Spirit of faith, she believed him to have such an overflowing fulness 
 of healing virtue, that the very <I>touch of his garment</I> would be 
 her cure. This, perhaps, had something of fancy mixed with faith; for 
 she had no precedent for this way of application to Christ, unless, as 
 some think, she had an eye to the raising of the dead man by the touch 
 of Elisha's bones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:21">2 Kings xiii. 21</A>.

 But what <I>weakness of understanding</I> there was in it, Christ was
 pleased to overlook, and to accept the sincerity and strength of her 
 faith; for he <I>eateth the honey-comb with the honey,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:11">Cant. iv. 11</A>.

 She believed she should be healed if she did but <I>touch the</I> very
 <I>hem of his garment,</I> the very extremity of it. Note, There is
 virtue in every thing that belongs to Christ. The holy oil with which
 the high priest was anointed, <I>ran down to the skirts of his
 garments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+133:2">Ps. cxxxiii. 2</A>.

 Such a fulness of grace is there in Christ, that <I>from it we may all
 receive,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16">John i. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ's great favour to this woman. He did not suspend (as he might 
 have done) his healing influences, but suffered this bashful patient to 
 steal a cure unknown to any one else, though she could not think to do 
 it unknown to him. And now she was well content to be gone, for she had 
 what she came for, but Christ was not willing to let her go so; he will
 not only have his power magnified in her cure, but his grace magnified 
 in her comfort and commendation: the triumphs of her faith must be to 
 her praise and honour. He <I>turned about</I> to see for her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 and soon discovered her. Note, It is great encouragement to humble
 Christians, that they who hide themselves from men are known to Christ, 
 who sees in secret their applications to heaven when most private. Now 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He <I>puts gladness into her heart,</I> by that word, <I>Daughter, 
 be of good comfort.</I> She feared being chidden for coming 
 clandestinely, but she is encouraged. 

 [1.] He calls her <I>daughter,</I> for he spoke to her with the 
 tenderness of a father, as he did <I>to the man sick of the palsy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 whom he called <I>son.</I> Note, Christ has comforts ready for <I>the
 daughters of Zion,</I> that are of a sorrowful spirit, as Hannah was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:15">1 Sam. i. 15</A>.

 Believing women are Christ's <I>daughters,</I> and he will own them as
 such.

 [2.] He bids her <I>be of good comfort:</I> she has reason to be so, if 
 Christ own her for a <I>daughter.</I> Note, The saints' consolation is 
 founded in their adoption. His bidding her <I>be comforted,</I> brought 
 comfort with it, as his saying, <I>Be ye whole,</I> brought health with 
 it. Note, It is the will of Christ that his people should be comforted, 
 and it is his prerogative to command comfort to troubled spirits. He 
 <I>creates the fruit of the lips, peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:19">Isa. lvii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He puts honour upon her faith. That grace of all others gives most 
 honour to Christ, and therefore he puts most honour upon it; <I>Thy 
 faith has made thee whole.</I> Thus <I>by faith she obtained a good 
 report.</I> And as of all graces Christ puts the greatest honour upon 
 faith, so of all believers he puts the greatest honour upon those that 
 are most humble; as here on this woman, who had more faith than she 
 thought she had. She had reason to <I>be of good comfort,</I> not only 
 because she was <I>made whole,</I> but because her <I>faith had made 
 her whole;</I> that is, 

 [1.] She was spiritually healed; that cure was wrought in her which is 
 the proper fruit and effect of faith, the pardon of sin and the work of 
 grace. Note, We may then be abundantly comforted in our temporal 
 mercies when they are accompanied with those spiritual blessings that 
 resemble them; our food and raiment will be comfortable, when by faith 
 we are fed with <I>the bread of life,</I> and <I>clothed with the 
 righteousness of Jesus Christ;</I> our rest and sleep will be 
 comfortable, when by faith we repose in God, and dwell at ease in him; 
 our health and prosperity will be comfortable, when by faith our souls 
 prosper, and are in health. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:16,17">Isa. xxxviii. 16, 17</A>.

 [2.] Her bodily cure was the fruit of faith, of her faith, and that 
 made it a happy, comfortable cure indeed. They out of whom the devils 
 were cast, were helped by Christ's sovereign power; some by the faith 
 of others (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 but it is <I>thy faith that has made thee whole.</I> Note, Temporal
 mercies are then comforts indeed to us, when they are received by 
 faith. If, when in pursuit of mercy, we prayed for it in faith, with an 
 eye to the promise, and in dependence upon that, if we desired it for 
 the sake of God's glory, and with a resignation to God's will, and have 
 our hearts enlarged by it in faith, love, and obedience, we may then 
 say, it was received by faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The posture in which he found the ruler's house,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 --He <I>saw the people and the minstrels,</I> or musicians, <I>making a
 noise.</I> The house was in a hurry: such work does death make, when it 
 comes into a family; and, perhaps, the necessary cares that arise at 
 such a time, when our dead is to be decently buried out of our sight, 
 give some useful diversion to that grief which is apt to prevail and 
 play the tyrant. The people in the neighbourhood came together to 
 condole on account of the loss, to comfort the parents, to prepare for, 
 and attend on, the funeral, which the Jews were not wont to defer long. 
 The musicians were among them, according to the custom of the Gentiles, 
 with their doleful, melancholy tunes, to increase the grief, and stir 
 up the lamentations of those that attended on this occasion; as (they 
 say) is usual among the Irish, with their Ahone, Ahone. Thus they 
 indulged a passion that is apt enough of itself to grow intemperate, 
 and affected to <I>sorrow as those that had no hope.</I> See how 
 religion provides cordials, where irreligion administers corrosives.
 Heathenism aggravates that grief which Christianity studies to assuage.
 Or perhaps these musicians endeavoured on the other hand to divert the 
 grief and exhilarate the family; but, <I>as vinegar upon nitre, so is 
 he that sings songs to a heavy heart.</I> Observe, The parents, who 
 were immediately touched with the affliction, were silent, while <I>the 
 people and minstrels,</I> whose lamentations were forced, made such a 
 noise. Note, The loudest grief is not always the greatest; rivers are 
 most noisy where they run shallow. <I>Ille dolet vere, qui sine teste 
 dolet--That grief is most sincere, which shuns observation.</I> But 
 notice is taken of this, to show that the girl was really dead, in the 
 undoubted apprehension of all about her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The rebuke that Christ gave to this hurry and noise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He said, <I>Give place.</I> Note, Sometimes, when <I>the sorrow of the
 world</I> prevails, it is difficult for Christ and his comforts to 
 enter. They that harden themselves in sorrow, and, like Rachel, 
 <I>refuse to be comforted,</I> should think they hear Christ saying to 
 their disquieting thoughts, <I>Give place:</I> "Make room for him who 
 is <I>the Consolation of Israel,</I> and brings with him <I>strong 
 consolations,</I> strong enough to overcome the confusion and tyranny 
 of these worldly griefs, if he may but be admitted into the soul." He 
 gives a good reason why they should not thus disquiet themselves and 
 one another; <I>The maid is not dead but sleepeth.</I> 

 1. This was eminently true of this maid, that was immediately to be
 raised to life; she was really dead, but not so to Christ, who knew 
 within himself what he would do, and could do, and who had determined 
 to make her death but as a sleep. There is little more difference 
 between sleep and death, but in continuance; whatever other difference 
 there is, it is but a dream. This death must be but of short 
 continuance, and therefore is but a sleep, like one night's rest. He 
 that quickens the dead, may well call the things which be not as though 
 they were, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:17">Rom. iv. 17</A>.

 2. It is in a sense true of all that die, chiefly of them <I>that die
 in the Lord.</I> Note,

 (1.) Death is a sleep. All nations and languages, for the softening of 
 that which is so dreadful, and withal so unavoidable, and the 
 reconciling of themselves to it, have agreed to call it so. It is said, 
 even of the wicked kings, that they <I>slept with their fathers;</I> 
 and of those that shall arise to everlasting contempt, that they 
 <I>sleep in the dust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:2">Dan. xii. 2</A>.

 It is not the sleep of the soul; its activity ceases not; but the sleep
 of the body, which lies down in the grave, still and silent, regardless 
 and disregarded, wrapt up in darkness and obscurity. Sleep is a short 
 death, and death a long sleep. But <I>the death of the righteous</I>
 is in a special manner to be looked upon as a sleep,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:2">Isa. lvii. 2</A>.
 
 They sleep in Jesus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:14">1 Thess. iv. 14</A>);

 they not only rest from the toils and labours of the day, but <I>rest
 in hope</I> of a joyful waking again in the morning of the 
 resurrection, when they shall wake refreshed, wake to a new life, wake 
 to be richly dressed and crowned, and <I>wake to sleep no more.</I> 
 
 (2.) The consideration of this should moderate our grief at the death 
 of our dear relations: "say not, They <I>are</I> lost; no, they are but 
 <I>gone before:</I> say not, They are <I>slain;</I> no, they are but 
 <I>fallen asleep;</I> and the apostle speaks of it as an absurd thing 
 to imagine that <I>they that are fallen asleep in Christ are 
 perished</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:18">1 Cor. xv. 18</A>);

 <I>give place,</I> therefore, to those comforts which the covenant of
 grace ministers, fetched from the future <I>state, and the glory to be 
 revealed.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now could it be thought that such a comfortable word as this, from the 
 mouth of our Lord Jesus, should be ridiculed as it was? <I>They laughed 
 him to scorn.</I> These people lived in Capernaum, knew Christ's 
 character, that he never spake a rash or foolish word; they knew how 
 many mighty works he had done; so that if they did not understand what 
 he meant by this, they might at least have been silent in expectation 
 of the issue. Note, The words and works of Christ which cannot be 
 understood, yet are not therefore to be despised. We must adore the 
 mystery of divine sayings, even when they seem to contradict what we 
 think ourselves most confident of. Yet even this tended to the 
 confirmation of the miracle: for it seems she was so apparently dead, 
 that it was thought a very ridiculous thing to say otherwise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The raising of the damsel to life by the power of Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 <I>The people were put forth.</I> Note, Scorners that laugh at what
 they see and hear that is above their capacity, are not proper 
 witnesses of the wonderful works of Christ, the glory of which lies not 
 in pomp, but in power. The widow's son at Nain, and Lazarus, were 
 raised from the dead openly, but this damsel privately; for Capernaum, 
 that had slighted the lesser miracles of restoring health, was unworthy 
 to see the greater, of restoring life; these <I>pearls were not</I> to 
 be <I>cast before</I> those that would <I>trample them under their 
 feet.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Christ went in and <I>took her by the hand,</I> as it were to awake 
 her, and to help her up, prosecuting his own metaphor of her being 
 asleep. The high priest, that typified Christ, was not to come near the 
 dead 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:10,11">Lev. xxi. 10, 11</A>),

 but Christ <I>touched the dead.</I> The Levitical priesthood leaves the
 dead in their uncleanness, and therefore keeps at a distance from them, 
 because it cannot remedy them; but Christ, having power to raise the 
 dead, is above the infection, and therefore is not shy of touching 
 them. He <I>took her by the hand, and the maid arose.</I> So easily, so 
 effectually was the miracle wrought; not by prayer, as Elijah did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1kI+17:21">1 Kings xvii. 21</A>),
 
 and Elisha 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2kI+4:33">2 Kings iv. 33</A>),
 
 but by a touch. They did it as servants, he as a Son, as a God, <I>to
 whom belong the issues from death.</I> Note, Jesus Christ is the Lord 
 of souls, he commands them forth, and commands them back, when and as 
 he pleases. Dead souls are not raised to spiritual life, unless Christ 
 <I>take them by the hand:</I> it is done in the <I>day of his 
 power.</I> He helps us up, or we lie still.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The general notice that was taken of this miracle, though it was 
 wrought privately; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 <I>The fame thereof went abroad into all that land:</I> it was the
 common subject of discourse. Note, Christ's works are more talked of
 than considered and improved. And doubtless, they that heard only the
 report of Christ's miracles, were accountable for that as well as they
 that were eye-witnesses of them. Though we at this distance have not
 seen Christ's miracles, yet having an authentic history of them, we are
 bound, upon the credit of that, to receive his doctrine; and blessed
 <I>are they that have not seen, and yet have believed,</I>

 In these verses we have an account of two more miracles wrought

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The giving of sight to two blind men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:27-31"><I>v.</I> 27-31</A>.

 Christ is the Fountain of light as well as life; and as, by raising the
 dead, he showed himself to be the same that at first <I>breathed into 
 man the breath of life,</I> so, by giving sight to the blind, he showed 
 himself to be the same that at first <I>commanded the light to shine 
 out of darkness.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The importunate address of the blind men to Christ. He was returning 
 from the ruler's house to his own lodgings, and these <I>blind men 
 followed him,</I> as beggars do, with their incessant cries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He that cured diseases so easily, so effectually, and, withal, at so
 cheap a rate, shall have patients enough. As for other things, so he is 
 famed for an Oculist. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The title which these blind men gave to Christ; <I>Thou Son of 
 David, have mercy on us.</I> The promise made to David, that of his 
 loins the Messiah should come, was well known, and the Messiah was 
 therefore commonly called <I>the Son of David.</I> At this time there 
 was a general expectation of his appearing; these blind men know, and 
 own, and proclaim it in the streets of Capernaum, that he is come, and 
 that this is he; which aggravates the folly and sin of the chief 
 priests and Pharisees who denied and opposed him. They could not see 
 him and his miracles, but <I>faith comes by hearing.</I> Note, They 
 who, by the providence of God, are deprived of bodily sight, may yet, 
 by the grace of God, have <I>the eyes of their understanding so 
 enlightened,</I> as to discern those great things of God, <I>which are 
 hid from the wise and prudent.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their petition, <I>Have mercy on us.</I> It was foretold that the 
 <I>Son of David</I> should be <I>merciful</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:12,13">Ps. lxxii. 12, 13</A>),

 and in him <I>shines the tender mercy of our God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:78">Luke i. 78</A>.

 Note, Whatever our necessities and burthens are, we need no more for
 supply and support, than a share in the <I>mercy of our Lord Jesus.</I> 
 Whether he heal us or no, if he <I>have mercy on us,</I> we have 
 enough; as to the particular instances and methods of mercy, we may 
 safely and wisely refer ourselves to the wisdom of Christ. They did not 
 each of them say for himself, <I>Have mercy on me,</I> but both for one 
 another, <I>Have mercy on us.</I> Note, It becomes those that are under 
 the same affliction, to concur in the same prayers for relief.
 Fellow-sufferers should be joint-petitioners. In Christ there is enough 
 for all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Their importunity in this request; they <I>followed him, 
 crying.</I> It seems, he did not take notice of them at first, for he 
 would try their faith, which he knew to be strong; would quicken their 
 prayers, and make his cures the more valued, when they did not always 
 come at the first word; and would teach us to <I>continue instant in 
 prayer, always to pray, and not to faint:</I> and, though the answer do 
 not come presently, yet to wait for it, and to follow providence, even 
 in those steps and out goings of it which seem to neglect or contradict 
 our prayers. Christ would not heal them publicly in the streets, for 
 this was a cure he would have kept private 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 but <I>when he came into the house,</I> they <I>followed him</I>
 thither, and <I>came to him.</I> Note, Christ's doors are always open 
 to believing and importunate petitioners; it seemed rude in them to 
 rush into the house after him, when he desired to retire; but, such is 
 the tenderness of our Lord Jesus, that they were not more bold than 
 welcome.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The confession of faith, which Christ drew from them upon this 
 occasion. When they came to him for mercy, he asked them, <I>Believe ye 
 that I am able to do this?</I> Note, Faith is the great condition of 
 Christ's favours. They who would receive the <I>mercy</I> of Christ, 
 must firmly believe the <I>power</I> of Christ. What we would have him 
 do for us, we must be fully assured that he is <I>able to do.</I> They 
 followed Christ, and followed him crying, but the great question is, 
 <I>Do ye believe?</I> Nature may work fervency, but it is only grace 
 that can work faith; spiritual blessings are obtained only by faith. 
 They had intimated their faith in the office of Christ as <I>Son of 
 David,</I> and in his mercy; but Christ demands likewise a profession 
 of faith in his power. <I>Believe ye that I am able to do this;</I> to 
 bestow this favour; to give sight to the blind, as well as to cure the 
 palsy and raise the dead? Note, It is good to be particular in the 
 exercise of faith, to apply the general assurances of God's power and 
 good will, and the general promises, to our particular exigencies. 
 <I>All shall work for good,</I> and if all, then this. "<I>Believe ye 
 that I am able,</I> not only to prevail with God for it, as a prophet, 
 but <I>that I am able to do it</I> by my own power?" This will amount 
 to their belief of his being not only <I>the Son of David,</I> but 
 <I>the Son of God;</I> for it is God's prerogative to <I>open the eyes 
 of the blind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:8">Ps. cxlvi. 8</A>);

 he makes <I>the seeing eye,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:11">Exod. iv. 11</A>.
 
 Job <I>was eyes to the blind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:15">Job xxix. 15</A>);

 was to them instead of eyes, but he could not <I>give</I> eyes to the
 blind. Still it is put to us, <I>Believe we that Christ is able to do 
 for us,</I> by the power of his merit and intercession in heaven, of 
 his Spirit and grace in the heart, and of his providence and dominion 
 in the world? To believe the power of Christ is not only to assure 
 ourselves of it, but to commit ourselves to it, and encourage ourselves 
 in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To this question they give an immediate answer, without hesitation: 
 they said, <I>Yea, Lord.</I> Though he had kept them in suspense 
 awhile, and had not helped them at first, they honestly imputed that to 
 his wisdom, not to his weakness, and were still confident of his 
 ability. Note, The treasures of mercy that are laid up in the power of 
 Christ, are <I>laid out and wrought for those that trust in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:19">Ps. xxxi. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The cure that Christ wrought on them; <I>he touched their eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 This he did to encourage their faith, which, by his delay, he had
 tried, and to show that he gives sight to blind souls by the operations 
 of his grace accompanying the word, <I>anointing the eyes with 
 eye-salve:</I> and he put the cure upon their faith, <I>According to 
 your faith be it unto you.</I> When they begged for a cure, he enquired 
 into their faith

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 <I>Believe ye that I am able?</I> He did not enquire into their wealth,
 whether they were able to pay him for a cure; nor into their 
 reputation, should he get credit by curing them; but into their faith; 
 and now they had professed their faith he referred the matter to that: 
 "I know you do believe, and the power you believe in shall be exerted 
 for you; <I>According to your faith be it unto you.</I>" This speaks,

 (1.) His knowledge of the sincerity of their faith, and his acceptance 
 and approbation of it. Note, It is a great comfort to true believers, 
 that Jesus Christ knows their faith, and is well pleased with it. 
 Though it be weak, though others do not discern it, though they 
 themselves are ready to question it, it is known to him. 

 (2.) His insisting upon their faith as necessary; "If you believe, take 
 what you come for." Note, They who apply themselves to Jesus Christ, 
 shall be dealt with <I>according to their faith;</I> not according to 
 their <I>fancies,</I> nor according to their <I>profession,</I> but 
 <I>according to their faith;</I> that is, unbelievers cannot expect to 
 find any favour with God, but true believers may be sure to find all 
 that favour which is offered in the gospel; and our comforts ebb or 
 flow, according as our faith is stronger or weaker; we are not 
 straitened in Christ, let us not then be straitened in ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The charge he gave them to keep it private 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 <I>See that no man know it.</I> He gave them this charge,

 (1.) To set us an example of that humility and lowliness of mind, which 
 he would have us to learn of him. Note, In the good we do, we must not 
 seek our own praise, but only the glory of God. It must be more our 
 care and endeavour to be useful, than to be known and observed to be 
 so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:6,25:27">Prov. xx. 6; xxv. 27</A>

 Thus Christ seconded the rule he had given, <I>Let not thy left hand 
 know what thy right hand doeth.</I>

 (2.) Some think that Christ, in keeping it private, showed his
 displeasure against the people of Capernaum, who had seen so many 
 miracles, and yet believed not. Note, The silencing of those who should 
 proclaim the works of Christ is a judgment to any place or people: and 
 it is just in Christ to deny the means of conviction to those that are 
 obstinate in their infidelity; and to shroud the light from those that 
 shut their eyes against it. 

 (3.) He did it in discretion, for his own preservation; because the 
 more he was proclaimed, the more jealous would the rulers of the Jews 
 be of his growing interest among the people. 

 (4.) Dr. Whitby gives another reason, which is very considerable, why 
 Christ sometimes concealed his miracles, and afterwards forbid the 
 publishing of his transfiguration; because he would not indulge that 
 pernicious conceit which obtained among the Jews, that their Messiah 
 should be a temporal prince, and so give occasion to the people to 
 attempt the setting up of his kingdom, by tumults and seditions, as 
 they offered to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:15">John vi. 15</A>.

 But when, after his resurrection (which was the full proof of his
 mission), his spiritual kingdom was set up, then that danger was over, 
 and they must be published to all nations. And he observes, that the
 miracles which Christ wrought among the Gentiles and the Gadarenes, 
 were ordered to be published, because with them there was not that 
 danger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But honour is like the shadow, which, as it flees from those that 
 follow it, so it follows those that flee from it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>);

 <I>They spread abroad his fame.</I> This was more an act of zeal, than
 of prudence; and though it may be excused as honestly meant for the 
 honour of Christ, yet it cannot be justified, being done against a 
 particular charge. Whenever we profess to direct our intention to the 
 glory of God, we must see to it that the action be according to the 
 will of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The healing of a <I>dumb man,</I> that was <I>possessed with a 
 devil.</I> And here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His case, which was very sad. He was under the power of the devil in 
 this particular instance, that he was disabled from speaking, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 See the calamitous state of this world, and how various the afflictions
 of the afflicted are! We have no sooner dismissed <I>two blind men,</I> 
 but we meet with a <I>dumb man.</I> How thankful should we be to God 
 for our sight and speech! See the malice of Satan against mankind, and 
 in how many ways he shows it. This man's dumbness was the effect of his 
 being <I>possessed with a devil;</I> but it was better he should be 
 unable to say any thing, than be forced to say, as those demoniacs did 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:29"><I>ch.</I> viii. 29</A>),

 <I>What have we to do with thee?</I> Of the two, better a dumb devil
 than a blaspheming one. When the devil gets possession of a soul, it is 
 made silent as to any thing that is good; dumb in prayers and praises, 
 which the devil is a sworn enemy to. This poor creature <I>they brought 
 to Christ,</I> who entertained not only those that came of themselves 
 in their own faith, but those that were <I>brought to him</I> by their 
 friends in the faith of others. Though <I>the just shall live</I> 
 eternally <I>by his faith,</I> yet temporal mercies may be bestowed on 
 us with an eye to their faith who are intercessors on our behalf. They 
 brought him in just as <I>the blind man went out.</I> See how unwearied 
 Christ was in doing good; how closely one good work followed another! 
 Treasures of mercy, wondrous mercy, are hid in him; which may be 
 continually communicated, but can never be exhausted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His cure, which was very sudden 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 <I>When the devil was cast out, the dumb spake.</I> Note, Christ's
 cures strike at the root, and remove the effect by taking away the 
 cause; they open the lips, by breaking Satan's power in the soul. In 
 sanctification he heals the waters by casting salt into the spring. 
 When Christ, by his grace, <I>casts the devil out</I> of a soul, 
 presently <I>the dumb speaks.</I> When Paul was converted, <I>behold, 
 he prays;</I> then <I>the dumb spake.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The consequences of this cure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>The multitudes marvelled;</I> and well they might; though 
 <I>few believed, many wondered.</I> The admiration of the common people 
 is sooner raised than any other affection. It was foretold, that the 
 new song, the New-Testament song, should be sung for <I>marvellous 
 works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:1">Ps. xcviii. 1</A>.

 They said, <I>It was never so seen in Israel,</I> and therefore never
 so seen any where; for no people experienced such wonders of mercy as 
 Israel did. There had been those in Israel that were famous for working 
 miracles, but Christ excelled them all. The miracles Moses wrought had 
 reference to Israel as a people, but Christ's were brought home to 
 particular persons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>The Pharisees</I> blasphemed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 When they could not gainsay the convincing evidence of these miracles,
 they fathered them upon the devil, as if they had been wrought by 
 compact and collusion: <I>he casteth out devils</I> (say they) by
 <I>the prince of the devils</I>--a suggestion horrid beyond expression; 
 we shall hear more of it afterwards, and Christ's answer to it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:25"><I>ch.</I> xii. 25</A>);

 only observe here, how <I>evil men and seducers wax worse and worse</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:13">2 Tim. iii. 13</A>),

 and it is both their sin and their punishment. Their quarrels with 
 Christ for taking upon him to <I>forgive sin</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 for <I>conversing with publicans and sinners,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 for <I>not fasting</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 though spiteful enough, yet had some colour of piety, purity, and
 devotion in them; but this (which they are left to, to punish them for 
 those) breathes nothing but malice and falsehood, and hellish enmity in 
 the highest degree; it is diabolism all over, and was therefore justly 
 pronounced unpardonable. Because the people marvelled, they must say 
 something to diminish the miracle, and this was all they could say.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>35  And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching
 in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
 healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
 &nbsp; 36  But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion
 on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as
 sheep having no shepherd.
 &nbsp; 37  Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly <I>is</I>
 plenteous, but the labourers <I>are</I> few;
 &nbsp; 38  Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send
 forth labourers into his harvest.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A conclusion of the foregoing account of Christ's preaching and 
 miracles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>);

 <I>He went about all the cities teaching and healing.</I> This is the
 same we had before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:23"><I>ch.</I> iv. 23</A>.

 There it ushers in the more particular record of Christ's preaching

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:1-7:29"><I>ch.</I> v., vi. and vii.</A>)

 and of his cures

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:1-9:38"><I>ch.</I> viii. and ix.</A>),

 and here it is elegantly repeated in the close of these instances, as
 the <I>quod erat demonstrandum--the point to be proved;</I> as if the 
 evangelist should say, "Now I hope I have made it out, by an induction 
 of particulars, that Christ preached and healed; for you have had the 
 heads of his sermons, and some few instances of his cures, which were 
 wrought to confirm his doctrine: and <I>these were written that you 
 might believe.</I>" Some think that this was a second perambulation in 
 Galilee, like the former; he visited again those whom he had before 
 preached to. Though the Pharisees cavilled at him and opposed him, he 
 went on with his work; he <I>preached the gospel of the kingdom.</I> He 
 told them of a kingdom of grace and glory, now to be set up under the 
 government of a Mediator: this was gospel indeed, <I>good news, glad 
 tidings of great joy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe how Christ in his preaching had respect,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To the private towns. He visited not only the great and wealthy 
 cities, but the poor, obscure villages; there he preached, there he 
 healed. The souls of those that are meanest in the world are as 
 precious to Christ, and should be to us, as the souls of those that make 
 the greatest figure. <I>Rich and poor meet together</I> in him, 
 citizens and boors: his <I>righteous acts towards the inhabitants of 
 his villages</I> must be <I>rehearsed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:11">Judg. v. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To the public worship. He taught <I>in their synagogues,</I> 

 (1.) That he might bear a testimony to solemn assemblies, even then 
 when there were corruptions in them. We <I>must not forsake the 
 assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is.</I> 

 (2.) That he might have an opportunity of preaching there, where people 
 were gathered together, with an expectation to hear. Thus, even where 
 the gospel church was founded, and Christian meetings erected, the 
 apostles often <I>preached in the synagogues of the Jews.</I> It is the 
 wisdom of the prudent, to make the best of that which is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A preface, or introduction, to the account in the following 
 chapter, of his sending forth his apostles. <I>He</I> took notice of 
 <I>the multitude</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>);

 not only of the crowds that <I>followed him,</I> but of the vast
 numbers of people with whom (as he passed along) he observed the 
 country to be replenished; he noticed what nests of souls the towns and 
 cities were, and how thick of inhabitants; what abundance of people 
 there were in every synagogue, and what places of concourse the 
 openings of the gates were: so very populous was that nation now grown; 
 and it was the effect of God's blessing on Abraham. Seeing this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He pities them, and was concerned for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>);

 <I>He was moved with compassion on them;</I> not upon a temporal
 account, as he pities the blind, and lame, and sick; but upon a 
 spiritual account; he was concerned to see them ignorant and careless, 
 and ready to perish for lack of vision. Note, Jesus Christ is a very 
 compassionate friend to precious souls; here his bowels do in a special 
 manner yearn. It was pity to souls that brought him from heaven to 
 earth, and there to the cross. Misery is the object of mercy; and the 
 miseries of sinful, self-destroying souls, are the greatest miseries: 
 Christ pities those most that pity themselves least; so should we. The 
 most Christian compassion is compassion to souls; it is most 
 Christ-like.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See what moved this pity. 

 (1.) <I>They fainted;</I> they were destitute, vexed, wearied. <I>They 
 strayed,</I> so some; were loosed one from another; <I>The staff of 
 bands was broken,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:14">Zech. xi. 14</A>.

 They wanted help for their souls, and had none at hand that was good
 for any thing. The scribes and Pharisees filled them with vain notions, 
 burthened them with the traditions of the elders, deluded them into 
 many mistakes, while they were not instructed in their duty, nor 
 acquainted with the extent and spiritual nature of the divine law; 
 therefore <I>they fainted;</I> for what spiritual health, and life, and 
 vigour can there be in those souls, that are fed with husks and ashes, 
 instead of <I>the bread of life?</I> Precious souls <I>faint</I> when 
 duty is to be done, temptations to be resisted, afflictions to be 
 borne, being not nourished up with the word of truth.

 (2.) <I>They were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.</I> 
 That expression is borrowed from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:17">1 Kings xxii. 17</A>,

 and it sets forth the sad condition of those that are destitute of 
 faithful guides to go before them in the things of God. No creature is 
 more apt to go astray than a sheep, and when gone astray more helpless, 
 shiftless, and exposed, or more unapt to find the way home again: 
 sinful souls <I>are as lost sheep;</I> they need the care of shepherds 
 to bring them back. The teachers the Jews then had pretended to be 
 <I>shepherds,</I> yet Christ says they had not <I>shepherds,</I> for 
 they were worse than none; idle shepherds that led them away, instead 
 of leading them back, and fleeced the flock, instead of feeding it: 
 such shepherds as were described,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:1,Eze+34:2">Jer. xxiii. 1, &c. Ezek. xxxiv. 2</A>,

 &c. Note, The case of those people is very pitiable, who either have no
 ministers at all, or those that are as bad as none; that seek their own 
 things, not <I>the things of Christ</I> and souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He excited his disciples to pray for them. His pity put him upon 
 devising means for the good of these people. It appears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:12,13">Luke vi. 12, 13</A>)

 that upon this occasion, before he sent out his apostles, he did 
 himself spend a great deal of time in prayer. Note, Those we pity we
 should pray for. Having spoken to God for them he turns to his 
 disciples, and tells them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How the case stood; <I>The harvest truly is plenteous, but the 
 labourers are few.</I> People desired good preaching, but there were 
 few good preachers. There was a great deal of work to be done, and a 
 great deal of good likely to be done, but there wanted hands to do it. 
 
 [1.] It was an encouragement, that <I>the harvest</I> was so 
 <I>plenteous.</I> It was not strange, that there were multitudes that 
 needed instruction, but it was what does not often happen, that they 
 who needed it, desired it, and were forward to receive it. They that 
 were ill taught were desirous to be better taught; people's 
 expectations were raised, and there was such a moving of affections, as 
 promised well. Note, It is a blessed thing, to see people in love with 
 good preaching. The valleys are then covered over with corn, and there 
 are hopes it may be well gathered in. That is a gale of opportunity, 
 that calls for a double care and diligence in the improvement of it; a 
 harvest-day should be a busy day. 

 [2.] It was a pity when it was so that <I>the labourers</I> should be 
 so <I>few;</I> that the corn should shed and spoil, and rot upon the 
 ground for want of reapers; loiterers many, but <I>labourers</I> very 
 <I>few.</I> Note, It is ill with the church, when good work stands 
 still, or goes slowly on, for want of good workmen; when it is so, the 
 <I>labourers</I> that there are have need to be very busy.</P>

 (2.) What was their duty in this case 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>);

 <I>Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest.</I> Note, The melancholy
 aspect of the times and the deplorable state of precious souls, should 
 much excite and quicken prayer. When things look discouraging, we 
 should pray more, and then we should complain and fear less. And we 
 should adapt our prayers to the present exigencies of the church; such 
 an understanding we ought to have of the times, as to know, not only 
 what Israel ought to do, but what Israel ought to pray for. Note,

 [1.] God is <I>the Lord of the harvest; my Father is the 
 Husbandman,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:1">John xv. 1</A>.

 It is <I>the vineyard of the Lord of hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:7">Isa. v. 7</A>.

 It is for him and to him, and to his service and honour, that <I>the
 harvest</I> is gathered in. <I>Ye are God's husbandry</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:9">1 Cor. iii. 9</A>);

 <I>his threshing, and the corn of his floor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:10">Isa. xxi. 10</A>.

 He orders every thing concerning <I>the harvest</I> as he pleases; when
 and where <I>the labourers</I> shall work, and how long; and it is very 
 comfortable to those who wish well to <I>the harvest-work,</I> that God 
 himself presides in it, who will be sure to order all for the best.

 [2.] Ministers are and should be <I>labourers</I> in God's 
 <I>harvest;</I> the ministry is a <I>work</I> and must be attended to 
 accordingly; it is <I>harvest-work,</I> which is needful work; work 
 that requires every thing to be done in its season, and diligence to do 
 it thoroughly; but it is pleasant work; they <I>reap in joy,</I> and 
 the joy of the preachers of the gospel is likened to the <I>joy of 
 harvest</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:2,3">Isa. ix. 2, 3</A>);

 and <I>he that reapeth receiveth wages; the hire of the labourers</I>
 that reap down God's field, shall not be <I>kept back,</I> as theirs 
 was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:4">Jam. v. 4</A>.

 [3.] It is God's work to <I>send forth labourers;</I> Christ makes 
 ministers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:11">Eph. iv. 11</A>);

 the office is of his appointing, the qualifications of his working, the
 call of his giving. They will not be owned nor paid as 
 <I>labourers,</I> that run without their errand, unqualified, uncalled. 
 <I>How shall they preach except they be sent?</I>

 [4.] All that love Christ and souls, should show it by their earnest 
 prayers to God, especially when <I>the harvest is plenteous, that he 
 would send forth</I> more skillful, faithful, wise, and industrious 
 <I>labourers into his harvest;</I> that he would raise up such as he 
 will own in the conversion of sinners and the edification of saints; 
 would give them a spirit for the work, call them to it, and succeed 
 them in it; <I>that he would</I> give them <I>wisdom to win souls; that 
 he would thrust forth labourers,</I> so some; intimating unwillingness 
 to go forth, because of their own weakness and the people's badness, 
 and opposition from men, that endeavour to thrust them out of <I>the 
 harvest;</I> but we should pray that all contradiction from within and 
 from without, may be conquered and got over. Christ puts his friends 
 upon praying this, just before he sends apostles forth to labour in 
 <I>the harvest.</I> Note, It is a good sign God is about to bestow some 
 special mercy upon a people, when he stirs up those that have an 
 interest at the throne of grace, to pray for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:17">Ps. x. 17</A>.

 Further observe, that Christ said this to his disciples, who were to be 
 employed as <I>labourers.</I> They must pray, <I>First,</I> That God
 <I>would send them forth. Here am I, send me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:8">Isa. vi. 8</A>.

 Note, Commissions, given in answer to prayer, are most likely to be
 successful; Paul is a chosen vessel, for <I>behold he prays,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:11,15">Acts ix. 11, 15</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> That he would send others forth. Note, Not the people
 only, but those who are themselves ministers, should pray for the 
 increase of ministers. Though self-interest makes those that seek their 
 own things desirous to be placed alone (the fewer ministers the more 
 preferments), yet those that <I>seek the things of Christ,</I> desire 
 more workmen, that more work may be done, though they be eclipsed by 
 it.</P>
