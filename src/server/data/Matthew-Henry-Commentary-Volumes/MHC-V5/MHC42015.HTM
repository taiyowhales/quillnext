 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Evil manners, we say, beget good laws; so, in this chapter, the 
 murmuring of the scribes and Pharisees at the grace of Christ, and the 
 favour he showed to publicans and sinners, gave occasion for a more 
 full discovery of that grace than perhaps otherwise we should have had 
 in these three parables which we have in this chapter, the scope of all 
 of which is the same, to show, not only what God had said and sworn in 
 the Old Testament, that he had no pleasure in the death and ruin of 
 sinners, but that he had great pleasure in their return and repentance, 
 and rejoices in the gracious entertainment he gives them thereupon. 
 Here is, 

 I. The offence which the Pharisees took at Christ for conversing with
 heathen men and publicans, and preaching his gospel to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.
 
 II. His justifying himself in it, by the design and proper tendency of
 it, which with many had been the effect of it, and that was, the
 bringing of them to repent and reform their lives, than which there
 could not be a more pleasing and acceptable service done to God, which
 he shows in the parables, 

 1. Of the lost sheep that was brought home with joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 2. Of the lost silver that was found with joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 3. Of the lost son that had been a prodigal, but returned to his 
 father's house, and was received with great joy, though his elder 
 brother, like these scribes and Pharisees, was offended at it,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to
 hear him.
 &nbsp; 2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man
 receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
 &nbsp; 3 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,
 &nbsp; 4 What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he lose one of
 them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and
 go after that which is lost, until he find it?
 &nbsp; 5 And when he hath found <I>it,</I> he layeth <I>it</I> on his shoulders,
 rejoicing.
 &nbsp; 6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together <I>his</I> friends
 and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have
 found my sheep which was lost.
 &nbsp; 7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
 sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just
 persons, which need no repentance.
 &nbsp; 8 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose
 one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek
 diligently till she find <I>it?</I>
 &nbsp; 9 And when she hath found <I>it,</I> she calleth <I>her</I> friends and
 <I>her</I> neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have
 found the piece which I had lost.
 &nbsp; 10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of
 the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The diligent attendance of the publicans and sinners upon Christ's 
 ministry. <I>Great multitudes</I> of Jews <I>went with him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:25"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 25</A>),

 with such an assurance of admission into the kingdom of God that he
 found it requisite to say that to them which would shake their vain 
 hopes. Here multitudes of <I>publicans</I> and <I>sinners</I> drew near 
 to him, with a humble modest fear of being <I>rejected</I> by him, and 
 to them he found it requisite to give encouragement, especially because 
 there were some haughty supercilious people that frowned upon them. The 
 <I>publicans,</I> who collected the tribute paid to the <I>Romans,</I> 
 were perhaps some of them <I>bad men,</I> but they were all 
 industriously put into an <I>ill name,</I> because of the prejudices of 
 the Jewish nation against their office. They are sometimes ranked with 
 <I>harlots</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:32">Matt. xxi. 32</A>);

 here and elsewhere with <I>sinners,</I> such as were openly vicious, 
 that traded with <I>harlots,</I> known rakes. Some think that the 
 <I>sinners</I> here meant were <I>heathen,</I> and that Christ was now 
 on the other side Jordan, or in <I>Galilee of the Gentiles.</I> These 
 <I>drew near,</I> when perhaps the multitude of the Jews that had 
 followed him had (upon his discourse in the close of the foregoing 
 chapter) <I>dropped off;</I> thus afterwards the Gentiles took their 
 turn in hearing the apostles, when the Jews had rejected them. <I>They 
 drew near to him,</I> being afraid of drawing nearer than just to come 
 within <I>hearing.</I> They drew near to him, not, as some did, to 
 solicit for cures, but to hear his excellent doctrine. Note, in all our 
 approaches to Christ we must have this in our eye, to <I>hear him;</I> 
 to hear the instructions he gives us, and his answers to our 
 prayers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The offence which the <I>scribes</I> and <I>Pharisees</I> took at 
 this. They <I>murmured,</I> and turned it to the reproach of our Lord 
 Jesus: <I>This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 1. They were angry that <I>publicans</I> and <I>heathens</I> had the
 means of grace allowed them, were called to repent, and encouraged to 
 hope for pardon upon repentance; for they looked upon their case as 
 <I>desperate,</I> and thought that none but Jews had the privilege of 
 repenting and being pardoned, though the prophets preached repentance 
 to the nations, and Daniel particularly to Nebuchadnezzar. 

 2. They thought it a disparagement to Christ, and inconsistent with the
 dignity of his character, to make himself familiar with such sort of 
 people, to <I>admit</I> them into his company and to <I>eat with 
 them.</I> They could not, for shame, condemn him for <I>preaching to 
 them,</I> though that was the thing they were most enraged at; and 
 therefore they reproached him for <I>eating with them,</I> which was 
 more expressly contrary to the tradition of the elders. Censure will 
 fall, not only upon the most innocent and the most excellent 
 <I>persons,</I> but upon the most innocent and most excellent 
 <I>actions,</I> and we must not think it strange.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's justifying himself in it, by showing that the worse these 
 people were, to whom he preached, the more glory would redound to God, 
 and the more joy there would be in heaven, if by his preaching they 
 were brought to repentance. It would be a more pleasing sight in heaven 
 to see Gentiles brought to the worship of the true God than to see Jews 
 go on in it, and to see publicans and sinners live an orderly sort of 
 life than to see <I>scribes</I> and <I>Pharisees</I> go on in living 
 such a life. This he here illustrates by two parables, the explication
 of both of which is the same.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The parable of the <I>lost sheep.</I> Something like it we had in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:12">Matt. xviii. 12</A>.

 There it was designed to show the care God takes for the preservation
 of saints, as a reason why we should not offend them; here it is 
 designed to show the pleasure God takes in the conversion of sinners, 
 as a reason why we should rejoice in it. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The case of a sinner that goes on in sinful ways. He is like a 
 <I>lost sheep,</I> a sheep <I>gone astray;</I> he is <I>lost</I> to 
 God, who has not the honour and service he should have from him; 
 <I>lost</I> to the flock, which has not communion with him; <I>lost</I> 
 to himself: he knows not where he is, wanders endlessly, is continually 
 exposed to the beasts of prey, subject to frights and terrors, from 
 under the shepherd's care, and wanting the green pastures; and he 
 cannot of himself find the way back to the fold.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The care the God of heaven takes of poor wandering sinners. He 
 <I>continues</I> his care of the sheep that did not go astray; they are 
 <I>safe in the wilderness.</I> But there is a particular care to be 
 taken of this lost sheep; and though he has a hundred sheep, a 
 considerable flock, yet he will not <I>lose</I> that <I>one,</I> but he 
 goes after it, and shows abundance of care, 

 [1.] In <I>finding it out.</I> He follows it, enquiring after it, and 
 looking about for it, until he <I>finds</I> it. God follows
 backsliding sinners with the calls of his word and the strivings of his 
 Spirit, until at length they are wrought upon to think of returning. 
 
 [2.] In <I>bringing it home.</I> Though he finds it <I>weary,</I> and
 perhaps <I>worried</I> and worn away with its wanderings, and not able 
 to bear being driven home, yet he does not leave it to perish, and say, 
 It is not wroth carrying home; but <I>lays it on his shoulders,</I> 
 and, with a great deal of tenderness and labour, brings it to the fold. 
 This is very applicable to the great work of our redemption. Mankind 
 were gone astray, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:6">Isa. liii. 6</A>.

 The value of the whole race to God was not so much as that of one sheep
 to him that had a hundred; what loss would it have been to God if they 
 had all been left to perish? There is a world of holy angels that are 
 as the ninety-nine sheep, a noble flock; yet God sends his Son to 
 <I>seek and save that which was lost,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:10"><I>ch.</I> xix. 10</A>.

 Christ is said to <I>gather the lambs in his arms,</I> and carry
 <I>them in his bosom,</I> denoting his pity and tenderness towards poor 
 sinners; here he is said to bear them <I>upon his shoulders,</I> 
 denoting the power wherewith he supports and bears them up; those can 
 never perish whom he carries upon his shoulders.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The pleasure that God takes in repenting returning sinners. He 
 <I>lays it on his shoulders rejoicing</I> that he has not lost his 
 labour in seeking; and the joy is the greater because he began to be 
 out of hope of finding it; and he <I>calls his friends and 
 neighbours,</I> the shepherds that keep their flocks about him, 
 <I>saying, Rejoice with me.</I> Perhaps among the pastoral songs which 
 the shepherds used to sing there was one for such an occasion as this, 
 of which these words might be the burden, <I>Rejoice with me, for I 
 have found my sheep which was lost;</I> whereas they never sung, 
 <I>Rejoice with me, for I have lost none.</I> Observe, he calls it 
 <I>his sheep,</I> though a <I>stray,</I> a wandering sheep. He has a 
 right to it (<I>all souls are mine</I>), and he will claim his own, and 
 recover his right; therefore he looks after it himself: <I>I have found 
 it;</I> he did not send a servant, but his own Son, the great and good 
 Shepherd, who will find what he seeks, and will be found of those that 
 seek him not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The parable of the <I>lost piece of silver.</I> 

 (1.) The <I>loser</I> is here supposed to be <I>a woman,</I> who will 
 more passionately grieve for her loss, and rejoice in finding what she 
 had lost, than perhaps a man would do, and therefore it the better 
 serves the purpose of the parable. She has <I>ten pieces of silver,</I> 
 and out of them loses only one. Let this keep up in us high thoughts of 
 the divine goodness, notwithstanding the sinfulness and misery of the 
 world of mankind, that there are nine to one, nay, in the foregoing 
 parable there are ninety-nine to one, of God's creation, that retain 
 their integrity, in whom God <I>is</I> praised, and never <I>was</I> 
 dishonoured. O the numberless beings, for aught we know numberless 
 worlds of beings, that never were lost, nor stepped aside from the laws 
 and ends of their creation! 

 (2.) That which is lost is a piece of silver, 
 <B><I>drachmen</I></B>--<I>the fourth part of a shekel.</I> The soul is 
 <I>silver,</I> of intrinsic worth and value; not base metal, as iron or 
 lead, but <I>silver,</I> the mines of which are <I>royal mines.</I> The 
 Hebrew word for <I>silver</I> is taken from the <I>desirableness</I> of 
 it. It is <I>silver coin,</I> for so the <I>drachma</I> was; it is 
 stamped with God's <I>image and superscription,</I> and therefore must 
 be <I>rendered to him.</I> Yet it is comparatively but of small value; 
 it was but seven pence half-penny; intimating that if sinful men be 
 left to perish God would be no loser. This silver was lost <I>in the 
 dirt;</I> a soul plunged in the world, and overwhelmed with the love of 
 it and care about it, is like a piece of money in the dirt; any one 
 would say, It is a thousand pities that it should <I>lie there.</I> 
 
 (3.) Here is a great deal of care and pains taken in quest of it. The 
 woman <I>lights a candle,</I> to look behind the door, under the table, 
 and in every corner of the house, <I>sweeps the house,</I> and <I>seeks 
 diligently till she finds it.</I> This represents the various means and 
 methods God makes use of to bring lost souls home to himself: he has 
 <I>lighted the candle</I> of the gospel, not to show himself the way to 
 us, but to show us the way to him, to discover us to ourselves; he has 
 <I>swept the house</I> by the convictions of the word; he <I>seeks 
 diligently,</I> his heart is upon it, to bring lost souls to himself. 

 (4.) Here is a great deal of joy for the finding of it: <I>Rejoice with
 me, for I have found the piece which I had lost,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Those that rejoice desire that others should rejoice with them; those
 that are merry would have others merry with them. She was glad that she 
 had found the piece of money, though she should spend it in 
 entertaining those whom she called to <I>make merry with her.</I> The 
 pleasing surprise of finding it put her, for the present, into a kind 
 of transport, <B><I>heureka, heureka</I></B>--<I>I have found, I have 
 found,</I> is the language of joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The explication of these two parables is to the same purport 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:7,10"><I>v.</I> 7, 10</A>):

 <I>There is joy in heaven, joy in the presence of the angels of God, 
 over one sinner that repenteth,</I> as those publicans and sinners did, 
 some of them at least (and, if but <I>one of them</I> did repent, 
 Christ would reckon it worth his while), more than <I>over</I> a great 
 number of <I>just persons, who need no repentance.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The <I>repentance</I> and <I>conversion of sinners</I> on earth
 are <I>matter of joy</I> and rejoicing <I>in heaven.</I> It is possible 
 that the greatest sinners may be brought to repentance. While there is 
 life there is hope, and the worst are not to be despaired of; and the 
 worst of sinners, if they repent and turn, shall find mercy. Yet this 
 is not all, 

 [1.] God will <I>delight</I> to show them mercy, will reckon their
 conversion a return for all the expense he has been at upon them. There 
 is always <I>joy in heaven.</I> God <I>rejoiceth in all his works,</I> 
 but particularly in the works of his grace. He rejoiceth to do good to 
 penitent sinners, with his <I>whole heart</I> and his <I>whole 
 soul.</I> He rejoiceth not only in the conversion of churches and 
 nations, but even over <I>one sinner that repenteth,</I> though but 
 <I>one.</I> 

 [2.] The good angels will be glad that mercy is shown them, so far are 
 they from repining at it, though those of their nature that sinned be 
 left to perish, and no mercy shown to them; though those sinners that 
 repent, that are so mean, and have been so vile, are, upon their 
 repentance, to be taken into communion with them, and shortly to be 
 made like them, and equal to them. The conversion of sinners is the joy 
 of angels, and they gladly become ministering spirits to them for their 
 good, upon their conversion. The redemption of mankind was matter of 
 joy in the presence of the angels; for they sung, <I>Glory to God in 
 the highest,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:14"><I>ch.</I> ii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) There is more joy over <I>one sinner that repenteth,</I> and 
 turneth to be religious from a course of life that had been notoriously 
 vile and vicious, than there is <I>over ninety-nine just persons, who 
 need no repentance.</I> 

 [1.] More joy for the redemption and salvation of fallen man than for
 the preservation and confirmation of the angels that stand, and did 
 indeed need no repentance. 

 [2.] More joy for the conversion of the sinners of the Gentiles, and of 
 those publicans that now heard Christ preach, than for all the praises 
 and devotions, and all the <I>God I thank thee,</I> of the Pharisees, 
 and the other self-justifying Jews, who though that they <I>needed no 
 repentance,</I> and that therefore God should abundantly rejoice in 
 them, and <I>make his boast</I> of them, as those that were most <I>his 
 honour;</I> but Christ tells them that it was quite otherwise, that God 
 was more praised <I>in,</I> and pleased <I>with,</I> the penitent 
 broken heart of one of those despised, envied sinners, than all the 
 long prayers which the scribes and Pharisees made, who could not see 
 any thing amiss in themselves. Nay,

 [3.] More joy for the conversion of one such great sinner, such a 
 Pharisee as Paul had been in his time, than for the regular conversion 
 of one that had always conducted himself decently and well, and 
 comparatively <I>needs no repentance,</I> needs not such a universal 
 change of the life as those great sinners need. Not but that it is best 
 not to go astray; but the grace of God, both in the power and the pity 
 of that grace, is more manifested in the <I>reducing</I> of great 
 sinners than in the <I>conducting</I> of those that never went astray.
 And many times those that have been great sinners before their 
 conversion prove more eminently and zealously good after, of which Paul 
 is an instance, and therefore in him God was greatly <I>glorified,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:24">Gal. i. 24</A>.

 They to whom much is forgiven will love much. It is spoken after the
 manner of men. We are moved with a more sensible joy for the recovery 
 of what we had lost than for the continuance of what we had always 
 enjoyed, for health <I>out of</I> sickness than for health 
 <I>without</I> sickness. It is as <I>life from the dead.</I> A
 constant course of religion may in itself be more valuable, and yet a 
 sudden return from an evil course and way of sin may yield a more 
 surprising pleasure. Now if there is such <I>joy in heaven,</I> for the 
 conversion of sinners, then the Pharisees were very much strangers to a 
 heavenly spirit, who did all they could to hinder it and were grieved 
 at it, and who were exasperated at Christ when he was doing a piece of 
 work that was of all others most grateful to Heaven.</P>

 <TR><TD><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  And he said, A certain man had two sons:
 &nbsp; 12 And the younger of them said to <I>his</I> father, Father, give
 me the portion of goods that falleth <I>to me.</I> And he divided unto
 them <I>his</I> living.
 &nbsp; 13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all
 together, and took his journey into a far country, and there
 wasted his substance with riotous living.
 &nbsp; 14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in
 that land; and he began to be in want.
 &nbsp; 15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;
 and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
 &nbsp; 16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that
 the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
 &nbsp; 17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired
 servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I
 perish with hunger!
 &nbsp; 18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,
 Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
 &nbsp; 19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one
 of thy hired servants.
 &nbsp; 20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
 great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran,
 and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
 &nbsp; 21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against
 heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy
 son.
 &nbsp; 22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best
 robe, and put <I>it</I> on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes
 on <I>his</I> feet:
 &nbsp; 23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill <I>it;</I> and let us
 eat, and be merry:
 &nbsp; 24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost,
 and is found. And they began to be merry.
 &nbsp; 25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
 nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.
 &nbsp; 26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these
 things meant.
 &nbsp; 27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father
 hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe
 and sound.
 &nbsp; 28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his
 father out, and intreated him.
 &nbsp; 29 And he answering said to <I>his</I> father, Lo, these many years
 do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy
 commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might
 make merry with my friends:
 &nbsp; 30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured
 thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted
 calf.
 &nbsp; 31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all
 that I have is thine.
 &nbsp; 32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this
 thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
 found.

 We have here the parable of the prodigal son, the scope of which is the 
 same with those before, to show how pleasing to God the conversion of 
 sinners is, of great sinners, and how ready he is to receive and 
 entertain such, upon their repentance; but the circumstances of the 
 parable do much more largely and fully set forth the riches of gospel 
 grace than those did, and it has been, and will be while the world 
 stands, of unspeakable use to poor sinners, both to direct and to 
 encourage them in repenting and returning to God. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The parable represents God as a <I>common Father</I> to all mankind, 
 to the whole family of Adam. We are all his <I>offspring,</I> have all 
 <I>one Father,</I> and <I>one God created us,</I>

 <I>From him</I> we <I>had</I> our being, <I>in him</I> we still <I>have
 it,</I> and from him we receive our <I>maintenance.</I> He is <I>our 
 Father,</I> for he has the <I>educating</I> and <I>portioning</I> of 
 us, and will <I>put us in</I> his testament, or <I>leave us out,</I> 
 according as we are, or are not, dutiful children to him. Our Saviour 
 hereby intimates to those proud Pharisees that these publicans and 
 sinners, whom they thus despised, were their brethren, partakers of the 
 same nature, and therefore they ought to be glad of any kindness shown 
 them. God is the God, <I>not of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:29">Rom. iii. 29</A>):

 the <I>same Lord over all, that is rich in mercy to all that call upon 
 him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It represents the children of men as of <I>different</I> 
 characters, though all related to God as their common Father. He had 
 <I>two sons,</I> one of them a solid grave youth, <I>reserved</I> and 
 <I>austere,</I> sober himself, but not at all <I>good-humoured</I> to 
 those about him; such a one would adhere to his education, and not be 
 easily drawn from it; but the other <I>volatile</I> and 
 <I>mercurial,</I> and impatient of restraint, roving, and willing to 
 try his fortune, and, if he fall into ill hands, likely to be a rake, 
 notwithstanding his virtuous education. Now this latter represents the 
 publicans and sinners, whom Christ is endeavouring to bring to 
 repentance, and the Gentiles, to whom the apostles were to be sent 
 forth to <I>preach repentance.</I> The former represents the Jews in 
 general, and particularly the Pharisees, whom he was endeavouring to 
 reconcile to that grace of God which was offered to, and bestowed upon, 
 sinners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The <I>younger son</I> is the prodigal, whose character and case are 
 here designed to represent that of a sinner, that of every one of us in 
 our natural state, but especially of some. Now we are to observe 
 concerning him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His <I>riot</I> and <I>ramble</I> when he was a prodigal, and the 
 extravagances and miseries he fell into. We are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What his request to his father was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>He said to his father,</I> proudly and pertly enough, "<I>Father, 
 give me</I>"--he might have put a little more in his mouth, and have
 said, <I>Pray give me,</I> or, <I>Sir, if you please, give me,</I> but 
 he makes an imperious demand--"<I>give me the portion of goods that 
 falleth to me;</I> not so much as you <I>think fit</I> to allot to me, 
 but that which falls to me as <I>my due.</I>" Note, It is bad, and the 
 beginning of worse, when men look upon God's gifts as debts. "<I>Give 
 me the portion,</I> all <I>my child's part,</I> that falls to me;" not, 
 "<I>Try me with a little,</I> and see how I can manage that, and 
 accordingly trust me with more;" but, "<I>Give it me all</I> at present 
 in possession, and I will never expect any thing in <I>reversion,</I> 
 any thing <I>hereafter.</I>" Note, The great folly of sinners, and that 
 which ruins them, is being content to have <I>their portion in 
 hand,</I> now in this lifetime to <I>receive their good things.</I> 
 They look only at the things that are seen, that are temporal, and 
 covet only a present gratification, but have no care for a future 
 felicity, when that is spent and gone. And why did he desire to have 
 his portion in his own hands? Was it that he might apply himself to 
 business, and trade with it, and so make it more? No, he had no thought 
 of that. But, 

 [1.] He was <I>weary</I> of his <I>father's government,</I> of the good
 order and discipline of his father's family, and was fond of liberty 
 falsely so called, but indeed the greatest slavery, for such a 
 <I>liberty to sin</I> is. See the folly of many young men, who are 
 religiously educated, but are impatient of the confinement of their 
 education, and never think themselves their own masters, their own men, 
 till they have broken all God's bands in sunder, and cast away his 
 cords from them, and, instead of them, bound themselves with the cords 
 of their own lust. Here is the original of the apostasy of sinners from 
 God; they will not be tied up to the rules of <I>God's government;</I> 
 they will themselves <I>be as gods,</I> knowing no other <I>good and 
 evil</I> than what themselves please. 

 [2.] He was willing to get <I>from under his father's eye,</I> for that 
 was always a check upon him, and often gave a check to him. A shyness 
 of God, and a willingness to disbelieve his omniscience, are at the 
 bottom of the wickedness of the wicked. 

 [3.] He was distrustful of his <I>father's management.</I> He would 
 have his <I>portion of goods</I> himself, for he thought that his 
 father would be laying up for hereafter for him, and, in order to that, 
 would limit him in his present expenses, and that he did not like. 

 [4.] He was <I>proud of himself,</I> and had a <I>great conceit of his 
 own sufficiency.</I> He thought that if he had but his portion in his 
 own hands he could manage it better than his father did, and make a 
 better figure with it. There are more young people ruined by 
 <I>pride</I> than by any one lust whatsoever. Our first parents ruined 
 themselves and all theirs by a foolish ambition to be 
 <I>independent,</I> and not to be beholden even to God himself; and 
 this is at the bottom of sinners' persisting in their sin--they will be 
 <I>for themselves.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How kind his father was to him: <I>He divided unto them his 
 living.</I> He computed what he had to dispose of between his sons, and 
 gave the younger son <I>his share,</I> and offered the elder his, which 
 ought to be a <I>double portion;</I> but, it should seem, he desired 
 his father to keep it in his own hands still, and we may see what he 
 got by it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>All that I have is thine.</I> He got all by staying for something in 
 reserve. He gave the younger son what he asked, and the son had no 
 reason to complain that he did him any wrong in the dividend; he had as 
 much as he expected, and perhaps more. 

 [1.] Thus he might <I>now see his father's kindness,</I> how willing he
 was to please him and make him easy, and that he was not such an unkind 
 father as he was willing to represent him when he wanted an excuse to 
 be gone. 

 [2.] Thus he would in a little time be made to see <I>his own 
 folly,</I> and that he was not such a wise manager for himself as he 
 would be thought to be. Note, God is a kind Father to all his
 children, and gives to them all <I>life, and breath, and all 
 things,</I> even to the evil and unthankful, <B><I>dieilen autois ton 
 bion</I></B>--<I>He divided to them life.</I> God's giving us life is 
 putting us in a capacity to serve and glorify him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) How he managed himself when he had got his portion in his own 
 hands. He set himself to spend it as fast as he could, and, as 
 prodigals generally do, in a little time he made himself a beggar: 
 <I>not many days after,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Note, if God leave us ever so little to ourselves, it will not be long
 ere we depart from him. When the bridle of restraining grace is taken 
 off we are soon gone. That which the younger son determined was to 
 <I>be gone</I> presently, and, in order to that, he <I>gathered all 
 together.</I> Sinners, that go astray from God, <I>venture their 
 all.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now the condition of the prodigal in this ramble of his represents to 
 us a <I>sinful state,</I> that <I>miserable</I> state into which man is 
 <I>fallen.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] A sinful state is a state of <I>departure</I> and <I>distance</I> 
 from God. <I>First,</I> It is the <I>sinfulness</I> of sin that it is 
 an apostasy from God. He <I>took his journey</I> from his father's 
 house. Sinners are fled from God; they <I>go a whoring from him;</I> 
 they revolt from their allegiance to him, as a servant that runs from 
 his service, or a wife that treacherously departs from her husband, and 
 they say unto God, <I>Depart.</I> They get as far off him as they can. 
 The world is the <I>far country</I> in which they take up their 
 residence, and are as at home; and in the service and enjoyment of it 
 they spend their all. <I>Secondly.</I> It is the misery of sinners that 
 they are afar off from God, from him who is the Fountain of all good, 
 and are going further and further from him. What is hell itself, but 
 being <I>afar off</I> from God?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] A sinful state is a <I>spending</I> state: There he <I>wasted his 
 substance with riotous living</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 devoured it <I>with harlots</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 and in a little time <I>he had spent all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He bought fine clothes, spent a great deal in meat and drink, treated
 high, associated with those that helped him to make an end of what he
 had in a little time. As to this world, they that <I>live riotously
 waste</I> what they have, and will have a great deal to answer for,
 that they spend that upon their lusts which should be for the necessary
 substance of themselves and their families. But this is to be applied
 spiritually. Wilful sinners <I>waste</I> their patrimony; for they
 misemploy their thoughts and all the powers of their souls, misspend
 their time and all their opportunities, do not only bury, but embezzle,
 the talents they are entrusted to trade with for their Master's honour;
 and the gifts of Providence, which were intended to enable them to
 serve God and to do good with, are made the food and fuel of their
 lusts. The soul that is made a drudge, either to the world or to the
 flesh, <I>wastes its substance,</I> and <I>lives riotously. One sinner
 destroys much good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:18">Eccl. ix. 18</A>.

 The good he destroys is valuable, and it is none of his own; they are 
 his <I>Lord's goods</I> that he <I>wastes,</I> which must be accounted 
 for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] A sinful state is a <I>wanting</I> state: <I>When he had spent 
 all</I> upon his harlots, they left him, to seek such another prey; and 
 <I>there arose a mighty famine in that land,</I> every thing was scarce 
 and dear, and he <I>began to be in want,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Note, Wilful waste brings woeful want. Riotous living in time, perhaps
 in a little time, brings men to a <I>morsel of bread,</I> especially 
 when <I>bad times</I> hasten on the consequences of <I>bad 
 husbandry,</I> which good husbandry would have <I>provided for.</I> 
 This represents the misery of <I>sinners,</I> who have thrown away 
 <I>their own mercies,</I> the favour of God, their interest in Christ, 
 the strivings of the Spirit, and admonitions of conscience; these they 
 <I>gave away</I> for the pleasure of sense, and the wealth of the 
 world, and then are ready to perish for want of them. Sinners want 
 necessaries for their souls; they have neither food nor raiment for 
 them, nor any provision for hereafter. A sinful state is like a land 
 where <I>famine reigns,</I> a <I>mighty famine;</I> for the <I>heaven 
 is as brass</I> (the dews of God's favour and blessing are withheld, 
 and we must needs want good things if God deny them to us), and the 
 <I>earth is as iron</I> (the sinner's heart, that should bring forth 
 good things, is dry and barren, and has no good in it). Sinners are 
 <I>wretchedly</I> and <I>miserably poor,</I> and, what aggravates it, 
 they brought themselves into that condition, and keep themselves in it 
 by refusing the supplies offered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [4.] A sinful state is <I>a vile servile state.</I> When this young 
 man's riot had brought him to want his want brought him to servitude. 
 <I>He went, and joined himself to a citizen of that country,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 The same wicked life that before was represented by <I>riotous
 living</I> is here represented by <I>servile living;</I> for sinners 
 are perfect slaves. The devil is the <I>citizen of that country;</I> 
 for he is both in city and country. Sinners <I>join themselves</I> to 
 him, hire themselves into his service, to do <I>his work,</I> to be at 
 <I>his beck,</I> and to depend upon him for maintenance and a portion. 
 They that commit sin are the <I>servants of sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:34">John viii. 34</A>.

 How did this young gentleman debase and disparage himself, when he
 hired himself into such a service and under such a master as this! He 
 <I>sent him into the fields,</I> not to feed sheep (there had been some 
 credit in that employment; Jacob, and Moses, and David, kept sheep), 
 but to <I>feed swine.</I> The business of the devil's servants is to 
 <I>make provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof,</I> and 
 that is no better than feeding greedy, dirty, noisy swine; and how can 
 rational immortal souls more disgrace themselves?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [5.] A sinful state is a state of <I>perpetual dissatisfaction.</I> 
 When the prodigal began to be in want, he thought to help himself by 
 <I>going to service;</I> and he must be content with the provision 
 which not the house, but the field, afforded; but it is poor provision: 
 <I>He would fain have filled his belly,</I> satisfied his hunger, and 
 nourished his body, <I>with the husks which the swine did eat,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 A fine pass my young master had brought himself to, to be
 fellow-commoner with the swine! Note, That which sinners, when they
 <I>depart from God,</I> promise themselves <I>satisfaction in,</I> will
 certainly disappoint them; they are <I>labouring for that which
 satisfieth not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:2">Isa. lv. 2</A>.

 That which is the <I>stumbling-block of their iniquity</I> will never
 <I>satisfy their souls, nor fill their bowels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:19">Ezek. vii. 19</A>.

 Husks are food for swine, but not for men. The wealth of the world and
 the entertainments of sense will serve for bodies; but what are these 
 to <I>precious souls?</I> They neither suit their nature, nor satisfy 
 their desires, nor supply their needs. He that takes up with them 
 <I>feeds on wind</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:1">Hos. xii. 1</A>),

 <I>feeds on ashes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:20">Isa. xliv. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [6.] A sinful state is a state which <I>cannot expect relief from any 
 creature.</I> This prodigal, when he could not earn his bread by 
 <I>working,</I> took to <I>begging;</I> but <I>no man gave unto 
 him,</I> because they knew he had brought all this misery upon himself, 
 and because he was rakish, and provoking to every body; such poor are 
 <I>least pitied.</I> This, in the application of the parable, intimates 
 that those who depart from God cannot be helped by any creature. In 
 vain do we cry to the world and the flesh (those gods which we have 
 served); they have that which will <I>poison</I> a soul, but have 
 nothing to give it which will <I>feed</I> and <I>nourish</I> it. If 
 thou refuse God's help, whence shall any creature help thee?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [7.] A sinful state is a <I>state of death: This my son was dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:24,32"><I>v.</I> 24, 32</A>.

 A sinner is not only dead in law, as he is under a sentence of death,
 but dead in state too, dead in trespasses and sins, destitute of 
 spiritual life; no union with Christ, no spiritual senses exercised, no 
 living to God, and therefore <I>dead.</I> The prodigal in the <I>far 
 country</I> was <I>dead</I> to his father and his family, cut off from 
 them, as a member from the body or a branch from the tree, and 
 therefore <I>dead,</I> and it is his own doing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [8.] A sinful state is a <I>lost state: This my son was lost</I>--lost
 to every thing that was good--lost to all virtue and honour--lost to his
 father's house; they had no joy of him. Souls that are separated from 
 God are <I>lost</I> souls; lost as a <I>traveller</I> that is out of 
 his way, and, if infinite mercy prevent not, will soon be lost as a 
 ship that is sunk at sea, lost irrecoverably.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [9.] A sinful state is a state of <I>madness</I> and <I>frenzy.</I> 
 This is intimated in that expression 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>when he came to himself,</I> which intimates that he had been 
 <I>beside himself.</I> Surely he was so when he left his father's 
 house, and much more so when he joined himself to the citizen of that 
 country. <I>Madness</I> is said to be <I>in the heart</I> of sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:3">Eccl. ix. 3</A>.

 Satan has got possession of the soul; and how raging mad was he that
 was possessed by Legion! Sinners, like those that are <I>mad,</I> 
 destroy themselves with <I>foolish lusts,</I> and yet at the same time 
 deceive themselves with foolish <I>hopes;</I> and they are, of all 
 diseased persons, most enemies to their own cure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We have here his <I>return</I> from this <I>ramble,</I> his penitent 
 <I>return</I> to his father again. When he was brought to the last 
 extremity, then he bethought himself how much it was his interest to go 
 home. Note, We must not despair of the worst; for while there is life 
 there is hope. The grace of God can soften the hardest heart, and give 
 a happy turn to the strongest stream of corruption. Now observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What was the <I>occasion</I> of his return and repentance. It was 
 his <I>affliction;</I> when he was in <I>want,</I> then he <I>came to 
 himself.</I> Note, Afflictions, when they are sanctified by divine 
 grace, prove happy means of turning sinners from the error of their 
 ways. By them the ear is opened to discipline and the heart disposed to 
 receive instructions; and they are sensible proofs both of the vanity 
 of the world and of the mischievousness of sin. Apply it spiritually. 
 When we find the insufficiency of creatures to make us happy, and have 
 tried all other ways of relief for our poor souls in vain, then it is 
 time to think of returning to God. When we see what miserable 
 comforters, what physicians of no value, all but Christ are, for a soul 
 that groans under the guilt and power of sin, and no <I>man gives unto 
 us</I> what we need, then surely we shall apply ourselves to Jesus 
 Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What was the <I>preparative</I> for it; it was 
 <I>consideration.</I> He said within himself, he reasoned with himself, 
 when he recovered his right mind, <I>How many hired servants of my 
 father's have bread enough!</I> Note, Consideration is the first step 
 towards conversion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:28">Ezek. xviii. 28</A>.

 <I>He considers, and turns.</I> To consider is to retire into
 ourselves, to reflect upon ourselves, to compare one thing with 
 another, and determine accordingly. Now observe what it was that he 
 considered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He considered how bad his condition was: <I>I perish with 
 hunger.</I> Not only, "I am <I>hungry,</I>" but, "<I>I perish with 
 hunger,</I> for I see not what way to expect relief." Note, Sinners 
 will not come to the service of Christ till they are brought to see 
 themselves just ready to perish in the service of sin; and the 
 consideration of that should drive us to Christ. <I>Master, save us, we 
 perish.</I> And though we be thus driven to Christ he will not 
 therefore reject us, nor think himself dishonoured by our being forced 
 to him, but rather honoured by his being applied to in a desperate 
 case.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He considered how much better it might be made if he would but 
 return: <I>How many hired servants of my father's,</I> the meanest in 
 his family, the very day-labourers, <I>have bread enough, and to 
 spare,</I> such a good house does he keep! Note, <I>First,</I> In our 
 <I>Father's house</I> there is bread for all his family. This was 
 taught by the twelve loaves of <I>showbread,</I> that were constantly 
 upon the holy table in the sanctuary, a loaf for every tribe. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> There is <I>enough</I> and to <I>spare,</I> enough for 
 all, enough for each, enough to spare for such as will join themselves 
 to his domestics, enough and <I>to spare</I> for <I>charity. Yet there 
 is room;</I> there are <I>crumbs</I> that fall from his table, which 
 many would be glad of, and thankful for. <I>Thirdly,</I> Even the 
 <I>hired servants</I> in God's family are well provided for; the 
 meanest that will but hire themselves into his family, to <I>do</I> his 
 work, and <I>depend</I> upon his rewards, shall be well provided for. 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> The consideration of this should encourage sinners, 
 that have gone astray from God, to think of returning to him. Thus the 
 adulteress reasons with herself, when she is disappointed in her new 
 lovers: <I>I will go and return to my first husband, for then was it 
 better with me than now,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:7">Hos. ii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What was the <I>purpose</I> of it. Since it is so, that his 
 condition is so bad, and may be bettered by returning to his father, 
 his consideration issues, at length, in this conclusion: <I>I will 
 arise, and go to my father.</I> Note, Good purposes are good things, 
 but still good performances are all in all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He determined what to do: <I>I will arise and go to my father.</I> 
 He will not take any longer time to consider of it, but will 
 <I>forthwith</I> arise and go. Though he be in a <I>far country,</I> a 
 great way off from his father's house, yet, far as it is, he will 
 return; every step of backsliding from God must be a step back again in 
 return to him. Though he be <I>joined to a citizen of this country,</I> 
 he makes no difficulty of breaking his bargain with him. We <I>are not 
 debtors to the flesh;</I> we are under no obligation at all to our 
 Egyptian task-masters to give them warning, but are at liberty to quit 
 the service when we will. Observe with what resolution he speaks: "<I>I 
 will arise, and go to my father:</I> I am resolved I will, whatever the 
 issue be, rather than <I>stay</I> here and <I>starve.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He determined what to say. True repentance is a <I>rising,</I> and 
 <I>coming</I> to God: <I>Behold, we come unto thee.</I> But what words 
 shall we take with us? He here considers what to say. Note, In all our 
 addresses to God, it is good to deliberate with ourselves beforehand 
 what we shall say, that we may <I>order our cause before him,</I> and 
 <I>fill our mouth with arguments.</I> We have <I>liberty of speech,</I> 
 and we ought to consider seriously with ourselves, how we may use that 
 liberty to the utmost, and yet not abuse it. Let us observe what he 
 purposed to say.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He would confess his fault and folly: <I>I have 
 sinned.</I> Note, Forasmuch as we have all sinned, it behoves us, and 
 well becomes us, to own that we have sinned. The confession of sin is 
 required and insisted upon, as a necessary condition of peace and 
 pardon. If we plead <I>not guilty,</I> we put ourselves upon a trial by 
 the covenant of innocency, which will certainly condemn us. If 
 <I>guilty,</I> with a contrite, penitent, and obedient heart, we refer 
 ourselves to the covenant of grace, which offers forgiveness to those 
 that <I>confess their sins.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He would aggravate it, and would be so far from
 extenuating the matter that he would <I>lay a load</I> upon himself for 
 it: I have sinned <I>against Heaven,</I> and <I>before thee.</I> Let 
 those that are <I>undutiful</I> to their <I>earthly parents</I> think 
 of this; they sin <I>against heaven, and before God.</I> Offences 
 against them are offences against God. Let us all think of this, as 
 that which renders our <I>sin exceedingly sinful,</I> and should render 
 us exceedingly sorrowful for it.

 1. Sin is committed in contempt of God's authority over us: <I>We have
 sinned against Heaven.</I> God is here called <I>Heaven,</I> to signify 
 how highly he is exalted above us, and the dominion he has over us, for 
 the <I>Heavens do rule.</I> The malignity of sin aims high; it is 
 <I>against Heaven.</I> The daring sinner is said to have <I>set his 
 mouth against the heavens,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:9">Ps. lxiii. 9</A>.

 Yet it is <I>impotent</I> malice, for we cannot hurt the heavens. Nay,
 it is foolish malice; what is shot <I>against the heavens</I> will 
 return upon the head of him that shoots it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:16">Ps. vii. 16</A>.

 Sin is an affront to the <I>God of heaven,</I> it is a forfeiture of
 the glories and joys of heaven, and a contradiction to the designs of 
 the kingdom of heaven.

 2. It is committed in contempt of God's eye upon us: "I have sinned
 <I>against Heaven</I> and yet <I>before thee,</I> and under thine eye," 
 than which there could not be a greater affront put upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> He would judge and condemn himself for it, and 
 acknowledge himself to have forfeited all the privileges of the family: 
 <I>I am no more worthy to be called thy son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He does not deny the relation (for that was all he had to trust to),
 but he owns that his father might justly deny the relation, and shut 
 his doors against him. He had, at his own demand, the portion of goods 
 that belonged to him, and had reason to expect no more. Note, It 
 becomes sinners to acknowledge themselves unworthy to receive any 
 favour from God, and to humble and abase themselves before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fourthly,</I> He would nevertheless sue for admission into the 
 family, though it were into the meanest post there: "<I>Make me as one 
 of thy hired servants:</I> that is good enough, and too good for me." 
 Note, True penitents have a high value for God's house, and the 
 privileges of it, and will be glad of any place, so they may but be in 
 it, though it be but as <I>door-keepers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:10">Ps. lxxxiv. 10</A>.

 If it be imposed on him as a mortification to sit with the servants, he
 will not only submit to it, but count it a preferment, in comparison 
 with his present state. Those that return to God, from whom they have 
 revolted, cannot but be desirous some way or other to be employed for 
 him, and put into a capacity of serving and honouring him: "<I>Make me 
 as a hired servant,</I> that I may show I love my father's house as 
 much as ever I slighted it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Fifthly,</I> In all this he would have an eye to his father as a 
 father: "<I>I will arise, and go to my father, and will say unto him, 
 Father.</I>" Note, Eyeing God as a Father, and our Father, will be of 
 great use in our repentance and return to him. It will make our sorrow 
 for sin genuine, our resolutions against it strong, and encourage us to 
 hope for pardon. God delights to be called <I>Father</I> both by 
 penitents and petitioners. <I>Is not Ephraim a dear son?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) What was the performance of this purpose: <I>He arose, and came to 
 his father.</I> His good resolve he put in execution without delay; he 
 struck while the iron was hot, and did not adjourn the thought to some 
 more convenient season. Note, It is our interest speedily to close with 
 our convictions. Have we said that we will arise and go? Let us 
 immediately arise and come. He did not come halfway, and then pretend 
 that he was tired and could get no further, but, weak and weary as he 
 was, he made a thorough business of it. <I>If thou wilt return, O 
 Israel, return unto me,</I> and <I>do thy first works.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We have here his reception and entertainment with his father: <I>He 
 came to his father;</I> but was he welcome? Yes, heartily welcome. And, 
 by the way, it is an example to parents whose children have been 
 foolish and disobedient, if they repent, and submit themselves, not to 
 be harsh and severe with them, but to be governed in such a case by the 
 wisdom that is from above, which is <I>gentle and easy to be 
 entreated;</I> herein let them be followers of God, and merciful, as he 
 is. But it is chiefly designed to set forth the grace and mercy of God 
 to poor sinners that repent and return to him, and his readiness to 
 forgive them. Now here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The great love and affection wherewith the father received the 
 son: <I>When he was yet a great way off his father saw him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 He expressed his kindness before the son expressed his repentance; for
 God prevents us with the blessings of his goodness. Even <I>before we 
 call he answers;</I> for he knows what is in our hearts. <I>I said, I 
 will confess, and thou forgavest.</I> How lively are the images 
 presented here! 

 [1.] Here were <I>eyes of mercy,</I> and those eyes quick-sighted:
 <I>When he was yet a great way off his father saw him,</I> before any 
 other of the family were aware of him, as if from the top of some high 
 tower he had been looking that way which his son was gone, with such a 
 thought as this, "O that I could see yonder wretched son of mine coming 
 home!" This intimates God's desire of the conversion of sinners, and 
 his readiness to meet them that are coming towards him. <I>He looketh 
 on men,</I> when they are gone astray from him, to see whether they 
 will return to him, and he is aware of the first inclination towards 
 him. 

 [2.] Here were <I>bowels of mercy,</I> and those bowels turning within 
 him, and yearning at the sight of his son: <I>He had compassion.</I> 
 Misery is the object of pity, even the misery of a sinner; though he 
 has brought it upon himself, yet God compassionates. <I>His soul was
 grieved for the misery of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:8,Jdg+10:16">Hos. xi. 8; Judg. x. 16</A>.

 [3.] Here were <I>feet of mercy,</I> and those feet quick-paced: <I>He
 ran.</I> This denotes how swift God is to show mercy. The prodigal son
 came slowly, under a burden of shame and fear; but the tender father 
 ran to meet him with his encouragements. 

 [4.] Here were <I>arms of mercy,</I> and those arms stretched out to 
 embrace him: <I>He fell on his neck.</I> Though guilty and deserving to 
 be beaten, though dirty and newly come from feeding swine, so that any 
 one who had not the strongest and tenderest compassions of a father 
 would have loathed to touch him, yet he thus takes him in his arms, and 
 lays him in his bosom. Thus dear are true penitents to God, thus 
 welcome to the Lord Jesus. 

 [5.] Here were <I>lips of mercy,</I> and those lips dropping as a 
 honey-comb: <I>He kissed him.</I> This kiss not only <I>assured</I> him 
 of his <I>welcome,</I> but <I>sealed his pardon;</I> his former follies 
 shall be all forgiven, and not mentioned against him, nor is one word 
 said by way of upbraiding. This was like David's kissing Absalom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:33">2 Sam. xiv. 33</A>.

 And this intimates how ready, and free, and forward the Lord Jesus is
 to receive and entertain poor returning repenting sinners, according to 
 his Father's will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The penitent submission which the poor prodigal made to his father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 He <I>said unto him, Father, I have sinned.</I> As it commends the good 
 father's kindness that he showed it before the prodigal expressed his 
 repentance, so it commends the prodigal's repentance that he expressed 
 it after his father had shown him so much kindness. When he had 
 received the kiss which sealed his pardon, yet he said, <I>Father, I 
 have sinned.</I> Note, Even those that have received the pardon of 
 their sins, and the comfortable sense of their pardon, must have in 
 their hearts a sincere contrition for it, and with their mouths must 
 make a penitent confession of it, even of those sins which they have 
 reason to hope are pardoned. David penned the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:1-19">fifty-first psalm</A>

 after Nathan had said, <I>The Lord has taken away thy sin, thou shall
 not die.</I> Nay, the comfortable sense of the pardon of sin should 
 increase our sorrow for it; and that is ingenuous evangelical sorrow 
 which is increased by such a consideration. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:63">Ezek. xvi. 63</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt be ashamed and confounded, when I am pacified towards
 thee.</I> The more we see of God's readiness to <I>forgive us,</I> the 
 more difficult it should be to us to <I>forgive ourselves.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The splendid provision which this kind father made for the 
 returning prodigal. He was going on in his submission, but one word we 
 find in his purpose to say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)
 
 which we do not find that he did say
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 and that was, <I>Make me as one of thy hired servants.</I> We cannot 
 think that he forgot it, much less that he changed his mind, and was 
 now either less desirous to be in the family or less willing to be a 
 hired servant there than when he made that purpose; but his father 
 interrupted him, prevented his saying it: "Hold, son, talk no more of 
 thy unworthiness, thou art heartily welcome, and, though not <I>worthy 
 to be called a son,</I> shalt be treated as a <I>dear son,</I> as a 
 <I>pleasant child.</I>" He who is thus entertained at first needs not 
 ask to be made <I>as a hired servant.</I> Thus when <I>Ephraim bemoaned 
 himself</I> God comforted him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:18-20">Jer. xxxi. 18-20</A>.

 It is strange that here is not one word of rebuke: "Why did you not
 stay with your harlots and your swine? You could never find the way 
 home till beaten hither with your own rod." No, here is nothing like 
 this; which intimates that, when God forgives the sins of true 
 penitents, he forgets them, he remembers them no more, they <I>shall 
 not be mentioned against them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:22">Ezek. xviii. 22</A>.

 But this is not all; here is rich and royal provision made for him,
 according to his birth and quality, far beyond what he did or could 
 expect. He would have thought it sufficient, and been very thankful, if 
 his father had but taken notice of him, and bid him go to the kitchen, 
 and get his dinner with his servants; but God does for those who return 
 to their duty, and cast themselves upon his mercy, abundantly above 
 what they are able to ask or think. The prodigal came home between hope 
 and fear, fear of being rejected and hope of being received; but his 
 father was not only better to him than his fears, but better to him 
 than his hopes--not only <I>received</I> him, but received him with 
 respect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He came home <I>in rags,</I> and his father not only 
 <I>clothed</I> him, but <I>adorned</I> him. He <I>said to the 
 servants,</I> who all attended their master, upon notice that his son 
 was come, <I>Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him.</I> The 
 worst old clothes in the house might have served, and these had been 
 good enough for him; but the father calls not for a <I>coat,</I> but 
 for a <I>robe,</I> the garment of princes and great men, the <I>best 
 robe</I>--<B><I>ten stolen ten proten</I></B>. There is a double
 emphasis: "<I>that robe, that principal robe,</I> you know which I 
 mean;" the <I>first robe</I> (so it may be read); the robe he wore 
 before he ran his ramble. When backsliders repent and do their <I>first 
 works,</I> they shall be received and dressed in their <I>first 
 robes.</I> "Bring hither that robe, and put it on him; he will be 
 ashamed to wear it, and think that it ill becomes him who comes home in 
 such a dirty pickle, but <I>put it on him,</I> and do not merely offer 
 it to him: and <I>put a ring on his hand,</I> a signet-ring, with the 
 arms of the family, in token of his being owned as a branch of the 
 family." Rich people wore rings, and his father hereby signified that 
 though he had spent one portion, yet, upon his repentance, he intended 
 him another. He came home barefoot, his feet perhaps sore with travel, 
 and therefore, "Put <I>shoes on his feet,</I> to make him easy." Thus 
 does the grace of God provide for true penitents. <I>First,</I> The 
 <I>righteousness of Christ</I> is the robe, that <I>principal robe,</I> 
 with which they are clothed; they <I>put on the Lord Jesus Christ,</I> 
 are <I>clothed</I> with that <I>Sun.</I> The <I>robe of 
 righteousness</I> is the <I>garment of salvation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:10">Isa. lxi. 10</A>.

 A <I>new nature</I> is this <I>best robe;</I> true penitents are
 clothed with this, being sanctified throughout. <I>Secondly,</I> The 
 <I>earnest</I> of the Spirit, by whom we are sealed to the day of 
 redemption, is the <I>ring on the hand.</I> After <I>you believed you 
 were sealed.</I> They that are sanctified are adorned and dignified, 
 are put in power, as Joseph was by Pharaoh's giving him a ring: "<I>Put 
 a ring on his hand,</I> to be before him a constant memorial of his 
 father's kindness, that he may never forget it." <I>Thirdly,</I> The 
 <I>preparation of the gospel of peace</I> is as <I>shoes for our 
 feet</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:15">Eph. vi. 15</A>),

 so that, compared with this here, signifies (saith Grotius) that God,
 when he receives true penitents into his favour, makes use of them for 
 the convincing and converting of others by their instructions, at least 
 by their examples. David, when pardoned, will teach transgressors God's 
 ways, and Peter, when converted, will strengthen his brethren. Or it 
 intimates that they shall go on cheerfully, and with resolution, in the 
 way of religion, as a man does when he has shoes on his feet, above 
 what he does when he is barefoot.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He came home <I>hungry,</I> and his father not only <I>fed 
 him,</I> but <I>feasted him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 "<I>Bring hither the fatted calf,</I> that has been stall-fed, and long 
 reserved for some special occasion, and <I>kill it,</I> that my son may 
 be satisfied with the best we have." Cold meat might have served, or 
 the leavings of the last meal; but he shall have fresh meat and hot 
 meat, and the fatted calf can never be better bestowed. Note, There is 
 excellent food provided by our heavenly Father for all those that 
 <I>arise</I> and <I>come to him.</I> Christ himself is the Bread of 
 Life; his flesh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed; in him 
 there is a feast for souls, a feast for fat things. It was a great 
 change with the prodigal, who just before <I>would fain have filled his 
 belly with husks.</I> How sweet will the supplies of the new covenant 
 be, and the relishes of its comforts, to those who have been 
 <I>labouring in vain</I> for satisfaction in the creature! Now he found 
 his own words made good, <I>In my father's house there is bread enough 
 and to spare.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The great joy and rejoicing occasioned by his return. The bringing 
 of the fatted calf was designed to be not only a <I>feast</I> for him, 
 but a <I>festival</I> for the family: "<I>Let us all eat, and be 
 merry,</I> for it is a good day; for <I>this my son was dead,</I> when 
 he was in his ramble, but his return is as <I>life from the dead,</I> 
 he <I>is alive again;</I> we thought that he was dead, having heard 
 nothing from him of a long time, but behold <I>he lives;</I> he <I>was 
 lost,</I> we gave him up for lost, we despaired of hearing of him, but 
 he <I>is found.</I>" Note, 

 [1.] The conversion of a soul from sin to God is the raising of that
 soul from death to life, and the finding of that which seemed to be 
 lost: it is a great, and wonderful, and happy change. What was in 
 itself <I>dead</I> is made <I>alive,</I> what was <I>lost</I> to God 
 and his church is <I>found,</I> and what was <I>unprofitable</I> 
 becomes <I>profitable,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Philem+1:11">
 Philem. 11</A>.

 It is such a change as that upon the face of the earth when the spring
 returns. 

 [2.] The conversion of sinners is greatly pleasing to the God of 
 heaven, and all that belong to his family ought to rejoice in it; those 
 in heaven <I>do,</I> and those on earth <I>should.</I> Observe, It was 
 <I>the father</I> that began the joy, and set all the rest on 
 rejoicing. <I>Therefore</I> we should be glad of the repentance of
 sinners, because it accomplishes God's design; it is the bringing of 
 those to Christ whom the Father had given him, and in whom he will be 
 for ever glorified. <I>We joy for your sakes before our God,</I> with 
 an eye to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:9">1 Thess. iii. 9</A>),

 and <I>ye are our rejoicing in the presence of our Lord Jesus 
 Christ,</I> who is the Master of the family, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:19">1 Thess. ii. 19</A>.

 The family complied with the master: <I>They began to be merry.</I>
 Note, God's children and servants ought to be affected with things as 
 he is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. We have here the <I>repining and envying of the elder brother,</I> 
 which is described by way of reproof to the scribes and Pharisees, to 
 show them the folly and wickedness of their discontent at the 
 repentance and conversion of the publicans and sinners, and the favour 
 Christ showed them; and he represents it so as not to aggravate the 
 matter, but as allowing them still the privileges of elder brethren: 
 the Jews had those privileges (though the Gentiles were favoured), for 
 the preaching of the gospel must begin at Jerusalem. Christ, when he 
 reproved them for their faults, yet accosted them mildly, to smooth 
 them into a good temper towards the poor publicans. But by the <I>elder 
 brother</I> here we may understand those who are really good, and have 
 been so from their youth up, and never went astray into any vicious 
 course of living, who <I>comparatively</I> need no repentance; and to 
 such these words in the close, <I>Son, thou art ever with me,</I> are 
 applicable without any difficulty, but not to the scribes and 
 Pharisees. Now concerning the elder brother, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How <I>foolish</I> and <I>fretful</I> he was upon occasion of his 
 brother's reception, and how he was disgusted at it. It seems he was 
 abroad <I>in the field,</I> in the country, when his brother came, and 
 by the time he had returned home the <I>mirth</I> was <I>begun; When he 
 drew nigh to the house he heard music and dancing,</I> either while the 
 dinner was getting ready, or rather after they had eaten and were full, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 He enquired <I>what these things meant</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and was informed that his brother was come, and his father had made him
 a feast for his <I>welcome home,</I> and great joy there was because he 
 had received him <I>safe and sound,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 It is but one word in the original, he had <I>received</I> him
 <B><I>hygiainonta</I></B>--<I>in health,</I> well both in body and 
 mind. He received him not only well in body, but a penitent, returned 
 to his <I>right mind,</I> and well reconciled to his father's house, 
 cured of his vices and his rakish disposition, else he had not been 
 received <I>safe</I> and <I>sound.</I> Now this offended him to the 
 highest degree: <I>He was angry, and would not go in</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 not only because he was resolved he would not himself join in the 
 mirth, but because he would show his displeasure at it, and would 
 intimate to his father that he should have kept out his younger 
 brother. This shows what is a common fault,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] In men's families. Those who have always been a comfort to their 
 parents think they should have the monopoly of their parents' favours, 
 and are apt to be <I>too sharp</I> upon those who have transgressed, 
 and to grudge their parents' kindness to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] In God's family. Those who are comparatively <I>innocents</I> 
 seldom know how to be compassionate towards those who are manifestly 
 <I>penitents.</I> The language of such we have here, in what the 
 <I>elder brother</I> said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>),

 and it is written for warning to those who by the grace of God are kept 
 from scandalous sin, and kept in the way of virtue and sobriety, that 
 they sin not after the similitude of this transgression. Let us observe 
 the particulars of it. <I>First,</I> He <I>boasted</I> of
 <I>himself</I> and <I>his own virtue</I> and <I>obedience.</I> He had 
 not only not run from his father's house, as his brother did, but had 
 made himself as a <I>servant</I> in it, and had long done so: <I>Lo, 
 these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time 
 thy commandment.</I> Note, It is too common for those that are better 
 than their neighbours to boast of it, yea, and to make their boast of 
 it before God himself, as if he were indebted to them for it. I am apt 
 to think that this elder brother said more than was true, when he 
 gloried that he had never <I>transgressed his father's commands,</I> 
 for them I believe he would not have been so obstinate as now he was to 
 <I>his father's entreaties.</I> However, we will admit it 
 comparatively; he had not been so disobedient as his brother had been. 
 O what need have good men to take heed of pride, a corruption that 
 arises out of the ashes of other corruptions! Those that have long 
 served God, and been kept from gross sins, have a great deal to be 
 humbly thankful for, but nothing proudly to boast of. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 He <I>complained of his father,</I> as if he had not been so kind as he 
 ought to have been to him, who had been so dutiful: <I>Thou never 
 gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends.</I> He was 
 out of humour now, else he would not have made this complaint; for, no 
 questions, if he had asked such a thing at any time, he might have had 
 it at the first word; and we have reason to think that he did not 
 desire it, but the <I>killing of the fatted calf</I> put him upon 
 making this peevish reflection. When men are <I>in a passion</I> they
 are apt to reflect in a way they would not if they were in their right 
 mind. He had been fed at his father's table, and had many a time been 
 merry with him and the family; but his father had never given him so 
 much as a kid, which was but a small token of love compared with the 
 <I>fatted calf.</I> Note, Those that think <I>highly</I> of themselves 
 and their services are apt to think <I>hardly</I> of their master and 
 meanly of his favours. We ought to own ourselves utterly unworthy of 
 those mercies which God has thought fit to give us, much more of those 
 that he has not thought fit to give us, and therefore we must not 
 <I>complain.</I> He would have had a kid, to <I>make merry with his 
 friends</I> abroad, whereas the <I>fatted calf</I> he grudged so much 
 was given to his brother, not to <I>make merry with his friends</I> 
 abroad, but <I>with the family</I> at home: the mirth of God's children 
 should be with their father and his family, in communion with God and 
 his saints, and not with any <I>other friends. Thirdly,</I> He was very 
 <I>ill-humoured</I> towards his younger brother, and harsh in what he 
 thought and said concerning him. Some good people are apt to be
 overtaken in this fault, nay, and to indulge themselves too much in it, 
 to look with disdain upon those who have not preserved their reputation 
 so clean as they have done, and to be sour and morose towards them, 
 yea, though they have given very good evidence of their repentance and 
 reformation. This is not the Spirit of Christ, but of the Pharisees. 
 Let us observe the instances of it. 

 1. He <I>would not go in,</I> except his brother were <I>turned
 out;</I> one house shall not hold him and his own brother, no, not his 
 <I>father's house.</I> The language of this was that of the Pharisee

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:5">Isa. lxv. 5</A>):

 <I>Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than
 thou;</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:11"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 11</A>)

 <I>I am not as other men are, nor even as this publican.</I> Note,
 Though we are to shun the society of those sinners by whom we are in 
 danger of being infected, yet we must not be shy of the company of 
 penitent sinners, by whom we may get good. He saw that his father had 
 <I>taken him in,</I> and yet he would not <I>go in</I> to him. Note, We 
 think too well of ourselves, if we cannot find in our hearts to 
 <I>receive</I> those whom God <I>hath received,</I> and to admit those 
 into favour, and friendship, and fellowship with us, whom we have 
 reason to think God has a favour for, and who are taken into friendship 
 and fellowship with him. 

 2. He would not call him <I>brother;</I> but <I>this thy son,</I> which
 sounds arrogantly, and not without reflection upon his father, as if 
 his indulgence had made him a prodigal: "He is <I>thy son,</I> thy 
 darling." Note, Forgetting the relation we stand in to our brethren, as 
 brethren, and disowning that, are at the bottom of all our neglects of 
 our duty to them and our contradictions to that duty. Let us give our 
 relations, both in the flesh and in the Lord, the titles that belong to 
 them. Let the rich call the poor <I>brethren,</I> and let the innocents 
 call the penitents so. 

 3. He <I>aggravated his brother's faults,</I> and made the worst of
 them, endeavouring to incense his father against him: He <I>is thy son, 
 who hath devoured thy living with harlots.</I> It is true, he had spent 
 his own portion foolishly enough (whether <I>upon harlots</I> or no we 
 are not told before, perhaps that was only the language of the elder 
 brother's jealousy and ill will), but that he had devoured <I>all his 
 father's living</I> was false; the father had still a good estate. Now 
 this shows how apt we are, in censuring our brethren, to <I>make the 
 worst</I> of every thing, and to set it out in the blackest colours, 
 which is not doing as we would be done by, nor as our heavenly Father 
 does by us, who is not extreme to mark iniquities.

 4. He <I>grudged</I> him the <I>kindness</I> that his father <I>showed
 him: Thou hast killed for him the fatted calf,</I> as if he were such a 
 son as he should be. Note, It is a wrong thing to <I>envy</I>
 penitents the grace of God, and to have our eye evil because he is 
 good. As we must not envy those that <I>are</I> the worst of sinners 
 the gifts of common providence (<I>Let not thine heart envy 
 sinners</I>), so we must not envy those that <I>have been</I> the worst 
 of sinners the gifts of covenant love upon their repentance; we must 
 not envy them their pardon, and peace, and comfort, no, nor any 
 extraordinary gift which God bestows upon them, which makes them 
 eminently acceptable or useful. Paul, before his conversion, had been
 a prodigal, had <I>devoured</I> his heavenly Father's <I>living</I> by 
 the <I>havoc</I> he made of the <I>church;</I> yet when after his 
 conversion he had greater measures of grace given him, and more honour 
 put upon him, than the other apostles, they who were the elder 
 brethren, who had been <I>serving Christ</I> when he was persecuting 
 him, and had not transgressed at any time his commandment, did not envy 
 him his visions and revelations, nor his more extensive usefulness, but 
 <I>glorified God in him,</I> which ought to be an example to us, as the 
 reverse of this elder brother.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Let us now see how <I>favourable</I> and <I>friendly</I> his 
 father was in <I>his carriage towards him</I> when he was thus sour and 
 ill-humoured. This is as surprising as the former. Methinks the mercy 
 and grace of our God in Christ shine almost as brightly in his tender 
 and gentle bearing with <I>peevish saints,</I> represented by the elder 
 brother here, as before in his reception of prodigal sinners upon their 
 repentance, represented by the younger brother. The disciples of Christ 
 themselves had many infirmities, and were men subject to like passions 
 as others, yet Christ bore with them, as a nurse with her children. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:7">1 Thess. ii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] When he would not come in, his <I>father came out, and entreated 
 him,</I> accosted him mildly, gave him good words, and desired him to 
 come in. He might justly have said, "If he will not come in, let him 
 stay out, shut the doors against him, and send him to seek a lodging 
 where he can find it. Is not the house my own? and may I not do what I 
 please in it? Is not the fatted calf my own? and may I not do what I 
 please with it?" No, as he to meet the younger son, so now he goes to 
 court the elder, did not send a servant out with a kind message to him, 
 but went himself. Now, <I>First,</I> This is designed to represent to 
 us the goodness of God; how strangely gentle and winning he has been 
 towards those that were strangely froward and provoking. He reasoned 
 with Cain: <I>Why art thou wroth?</I> He <I>bore Israel's manners in 
 the wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:18">Acts xiii. 18</A>.

 How mildly did God reason with Elijah, when he was upon the fret 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:46">1 Kings xix. 46</A>),

 and especially with Jonah, whose case was very parallel with this here, 
 for he was there disquieted at the repentance of Nineveh, and the mercy 
 shown to it, as the elder brother here; and those questions, <I>Dost 
 thou well to be angry?</I> and, <I>Should not I spare Nineveh?</I> are 
 not unlike these expostulations of the father with the elder brother 
 here. <I>Secondly,</I> It is to teach all superiors to be mild and
 gentle with their inferiors, even when they are in a fault and 
 passionately justify themselves in it, than which nothing can be more 
 provoking; and yet even in that case let fathers <I>not provoke their 
 children to more wrath,</I> and let <I>masters forbear threatening,</I> 
 and both show all <I>meekness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] His father assured him that the kind entertainment he gave his 
 younger brother was neither any reflection upon him nor should be any 
 prejudice to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "Thou shalt fare never the worse for it, nor have ever the less for it. 
 <I>Son, thou art ever with me;</I> the reception of him is no rejection 
 of thee, nor what is laid out on him any sensible diminution of what I 
 design for thee; thou shalt still remain entitled to the <I>pars 
 enitia</I> (so our law calls it), the <I>double portion</I> (so the
 Jewish law called it); thou shalt be <I>h&aelig;res ex asse</I> (so the 
 Roman law called it): <I>all that I have is thine,</I> by an 
 indefeasible title." If he had not <I>given him a kid to make merry 
 with his friends,</I> he had allowed him to eat bread at his table 
 continually; and it is better to be <I>happy with our Father</I> in 
 heaven than <I>merry</I> with any <I>friend</I> we have in this world. 
 Note, <I>First,</I> It is the unspeakable happiness of all the children 
 of God, who keep close to their Father's house, that they are, and 
 shall be, ever with him. They are so in this world by faith; they shall 
 be so in the other world by fruition; and all that he has is theirs; 
 for, <I>if children, then heirs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:17">Rom. viii. 17</A>.

 <I>Secondly, Therefore</I> we ought not to envy others God's grace to
 them because we shall have never the less for their sharing in it. If 
 we be true believers, all that God is, all that he has, is <I>ours;</I> 
 and, if others come to be true believers, all that he is, and all that 
 he has, is theirs too, and yet we have not the less, as they that walk 
 in the light and warmth of the sun have all the benefit they can have 
 by it, and yet not the less for others having as much; for Christ in 
 his church is like what is said of the soul in the body: it is <I>tota 
 in toto</I>--<I>the whole in the whole,</I> and yet <I>tota in qualibet 
 parte</I>--<I>the whole in each part.</I></P>
