 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the
 door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same
 is a thief and a robber.
 &nbsp; 2  But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the
 sheep.
 &nbsp; 3  To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and
 he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
 &nbsp; 4  And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before
 them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
 &nbsp; 5  And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him:
 for they know not the voice of strangers.
 &nbsp; 6  This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not
 what things they were which he spake unto them.
 &nbsp; 7  Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto
 you, I am the door of the sheep.
 &nbsp; 8  All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the
 sheep did not hear them.
 &nbsp; 9  I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved,
 and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
 &nbsp; 10  The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
 destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might
 have <I>it</I> more abundantly.
 &nbsp; 11  I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life
 for the sheep.
 &nbsp; 12  But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own
 the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep,
 and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
 &nbsp; 13  The hireling fleeth, because he is a hireling, and careth
 not for the sheep.
 &nbsp; 14  I am the good shepherd, and know my <I>sheep,</I> and am known of
 mine.
 &nbsp; 15  As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I
 lay down my life for the sheep.
 &nbsp; 16  And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them
 also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall
 be one fold, <I>and</I> one shepherd.
 &nbsp; 17  Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my
 life, that I might take it again.
 &nbsp; 18  No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I
 have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
 This commandment have I received of my Father.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is not certain whether this discourse was at the <I>feast of 
 dedication</I> in the winter (spoken of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 which may be taken as the date, not only of what follows, but of what 
 goes before (that which countenances this is, that Christ, in his 
 discourse there, carries on the metaphor of the sheep, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>,

 whence it seems that that discourse and this were at the same time); or 
 whether this was a continuation of his parley with the Pharisees, in 
 the close of the foregoing chapter. The Pharisees supported themselves 
 in their opposition to Christ with this principle, that they were the 
 <I>pastors of the church,</I> and that Jesus, having no commission from 
 them, was an intruder and an impostor, and therefore the people were 
 bound in duty to stick to <I>then,</I> against <I>him.</I> In 
 opposition to this, Christ here describes who were the false shepherds, 
 and who the true, leaving them to infer what they were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the parable or similitude proposed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:1-5"><I>v.</I> 1-5</A>);

 it is borrowed from the custom of that country, in the management of 
 their sheep. Similitudes, used for the illustration of divine truths,
 should be taken from those things that are most familiar and common, 
 that the things of God be not clouded by that which should clear them. 
 The preface to this discourse is solemn: <I>Verily, verily, I say unto 
 you,--Amen, amen.</I> This vehement asseveration intimates the 
 certainty and weight of what he said; we find <I>amen</I> doubled in 
 the church's praises and prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:13,72:19,89:52">Ps. xli. 13; lxxii. 19; lxxxix. 52</A>.

 If we would have our <I>amens</I> accepted in heaven, let Christ's
 <I>amens</I> be prevailing on earth; his repeated <I>amens.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In the parable we have, 

 (1.) The evidence of a thief and robber, that comes to do mischief to 
 the flock, and damage to the owner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 <I>He enters not by the door,</I> as having no lawful cause of entry, 
 but <I>climbs up some other way,</I> at a window, or some breach in the 
 wall. How industrious are wicked people to do mischief! What plots will 
 they lay, what pains will they take, what hazards will they run, in 
 their wicked pursuits! This should shame us out of our slothfulness
 and cowardice in the service of God.

 (2.) The character that distinguishes the rightful owner, who has a 
 property in the sheep, and a care for them: <I>He enters in by the 
 door,</I> as one having authority 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and he comes to do them some good office or other, to <I>bind up that 
 which is broken,</I> and <I>strengthen that which is sick,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:16">Ezek. xxxiv. 16</A>.

 Sheep need man's care, and, in return for it, are serviceable to man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:7">1 Cor. ix. 7</A>);

 they clothe and feed those by whom they are coted and fed.

 (3.) The ready entrance that the shepherd finds: <I>To him the porter 
 openeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Anciently they had their sheepfolds within the outer gates of their 
 houses, for the greater safety of their flocks, so that none could come 
 to them the right way, but such as the porter opened to or the master 
 of the house gave the keys to.

 (4.) The care he takes and the provision he makes for his sheep. The 
 <I>sheep hear his voice,</I> when he speaks familiarly to them, when 
 they come into the fold, as men now do to their dogs and horses; and, 
 which is more, he <I>calls his own sheep by name,</I> so exact is the 
 notice he takes of them, the account he keeps of them; and he leads 
 them our from the fold to the green pastures; and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>)

 when he <I>turns them out</I> to graze he does not drive them, but 
 (such was the custom in those times) he goes before them, to prevent 
 any mischief or danger that might meet them, and they, being used to 
 it, <I>follow him,</I> and are safe. 

 (5.) The strange attendance of the sheep upon the shepherd: <I>They 
 know his voice,</I> so as to discern his mind by it, and to distinguish 
 it from that of a stranger (for <I>the ox knows his owner,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:3">Isa. i. 3</A>),

 and <I>a stranger will they not follow,</I> but, as suspecting some ill
 design, will flee from him, not <I>knowing his voice,</I> but that it 
 is not the voice of their own shepherd. This is the parable; we have 
 the key to it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:31">Ezek. xxxiv. 31</A>:

 <I>You my flock are men, and I am your God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us observe from this parable, 

 (1.) That good men are fitly compared to sheep. Men, as creatures 
 depending on their Creator, are called the <I>sheep of his pasture.</I> 
 Good men, as new creatures, have the good qualities of sheep, 
 <I>harmless</I> and inoffensive as sheep; <I>meek</I> and quiet, 
 without noise; <I>patient</I> as sheep under the hand both of the 
 shearer and of the butcher; <I>useful</I> and profitable, tame and 
 tractable, to the shepherd, and <I>sociable</I> one with another, and 
 much used in sacrifices. 

 (2.) The church of God in the world is a <I>sheepfold,</I> into which 
 the <I>children of God</I> that were scattered abroad are <I>gathered 
 together</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52"><I>ch.</I> xi. 52</A>),

 and in which they are united and incorporated; it is a good fold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:14">Ezek. xxxiv. 14</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+2:12">Mic. ii. 12</A>.

 This fold is well fortified, for God himself is as a <I>wall of fire
 about it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:5">Zech. ii. 5</A>.

 (3.) This sheepfold lies much exposed to thieves and robbers; crafty
 seducers that debauch and deceive, and cruel persecutors that destroy 
 and devour; <I>grievous wolves</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:29">Acts xx. 29</A>);

 thieves that would steal Christ's sheep from him, to sacrifice them to 
 devils, or steal their food from them, that they might perish for lack 
 of it; <I>wolves</I> in sheep's clothing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:15">Matt. vii. 15</A>.

 (4.) The great Shepherd of the sheep takes wonderful care of the flock 
 and of all that belong to it. God is the great Shepherd, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:1">Ps. xxiii. 1</A>.

 He knows those that are his calls them by name, marks them for himself, 
 leads them out to fat pastures, makes them both feed and rest there, 
 speaks comfortably to them, guards them by his providence, guides them 
 by his Spirit and word, and goes before them, <I>to set them in the way 
 of his steps.</I> 

 (5.) The under-shepherds, who are entrusted to feed the flock of God, 
 ought to be careful and faithful in the discharge of that trust; 
 magistrates must defend them, and protect and advance all their secular 
 interests; ministers must serve them in their spiritual interests, must 
 <I>feed their souls</I> with the word of God faithfully opened and 
 applied, and with gospel ordinances duly administered, <I>taking the 
 oversight of them.</I> They must <I>enter by the door</I> of a regular 
 ordination, and to such <I>the porter will open;</I> the Spirit of 
 Christ will <I>set before them an open door,</I> give them authority in 
 the church, and assurance in their own bosoms. They must know the 
 members of their flocks by name, and watch over them; must lead them 
 into the pastures of public ordinances, preside among them, be their 
 mouth to God and God's to them; and in their conversation must be 
 examples to the believers. 

 (6.) Those who are truly the sheep of Christ will be very observant of 
 their Shepherd, and very cautious and shy of strangers. 

 [1.] <I>They follow their Shepherd,</I> for they <I>know his voice,</I> 
 having both a discerning ear, and an obedient heart. 

 [2.] <I>They flee from a stranger,</I> and dread following him, because 
 they know not his voice. It is dangerous following those in whom we
 discern not the <I>voice of Christ,</I> and who would draw us from 
 <I>faith in him</I> to <I>fancies concerning him.</I> And those who 
 have experienced the power and efficacy of divine truths upon their 
 souls, and have the savour and relish of them, have a wonderful 
 sagacity to discover Satan's wiles, and to discern between good and 
 evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Jew's ignorance of the drift and meaning of this discourse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Jesus spoke this parable</I> to them, this figurative, but wise, 
 elegant, and instructive discourse, <I>but they understood not what the 
 things were which he spoke unto them,</I> were not aware whom he meant 
 by the <I>thieves and robbers</I> and whom by the <I>good Shepherd.</I> 
 It is the sin and shame of many who hear the word of Christ that they 
 do not understand it, and they do not because they will not, and 
 because they will <I>mis-understand it.</I> They have no acquaintance 
 with, nor taste of, the things themselves, and therefore do not 
 understand the parables and comparisons with which they are 
 illustrated. The Pharisees had a great conceit of their own knowledge, 
 and could not bear that it should be questioned, and yet they had not 
 sense enough to <I>understand the things that Jesus spoke of;</I> they 
 were above their capacity. Frequently the greatest pretenders to 
 knowledge are most ignorant in the things of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Christ's explication of this parable, opening the particulars of 
 it fully. Whatever difficulties there may be in the sayings of the Lord 
 Jesus, we shall find him ready to explain himself, if we be but willing 
 to understand him. We shall find one scripture expounding another, and 
 the <I>blessed Spirit</I> interpreter to the <I>blessed Jesus.</I> 
 Christ, in the parable, had distinguished the shepherd from the robber 
 by this, that he <I>enters in by the door.</I> Now, in the explication 
 of the parable, he makes himself to be both <I>the door</I> by which 
 the shepherd enters and the shepherd that enters in by the door. Though 
 it may be a solecism in rhetoric to make the same person to be both the 
 <I>door</I> and the <I>shepherd,</I> it is no solecism in divinity to 
 make Christ to have his authority from himself, as he has life in 
 himself; and <I>himself</I> to <I>enter by his own blood,</I> as the 
 door, <I>into the holy place.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Christ is <I>the door.</I> This he saith to those who pretended to 
 <I>seek for righteousness,</I> but, like the Sodomites, <I>wearied 
 themselves to find the door,</I> where it was not to be found. He saith 
 it to the Jews, who would be thought God's only sheep, and to the 
 Pharisees, who would be thought their only shepherds: <I>I am the 
 door</I> of the sheepfold; the door of the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In general, 

 [1.] He is as a <I>door shut,</I> to keep out thieves and robbers, and 
 such as are not fit to be admitted. The shutting of the door is the 
 securing of the house; and what greater security has the church of God 
 than the interposal of the Lord Jesus, and his wisdom, power, and 
 goodness, betwixt it and all its enemies? 

 [2.] He is as a <I>door open</I> for passage and communication. 
 <I>First,</I> By Christ, as the door, we have our first admission into 
 the flock of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:6"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 6</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> We go in and out in a religious conversation, assisted
 by him, accepted in him; walking up and down in his name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:12">Zech. x. 12</A>.
 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> By him God comes to his church, visits it, and
 communicates himself to it. <I>Fourthly,</I> By him, as the door, the
 sheep are at last admitted into the heavenly kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:34">Matt. xxv. 34</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) More particularly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Christ is the door of <I>the shepherds,</I> so that none who come 
 not in by him are to be accounted <I>pastors,</I> but (according to the 
 rule laid down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 <I>thieves and robbers</I> (though they pretended to be 
 <I>shepherds</I>); but the <I>sheep did not hear them.</I> This refers 
 to all those that had the character of shepherds in <I>Israel,</I> 
 whether magistrates or ministers, that exercised their office without 
 any regard to the Messiah, or any other expectations of him than what 
 were suggested by their own carnal interest. Observe, <I>First,</I> The 
 character given of them: they are <I>thieves and robbers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 all that <I>went before him,</I> not in time, many of them were 
 faithful shepherds, but all that <I>anticipated</I> his commission, and 
 went before he sent them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:21">Jer. xxiii. 21</A>),

 that assumed a precedency and superiority above him, as the antichrist
 is said to <I>exalt himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:4">2 Thess. ii. 4</A>.

 "The scribes, and Pharisees, and chief priests, <I>all, even as many as 
 have come before me,</I> that have endeavoured to forestal my interest, 
 and to prevent my gaining any room in the minds of people, by 
 prepossessing them with prejudices against me, they are <I>thieves and 
 robbers,</I> and steal those hearts which they have no title to, 
 defrauding the right owner of his property." They condemned our Saviour 
 as a thief and a robber, because he did not come in by them as the 
 door, nor take out a license from them; but he shows that they ought to 
 have received their commission from him, to have been admitted by him, 
 and to have come after him, and because they did not, but stepped 
 <I>before him,</I> they were <I>thieves and robbers.</I> They would not 
 come in as his disciples, and therefore were condemned as usurpers, and 
 their pretended commissions vacated and superseded. Note, Rivals with 
 Christ are robbers of his church, however they pretend to be 
 <I>shepherds,</I> nay, <I>shepherds of shepherds. Secondly,</I> The
 care taken to preserve the sheep from them: <I>But the sheep did not 
 hear them.</I> Those that had a true savour of piety, that were 
 spiritual and heavenly, and sincerely devoted to God and godliness, 
 could by no means approve of the traditions of the elders, nor relish 
 their formalities. Christ's disciples, without any particular
 instructions from their Master, made no conscience of eating with 
 unwashen hands, or plucking the ears of corn on the sabbath day; for 
 nothing is more opposite to true Christianity than Pharisaism is, nor 
 any thing more disrelishing to a soul truly devout than their 
 hypocritical devotions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] Christ is the door of <I>the sheep</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>By me</I> (<B><I>di emou</I></B>--<I>through me</I> as the door)
 <I>if any man enter into the sheepfold,</I> as one of the flock, he 
 <I>shall be saved;</I> shall not only by safe from thieves and robbers, 
 but he shall be happy, he <I>shall go in and out.</I> Here are, 
 <I>First,</I> Plain directions how to come into the fold: we must come 
 in <I>by Jesus Christ</I> as the door. By faith in him, as the great 
 Mediator between God and man, we come into covenant and communion with 
 God. There is no entering into God's church but by coming into Christ's 
 church; nor are any looked upon as members of the kingdom of God among 
 men but those that are willing to submit to the grace and government of 
 the Redeemer. We must now enter by the <I>door of faith</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:27">Acts xiv. 27</A>),

 since the door of <I>innocency</I> is shut against us, and that 
 <I>pass</I> become unpassable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:24">Gen. iii. 24</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Precious promises to those who observe this direction. 
 
 1. They <I>shall be saved hereafter;</I> this is the privilege of
 <I>their home.</I> These sheep shall be saved from being distrained and 
 impounded by divine justice for trespass done, satisfaction being made 
 for the damage by their great Shepherd, saved from being a prey to the 
 roaring lion; they shall be <I>for ever happy.</I> 

 2. In the mean time they shall <I>go in and out and find pasture;</I>
 this is the privilege of <I>their way.</I> They shall have their 
 conversation in the world by the grace of Christ, shall be in his fold 
 as a man at his own house, where he has <I>free ingress, egress,</I> 
 and <I>regress.</I> True believers are <I>at home</I> in Christ; when 
 they go out, they are not <I>shut out</I> as strangers, but have 
 liberty to come in again; when they come in, they are not <I>shut 
 in</I> as trespassers, but have liberty to go out. They go out to the 
 field in the morning, they come into the fold at night; and in both the 
 Shepherd leads and keeps them, and they <I>find pasture</I> in both: 
 grass in the field, fodder in the fold. In public, in private, they 
 have the word of God to converse with, by which their spiritual life is 
 supported and nourished, and out of which their gracious desires are 
 satisfied; they are replenished with the goodness of God's house.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ is the <I>shepherd,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>,

 &c. He was prophesied of under the Old Testament as a <I>shepherd,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11,Eze+34:23,37:24,Zec+13:7">Isa. xl. 11; 
 Ezek. xxxiv. 23; xxxvii. 24; Zech. xiii. 7</A>.

 In the New Testament he is spoken of as the <I>great Shepherd</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:20">Heb. xiii. 20</A>),
 
 the <I>chief Shepherd</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:4">1 Pet. v. 4</A>),

 the <I>Shepherd and bishop of our souls,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:25">1 Pet. ii. 25</A>.

 God, our great owner, the sheep of whose pasture we are by creation,
 has constituted his Son Jesus to be our <I>shepherd;</I> and here again 
 and again he owns the relation. He has all that care of his church, and 
 every believer, that a good shepherd has of his flock; and expects all 
 that attendance and observance from the church, and every believer, 
 which the shepherds in those countries had from their flocks.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Christ is <I>a shepherd,</I> and not as the thief, not as those 
 that <I>came not in by the door.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The mischievous design of the thief 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The thief cometh not</I> with any good intent, but to <I>steal, and 
 to kill, and to destroy. First,</I> Those whom they <I>steal,</I> whose 
 hearts and affections they steal from Christ and his pastures, they 
 <I>kill and destroy</I> spiritually; for the <I>heresies</I> they 
 <I>privily bring in</I> are <I>damnable.</I> Deceivers of souls are 
 murderers of souls. Those that steal away the scripture by keeping it
 in an unknown tongue, that steal away the sacraments by maiming them 
 and altering the property of them, that steal away Christ's ordinances 
 to put their own inventions in the room of them, they <I>kill and 
 destroy;</I> ignorance and idolatry are destructive things. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> Those whom they cannot <I>steal,</I> whom they can 
 neither lead, drive, nor carry away, from the flock of Christ, they aim 
 by persecutions and massacres to <I>kill and destroy</I> corporally. He 
 that will not suffer himself to be robbed is in danger of being 
 slain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The gracious design of the shepherd; he is come,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> To <I>give life to the sheep.</I> In opposition to the 
 design of the thief, which is to <I>kill and destroy</I> (which was the 
 design of the <I>scribes</I> and <I>Pharisees</I>) Christ saith, <I>I 
 am come among men,</I> 

 1. That <I>they might have life.</I> He came to put life into the
 flock, the church in general, which had seemed rather like a valley 
 full of dry bones than like a pasture covered over with flocks. Christ 
 came to vindicate divine truths, to purify divine ordinances, to 
 redress grievances, and to revive dying zeal, to <I>seek</I> those of 
 his flock that were <I>lost,</I> to <I>bind up that which was 
 broken</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:16">Ezek. xxxiv. 16</A>),

 and this to his church is <I>as life from the dead.</I> He came to 
 <I>give life</I> to particular believers. Life is inclusive of all 
 good, and stands in opposition to the death threatened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:17">Gen. ii. 17</A>);
 
 that <I>we might have life,</I> as a criminal has when he is pardoned, 
 as a sick man when he is cured, a dead man when he is raised; that we 
 might be justified, sanctified, and at last glorified. 

 2. That they might have it <I>more abundantly,</I> <B><I>kai perisson
 echosin</I></B>. As we read it, it is <I>comparative,</I> that they 
 might have a life <I>more abundant</I> than that which was lost and 
 forfeited by sin, more abundant than that which was promised by the law 
 of Moses, length of days in Canaan, more abundant than could have been 
 expected or than we are <I>able to ask or think.</I> But it may be 
 construed without a note of comparison, <I>that they might have 
 abundance,</I> or might <I>have it abundantly.</I> Christ came to give 
 life and <B><I>perisson ti</I></B>--<I>something more,</I> something 
 <I>better,</I> life with advantage; that in Christ we might not only 
 live, but live comfortably, live plentifully, live and rejoice. Life in 
 abundance is <I>eternal life,</I> life without death or fear of death, 
 life and <I>much more.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> To <I>give his life for the sheep,</I> and this that 
 he might give life <I>to them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</I> 

 1. It is the property of every good shepherd to hazard and expose his
 life for the sheep. Jacob did so, when he would go through such a
 fatigue to attend them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:40">Gen. xxxi. 40</A>.

 So did David, when he <I>slew the lion and the bear.</I> Such a 
 shepherd of souls was St. Paul, who would gladly <I>spend, and be 
 spent,</I> for their service, and <I>counted not his life dear to 
 him,</I> in comparison with their salvation. But, 

 2. It was the prerogative of the great Shepherd to give his life to
 purchase his flock

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:28">Acts xx. 28</A>),

 to satisfy for their trespass, and to shed his blood to wash and 
 cleanse them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Christ is <I>a good shepherd,</I> and not as a hireling. There 
 were many that were not thieves, aiming to kill and destroy the sheep, 
 but passed for shepherds, yet were very careless in the discharge of 
 their duty, and through their neglect the flock was greatly damaged; 
 <I>foolish shepherds, idle shepherds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:15,17">Zech. xi. 15, 17</A>.

 In opposition to these,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] Christ here <I>calls himself the good shepherd</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 <B><I>ho poimen ho kalos</I></B>--<I>that shepherd, that good 
 Shepherd,</I> whom God had promised. Note, Jesus Christ is the best of 
 shepherds, the best in the world to take the over-sight of souls, none 
 so skilful, so faithful, so tender, as he, no such feeder and leader, 
 no such protector and healer of souls as he.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He <I>proves himself</I> so, in opposition to all hirelings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.
 
 Where observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> The carelessness of the unfaithful shepherd described 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>);

 he that is a hireling, that is employed as a servant and is paid for 
 his pains, <I>whose own the sheep are not,</I> who has neither profit 
 nor loss by them, <I>sees the wolf coming,</I> or some other danger 
 threatening, and <I>leaves the sheep</I> to the wolf, for in truth he 
 <I>careth not for them.</I> Here is plain reference to that of the 
 idol-shepherd, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+11:17">Zech. xi. 17</A>.

 Evil shepherds, magistrates and ministers, are here described both by
 their bad principles and their bad practices.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> Their <I>bad principles,</I> the root of their bad practices. 
 What makes those that have the charge of souls in trying times to 
 betray their trust, and in quiet times not to mind it? What makes them 
 false, and trifling, and self-seeking? It is because they are 
 <I>hirelings,</I> and <I>care not for the sheep.</I> That is, 

 (<I>a.</I>) The wealth of the world is the chief of their good; it is 
 because they are <I>hirelings.</I> They undertook the shepherds' 
 office, as a trade to live and grow rich by, not as an opportunity of 
 serving Christ and doing good. It is the love of money, and of their 
 own bellies, that carries them on in it. Not that those are hirelings 
 who, while they <I>serve at the altar, live,</I> and live comfortably, 
 <I>upon the altar.</I> The labourer is worthy of his meat; and a 
 scandalous maintenance will soon make a scandalous ministry. But those 
 are <I>hirelings</I> that love the wages more than the work, and <I>set 
 their hearts</I> upon that, as the hireling is said to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:15">Deut. xxiv. 15</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:29,Isa+56:11,Mic+3:5,11">1 Sam. ii. 29; 
 Isa. lvi. 11; Mic. iii. 5, 11</A>.

 (<I>b.</I>) The work of their place is the least of their care. They
 <I>value not the sheep,</I> are unconcerned in the souls of others; 
 their business is to be their brothers' lords, not their brothers' 
 keepers or helpers; they <I>seek their own things,</I> and do not, like 
 Timothy, <I>naturally care for the state of souls.</I> What can be 
 expected but that they will flee when the <I>wolf comes.</I> He 
 <I>careth not for the sheep,</I> for he is one <I>whose own the sheep 
 are not.</I> In one respect we may say of the best of the 
 under-shepherds that the sheep are <I>not their own,</I> they have not 
 dominion over them not property in them (<I>feed my sheep</I> and <I>my 
 lambs,</I> saith Christ); but in respect of dearness and affection they 
 should be <I>their own.</I> Paul looked upon those as <I>his own</I> 
 whom he called his <I>dearly beloved and longed for.</I> Those who do 
 not cordially espouse the church's interests, and make them their own, 
 will not long be faithful to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> Their <I>bad practices,</I> the effect of these bad 
 principles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 See here,

 (<I>a.</I>) How basely the hireling deserts his post; when he sees
 <I>the wolf coming,</I> though then there is most need of him, he 
 <I>leaves the sheep and flees.</I> Note, Those who mind their safety 
 more than their duty are an easy prey to Satan's temptations. 
 
 (<I>b.</I>) How fatal the consequences are! the hireling fancies the 
 sheep may look to themselves, but it does not prove so: <I>the wolf 
 catches them,</I> and <I>scatters the sheep,</I> and woeful havoc is 
 made of the flock, which will all be charged upon the treacherous 
 shepherd. The blood of perishing souls is required at the hand of the 
 careless watchmen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> See here the grace and tenderness of the good Shepherd 
 set over against the former, as it was in the prophecy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:21,22">Ezek. xxxiv. 21, 22</A>,

 &c.): <I>I am the good Shepherd.</I> It is matter of comfort to the
 church, and all her friends, that, however she may be damaged and 
 endangered by the treachery and mismanagement of her under-officers, 
 the Lord Jesus is, and will be, as he ever has been, <I>the good 
 Shepherd.</I> Here are two great instances of the shepherd's 
 goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> His <I>acquainting</I> himself with his flock, with all that 
 belong or in any wise appertain to his flock, which are of two sorts, 
 both known to him:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) He is acquainted with all that <I>are now of his flock</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>),
 
 as the good Shepherd 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>):

 <I>I know my sheep and am known of mine.</I> Note, There is a mutual 
 acquaintance between Christ and true believers; they know one another 
 very well, and knowledge notes affection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>a.</I>] Christ <I>knows his sheep.</I> He knows with a 
 <I>distinguishing</I> eye who are his sheep, and who are not; he knows 
 the sheep under their many infirmities, and the goats under their most 
 plausible disguises. He knows with a <I>favourable</I> eye those that 
 in truth are his own sheep; he takes cognizance of their state, 
 concerns himself for them, has a tender and affectionate regard to 
 them, and is continually mindful of them in the intercession he ever 
 lives to make within the veil; he visits them graciously by his Spirit, 
 and has communion with them; he <I>knows</I> them, that is, he approves 
 and accepts of them, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:6,37:18,Ex+33:17">Ps. i. 6; xxxvii. 18; 
 Exod. xxxiii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>b.</I>] He is <I>known of them.</I> He observes them with an eye of 
 favour, and they observe him with an eye of faith. Christ's knowing his 
 sheep is put before their knowing him, for he knew and loved us first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+4:19">1 John iv. 19</A>),

 and it is not so much our knowing him as our being known of him that is 
 our happiness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:9">Gal. iv. 9</A>.

 Yet it is the character of Christ's sheep that <I>they know him;</I> 
 know him from all pretenders and intruders; they know his mind, know 
 his voice, know by experience the power of his death. Christ speaks 
 here as if he gloried in being known by his sheep, and thought their 
 respect an honour to him. Upon this occasion Christ mentions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)
 
 the mutual acquaintance between his Father and himself: <I>As the 
 Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father.</I> Now this may be 
 considered, either, <I>First,</I> As the <I>ground</I> of that intimate 
 acquaintance and relation which subsist between Christ and believers. 
 The covenant of grace, which is the bond of this relation, is founded 
 in the covenant of redemption between the Father and the Son, which, we 
 may be sure, stands firm; for the Father and the Son understood one 
 another perfectly well in that matter, and there could be no mistake, 
 which might leave the matter at any uncertainty, or bring it into any 
 hazard. The Lord Jesus <I>knows whom he hath chosen,</I> and is sure of 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:18"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 18</A>),

 and they also <I>know whom they have trusted,</I> and are sure of him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:12">2 Tim. i. 12</A>),

 and the ground of both is the perfect knowledge which the Father and 
 the Son had of one another's mind, when <I>the counsel of peace was 
 between them both.</I> Or, <I>Secondly,</I> As an apt similitude, 
 illustrating the intimacy that is between Christ and believers. It may 
 be connected with the foregoing words, thus: <I>I know my sheep, and am 
 known of mine, even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father;</I> 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:21"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 21</A>.

 1. As the Father knew the Son, and loved him, and owned him in his
 sufferings, when he was <I>led as a sheep to the slaughter,</I> so
 Christ knows his sheep, and has a watchful tender eye upon them, will
 be with them when they are <I>left alone,</I> as his Father was with
 him. 

 2. As the Son knew the Father, loved and obeyed him, and always did
 those things that pleased him, confiding in him as his God even when he 
 seemed to forsake him, so believers know Christ with an obediential 
 fiducial regard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) He is acquainted with those that are <I>hereafter to be of 
 this flock</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Other sheep I have,</I> have a right to and an interest in, <I>which 
 are not of this fold,</I> of the Jewish church; <I>them also I must 
 bring.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>a.</I>] The eye that Christ had to the poor Gentiles. He had 
 sometimes intimated his special concern for <I>the lost sheep of the 
 house of Israel;</I> to them indeed his personal ministry was confined;
 but, saith he, <I>I have other sheep.</I> Those who in process of time 
 should believe in Christ, and be brought into obedience to him from 
 among the Gentiles, are here called <I>sheep,</I> and he is said to 
 have them, though as yet they were <I>uncalled,</I> and many of them 
 <I>unborn,</I> because they were chosen of God, and given to Christ in 
 the counsels of divine love from eternity. Christ has a right, by 
 virtue of the Father's donation and his own purchase, to many a soul of 
 which he has not yet the possession; thus he had <I>much people</I> in 
 Corinth, when as yet it lay in wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:10">Acts xviii. 10</A>.

 "Those other sheep <I>I have,</I>" saith Christ, "I have them on my
 heart, have them in my eye, am as sure to have them as if I had them 
 already." Now Christ speaks of those <I>other sheep, First,</I> To take 
 off the contempt that was put upon him, as having <I>few followers,</I> 
 as having but a <I>little flock,</I> and therefore, if a <I>good</I> 
 shepherd, yet a <I>poor</I> shepherd: "But," saith he, "I have more 
 sheep than you see." <I>Secondly,</I> To take down the pride and 
 vain-glory of the Jews, who thought the Messiah must gather all his 
 sheep from among them. "No," saith Christ, "I have others whom I will 
 set with the lambs of my flock, though you disdain to set them with the 
 dogs of your flock."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>b.</I>] The purposes and resolves of his grace concerning them: 
 "<I>Them also I must bring,</I> bring home to God, bring into the 
 church, and, in order to this, bring off from their vain conversation, 
 bring them back from their wanderings, as that <I>lost sheep,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:5">Luke xv. 5</A>.

 But why <I>must</I> he bring them? What was the necessity?
 <I>First,</I> The <I>necessity of their case</I> required it: "I 
 <I>must</I> bring, or they must be left to wander endlessly, for, like 
 sheep, they will never come back of themselves, and no other can or 
 will bring them." <I>Secondly,</I> The <I>necessity of his own 
 engagements</I> required it; he must bring them, or he would not be 
 faithful to his trust, and true to his undertaking. "They are <I>my 
 own,</I> bought and paid for, and therefore I <I>must not</I> neglect 
 them nor leave them to perish." He <I>must</I> in honour <I>bring</I> 
 those with whom he was entrusted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>c.</I>] The happy effect and consequence of this, in two 
 things:--<I>First,</I> "They shall hear my voice. Not only my voice
 shall be heard <I>among them</I> (whereas they have not heard, and 
 therefore could not believe, now the <I>sound</I> of the gospel shall 
 <I>go to the ends of the earth</I>), but it shall be heard <I>by 
 them;</I> I will speak, and give to them to hear." Faith comes by 
 hearing, and our diligent observance of the voice of Christ is both a 
 means and an evidence of our being brought to Christ, and to God by 
 him. <I>Secondly, There shall be one fold and one shepherd.</I> As 
 there is one shepherd, so there shall be one fold. Both Jews and 
 Gentiles, upon their turning to the faith of Christ, shall be 
 incorporated in one church, be joint and equal sharers in the 
 privileges of it, without distinction. Being united to Christ, they 
 shall unite in him; two sticks shall become one in the hand of the 
 Lord. Note, One shepherd makes one fold; one Christ makes one church. 
 As the church is one in its constitution, subject to one head, animated 
 by one Spirit, and guided by one rule, so the members of it ought to be 
 one in love and affection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:3-6">Eph. iv. 3-6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> Christ's <I>offering up himself for his sheep</I> is another 
 proof of his being a <I>good shepherd,</I> and in this he yet more 
 <I>commended his love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:15,17,18"><I>v.</I> 15, 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>a.</I>) He declares his purpose of <I>dying for his flock</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>I lay down my life for the sheep.</I> He not only ventured his life 
 for them (in such a case, the hope of <I>saving</I> it might balance 
 the fear of <I>losing it</I>), but he actually <I>deposited</I> it, and 
 submitted to a necessity of dying for our redemption; 
 <B><I>tithemi</I></B>--<I>I put it</I> as a pawn or pledge; as 
 purchase-money paid down. Sheep appointed for the slaughter, ready to 
 be sacrificed, were ransomed with the blood of the shepherd. He laid 
 down his life, <B><I>hyper ton probaton</I></B>, not only for the good 
 of the sheep, but <I>in their stead.</I> Thousands of sheep had been 
 offered in sacrifice for their shepherds, as sin-offerings, but here, 
 by a surprising reverse, the shepherd is sacrificed for the sheep. When 
 David, the shepherd of Israel, was himself guilty, and the destroying 
 angel drew his sword against the flock for his sake, with good reason 
 did he plead, <I>These sheep, what evil have they done? Let thy hand be 
 against me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:17">2 Sam. xxiv. 17</A>.

 But the Son of David was sinless and spotless; and his sheep, what evil
 have they not done? Yet he saith, <I>Let thine hand be against me.</I> 
 Christ here seems to refer to that prophecy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+13:17">Zech. xiii. 7</A>,

 <I>Awake, O sword, against my shepherd;</I> and, though the smiting of
 the shepherd be for the present the <I>scattering</I> of the flock, it 
 is in order to the gathering of them in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (<I>b.</I>) He takes off the offence of the cross, which to many is a 
 stone of stumbling, by four considerations:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>a.</I>] That his <I>laying down his life for the sheep</I> was the 
 condition, the performance of which entitled him to the honours and 
 powers of his exalted state 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life.</I> 
 Upon these terms I am, as Mediator, to expect my Father's acceptance 
 and approbation, and the glory designed me--that I become a sacrifice 
 for the chosen remnant." Not but that, as the Son of God, he was 
 beloved of his Father from eternity, but as <I>God-man,</I> as 
 <I>Immanuel,</I> he was <I>therefore</I> beloved of the Father because 
 he undertook to <I>die for the sheep; therefore</I> God's soul 
 delighted in him as his elect because herein he was his <I>faithful 
 servant</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa. xlii. 1</A>);

 therefore he said, <I>This is my beloved Son.</I> What an instance is 
 this of God's love to man, that he loved his Son the more for loving 
 us! See what a value Christ puts upon his Father's love, that, to 
 recommend himself to that, he would lay down his life for the sheep.
 Did he think God's love recompence sufficient for all his services and 
 sufferings, and shall we think it too little for ours, and court the 
 smiles of the world to make it up? <I>Therefore doth my Father love 
 me,</I> that is, me, and all that by faith become one with me; me, and 
 the mystical body, <I>because I lay down my life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>b.</I>] That his laying down his life was in order to his resuming 
 it: <I>I lay down my life, that I may receive it again. First,</I> This 
 was the effect of his Father's love, and the first step of his 
 exaltation, the fruit of that love. Because he was God's <I>holy 
 one,</I> he must not <I>see corruption,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:10">Ps. xvi. 10</A>.

 God loved him too well to leave him in the grave. <I>Secondly,</I> This
 he had in his eye, in laying down his life, that he might have an 
 opportunity of declaring himself to be the Son of God with power by his 
 resurrection,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:4">Rom. i. 4</A>.
 
 By a divine stratagem (like that before Ai, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+8:15">Josh. viii. 15</A>)

 he yielded to death, as if he were smitten before it, that he might the 
 more gloriously conquer death, and triumph over the grave. He laid down 
 a <I>vilified</I> body, that he might assume a <I>glorified</I> one, 
 fit to ascend to the world of spirits; laid down a life adapted to this 
 world, but assumed one adapted to the other, like a corn of wheat,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:24"><I>ch.</I> xii. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [<I>c.</I>] That he was perfectly voluntary in his sufferings and death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "No one doth or can force my life from me against my will, but I freely 
 <I>lay it down of myself,</I> I deliver it as my own act and deed, for 
 I <I>have</I> (which no man has) <I>power to lay it down, and to take 
 it again.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>1st,</I> See here the power of Christ, as the Lord of life, 
 particularly of his own life, which he had <I>in himself.</I> 

 1. He had power to <I>keep his life</I> against all the world, so that
 it could not be wrested from him without his own consent. Though
 Christ's life seemed to be taken by storm, yet really it was 
 surrendered, otherwise it had been impregnable, and never taken. The 
 Lord Jesus did not fall into the hands of his persecutors because he 
 could not avoid it, but threw himself into their hands because his hour 
 was come. <I>No man taketh my life from me.</I> This was such a 
 challenge as was never given by the most daring hero. 

 2. He had power to <I>lay down his life.</I>

 (1.) He had ability to do it. He could, when he pleased, slip the knot 
 of union between soul and body, and, without any act of violence done 
 to himself, could disengage them from each other: having voluntarily 
 <I>taken up</I> a body, he could voluntarily lay it down again, which 
 appeared when he cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. 

 (2.) He had authority to do it, <B><I>exousian</I></B>. Though we could 
 find instruments of cruelty, wherewith to make an end of our own lives, 
 yet <I>Id possumus quod jure possumus--we can do that, and that only, 
 which we can do lawfully.</I> We are not at liberty to do it; but 
 Christ had a sovereign authority to dispose of his own life as he 
 pleased. He was no debtor (as we are) either to life or death, but
 perfectly <I>sui juris.</I> 

 3. He had power to <I>take it again;</I> we have not. Our life, once 
 laid down, is <I>as water spilt upon the ground;</I> but Christ, when 
 he laid down his life, still had it within reach, within call, and 
 could resume it. Parting with it by a voluntary conveyance, he might 
 limit the surrender at pleasure, and he did it with a power of 
 revocation, which was necessary to preserve the intentions of the 
 surrender.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>2ndly,</I> See here the grace of Christ; since none could demand his 
 life of him by law, or extort it by force, he <I>laid it down of 
 himself,</I> for our redemption. He offered himself to be the Saviour: 
 <I>Lo, I come;</I> and then, the necessity of our case calling for it, 
 he offered himself to be a sacrifice: <I>Here am I, let these go their 
 way; by which will we are sanctified,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:10">Heb. x. 10</A>.

 He was both the offerer and the offering, so that <I>his laying down
 his life</I> was his offering up himself.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  There was a division therefore again among the Jews for
 these sayings.
 &nbsp; 20  And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear
 ye him?
 &nbsp; 21  Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a
 devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the people's different sentiments concerning 
 Christ, on occasion of the foregoing discourse; there was a division, a 
 <I>schism,</I> among them; they differed in their opinions, which threw 
 them into heats and parties. Such a ferment as this they had been in 
 before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:43,9:16"><I>ch.</I> vii. 43; ix. 16</A>);

 and where there has once been a division again. Rents are sooner made
 than made up or mended. This division was occasioned by the sayings of
 Christ, which, one would think, should rather have united them all in
 him as their centre; but they set them at variance, as Christ foresaw,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:51">Luke xii. 51</A>.

 But it is better that men should be <I>divided</I> about the doctrine
 of Christ than <I>united</I> in the service of sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:21">Luke xi. 21</A>.

 See what the debate was in particular.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Some upon this occasion spoke ill of Christ and of his sayings, 
 either openly in the face of the assembly, for his enemies were very 
 impudent, or privately among themselves. They said, <I>He has a devil, 
 and is mad, why do you hear him?</I> 

 1. They reproach him as a demoniac. The worst of characters is put upon
 the best of men. He is a distracted man, he raves and is delirious, and 
 no more to be heard than the rambles of a man in bedlam. Thus still, if 
 a man preaches seriously and pressingly of another world, he shall be 
 said to talk like an enthusiast; and his conduct shall be imputed to 
 fancy, a heated brain, and a crazed imagination. 

 2. They ridicule his hearers: "<I>Why hear you him?</I> Why do you so
 far encourage him as to take notice of what he says?" Note, Satan ruins 
 many by putting them out of conceit with the word and ordinances, and 
 representing it as a weak and silly thing to attend upon them. Men 
 would not thus be laughed out of their necessary food, and yet suffer 
 themselves to be laughed out of what is more necessary. Those that hear 
 Christ, and mix faith with what they hear, will soon be able to give a 
 good account <I>why they hear him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Others stood up in defence of him and his discourse, and, though 
 the stream ran strong, dared to swim against it; and, though perhaps 
 they did not believe on him as the Messiah, they could not bear to hear 
 him thus abused. If they could say no more of him, this they would 
 maintain, that he was a man in his wits, that he had not a devil, that 
 he was neither senseless nor graceless. The absurd and most 
 unreasonable reproaches, that have sometimes been cast upon Christ and 
 his gospel, have excited those to appear for him and it who otherwise 
 had no great affection to either. Two things they plead:--

 1. The excellency of his doctrine: "<I>These are not the words of him
 that hath a devil;</I> they are not idle words; distracted men are not 
 used to talk at this rate. These are not the words of one that is 
 either violently possessed with a devil or voluntarily in league with 
 the devil." Christianity, if it be not the true religion, is certainly 
 the greatest cheat that ever was put upon the world; and, if so, it 
 must be of the devil, who is the father of all lies: but it is certain 
 that the doctrine of Christ is no doctrine of devils, for it is 
 levelled directly against the devil's kingdom, and Satan is too subtle 
 to be divided against himself. So much of holiness there is in the 
 words of Christ that we may conclude they are <I>not the words of one 
 that has a devil,</I> and therefore are the words of one that was sent 
 of God; are not from hell, and therefore must be from heaven. 

 2. The power of his miracles: <I>Can a devil,</I> that is, a man that
 has a devil, <I>open the eyes of the blind?</I> Neither mad men nor bad 
 men can work miracles. Devils are not such lords of the power of nature 
 as to be able to work such miracles; nor are they such friends to 
 mankind as to be willing to work them if they were able. The devil will 
 sooner put out men's eyes than open them. Therefore Jesus <I>had not a 
 devil.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it
 was winter.
 &nbsp; 23  And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
 &nbsp; 24  Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How
 long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us
 plainly.
 &nbsp; 25  Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the
 works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.
 &nbsp; 26  But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I
 said unto you.
 &nbsp; 27  My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
 &nbsp; 28  And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never
 perish, neither shall any <I>man</I> pluck them out of my hand.
 &nbsp; 29  My Father, which gave <I>them</I> me, is greater than all; and no
 <I>man</I> is able to pluck <I>them</I> out of my Father's hand.
 &nbsp; 30  I and <I>my</I> Father are one.
 &nbsp; 31  Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
 &nbsp; 32  Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from
 my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
 &nbsp; 33  The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee
 not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man,
 makest thyself God.
 &nbsp; 34  Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said,
 Ye are gods?
 &nbsp; 35  If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and
 the scripture cannot be broken;
 &nbsp; 36  Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent
 into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of
 God?
 &nbsp; 37  If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
 &nbsp; 38  But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works:
 that ye may know, and believe, that the Father <I>is</I> in me, and I
 in him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here another rencounter between Christ and the Jews in the 
 temple, in which it is hard to say which is more strange, the gracious 
 words that came out of his mouth or the spiteful ones that came out of 
 theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We have here the time when this conference was: <I>It was at the 
 feast of dedication, and it was winter,</I> a feast that was annually 
 observed by consent, in remembrance of the dedication of a new altar 
 and the purging of the temple, by Judas Maccab&aelig;us, after the temple
 had been profaned and the altar defiled; we have the story of it at 
 large in the history of the Maccabees (lib. 1, cap. 4); we have the
 prophecy of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:13,14">Dan. viii. 13, 14</A>.
 
 See more of the feast, 
 
 <U>2 Mac. i. 18</U>.

 The return of their liberty was to them as life from the dead, and, in 
 remembrance of it, they kept an annual feast on the twenty-fifth day of 
 the month <I>Cisleu,</I> about the beginning of <I>December,</I> and 
 seven days after. The celebrating of it was not confined to Jerusalem, 
 as that of the divine feasts was, but every one observed it in his own 
 place, not as a <I>holy time</I> (it is only a divine institution that 
 can sanctify a day), but as a <I>good time,</I> as the days of Purim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:19">Esth. ix. 19</A>.

 Christ forecasted to be now at Jerusalem, not in honour of the feast,
 which did not require his attendance there, but that he might improve 
 those eight days of vacation for good purposes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The place where it was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch;</I> so called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:11">Acts iii. 11</A>),

 not because built by Solomon, but because built in the same place with 
 that which had borne his name in the first temple, and the name was 
 kept up for the greater reputation of it. Here Christ walked, to 
 observe the proceedings of the great sanhedrim that sat here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:1">Ps. lxxxii. 1</A>);

 <I>he walked,</I> ready to give audience to any that should apply to 
 him, and to offer them his services. He walked, as it should seem, for 
 some time <I>alone,</I> as one neglected; walked pensive, in the 
 foresight of the ruin of the temple. Those that have any thing to say 
 to Christ may find him in the temple and walk with him there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The conference itself, in which observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A weighty question put to him by the Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 They <I>came round about him,</I> to tease him; he was waiting for an 
 opportunity to do them a kindness, and they took the opportunity to do 
 him a mischief. Ill-will for good-will is no rare and uncommon return.
 He could not enjoy himself, no, not in the temple, his Father's house, 
 without disturbance. They came about him, as it were, to lay siege to 
 him: <I>encompassed him about like bees.</I> They came about him as if 
 they had a joint and unanimous desire to be satisfied; came as one man, 
 pretending an impartial and importunate enquiry after truth, but 
 intending a general assault upon our Lord Jesus; and they seemed to 
 speak the sense of their nation, as if they were the mouth of all the 
 Jews: <I>How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ 
 tell us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They quarrel with him, as if he had unfairly held them in suspense 
 hitherto. <B><I>Ten psychen hemon aireis</I></B>--<I>How long dost thou
 steal away our hearts?</I> Or, <I>take away our souls?</I> So some read 
 it; basely intimating that what share he had of the people's love and 
 respect he did not obtain fairly, but by indirect methods, as Absalom 
 stole the hearts of the men of Israel; and as seducers deceive the
 <I>hearts of the simple,</I> and so <I>draw away disciples after 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:18,Ac+20:30">Rom. xvi. 18; Acts xx. 30</A>.

 But most interpreters understand it as we do: "<I>How long dost thou 
 keep us in suspense?</I> How long are we kept debating whether thou be 
 the Christ or no, and not able to determine the question?" Now,

 [1.] It was the effect of their infidelity, and powerful prejudices,
 that after our Lord Jesus had so fully proved himself to be the Christ 
 they were still in doubt concerning it; this they willingly hesitated 
 about, when they might easily have been satisfied. The struggle was
 between their convictions, which told them he was Christ, and their 
 corruptions, which said, No, because he was not such a Christ as they 
 expected. Those who choose to be sceptics may, if they please, hold
 the balance so that the most cogent arguments may not weigh down the 
 most trifling objections, but scales may still hang even. 

 [2.] It was an instance of their impudence and presumption that they 
 laid the blame of their doubting upon Christ himself, as if he <I>made 
 them to</I> doubt by inconsistency with himself, whereas in truth they 
 made themselves doubt by indulging their prejudices. If Wisdom's 
 sayings appear doubtful, the fault is not in the object, but in the 
 eye; they are all <I>plain to him that understands.</I> Christ would 
 make us to believe; we make ourselves to <I>doubt.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They challenge him to give a direct and categorical answer whether 
 he was the Messiah or no: "<I>If thou be the Christ,</I> as many 
 believe thou art, <I>tell us plainly,</I> not by parables, as, <I>I am 
 the light of the world,</I> and <I>the good

 Shepherd,</I> and the like, but <I>totidem verbis--in so many words,</I>
 either that thou art the Christ, or, as John Baptist, that thou art 
 not," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:20"><I>ch.</I> i. 20</A>.

 Now this pressing query of theirs was <I>seemingly good;</I> they
 pretended to be desirous to know the truth, as if they were ready to 
 embrace it; but it was <I>really bad,</I> and put with an ill design; 
 for, if he should tell them plainly that he was the Christ, there 
 needed no more to make him obnoxious to the jealousy and severity of 
 the Roman government. Every one knew the Messiah was to be a king, and 
 therefore whoever pretended to be the Messiah would be prosecuted as a 
 traitor, which was the thing they would have been at; for, let him tell 
 them ever so plainly that he was the Christ, they would have this to 
 say presently, <I>Thou bearest witness of thyself,</I> as they had 
 said,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:13"><I>ch.</I> viii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Christ's answer to this question, in which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He justifies himself as not at all accessary to their infidelity 
 and skepticism, referring them, 

 [1.] To what he had said: <I>I have told you.</I> He had told them that 
 he was the Son of God, the Son of man, that he had life in himself, 
 that he had <I>authority to execute judgment,</I> &c. And is not this 
 the Christ then? These things he had told them, and they believed not; 
 why then should they be told them again, merely to gratify their 
 curiosity? <I>You believed not.</I> They pretended that they only 
 doubted, but Christ tells them that they did not believe. Skepticism in 
 religion is no better than downright infidelity. It is now for us to 
 teach God how he should teach us, nor prescribe to him how plainly he 
 should tell us his mind, but to be thankful for divine revelation as we 
 have it. If we do not believe this, neither should we be persuaded if 
 it were ever so much adapted to our humour. 

 [2.] He refers them to his works, to the example of his life, which was 
 not only perfectly pure, but highly beneficent, and of a piece with his 
 doctrine; and especially to his miracles, which he wrought for the 
 confirmation of his doctrine. It was certain that no man could do
 those miracles except God were with him, and God would not be with him 
 to attest a forgery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He condemns them for their obstinate unbelief, notwithstanding all 
 the most plain and powerful arguments used to convince them: "<I>You 
 believed not;</I> and again, <I>You believed not.</I> You still are 
 what you always were, obstinate in your unbelief." But the reason he 
 gives is very surprising: "<I>You believed not, because you are not of 
 my sheep:</I> you believe not in me, because you belong not to me." 
 
 [1.] "You are not disposed to be my followers, are not of a tractable 
 teachable temper, have no inclination to receive the doctrine and law 
 of the Messiah; you will not herd yourselves with my sheep, will not 
 come and see, come and hear my voice." Rooted antipathies to the gospel 
 of Christ are the bonds of iniquity and infidelity. 

 [2.] "You are not <I>designed</I> to be my followers; you are not of 
 those that were given me by my Father, to be brought to grace and 
 glory. You are not of the number of the elect; and your unbelief, if 
 you persist in it, will be a certain evidence that you are not." Note, 
 Those to whom God never gives the grace of faith were never designed 
 for heaven and happiness. What Solomon saith of immorality is true of
 infidelity, It is <I>a deep ditch, and he that is abhorred of the Lord 
 shall fall therein,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:14">Prov. xxii. 14</A>.

 <I>Non esse electum, non est causa incredulitatis propri&egrave; dicta, 
 sed causa per accidens. Fides autem est donum Dei et effectus 
 pr&aelig;destinationis--The not being included among the elect is not 
 the</I> proper <I>cause of infidelity, but merely the</I> accidental 
 <I>cause. But faith is the gift of God, and the effect of
 predestination.</I> So Jansenius distinguishes well here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He takes this occasion to describe both the gracious disposition 
 and the happy state of those that are his sheep; for such there are, 
 though <I>they</I> be not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] To convince them that they were not his sheep, he tells them what 
 were the characters of his sheep. <I>First,</I> They <I>hear his 
 voice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),
 
 for they know it to be his 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and he has undertaken that they shall hear it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 They discern it, <I>It is the voice of my beloved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:8">Cant. ii. 8</A>.

 They delight in it, are in their element when they are sitting at his
 feet to hear his word. They do according to it, and make his word their
 rule. Christ will not account those his sheep that are deaf to his
 calls, deaf to his charms, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:5">Ps. lviii. 5</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> They <I>follow him;</I> they submit to his guidance by 
 a willing obedience to all his commands, and a cheerful conformity to 
 his spirit and pattern. The word of command has always been, <I>Follow 
 me.</I> We must eye him as our leader and captain, and <I>tread in his 
 steps,</I> and walk as he walked--follow the prescriptions of his word, 
 the intimations of his providence, and the directions of his 
 Spirit--<I>follow the Lamb</I> (the <I>dux gregis--the leader of the 
 flock</I>) <I>whithersoever he goes.</I> In vain do we <I>hear his 
 voice</I> if we do not <I>follow him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] To convince them that it was their great unhappiness and misery 
 not to be of Christ's sheep, he here describes the blessed state and 
 case of those that are, which would likewise serve for the support and 
 comfort of his poor despised followers, and keep them from envying the 
 power and grandeur of those that were not of his sheep.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> Our Lord Jesus <I>takes cognizance</I> of his sheep: They 
 <I>hear my voice,</I> and <I>I know them.</I> He distinguishes them 
 from others 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:19">2 Tim. ii. 19</A>),
 
 has a particular regard to every individual
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:6">Ps. xxxiv. 6</A>);

 he knows their wants and desires, knows their souls in adversity, where 
 to find them, and what to do for them. He knows others afar off, but 
 knows them near at hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He has provided a happiness for them, suited to them: 
 <I>I give unto them eternal life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 1. The estate settled upon them is rich and valuable; it is life, 
 eternal life. Man has a living soul; therefore the happiness provided 
 is life, suited to his nature. Man has an immortal soul: therefore the
 happiness provided is eternal life, running parallel with his duration. 
 <I>Life eternal</I> is the felicity and chief good of a <I>soul 
 immortal.</I> 

 2. The manner of conveyance is <I>free: I give it</I> to them; it is
 not bargained and sold upon a valuable consideration, but given by the 
 free grace of Jesus Christ. The donor has power to give it. He who is 
 the fountain of life, and Father of eternity, has authorized Christ to 
 give eternal life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:2"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 2</A>.

 Not <I>I will</I> give it, but <I>I do</I> give it; it is a present
 gift. He gives the assurance of it, the pledge and earnest of it, the 
 first-fruits and foretastes of it, that <I>spiritual</I> life which is 
 <I>eternal</I> life begun, heaven in the seed, in the bud, in the 
 embryo.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> He has undertaken for their security and preservation 
 to this happiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> They shall be <I>saved from everlasting perdition. They shall 
 by no means perish for ever;</I> so the words are. As there is an 
 eternal life, so there is an eternal destruction; the soul not 
 <I>annihilated,</I> but <I>ruined;</I> its being continued, but its 
 comfort and happiness irrecoverably lost. All believers are saved from 
 this; whatever cross they may come under, they shall not <I>come into 
 condemnation.</I> A man is never undone till he is in hell, and they 
 shall not go down to that. Shepherds that have large flocks often lose
 some of the sheep and suffer them to perish; but Christ has engaged 
 that none of his sheep shall perish, not one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> They cannot be kept from their <I>everlasting happiness;</I> 
 it is in reserve, but he that gives it to them will preserve them to 
 it. 

 (<I>a.</I>) His own power is engaged for them: <I>Neither shall any man 
 pluck them out of my hand.</I> A mighty contest is here supposed about 
 these sheep. The Shepherd is so careful of their welfare that he has 
 them not only within his fold, and under his eye, but <I>in his 
 hand,</I> interested in his special love and taken under his special
 protection (<I>all his saints are in thy hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:3">Deut. xxxiii. 3</A>);

 yet their enemies are so daring that they attempt to pluck them out of 
 his hand--<I>his</I> whose <I>own</I> they are, whose <I>care</I> they 
 are; but they cannot, they shall not, do it. Note, Those are safe who 
 are in the hands of the Lord Jesus. The saints are <I>preserved in 
 Christ Jesus:</I> and their salvation is not in their own keeping, but 
 in the keeping of a Mediator. The Pharisees and rulers did all they 
 could to frighten the disciples of Christ from following him, reproving 
 and threatening them, but Christ saith that they shall not prevail.
 
 (<I>b.</I>) His Father's power is likewise engaged for their 
 preservation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 He now appeared in weakness, and, lest his security should therefore be 
 thought <I>insufficient,</I> he brings in his Father as a further 
 security. Observe,

 [<I>a.</I>] The power of the Father: <I>My Father is greater than 
 all;</I> greater than all the other <I>friends</I> of the church, all 
 the other shepherds, magistrates or ministers, and able to do that for 
 them which they cannot do. Those shepherds slumber and sleep, and it 
 will be easy to pluck the sheep out of their hands; but he keeps his 
 flock day and night. He is greater than all the enemies of the church, 
 all the opposition given to her interests, and able to secure his own 
 against all their insults; he is <I>greater than all</I> the combined 
 force of hell and earth. He is greater in wisdom than the <I>old 
 serpent,</I> though noted for subtlety; greater in strength than the 
 great red dragon, though his name be <I>legion,</I> and his title 
 <I>principalities and powers.</I> The devil and his angels have had 
 many a push, many a pluck for the mastery, but have never yet 
 prevailed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:7,8">Rev. xii. 7, 8</A>.
 
 <I>The Lord on high is mightier.</I>

 [<I>b.</I>] The interest of the Father in the sheep, for the sake of
 which this power is engaged for them: "It is my Father <I>that gave 
 them to me,</I> and he is concerned in honour to uphold his gift." They 
 were given to the Son as a trust to be managed by him, and therefore 
 God will still look after them. All the divine power is engaged for the 
 accomplishment of all the divine counsels. 

 [<I>c.</I>] The safety of the saints inferred from these two. If this 
 be so, then <I>none</I> (neither man nor devil) is <I>able to pluck 
 them out of the Father's hand,</I> not able to deprive them of the 
 grace they have, nor to hinder them from the glory that is designed 
 them; not able to put them out of God's protection, nor get them into 
 their own power. Christ had himself experienced the power of his Father 
 <I>upholding</I> and <I>strengthening</I> him, and therefore puts all 
 his followers into his hand too. He that secured the glory of the 
 Redeemer will secure the glory of the redeemed. Further to corroborate 
 the security, that the sheep of Christ may have strong consolation, he 
 asserts the union of these two undertakers: "<I>I and my Father are 
 one,</I> and have jointly and severally undertaken for the protection 
 of the saints and their perfection." This denotes more than the 
 harmony, and consent, and good understanding, that were between the 
 Father and the Son in the work of man's redemption. Every good man is 
 so far one with God as to concur with him; therefore it must be meant 
 of the <I>oneness of the nature</I> of Father and Son, that they are 
 the same in substance, and equal in power and glory. The fathers urged 
 this both against the Sabellians, to prove the distinction and 
 plurality of the persons, that the Father and the Son are two, and 
 against the Arians, to prove the unity of the nature, that these two 
 are <I>one.</I> If we should altogether hold our peace concerning this 
 sense of the words, even the stones which the Jews took up to cast at 
 him would speak it out, for the Jews understood him as hereby making 
 himself God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>)

 and he did not deny it. He proves that none could pluck them out <I>of 
 his hand</I> because they could not pluck them out <I>of the Father's 
 hand,</I> which had not been a conclusive argument if the Son had not 
 had the same almighty power with the Father, and consequently been one 
 with him in essence and operation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The rage, the outrage, of the Jews against him for this discourse: 
 <I>The Jews took up stones again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 It is not the word that is used before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:59"><I>ch.</I> viii. 59</A>),

 but <B><I>ebastasan lithous</I></B>--<I>they carried stones</I>--great
 stones, stones that were a <I>load,</I> such as they used in stoning 
 malefactors. They <I>brought</I> them from some place at a distance, as 
 it were preparing things for his execution without any judicial 
 process; as if he were convicted of blasphemy upon the notorious 
 evidence of the fact, which needed no further trial. The absurdity of 
 this insult which the Jews offered to Christ will appear if we 
 consider, 

 1. That they had <I>imperiously,</I> not to say <I>impudently,</I>
 challenged him to tell them plainly whether he was the Christ or no; 
 and yet now that he not only said <I>he</I> was the Christ, but proved 
 himself so, they condemned him as a malefactor. If the preachers of the 
 truth propose it <I>modestly,</I> they are branded as cowards; if 
 <I>boldly,</I> as insolent; but <I>Wisdom is justified of her 
 children.</I> 

 2. That when they had before made a similar attempt it was in vain; he
 <I>escaped through the midst of them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:59"><I>ch.</I> viii. 59</A>);

 yet they repeat their baffled attempt. Daring sinners will throw stones
 at heaven, though they return upon their own heads; and will strengthen 
 themselves against the Almighty, though none ever hardened themselves 
 against him and prospered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Christ's tender expostulation with them upon occasion of this 
 outrage 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>Jesus answered</I> what they <I>did,</I> for we do not find that 
 they <I>said any thing,</I> unless perhaps they stirred up the crown 
 that they had gathered about him to join with them, crying, <I>Stone 
 him, stone him,</I> as afterwards, <I>Crucify him, crucify him.</I> 
 When he could have answered them with fire from heaven, he mildly 
 replied, <I>Many good works have I shown you from my Father: for which 
 of those works do you stone me?</I> Words so very tender that one would 
 think they should have melted a heart of stone. In dealing with his
 enemies he still argued from his works (men evidence what they 
 <I>are</I> by what they <I>do</I>), his <I>good works</I>--<B><I>kala 
 erga</I></B> excellent, eminent works. <I>Opera eximia vel 
 pr&aelig;clara;</I> the expression signifies both <I>great works</I> 
 and <I>good works.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The divine power of his works convicted them of the most obstinate 
 infidelity. They were works <I>from his Father,</I> so far above the 
 reach and course of nature as to prove him who did them <I>sent of 
 God,</I> and acting by commission from him. These works he
 <I>showed</I> them; he did them openly before the people, and not in a 
 corner. His works would bear the test, and refer themselves to the 
 testimony of the most inquisitive and impartial spectators. He did not 
 show his works by candle-light, as those that are concerned only for 
 <I>show,</I> but he showed them at noon-day before the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:20"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 20</A>.

 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:6">Ps. cxi. 6</A>.

 His works so undeniably <I>demonstrated</I> that they were an
 incontestable <I>demonstration</I> of the validity of his 
 commission.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The divine grace of his works convicted them of the most base 
 ingratitude. The works he did among them were not only miracles, but 
 mercies; not only works of wonder to amaze them, but works of love and 
 kindness to do them good, and so make them good, and endear himself to 
 them. He healed the sick, cleansed the lepers, cast out devils, which 
 were favours, not only to the persons concerned, but to the public; 
 these he had repeated, and multiplied: "<I>Now for which of these do 
 you stone me?</I> You cannot say that I have done you any harm, or 
 given you any just provocation; if therefore you will pick a quarrel 
 with me, it must be for some good work, some good turn done you; tell 
 me for which." Note, 

 (1.) The horrid ingratitude that there is in our sins against God and 
 Jesus Christ is a great aggravation of them, and makes them appear 
 exceedingly sinful. See how God argues to this purpose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:6,Jer+2:5,Mic+6:3">Deut. xxxii. 6; 
 Jer. ii. 5; Mic. vi. 3</A>.

 (2.) We must not think it strange if we meet with those who not only
 hate us without cause, but are our adversaries for our love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:12,41:9">Ps. xxxv. 12; xli. 9</A>.

 When he asks, <I>For which of these do you stone me?</I> as he
 intimates the abundant satisfaction he had in his own innocency, which 
 gives a man courage in a suffering day, so he puts his persecutors upon 
 considering what was the true reason of their enmity, and asking, as 
 all those should do that create trouble to their neighbour, <I>Why 
 persecute we him?</I> As Job advises his friends to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:28">Job xix. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Their vindication of the attempt they made upon Christ, and the 
 cause upon which they grounded their prosecution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 What sin will want fig-leaves with which to cover itself, when even the 
 bloody persecutors of the Son of God could find something to say for 
 themselves?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They would not be thought such enemies to their country as to 
 persecute him for a good work: <I>For a good work we stone thee 
 not.</I> For indeed they would scarcely allow any of his works to be 
 so. His curing the impotent man 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:1-46"><I>ch.</I> v.</A>)
 
 and the blind man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:1-41"><I>ch.</I> ix.</A>)

 were so far from being acknowledged good services to the town, and
 meritorious, that they were put upon the score of his crimes, because 
 done on the sabbath day. But, if he had done any good works, they would 
 not own that they stoned him <I>for them,</I> though these were really 
 the things that did most exasperate them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:47"><I>ch.</I> xi. 47</A>.

 Thus, though most absurd, they could not be brought to own their
 absurdities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They would be thought such friends to God and his glory as to 
 prosecute him for blasphemy: <I>Because that thou, being a man, makest 
 thyself God.</I> Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A pretended zeal for the law. They seem mightily concerned for the 
 honour of the divine majesty, and to be seized with a religious horror 
 at that which they imagined to be a reproach to it. A blasphemer was to 
 be <I>stoned,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+24:16">Lev. xxiv. 16</A>.

 This law, they thought, did not only justify, but sanctify, what they 
 attempted, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:9">Acts xxvi. 9</A>.

 Note, The vilest practices are often varnished with plausible 
 pretences. As nothing is more <I>courageous</I> than a well-informed 
 conscience, so nothing is more <I>outrageous</I> than a mistaken one. 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5,Joh+16:2">Isa. lxvi. 5; <I>ch.</I> xvi. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) A real enmity to the gospel, on which they could not put a greater 
 affront than by representing Christ as a blasphemer. It is no new thing 
 for the worst of characters to be put upon the best of men, by those 
 that resolve to give them the worst of treatment. 

 [1.] The crime laid to his charge is <I>blasphemy,</I> speaking 
 reproachfully and despitefully of God. God himself is out of the 
 sinner's reach, and not capable of receiving any real injury; and 
 therefore enmity to God spits its venom at his name, and so shows its 
 ill-will. 

 [2.] The proof of the crime: <I>Thou, being a man, makest thyself 
 God.</I> As it is God's glory that <I>he is God,</I> which we rob him 
 of when we make him altogether such a one as ourselves, so it is his 
 glory that <I>besides him there is no other,</I> which we rob him of 
 when we make ourselves, or any creature, altogether like him. Now,
 <I>First,</I> Thus far they were in the right, that what Christ said of 
 himself amounted to this--that he was God, for he had said that he was 
 <I>one with the Father</I> and that he would <I>give eternal life;</I> 
 and Christ does not deny it, which he would have done if it had been a 
 mistaken inference from his words. But, <I>secondly,</I> They were much 
 mistaken when they looked upon him as a <I>mere man,</I> and that the 
 Godhead he claimed was a usurpation, and of his own making. They 
 thought it absurd and impious that such a one as he, who appeared in 
 the fashion of a poor, mean, despicable man, should profess himself the 
 Messiah, and entitle himself to the honours confessedly due to the Son 
 of God. Note, 

 1. Those who say that Jesus is a <I>mere man,</I> and only a <I>made
 God,</I> as the Socinians say, do in effect charge <I>him</I> with
 blasphemy, but do effectually prove it upon themselves.

 2. He who, being a man, a sinful man, makes himself a god as the Pope
 does, who claims divine powers and prerogatives, is unquestionably a 
 <I>blasphemer,</I> and <I>that</I> antichrist.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Christ's reply to their accusation of him (for such their 
 vindication of themselves was), and his making good those claims which 
 they imputed to him as blasphemous 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>,

 &c.), where he proves himself to be no blasphemer, by two
 arguments:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By an argument taken from <I>God's word.</I> He appeals to what was 
 <I>written in their law,</I> that is, in the Old Testament; whoever 
 opposes Christ, he is sure to have the scripture <I>on his side.</I> It 
 is written 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:6">Ps. lxxxii. 6</A>),

 <I>I have said, You are gods.</I> It is an argument <I>a minore ad 
 majus--from the less to the greater.</I> If they were gods, much more 
 am I. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How he explains the text 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>He called them gods to whom the word of God came, and the scripture 
 cannot be broken.</I> The word of God's commission came to them, 
 appointing them to their offices, as judges, and therefore they are 
 called <I>gods,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:28">Exod. xxii. 28</A>.

 To some the word of God came immediately, as to Moses; to others in the
 way of an instituted ordinance. Magistracy is a divine institution; and 
 magistrates are God's delegates, and therefore the scripture calleth 
 them gods; and we are sure that the scripture <I>cannot be broken,</I> 
 or broken in upon, or found fault with. Every word of God is 
 <I>right;</I> the very style and language of scripture are 
 unexceptionable, and not to be corrected,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:18">Matt. v. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How he applies it. Thus much in general is easily inferred, that 
 those were very rash and unreasonable who condemned Christ as a 
 blasphemer, only for calling himself the Son of God, when yet they 
 themselves called their rulers so, and therein the scripture warranted 
 them. But the argument goes further 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 If magistrates were called Gods, because they were commissioned to 
 administer justice in the nation, <I>say you of him whom the Father 
 hath sanctified, Thou blasphemest?</I> We have here two things 
 concerning the Lord Jesus:--

 [1.] The honour done him by the <I>Father,</I> which he justly glories 
 in: He <I>sanctified him,</I> and <I>sent him into the world.</I> 
 Magistrates were called <I>the sons of God,</I> though the word of God 
 only came to them, and the spirit of government came upon them by 
 measure, as upon Saul; but our Lord Jesus was himself the <I>Word,</I> 
 and had the <I>Spirit without measure.</I> They were constituted for a 
 particular country, city, or nation; but he was sent <I>into the 
 world,</I> vested with a universal authority, as Lord of all. They were 
 <I>sent to,</I> as persons at a distance; he was <I>sent forth,</I> as 
 having been from eternity with God. The Father <I>sanctified him,</I> 
 that is, designed him and set him apart to the office of Mediator, and 
 qualified and fitted him for that office. <I>Sanctifying</I> him is
 the same with <I>sealing</I> him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:27"><I>ch.</I> vi. 27</A>.

 Note, Whom the Father sends he sanctifies; whom he designs for holy
 purposes he prepares with holy principles and dispositions. The holy
 God will reward, and therefore will employ, none but such as he finds
 or makes holy. The Father's sanctifying and sending him is here vouched
 as a sufficient warrant for his calling himself the <I>Son of God;</I>
 for because he was a <I>holy thing</I> he was <I>called the Son of
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:35">Luke i. 35</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:4">Rom. i. 4</A>.

 [2.] The dishonour done him by the Jews, which he justly complains
 of--that they impiously said of him, whom the Father had thus 
 dignified, that he was a <I>blasphemer,</I> because he called himself 
 the <I>Son of God: "Say you of him</I> so and so? Dare you say so? Dare 
 you thus set your mouths against the heavens? Have you brow and brass
 enough to tell the God of truth that he lies, or <I>to condemn him that 
 is most just?</I> Look me in the face, and say it if you can. What! say 
 you of the Son of God that <I>he is a blasphemer?</I>" If devils, whom 
 he came to condemn, had said so of him, it had not been so strange; but 
 that <I>men,</I> whom he came to teach and save, should say so of him, 
 <I>be astonished, O heavens! at this.</I> See what is the language of 
 an obstinate unbelief; it does, in effect, call the holy Jesus a 
 blasphemer. It is hard to say which is more to be wondered at, that men 
 who breathe in God's air should yet speak such things, or that men who 
 have spoken such things should still be suffered to breathe in God's 
 air. The wickedness of man, and the patience of God, as it were, 
 contend which shall be most <I>wonderful.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By an argument taken from <I>his own works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>.

 In the former he only answered the charge of blasphemy by an argument 
 <I>ad hominem--turning a man's own argument against himself;</I> but he 
 here makes out his own claims, and proves that he and the Father are 
 one

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>):

 <I>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</I> Though he 
 might justly have abandoned such blasphemous wretches as incurable, yet 
 he vouchsafes to reason with them. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>From what</I> he argues--from his works, which he had often
 vouched as his credentials, and the proofs of his mission. As he proved 
 himself sent of God by the <I>divinity</I> of his works, so we must 
 prove ourselves allied to Christ by the <I>Christianity</I> of ours. 
 
 [1.] The argument is very cogent; for the works he did were the 
 <I>works of his Father,</I> which the Father only could do, and which 
 could not be done in the ordinary course of nature, but only by the 
 sovereign over-ruling power of the God of nature. <I>Opera Deo 
 propria--works peculiar to God,</I> and <I>Opera Deo Digna--works worthy
 of God</I>--the works of a divine power. He that can dispense with the
 laws of nature, repeal, altar, and overrule them at his pleasure, by 
 his own power, is certainly the sovereign prince who first instituted 
 and enacted those laws. The miracles which the apostles wrought in his 
 name, by his power, and for the confirmation of his doctrine, 
 corroborated this argument, and continued the evidence of it when he 
 was gone. 

 [2.] It is proposed as fairly as can be desired, and put to a short 
 issue. <I>First, If I do not the works of my Father, believe me 
 not.</I> He does not demand a blind and implicit faith, nor an assent 
 to his divine mission further than he gave proof of it. He did not wind 
 himself into the affections of the people, nor wheedle them by sly 
 insinuations, nor impose upon their credulity by bold assertions, but 
 with the greatest fairness imaginable quitted all demands of their 
 faith, further than he produced warrants for these demands. Christ is 
 no hard master, who expects to reap in assents where he has not sown in 
 arguments. None shall perish for the disbelief of that which was not 
 proposed to them with sufficient motives of credibility, Infinite 
 Wisdom itself being judge. <I>Secondly,</I> "But if I do <I>the works 
 of my Father, if I work</I> undeniable miracles for the confirmation of 
 a holy doctrine, <I>though you believe not me,</I> though you are so 
 scrupulous as not to take my word, yet <I>believe the works:</I> 
 believe your own eyes, your own reason; the thing speaks itself plainly 
 enough." As the invisible things of the Creator are clearly seen by his 
 works of creation and common providence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:20">Rom. i. 20</A>),

 so the invisible things of the Redeemer were seen by his miracles, and 
 by all his works both of power and mercy; so that those who were not 
 convinced by these works were <I>without excuse.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) <I>For what</I> he argues--<I>that you may know and believe,</I>
 may believe it intelligently, and with an entire satisfaction, that 
 <I>the Father is in me and I in him;</I> which is the same with what he 
 had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>I and my Father are one.</I> The Father was so in the Son as that in 
 him <I>dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead,</I> and it was by a divine 
 power that he wrought his miracles; the Son was so in the Father as 
 that he was perfectly acquainted with the whole of his mind, not by 
 communication, but by consciousness, having lain in his bosom. This we 
 must <I>know;</I> not know and <I>explain</I> (for we cannot by 
 searching find it out to perfection), but know and <I>believe</I> it; 
 acknowledging and adoring the depth, when we cannot find the 
 bottom.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>39  Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out
 of their hand,
 &nbsp; 40  And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John
 at first baptized; and there he abode.
 &nbsp; 41  And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle:
 but all things that John spake of this man were true.
 &nbsp; 42  And many believed on him there.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the issue of the conference with the Jews. One would have 
 thought it would have convinced and melted them, but their hearts were 
 hardened. Here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How they attacked him by force. Therefore <I>they sought again to 
 take him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.
 
 Therefore, 

 1. Because he had fully answered their charge of blasphemy, and wiped 
 off that imputation, so that they could not for shame go on with their 
 attempts to stone him, therefore they contrived to seize him, and 
 prosecute him as an offender against the state. When they were 
 constrained to drop their attempt by a popular tumult, they would try 
 what they could do under colour of a legal process. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:13">Rev. xii. 13</A>.
 
 Or, 

 2. Because he persevered in the same testimony concerning himself, they 
 persisted in their malice against him. What he had said before he did 
 in effect say again, for the <I>faithful witness</I> never departs from 
 what he has once said; and therefore, having the same provocation, they 
 express the same resentment, and justify their attempt to stone him by 
 another attempt to take him. Such is the temper of a persecuting 
 spirit, and such its policy, <I>mal&egrave; facta mal&egrave; factis 
 tegere ne perpluant</I>--<I>to cover one set of bad deeds with another, 
 lest the former should fall through.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he avoided them by flight; not an inglorious retreat, in which 
 there was any thing of human infirmity, but a glorious retirement, in 
 which there was much of a divine power. He <I>escaped out of their 
 hands,</I> not by the interposal of any friend that helped him, but by 
 his own wisdom he <I>got clear</I> of them; he drew a veil over 
 himself, or cast a mist before their eyes, or tied the hands of those 
 whose hearts he did not turn. Note, No weapon formed against our Lord 
 Jesus shall prosper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4">Ps. ii. 4</A>.

 He <I>escaped,</I> not because he was afraid to suffer, but because
 <I>his hour was not come.</I> And he who knew how to <I>deliver 
 himself</I> no doubt knows how to <I>deliver the godly out of 
 temptation,</I> and to make <I>a way for them to escape.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How he disposed of himself in his retirement: He <I>went away 
 again beyond Jordan,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 The bishop of our souls came not to be fixed in one see, but to go 
 about from place to place, doing good. This great benefactor was never 
 out of his way, for wherever he came there was work to be done. Though 
 Jerusalem was the royal city, yet he made many a kind visit to the 
 country, not only to his own country Galilee, but to other parts, even 
 those that lay most remote beyond Jordan. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What <I>shelter</I> he found there. He went into a private part of 
 the country, and <I>there he abode;</I> there he found some rest and 
 quietness, when in Jerusalem he could find none. Note, Though 
 persecutors may drive Christ and his gospel out of their own city or 
 country, they cannot drive him or it out of the world. Though Jerusalem 
 was not gathered, nor would be, yet Christ was glorious, and would be. 
 Christ's going now beyond Jordan was a figure of the taking of the 
 kingdom of God from the Jews, and bringing it to the Gentiles. Christ 
 and his gospel have often found better entertainment among the plain 
 country-people than among <I>the wise, the mighty, the noble,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:26,27">1 Cor. i. 26, 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What <I>success</I> he found there. He did not go thither merely for 
 his own security, but to do good there; and he chose to go thither, 
 where John at first baptized 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:28"><I>ch.</I> i. 28</A>),

 because there could not but remain some impressions of John's ministry
 and baptism thereabouts, which would dispose them to receive Christ and 
 his doctrine; for it was not three years since John was baptizing, and 
 Christ was himself baptized here at Bethabara. Christ came hither now 
 to see what fruit there was of all the pains John Baptist had taken 
 among them, and what they retained of the things they then heard and 
 received. The event in some measure answered expectation; for we are 
 told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That they flocked after him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 <I>Many resorted to him.</I> The return of the means of grace to a 
 place, after they have been for some time intermitted, commonly 
 occasions a great stirring of affections. Some think Christ chose to 
 <I>abide</I> at <I>Bethabara,</I> the <I>house of passage,</I> where 
 the ferry-boats lay by which they crossed the river Jordan, that the 
 confluence of people thither might give an opportunity of teaching many 
 who would come to hear him when it <I>lay in their way,</I> but who 
 would scarcely go a step out of the road for an opportunity of 
 attending on his word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That they reasoned in his favour, and sought arguments to induce 
 them to close with him as much as those at Jerusalem sought objections 
 against him. They said very judiciously, <I>John did no miracle, but 
 all things that John spoke of this man were true.</I> Two things they 
 considered, upon recollecting what they had seen and heard from John, 
 and comparing it with Christ's ministry. 

 [1.] That Christ far exceeded John Baptist's power, for <I>John did no 
 miracle,</I> but Jesus does many; whence it is easy to infer that Jesus 
 is greater than John. And, if John was so great a prophet, how great 
 then is this Jesus! Christ is best known and acknowledged by such a 
 comparison with others as sets him superlatively above others. Though 
 John came in the spirit and power of Elias, yet he did not work 
 miracles, as Elias did, lest the minds of people should be made to 
 hesitate between him and Jesus; therefore the honour of working 
 miracles was reserved for Jesus as a flower of his crown, that there 
 might be a sensible demonstration, and <I>undeniable</I> one, that 
 though he came after John, yet he was <I>preferred far before him.</I> 
 
 [2.] That Christ exactly answered John Baptist's testimony. John not 
 only <I>did no miracle</I> to <I>divert</I> people from Christ, but he 
 said a great deal to direct them to Christ, and to turn them over as 
 apprentices to him, and this came to their minds <I>now:</I> all things 
 that <I>John said of this man were true,</I> that he should be the 
 <I>Lamb of God,</I> should <I>baptize with Holy Ghost and with 
 fire.</I> Great things John had said of him, which raised their 
 expectations; so that though they had not zeal enough to carry them 
 into his country to enquire after him, yet, when he came into theirs, 
 and brought his gospel to their doors, they acknowledged him as great 
 as John had said he would be. When we get acquainted with Christ, and 
 come to know him experimentally, we find all things that the scripture 
 saith of him to be true; nay, and that the reality exceeds the report,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:6,7">1 Kings x. 6, 7</A>.

 John Baptist was now dead and gone, and yet his hearers profited by 
 what they had heard formerly, and, by comparing what they heard then 
 with what they saw now, they gained a double advantage; for, 
 <I>First,</I> They were confirmed in their belief that <I>John was a 
 prophet,</I> who foretold such things, and spoke of the eminency to 
 which this Jesus would arrive, though his beginning was so small. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> They were prepared to believe that <I>Jesus was the 
 Christ,</I> in whom they saw those things accomplished which John 
 foretold. By this we see that the success and efficacy of the word 
 preached are not confined to the life of the preacher, nor do they 
 expire with his breath, but that which seemed as <I>water spilt upon 
 the ground</I> may afterwards be <I>gathered up again.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:5,6">Zech. i. 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That many believed on him there. Believing that he who wrought 
 such miracles, and in whom John's predictions were fulfilled, was what 
 he declared himself to be, the Son of God, they gave up themselves to 
 him as his disciples, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.
 
 An emphasis is here to be laid,

 [1.] Upon the persons that believed on him; they were <I>many.</I> 
 While those that received and embraced his doctrine at Jerusalem were 
 but as the grape-gleanings of the vintage, those that believed on him 
 in the country, beyond the Jordan, were a full harvest gathered in to 
 him.

 [2.] Upon the place where this was; it was where John had been 
 preaching and baptizing and had had great success; <I>there</I> many 
 believed on the Lord Jesus. Where the preaching of the doctrine of 
 repentance has had success, as desired, there the preaching of the 
 doctrine of reconciliation and gospel grace is most likely to be 
 prosperous. Where John has been acceptable, Jesus will not be 
 unacceptable. The jubilee-trumpet sounds sweetest in the ears of those 
 who in the day of atonement have afflicted their souls for sin.</P>
